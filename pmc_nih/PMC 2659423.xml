                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Under the direction and sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute, we report on the first pre-clinical trial of the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC). The COTC is a novel infrastructure to integrate cancers that naturally develop in pet dogs into the development path of new human drugs. Trials are designed to address questions challenging in conventional preclinical models and early phase human trials. Large animal spontaneous cancer models can be a valuable addition to successful studies of cancer biology and novel therapeutic drug, imaging and device development.</p>

                  <title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title>
                  <p>Through this established infrastructure, the first trial of the COTC (COTC001) evaluated a targeted AAV-phage vector delivering tumor necrosis factor (RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>) to Î±V integrins on tumor endothelium. Trial progress and data was reviewed contemporaneously using a web-enabled electronic reporting system developed for the consortium. Dose-escalation in cohorts of 3 dogs (nâ=â24) determined an optimal safe dose (5Ã10<sup>12</sup> transducing units intravenous) of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>. This demonstrated selective targeting of tumor-associated vasculature and sparing of normal tissues assessed via serial biopsy of both tumor and normal tissue. Repetitive dosing in a cohort of 14 dogs, at the defined optimal dose, was well tolerated and led to objective tumor regression in two dogs (14%), stable disease in six (43%), and disease progression in six (43%) via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The current cancer drug development path involves a linear development plan that includes assessment of efficacy in small animals and safety assessments in non-tumor bearing large animals that lead to first-in-man clinical trials. For many reasons this preclinical development process has been criticized for its inability to identify drugs that are most likely to succeed in the human clinic. For example the use of one species (i.e. rodents) to define efficacy and a second species to define safety (i.e. the dog) precludes assessment of therapeutic index until an agent actually enters early phase human studies. The biological complexity and heterogeneity of cancer is not adequately represented by the numbers of rodent tumor models commonly used in preclinical efficacy screening <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Complex relationships between drug exposure and necessary biological changes in tumor tissue or circulating space are not easily modeled in murine cancers. As a result, many questions are left unanswered before early phase human studies. Similar if not more pressing questions persist following early phase human trials that may significantly limit the optimal design of later phase human studies.</p>
              <p>Spontaneous cancers in companion (pet) dogs offer a unique, and largely unexploited translational research opportunity for cancer imaging, device and drug development <xref rid="pone.0004972-Paoloni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Khanna1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This field of study, known as comparative oncology, has a long history of advancing surgical techniques, such as limb sparing for pediatric sarcoma patients, elucidating hyperthermia and radiobiology, and evaluating novel anti-cancer agents and delivery mechanisms, including inhalation cytokine and chemotherapy strategies <xref rid="pone.0004972-Khanna2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Larue1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Thrall1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Vujaskovic1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Withrow1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Withrow2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The features and use of cancers in pet dogs that may contribute to our understanding of cancer pathogenesis, progression and therapy have also been recently reviewed <xref rid="pone.0004972-Paoloni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The opportunity to assess drug exposures, toxicity and efficacy (therapeutic index) in a single large animal model is highly informative. These cancers more accurately recapitulate the heterogeneity and complexity of human malignancies and as a result are linked to the problems of recurrence, resistance and metastasis. The size of the dog and tumors in these dogs make assessment of correlative endpoints such as pharmacodynamic changes in a tumor or secondary tissue quite feasible. Accordingly, these models are well suited to be integrated with existing model approaches and optimize the drug development path.</p>
              <p>In order to take advantage of the model opportunities provided by pet dogs that have naturally developed cancer, the National Cancer Institute's Center for Cancer Research-Comparative Oncology Program (CCR-COP) has recently developed an infrastructure that is capable of multi-center nation-wide trials in tumor-bearing dogs using cancer drugs that are under development for human patients. Referred to as the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC), this infrastructure includes 18 state-of-the-art academic veterinary oncology centers. COTC trials are centrally managed and designed to include multiple endpoints that define safety, biological and clinical activity of novel treatment agents.</p>
              <p>The first completed trial of the COTC is an example of a pharmacodynamically focused study conducted to directly inform next step decisions in the clinical development of an adeno-associated virus phage <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> delivery of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>) to Î±V integrins to tumor and tumor-associated vascular endothelium. The development of anti-angiogenic and vascular-targeted agents has been complex and with incommensurate results from studies in tumor-bearing mice and human cancer patients <xref rid="pone.0004972-vanKempen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Zakarija1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is reasonable that that some of the attributes of the comparative oncology approach may be particularly informative in the evaluation of both anti-angiogenic agents and novel gene delivery methods <xref rid="pone.0004972-Siddiqui1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Accordingly, the first trial of the COTC has evaluated this ligand-direct targeting gene delivery system <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Thamm1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Fosmire1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Arce1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Through a step-wise trial design we demonstrated the safety, tumor-selective trafficking, and anti-tumor activity of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> to tumor blood vessels and targeted expression of TNFÎ± in a relevant clinical setting. These results provide a strong pre-clinical basis for first-in-man studies in human cancer patients. In a larger context, this report of the first clinical trial from the COTC, suggests that the existing population of dogs with spontaneous tumors and this advanced clinical trial infrastructure can serve as an efficient intermediate step in the translation of new cancer treatments from pre-clinical models to man.</p>

                    <p>(A) This study was structured as a dose-escalation using a modified Fibonacci design to govern dose escalation towards an MTD. (B) Three dogs were enrolled in the starting-dose cohort, and three dogs per cohort were enrolled there after for each of the five dose levels planned. Dogs were scheduled to receive RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> on day zero and to undergo definitive tumor resection 4 days later. This initial 4-day group was designed (i) to evaluate vector localization and TNFÎ± expression within tumors and (ii) to verify that the tentative follow-up schedule of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> administration at one-week dosing intervals was biologically appropriate. After a group of dogs (nâ=â18) were treated according to this schedule, an additional group was enrolled by equivalent inclusion criteria to receive RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> on the same day of definitive surgical resection. In this subset of dogs (nâ=â6), surgery was performed 4â6 hours post administration of RGD-A-<italic>TNF,</italic> this same-day experimental subset was designed to establish the acute selectivity of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> trafficking and its tumor vascular localization.</p>

                <p>All data were reported by contemporaneous electronic reporting such that adverse events were uniformly monitored and managed within this multi-center COTC trial design. Single-doses of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> were for the most part well tolerated in all dose-escalation cohorts planned for this phase of the study. The only significant adverse event observed occurred during the intravenous infusion of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in the highest dose cohort (10<sup>13</sup> TU), where a single dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was noted (Dog #1.18; Grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction); this event (nausea, tachycardia, and hypotension) was transient and resolved with minimal supportive care. Three additional dogs were entered into this dose cohort with no further toxicity observed. No maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was reached since the highest dose failed to result in any dose limiting toxicities. There were no clinically significant neurological, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, or hematologic toxicities related to the treatment of the dogs entered in this phase of the study. Moreover, there were no delays in wound healing (surgical incision) detected, or febrile episodes associated with single-doses of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> These data suggest that RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was safe following intravenous administration of a single dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> up to 10<sup>13</sup> TU. Since no MTD was achieved, it is possible that higher single doses of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> may also be safely administered.</p>

                <title>Trafficking to tumor vascular endothelium and targeted TNFÎ± delivery</title>
                <p>To determine if RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> trafficked to tumor versus normal tissues, we analyzed pre-treatment and post-treatment (after 4â6 hours and after 4 days) biopsies of tumor and normal tissues (i.e., oral mucosa, skin, and muscle) following a single dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> by dual-color immunofluorescence (IF) staining for phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). The staining pattern of all biopsy samples were scored as positive or negative as described (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Clear co-localization of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> particles were seen only within tumor vascular endothelium in tumor biopsies, but not in the blood vessels of normal tissues, as early as 4 to 6 hours post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and at 4 days post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The specificity of the IF assay was supported by the lack of staining seen in the pre-treatment biopsies in any dogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Secondarily, there was no tumor cell RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> staining evident, only tumor vascular endothelium staining. We observed heterogeneous RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> staining patterns in different sections from the same tumor biopsy and in different biopsies within the same tumors. This reflects the heterogeneity of tumor vasculature biology in spontaneous cancer that led to differential uptake of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in tumor tissues. Consistent trafficking of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> to tumor blood vessels was observed in the two cohorts receiving the highest doses; specifically, two out of three dogs (67%) in the cohort that received 5Ã10<sup>12</sup> TU and five out of six dogs (83%) in the cohort that received 1Ã10<sup>13</sup> TU. There was no apparent association between tumor histology and tumor vascular targeting.</p>

                    <p>(A, B) RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> selectively targeted tumor-associated vasculature (arrows) and was absent from normal tissues at 4â6 hours (A) and at 4 days (B). Magnification, 400-fold; scale bar, 100 ÂµM. Pre-treatment tumor biopsies, post-treatment tumor biopsies, and post-treatment normal tissues in dogs that received a single-dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> double-stained with an anti-CD31 specific antibody plus an anti-bacteriophage specific antibody. Detection was performed with Alexa Fluor 488 (green, blood vessels), Alexa Fluor 594 (red, AAVP), and DAPI (blue, cell nuclei). (C) Pre-treatment tumor biopsies (day 0), post-treatment normal biopsies (day 4) and post-treatment tumor biopsies (day 4) were used for extraction of total RNA. RT-PCR was performed to measure transcript levels of human TNFÎ± in quadruplicate. The Y-axis represents the relative TNFÎ± expression levels in post-treatment normal biopsies and post-treatment tumor biopsies compared to pre-treatment tumor biopsies after normalization to GAPDH expression (Kruskal-Wallis Test, pâ=â0.0107). All data are presented as meansÂ±standard deviations. (DâF) Presence of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was evaluated in post-treatment (day 28) necropsy samples of tumor (D) and normal tissues (E, F). Tissues were stained for RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> as described earlier. RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> selectively targeted tumor-associated vasculature in post-treatment tumor samples (arrows). In contrast, the vector was not apparent in pre-treatment tumor samples or in post-treatment normal control necropsy samples (such as lung, liver, spleen or intestine) after serial administrations of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>.</p>

                <p>After establishing that RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> preferentially localizes within tumor vascular endothelium after systemic administration, we next evaluated whether vector localization would result in targeted TNFÎ± gene expression. Three out of the four dogs tested for hTNFÎ± gene expression showed significantly increased levels of hTNFÎ± in post-treatment tumor biopsies (day 4) compared to pre-treatment tumor biopsies (Kruskal-Wallis test pâ=â0.0107) after a single dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).

At enrollment in the multi-dose phase of the study, pathological tumor types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>) included soft tissue sarcomas (nâ=â8), malignant melanomas (nâ=â5), osteosarcoma (nâ=â1), multilobular osteochondrosarcoma (nâ=â1), hemangiosarcoma (nâ=â1), lymphoma (nâ=â1), and squamous cell carcinoma (nâ=â1). All tumors were located at peripheral sites that were accessible to biopsy; however, concurrent metastatic disease existed in two dogs. Age (range, 6â14.8 years; median 10.2 years), weight (range, 11â55 kg; median 33.3 kg) and breed (7 mixed-breed and 11 purebred) of the dogs that entered this trial phase were recorded (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Dogs received weekly doses (5Ã10<sup>12</sup> TU intravenously) of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>. Anticancer activity of this agent was evaluated using RECIST criteria. The treatment received population included dogs that received at least four weekly doses (i.e., one cycle 1). This population consisted of 14 dogs. Dogs were permitted to receive additional therapy in subsequent cycles if there was evidence of either stable disease or tumor response. Tumor measurements were recorded every two weeks with full restaging every 28 days.</p>

                <p>Serial, multiple fixed doses (total, 78.25 doses; mean 4.34 doses/dog; range, 1â8 doses/dog) were administered. Fourteen dogs in this cohort (78%) completed at least one full cycle (defined as four weekly doses) of treatment and were included in the treatment-received population for assessment of tumor response. Death due to disease progression (nâ=â2) or study withdrawal by owner request (nâ=â2) was the most common reason for dogs to fail completion of treatment cycle 1. Three of 14 dogs (21%) completed a second full cycle (i.e., eight weekly doses) of treatment.</p>
                <p>Similar to the dose-escalation phase of the study, all data was electronically reported within the format of this COTC multi-center trial design. Furthermore, the same clinical evaluation, imaging, and laboratory studies were obtained before and after the administration of each weekly dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF.</italic> In dogs that received repetitive weekly doses, the most common toxicity (nâ=â9) was a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction during intravenous administration; six dogs out of 14 (42%) had more than one clinical episode (i.e., vomiting, hypotension, and tachycardia) that was not prevented by pre-medication (famotidine, diphenhydramine and dexamethasone). However, all of these adverse events were transient and resolved following temporary pause (&lt;30 min) of administration and minimal supportive care, after which a slower intravenous infusion rate (100 ml/hour) was resumed without further complications. There were no apparent long-term clinical sequelae to these events. Grade 3 or 4 non-neutropenic fever was noted in five dogs (36%) in the study (three noted during the infusion and two on non-administration days). All fever episodes resolved with symptomatic care. One case (Dog #2.2) presented with grade 3 necrosis (open wound and drainage at the tumor site) on treatment day 19; this same dog had an 18% reduction in tumor size at that time (defined by RECIST as stable disease). There were three other events with unknown attribution, including a grade 2 skin reaction associated with demodectic mange (Demodex <italic>canis</italic>), a grade 1 ventricular arrhythmia, and a first-event-death of unknown cause two days after the fifth dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>. In the first-event-death case, no adverse events were noted (Dog #2.14) during the week prior to this event. First-event-death in dogs with advanced cancer (not unlike early phase human trials) is not uncommon and may be associated with disease progression, particularly when observed as isolated events. No other significant adverse events including clinical or laboratory reports of neurological, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, or hematologic toxicity related to serial treatment with RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> were seen. Three dogs out of 14 (21%) were euthanized due to progressive disease and underwent rapid (warm) necropsy; pathologic evaluation of visceral organs (brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and lymph nodes) did not detect any treatment related histologic abnormalities in these organs; data supporting the relative safety and tumor-targeting of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>. In select warm necropsy cases (nâ=â2), two-color IF was performed and tumor-specific trafficking of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>); no RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was detected in examined normal tissues (lung, liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g002">Fig. 2E, F</xref>).</p>

                <p>In the treatment-received population of 14 dogs, we used serial tumor measurements to determine the activity of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>). Again, the four dogs that failed to complete one cycle (4 weeks) of therapy were excluded for evaluation of response. Evaluable dogs included those with tumors not amenable to surgical excision, tumors for which prior therapy had failed, and tumors in which standard-of-care therapy was declined. Two animals (Dogs #2.11 and #2.16) had a RECIST-defined partial response (PR) (14%; 95% confidence interval 2â43%) one at day 28 and the other at day 56 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>). Six dogs had stable disease (SD) (43%; 95% confidence interval 18â71%) including a dog with an 18% reduction in tumor size, and six dogs had disease progression (PD) (43%; 95% confidence interval 18â71%) after one cycle of therapy. After two cycles of therapy, two of the dogs with previously defined stable disease at Day 28 progressed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>). The case of a marked clinical PR is depicted to illustrate the magnitude of the serial therapeutic effect of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in a dog presenting with a large soft tissue sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

Following this response a &lt;2 cm residual lesion was resected resulting in a pathological review revealing no viable tumor.

                    <p>A large primary soft tissue sarcoma on the flank of Dog #2.11 is shown to feature the potential magnitude of the tumor response. Prior to therapy (day 0), the tumor measured 12.3 cm in longest diameter. At day 28, after 4 weekly infusions of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>, the tumor measured 8.2 cm in longest diameter (a 33% regression) and a RECIST-based partial response (PR). At day 56, after a total of 8 weekly systemic infusions of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>, the tumor measured 1.85 cm in longest diameter prior to resection. Therefore, this response equated to an 85% regression from baseline and a continued clinical PR. Upon surgical resection of the residual lesion, no viable tumor was found and a pathological complete response was determined.</p>

              <p>The opportunity to integrate cancers that naturally develop in pet dogs within the development path of a novel human cancer drug is further realized through the inaugural study of the COTC. In this report, we describe a targeted delivery of TNFÎ± with an AAVP gene delivery system to tumor blood vessels of pet dogs with spontaneous cancer. Selective AAVP homing, tumor-associated vascular expression of TNFÎ±, systemic safety, and RECIST-based objective responses were observed (same species therapeutic index). These large animal spontaneous cancer models are well suited to inform pre-clinical to clinical transitions necessary for successful drug development and compliment the use of both existing rodent models and human clinical trials.</p>
              <p>The COTC is an active network of academic comparative oncology centers, centrally managed by the NCI's Comparative Oncology Program. The COTC designs and implements clinical trials in dogs with cancer with the goal of providing necessary translational data for novel therapies, techniques or devices for future cancer patients. Trials are executed at COTC member institutions, which currently include eighteen veterinary teaching hospitals across the United States. As described above, trials conducted by the COTC may include several biological and clinical endpoints that can be directly integrated into the design of human Phase I and II clinical trials. Although not included in the study presented here, correlative imaging strategies, such as PET/CT or dynamic MRI, with the ability to link these imaging endpoints to tumor or circulating biological surrogates are feasible through the designed infrastructure. Such complex correlative studies may be vetted in a clinically relevant setting through COTC studies, and therein provide a model to evaluate all parts of this process including tissue collection standards and techniques, timing of imaging and biopsy, and assay methodologies prior to early phase human studies.</p>
              <p>In the current study, COTC001, we assessed the fluidity and structure of this novel preclinical infrastructure. In the process, we defined the safety and efficacy of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> targeting to tumor endothelium in pet dogs with spontaneous cancer. RGD targeted delivery to tumor Î±V integrins has been previously described <xref rid="pone.0004972-Ruoslahti1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Thumshirn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and this anticipated targeting was the basis of the RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> vector development <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou4" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In previously published work in mouse xenograft models, we described targeted systemic delivery of RGD-A<italic>VVP</italic> vectors expressing either HSVtk or TNF-Î±, to tumor vasculature <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Rajotte1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Arap1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Anti-tumor activity has been seen in Kaposi sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, prostate carcinoma and melanoma <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Although, activity of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> has been demonstrated in traditional small animal models, the comparative oncology approach provided unique information regarding the safety of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> that would not have been possible in conventional animal safety studies. Since neither tumor nor tumor vasculature are present in healthy animals (i.e. purpose-bred research dogs), a safety assessment in these animals would likely under-report adverse events related to RGD-A-<italic>TNF.</italic> Drug-related events reported in our population of tumor-bearing pet dogs were indeed generally mild and self-limiting. In fact, a MTD was not achieved in the single dose cohorts evaluated in the dose-escalation as increasing the dose of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was limited by manufacture process. Most adverse events that were documented were seen either during the administration or within 2 hours of administration in dogs that had received multiple doses of RGD-A-<italic>TNF.</italic> Administration-related events included hypersensitivity-like reactions and fever. Given the per-acute nature of these events, it is plausible that such they were related either to undetectable remnant endotoxin in the treatment product or to a specific response to the vector itself. Testing of all production lots of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> failed to reveal residual endotoxin; however, one cannot entirely exclude this or other contaminants as a cause of some of the adverse events.</p>
              <p>Serial tumor and control tissue biopsies taken before and after the administration of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> provided an opportunity to correlate drug exposure with tumor and normal tissue trafficking of RGD-A-<italic>TNF.</italic> These experiments validated the tumor-specific targeting of the RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in the setting of dogs with spontaneous cancers. We observed vector localization in tumor vascular endothelium in post-treatment tumor biopsies taken 4â6 hours and 4 days after systemic administration of RGD-A-<italic>TNF.</italic> Notably, there was a complete absence of the vector in normal tissue biopsies in all treated dogs. Thus, RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> exploits aberrant disease-related vasculature to target the therapy of interest specifically to the tumor. Thus confirming the safety of this delivery system first observed in our small animal models <xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consistent with this, warm necropsies from dogs euthanized due to disease progression showed that RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> targeted tumor vasculature but not blood vessels within normal visceral organs. Importantly, we did not observe RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in any of the control tissues analyzed, including liver whereas the presence of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> has been previously seen in the liver and spleen of rodents treated with RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. These large animal data are particularly valuable as the risks and benefits for AAVP delivery strategies in human cancer patients are considered. Effective targeting of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was seen at doses from 5Ã10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup> TU. A dose of 5Ã10<sup>12</sup> TU was selected as optimal dose for the multiple-dose study, due to equivalent trafficking, targeting, and safety as well as our inability to produce 1Ã10<sup>13</sup> TU in a timely manner. At this dose vector targeting also resulted in measurable expression of human TNFÎ±. Further support for the biological relevance of the observed trafficking of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> along with targeted expression of human TNFÎ±, was provided by the objective anti-tumor activity observed in dogs receiving multiple weekly treatments. RECIST-based responses were observed in two dogs with soft tissue sarcoma and metastatic melanoma; such objective tumor responses are particularly germane, because all dogs in this study had large bulky tumors and were not candidates for conventional loco-regional treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy. We speculate that the observed objective responses were the result of TNFÎ± transgene expression, as no activity was seen in our mouse models from either non-targeted AAVP or targeted-null vector <xref rid="pone.0004972-Tandle1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The proposed mechanism for this activity is the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis and hyperpermeability leading to hemorrhagic necrosis in treated tumors <xref rid="pone.0004972-tenHagen1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-tenHagen2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-vanHorssen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This biology will be further explored in planned canine studies using Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) quality RGD-A-<italic>TNF,</italic> via caspase-3 and CD31 staining. However, it is important to note that the future development strategy for this delivery system is not as a single agent. Instead it will likely involve combinational therapies, either dual transgene insertion or adjunct administration of complementary agents. Hence its single agent activity is note worthy.</p>
              <p>In summary, the biological complexity of naturally occurring cancers in pet dogs, their size and strong similarities to human cancers, and the availability of a motivated population of pet-owners interested in treatments for their pets with cancer provide an opportunity to now develop a comparative and integrated approach to cancer drug development. <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Paoloni1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Khanna1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The first study of the COTC (COTC001) provides an example of this integration and a functional infrastructure that may deliver trial outcomes in a timely manner. Specifically, COTC001 assessed the safety, selective tumor-specific localization, and anti-tumor activity of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> in dogs with measurable malignant cancers. This report supports a new paradigm for rapid intermediate evaluation of agents prior to or after early human trials as a means to creating a more informed and optimal cancer drug development pathway.</p>

                <p>Client-owned pet dogs with biopsy-proven malignant tumors (newly-diagnosed or recurrent disease) with favorable performance status (Grade 0 or 1 Modified ECOG Performance Status), and informed owner consent were eligible for enrollment. For the dose-escalation phase, entry criterion was an externally measurable tumor (&gt;2 cm in the longest diameter) that was amenable to surgical resection. For the multiple-dose trial phase entry criteria included measurable tumors of greater than 3 cm in the longest diameter. Physical examination, laboratory studies, and imaging studies were performed to evaluate eligibility prior to enrollment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g001">Figs 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004972-g003">3</xref>). Specifically, complete blood count, biochemical screening profile, urine analysis, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, and a baseline electrocardiogram were required. Exclusion criteria removed dogs weighing less than 15 kg, those with significant co-morbidities (such as renal, liver, and heart failure or coagulopathy) a diagnosis of mast cell cancer, or concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy. Tumor staging included thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound when clinically indicated. Dogs with metastatic disease were excluded from entry in the dose-escalation phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t001">Table 1</xref>) but were allowed in the multiple-dosing phase of the trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004972-t002">Table 2</xref>).

<xref rid="pone.0004972-Hwu1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> into the vector pAAV-eGFP/NotI/HindIII, with replacement of the <italic>GFP</italic> gene sequence.

RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> is a targeted vector with binding affinity to Î±V integrins.</p>
                <p>To obtain targeted AAVP particles, RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was electroporated into MC1061 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and virus particles purified from culture supernate as described <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004972-Hajitou3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Contaminating bacterial cells were removed by repeated centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> prepared from MC1061 <italic>E. coli</italic> was used to purify large-scale AAVP particles from a permissive host bacterial strain (k91Kan <italic>E. coli</italic>). After preparation of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic>, endotoxin was removed using MiraCLEAN endotoxin removal kits (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, Wisconsin) with pyrogen-free materials and under good laboratory practice (GLP) conditions in a sterile hood equipped with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. Briefly, 0.1 volumes of MiraCLEAN buffer were added to RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> preparation, followed by vortexing and incubation on ice for 15 min. After incubation, 0.03 volumes of the EndoGO extraction reagent were added and the solution was incubated on ice for 15 min with intermittent vortexing. Samples were incubated at 50Â°C for 15 min. Phases were then separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min, and the upper colorless aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. Every batch of RGD-A-<italic>TNF</italic> was underwent endotoxin removal (3 cycles). Next, AAVP was tested to determine endotoxin levels with Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) QCL-1000 kits (Cambrex, Walkersville, Maryland).

                <p>Following endotoxin removal, the final preparation was filtered through a sterile filter. To determine the number of bacterial transducing units (TU), the permissive host k91Kan <italic>E. coli</italic> was infected with serial dilutions of AAVP particles and plated on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing tetracycline and kanamycin.
