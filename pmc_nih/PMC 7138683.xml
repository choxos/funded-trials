                  <p>Forty-two adults at cardiovascular risk were included in a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding trial that provided a 2-wk standard Western diet (SWD) run-in and three 6-wk isocaloric study diets: a diet containing whole walnuts (WD; 57–99 g/d walnuts; 2.7% ALA), a fatty acid–matched diet devoid of walnuts (walnut fatty acid–matched diet; WFMD; 2.6% ALA), and a diet replacing ALA with oleic acid without walnuts (oleic acid replaces ALA diet; ORAD; 0.4% ALA). Fecal samples were collected following the run-in and study diets to assess gut microbiota with 16S rRNA sequencing and Qiime2 for amplicon sequence variant picking.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and poor diet quality is the primary etiological risk factor underlying the development of CVD (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota also plays an important role in cardiovascular risk (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–8</xref>). The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem of organisms that are critical for human health. The microbes present in the lower gastrointestinal tract are involved in extraction and metabolism of nutrients not fully digested in the small intestine. Diet largely affects the composition and functionality of bacteria present in the large intestine (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is evidence that the gut microbiota may be a mediator of the CVD benefits observed with walnut consumption. A study conducted by Baer et al. (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) demonstrated that the metabolizable energy from walnuts is overestimated by 21% by the predicted Atwater factors, suggesting that walnut-derived nutrients are accessible to the gut microbiota. Walnuts are uniquely rich in PUFAs, including α-linolenic acid (ALA), a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid that has cardiometabolic benefits (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, walnuts also contain bioactive compounds, such as hydrolyzable tannins, and fiber that can be metabolized by gut bacteria and may confer additional benefits beyond the fatty acid profile of walnuts (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Collectively, these walnut components may contribute to the cardiometabolic benefits of walnuts that have been demonstrated via different mechanisms of action.</p>
              <p>The present study is a secondary analysis of a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding trial that provided 3 study diets: a diet containing walnuts as an SFA replacement compared to 2 diets that replace SFA with a vegetable oil blend reflective of the fatty acid profile of walnuts and a vegetable oil blend 83% lower in ALA and proportionally higher in oleic acid (both without walnuts). This study examined between-diet differences in gut bacterial composition in individuals at risk for CVD. Exploratory analyses were also conducted to examine the relation between CVD risk factors and changes in bacterial abundance following each experimental diet. We hypothesized that following the diet containing walnuts, individuals would have a significantly different gut microbiota because of the bioactive content and whole food complex compared to the 2 other experimental diets and the baseline run-in diet, which was a standard Western diet (SWD).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Details of the study design and results of the CVD-related endpoints, including blood pressure (BP), vascular health, and lipids and lipoproteins, are reported elsewhere (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Data from secondary analyses, including analysis of fecal bacteria diversity, enrichment, predictive functional analysis, and taxonomic co-occurrence, are reported here. Briefly, a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study with a 2-wk run-in on a SWD followed by three 6-wk diet periods (with compliance breaks between diet periods) on a walnut diet (WD), a walnut fatty acid-matched diet (WFMD), or an oleic acid replaces α-linolenic acid diet (ORAD), was conducted at The Pennsylvania State University. The fully controlled, weight-maintenance dietary feeding intervention provided similar macronutrient profiles (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) in all 3 study diets (48% carbohydrate, 17% protein, 35% fat, 7% SFA). The run-in diet was designed to represent a SWD (50% carbohydrate, 17% protein, 33% fat, 12% SFA). The presence or absence of walnuts and the fatty acid profile of each of the diets differed: WD (contained 57–99 g/d walnuts; 2.7% ALA); WFMD (did not contain walnuts; 2.6% ALA); ORAD (did not contain walnuts; 0.4% ALA). Participants’ compliance was assessed with daily questionnaires for diet, medications, exercise, and general wellness. Participants were asked to refrain from medication use, including antibiotics, 48 h before sample collections. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02210767.</p>

Statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). The correlation procedure (PROC CORR) was used with the Spearman correlation coefficient to assess associations between the magnitudes of change for CVD risk factors that were significantly changed from baseline with bacteria that were significantly enriched at a predetermined α value of 0.05.</p>

All of the bacteria present in the sample were mapped against the magnitudes of change for significantly changed CVD risk factors for each study diet and mean values for the same CVD risk factors were mapped against the run-in diet bacteria. A multivariate linear model associating metadata with each bacterium independently was boosted, and any metadata selected in at least 1% of these iterations was finally tested for significance (α &lt;0.05) in a standard generalized linear model. Because this approach compared every bacteria present in the sample against each individual CVD risk factor, multiple comparisons were adjusted with a Bonferroni correction; multiple hypothesis tests over all bacteria and metadata were adjusted to produce a final Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (Q-value). Statistical analyses were performed in R with the glm package.</p>

                <p>16S rRNA gene PCR amplification of the V4 region was successful for all collected samples. High-quality sequence data were obtained for 144 out of 149 fecal samples. Overall, sequencing depth of DADA2 processed data ranged from 1955 to 95,549 sequences per sample. A total of 3,008,191 sequences were obtained after quality filtering, merging, and chimera checking. One-hundred and forty-four samples were able to be incorporated into community analyses and a cumulative sum scaling normalized ASV table, as sequencing depth exceeded 1000 sequences for each sample.</p>

              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of diets containing walnuts (and walnut-derived fiber) and vegetable oils compared to a diet with a greater % SFA (12% compared with 7%) on the human gut microbiota composition, predictive functional analysis, taxonomic co-occurrence, and associations with cardiovascular risk. Our findings, together with previous research on walnuts and the gut microbiota, assist in advancing our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in disease risk and prevention, and how diet affects this. Relative to the current study, we have shown that a diet containing whole walnuts (including bioactive compounds), a diet with a matched fatty acid profile to the walnut-containing diet (devoid of whole walnuts and walnut bioactive compounds), and a diet matched for SFA but with oleic acid in place of ALA found in walnuts (devoid of walnuts and walnut bioactive compounds) differentially affected the gut microbiota. Our results demonstrate unique enrichment of bacteria, including butyrate producers such as <italic>Roseburia</italic>, following the WD and WFMD relative to the SWD. The bioactive compounds in walnuts may also play an important role in altering the gut environment. Walnuts contain ellagitannins that are metabolized by gut bacteria to form urolithins, which may provide cardiovascular benefits (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> is a bacteria involved in ellagitannins metabolism, which was enriched following the WD relative to the WFMD. Further, this study showed possible microbiota-CVD interactions between enriched bacteria following the WD. Thus, consuming walnuts as a replacement for SFA elicits changes in gut bacteria that may have important health implications.</p>
              <p>The present controlled-feeding study showed differentially enriched bacteria among all 3 study diets relative to the SWD run-in diet, which suggests that replacing SFA with unsaturated fatty acids in the presence or absence of walnuts affects the gut microbial environment. Both the WFMD and WD led to significant enrichment in <italic>Roseburia, Eubacteria eligens</italic>, and <italic>Butyricicoccus</italic> relative to the SWD. The enrichment of <italic>Roseburia</italic> following the WD is a similar finding to Holscher and colleagues (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), who reported that the RA of <italic>Roseburia</italic> was negatively associated with secondary bile acids. Certain gut bacteria can convert bile salts to secondary bile acids in the colon, which can damage the gut epithelial lining (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Dietary fat composition affects gut bacteria and can also affect bile acid metabolism and composition (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). SFAs in particular may promote the expansion of bacteria capable of converting bile salts into secondary bile acids (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Our study demonstrates that replacing SFAs with walnuts or a walnut fatty acid profile match may beneficially affect the gut environment through increasing bacteria that are inversely associated with secondary bile acids.</p>
              <p>Holscher et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) also reported significant differences in β-diversity. Of note, our study and the study conducted by Holscher et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) were controlled-feeding studies that provide a more robust assessment of diet-microbiota interactions because of the tightly controlled study design implemented. In contrast, Bamberger et al. (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) conducted a free living study and, consistent with our data and that of Holscher et al. (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), reported enrichment of <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> after walnut consumption compared to a walnut-free diet. Bamberger and colleagues (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) also reported significantly different β-diversity between diets. Although we did not see differences in β-diversity among diets, this may be because of our extremely similar treatment diets; diets only differed in the walnut bioactive and fiber profile or ALA content. Otherwise, our results are similar to the 2 previous studies (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>); however, those studies were conducted in healthy individuals and were not able to identify which component of walnuts may be inducing beneficial changes to the gut microbiota.</p>
              <p>The significantly enriched bacteria and predictive functional analysis suggest walnut consumption and a diet that contains a comparable fatty acid profile promote a favorable environment in the gastrointestinal tract and may also be important in gut epithelial maintenance. Increased gut permeability or “leaky gut” is associated with a variety of diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). SCFAs, butyrate in particular, are a main energy source of enterocytes and are important for the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Increased SCFA availability decreases intestinal permeability (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Although we did not observe significant enrichment in genes related to butyrate production or metabolism, <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium</italic> were enriched following both the WD and WFMD and <italic>Leuconostocaceae</italic> was enriched following the WD; all of these bacteria are capable of SCFA production (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> was also enriched following the WD and may also be involved in intestinal epithelium maintenance as it is inversely correlated with intestinal permeability (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref>). Further, genes involved in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells were enriched following the Western-style, run-in diet relative to the WFMD. Unfortunately, when we examined the contributions of bacteria within the enriched Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States pathway (data not shown), the bacterial species had not been identified, but they possess genes related to the enriched pathway. Identification of <italic>SJTU_G_09_34, SHZO627</italic>, and <italic>aab28d05</italic> could provide more information on the enrichment of invasion of epithelial cells. This pathway has been connected to increased gastrointestinal epithelial permeability (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and suggests a Western-style diet that had a greater % SFA (compared to study diets), which participants followed previous to the study diets, may increase gut permeability. The MaAsLin analysis also showed a positive association between gut bacteria and systemic inflammation following the run-in diet, which could be linked to increased gut bacteria infiltration. Although we did not analyze gut-derived metabolites, the enrichment of SCFA-producing bacteria following the WD and WFMD suggests that the fatty acid composition, including ALA, may be protective against gut permeability.</p>
              <p>The co-occurrence networks constructed to assess the bacterial community following each of the study diets illustrates potentially protective clustering following the WD and WFMD. Baldassano and Bassett (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) reported that healthy individuals had a high degree of bacterial modularity compared to individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, who had less distinctive community structures. The WD and WFMD networks had more modular bacterial clusters such as the <italic>Blautia, Agathobacter, Lachnospiraceae, Fusicatenibacter</italic> cluster in the WD co-occurrence network and the <italic>Lachnospiraceceae, Eubacterium eligens, Lachnospira</italic> cluster in the WFMD network. The ORAD network did not indicate any clustering and there was limited clustering in the SWD network. The interactions between bacterial nodes were primarily positive in the WD, WFMD, and SWD networks, with the greatest number of negative interactions following the ORAD. The large numbers of positive bacterial interactions correspond to a stable gut environment. A common trend in the co-occurrence network analyses is negative interactions among several bacteria that may be pathogenic with potentially beneficial bacteria, <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> indicating this bacterium may have a protective effect within the bacterial community. The observed positive interactions and modular bacterial clustering in the WD and WFMD networks could provide protection against pathogenic bacteria to maintain host health.</p>
              <p>The enrichment of <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> following the WD relative to the WFMD (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplemental Table 2</xref></bold>) suggests that the walnuts may be altering the gut microenvironment to better metabolize the bioactive compounds present in walnuts. <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> is known to metabolize ellagitannins, which are uniquely high in walnuts, to urolithins, the primary form in which ellagitannins are absorbed into the body (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Urolithin A has been negatively correlated with CVD risk factors, such as plasma glucose. Further, when we examined the RA of <italic>Gordonibacter</italic>, the RA was significantly greater following the WD compared to both the WFMD and ORAD. The increase in ellagitannins-metabolizing bacteria after walnut consumption suggests that the gut microbiota may be involved in the underlying mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular benefits of walnut consumption.</p>
              <p>In the absence of clearly defined underlying mechanisms for the association between the gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk, we performed correlation analyses between enriched bacteria and CVD risk factors examined in the primary analysis of this study. We demonstrated that members of the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family are inversely correlated with CVD risk factors following a diet containing walnuts. Increased <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> abundance was negatively correlated with changes in brachial MAP, central MAP, central diastolic BP, TC, and non-HDL cholesterol; greater abundance of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> bacteria was associated with greater reductions in CVD risk factors. Increased abundance of <italic>Eubacterium eligens</italic> was also correlated with reductions in brachial MAP, central MAP, and central diastolic BP. Increased <italic>Leuconostocaceae</italic> was positively correlated with increases in brachial and central MAP. Although further research examining bacterial functionality and secondary metabolites is needed to provide more mechanistic insight, this exploratory analysis suggests that several bacteria may be involved in the underlying mechanisms for walnut consumption and reduced cardiovascular risk.</p>
              <p>Previous reports of interactions between BMI and the gut microbiota (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) prompted us to perform an exploratory analysis on phylogenic taxonomy by BMI in the present study. Although we did not observe any differences between individuals with overweight, obesity, or morbid obesity in the prominent phyla, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, there could be differences at lower taxonomic levels or functional differences that were not detected. These results are similar to a meta-analysis that examined whether α-diversity could predict BMI. The authors reported a relatively weak association between diversity and BMI that was confounded by large inter-personal variation (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). We did observe possible interactions between bacteria that may affect BMI. The CoNet of the WD showed <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> could be suppressing <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic>, a bacteria that may be associated with increased BMI (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The enrichment of <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> following the WD could play a role in weight status as it may be suppressing bacteria associated with increased BMIs. This warrants further exploration of interactions between weight status and gut bacteria given the increasing rates of obesity globally.</p>
              <p>The strength of this study is the use of a controlled-feeding, randomized, controlled crossover trial with a run-in period to examine the differences in gut microbial composition and correlations with cardiovascular risk markers in individuals at risk for CVD following a diet containing walnuts as an SFA replacement. Study limitations include the lack of evaluation of secondary metabolites, such as SCFAs, and the use of Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States rather than a metatrancriptomics analysis to assess the functional capacity of gut bacteria. This study also did not assess the conversion of ALA to EPA which could affect the gut microbiota.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study, which was designed to investigate which component(s) of walnuts underlie the beneficial cardiovascular effects, suggests that whole walnuts (fatty acids, fiber, and bioactive compounds), and the fatty acid profile may differentially affect the gut microbiota relative to a Western-style diet with a greater percentage of calories (or energy) from SFAs. Similarities between enrichment of SCFA-producing bacteria, including <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, following the WD and WFMD illustrate the effect that the high unsaturated fat content, including ALA, may have on gut bacteria. The unique enrichment of <italic>Gordonibacter</italic> following the WD suggests that walnut-derived bioactive compounds and fiber modulate gut microbiota. The associations between <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and improved cardiovascular risk factors suggest that the gastrointestinal microbiota may contribute to the underlying mechanisms of the beneficial health effects of walnut consumption.</p>
