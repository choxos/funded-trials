                  <p>HVTN 100 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV subtype C pox-protein vaccine regimen, investigating a 12-month booster to extend vaccine-induced immune responses.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>A phase 1–2 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial enrolled 252 participants (210 vaccine/42 placebo; median age 23 years; 43% female) between 9 February 2015 and 26 May 2015. Vaccine recipients received ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) alone at months 0 and 1 and with bivalent subtype C gp120/MF59 at months 3, 6, and 12. Antibody (IgG, IgG3 binding, and neutralizing) and CD4+ T-cell (expressing interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and CD40 ligand) responses were evaluated at month 6.5 for all participants and at months 12, 12.5, and 18 for a randomly selected subset. The primary analysis compared IgG binding antibody (bAb) responses and CD4+ T-cell responses to 3 vaccine-matched antigens at peak (month 6.5 versus 12.5) and durability (month 12 versus 18) timepoints; IgG responses to CaseA2_gp70_V1V2.B, a primary correlate of risk in RV144, were also compared at these same timepoints. Secondary and exploratory analyses compared IgG3 bAb responses, IgG bAb breadth scores, neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, CD4+ polyfunctionality responses, and CD4+ memory sub-population responses at the same timepoints. Vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated. During the study, there were 2 deaths (both in the vaccine group and both unrelated to study products). Ten participants became HIV-infected during the trial, 7% (3/42) of placebo recipients and 3% (7/210) of vaccine recipients. All 8 serious adverse events were unrelated to study products. Less waning of immune responses was seen after the fifth vaccination than after the fourth, with higher antibody and cellular response rates at month 18 than at month 12: IgG bAb response rates to 1086.C V1V2, 21.0% versus 9.7% (difference = 11.3%, 95% CI = 0.6%–22.0%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.039), and ZM96.C V1V2, 21.0% versus 6.5% (difference = 14.5%, 95% CI = 4.1%–24.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). IgG bAb response rates to all 4 primary V1V2 antigens were higher 2 weeks after the fifth vaccination than 2 weeks after the fourth vaccination: 87.7% versus 75.4% (difference = 12.3%, 95% CI = 1.7%–22.9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.022) for 1086.C V1V2, 86.0% versus 63.2% (difference = 22.8%, 95% CI = 9.1%–36.5%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) for TV1c8.2.C V1V2, 67.7% versus 44.6% (difference = 23.1%, 95% CI = 10.4%–35.7%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) for ZM96.C V1V2, and 81.5% versus 60.0% (difference = 21.5%, 95% CI = 7.6%–35.5%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) for CaseA2_gp70_V1V2.B. IgG bAb response rates to the 3 primary vaccine-matched gp120 antigens were all above 90% at both peak timepoints, with no significant differences seen, except a higher response rate to ZM96.C gp120 at month 18 versus month 12: 64.5% versus 1.6% (difference = 62.9%, 95% CI = 49.3%–76.5%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). CD4+ T-cell response rates were higher at month 18 than month 12 for all 3 primary vaccine-matched antigens: 47.3% versus 29.1% (difference = 18.2%, 95% CI = 2.9%–33.4%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.021) for 1086.C, 61.8% versus 38.2% (difference = 23.6%, 95% CI = 9.5%–37.8%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) for TV1.C, and 63.6% versus 41.8% (difference = 21.8%, 95% CI = 5.1%–38.5%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.007) for ZM96.C, with no significant differences seen at the peak timepoints. Limitations were that higher doses of gp120 were not evaluated, this study was not designed to investigate HIV prevention efficacy, and the clinical significance of the observed immunological effects is uncertain.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The goal of a preventative HIV vaccine is to induce durable immune responses that can protect against HIV acquisition. Durability of a prevention intervention reduces health system burden and cost. Durability was a critical challenge in the RV144 trial, which administered the only vaccine regimen to date to show any preventative efficacy against HIV-1 acquisition [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With a 4-dose pox-protein heterologous prime–boost regimen administered over 6 months, vaccine efficacy in the RV144 trial was 60.5% at 1 year but waned to 31.2% at 3.5 years [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, antibody response magnitude and quality decayed significantly over the same time frame, with IgG3 antibodies to HIV envelope decaying earlier than other subclasses. IgG and IgG3 binding antibodies (bAbs) to the HIV envelope and IgG3 bAbs to the V1V2 region were among the immune responses that correlated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition risk [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Extending antibody persistence and improving the quality of responses could be approached through multiple plausible strategies, including altering immunogen design, adjuvant selection, dosing intervals, and administration routes. Currently, several clinical trials are exploring the use of various adjuvants and additional booster doses to extend the longevity of vaccine-induced immune responses. Both non-human primate and human studies utilizing other pox-protein boosters have demonstrated that, although immune responses decline after completion of the primary vaccination series, a booster can restore antibody responses [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 100 clinical trial investigated a prime–boost vaccine regimen designed against subtype C HIV, and it aimed to increase the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited immune responses beyond those observed in the RV144 trial. The regimen had 2 constituents. The first constituent was ALVAC-HIV, a pox vector vaccine with subtype C inserts. The second constituent was glycoprotein 120 (gp120), a protein vaccine that was administered with the MF59 adjuvant, instead of the alum adjuvant used in the RV144 trial. HVTN 100 also added a pox-protein booster (a fifth vaccination) at month 12. By 2 weeks after the month 6 vaccination, all HVTN 100 vaccine recipients developed IgG bAbs with significantly higher titers than to the corresponding antigens in the RV144 trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here we present the safety profile and cellular and antibody responses, including the effects of the 12-month booster, up to month 18.</p>

                <p>The HVTN 100 study design, eligibility criteria, participants and their baseline characteristics, randomization by computer-generated block-randomized sequences, masking of participants and staff, study products, and trial site locations have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All participants gave written informed consent in English or their local language (Setswana, Sotho, Xhosa, or Zulu). Participant baseline characteristics of the intention-to-treat (i.e., full study), per-protocol, and durability subset cohorts are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003038.s007">S1 Table</xref>. HVTN 100 is, in summary, a phase 1–2randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 252 healthy HIV-uninfected 18- to 40-year-old participants at 6 sites in South Africa. The investigational products were ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) and MF59-adjuvanted bivalent subtype C gp120. ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) (viral titer nominal dose of 10<sup>7</sup> 50% cell culture infectious dose) expressed the envelope gp120 of the subtype C ZM96.C strain with the gp41 transmembrane sequence of the subtype B LAI strain, as well as <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>protease</italic> from the subtype B LAI strain. Bivalent subtype C gp120 was a combination of 100 μg each of the subtype C envelope gp120 of the TV1.C and 1086.C strains. Placebo for ALVAC-HIV was a mixture of virus stabilizer and freeze-drying medium reconstituted with 0.4% NaCl, and placebo for the bivalent subtype C gp120 was sodium chloride for injection. Participants were randomized in a 5:1 vaccine:placebo ratio to receive ALVAC-HIV at months 0 and 1 followed by 3 administrations of ALVAC-HIV along with bivalent subtype C gp120/MF59 at months 3, 6, and 12, or to receive placebo throughout, all by intramuscular injection. The protocol specified ALVAC-HIV or placebo to be administered in the left deltoid and bivalent subtype C gp120/MF59 or placebo to be administered in the right deltoid. Participants were followed for 18 months after enrollment.</p>

                <title>Safety measures</title>
                <p>Standard safety laboratory testing included hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis, which were obtained at baseline (during screening) and at each 2-week post-vaccination visit plus a month 15 visit (except urinalysis, collected at 2 weeks after the first, fourth, and fifth vaccination). Participants were observed for 30 minutes after vaccinations and recorded solicited local and systemic symptoms (reactogenicity) for 3 days after each vaccination. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded until 30 days after each vaccination, except for AEs leading to early participant withdrawal or early product discontinuation and serious AEs, which were recorded throughout the trial. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 21.1, and severity was graded using version 2.0 of the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (November 2014). Safety reviews were conducted by the protocol safety review team and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).</p>

The secondary objectives were to compare IgG3 responses to the same antigens at the same timepoints as IgG, nAb responses to TV1c8.2.C and MW965.26.C, and ADCP responses to 1086.C gp140 at the same peak and durability timepoints. CD4+ memory sub-populations and CD4+ polyfunctionality responses (as defined below) to vaccine-matched peptide pools were assessed as exploratory objectives.</p>
                <p>All randomized participants were included in the safety analyses. The number and percentage of participants experiencing each AE or reactogenicity symptom were tabulated by severity.</p>
                <p>Immune responses at month 6.5 were analyzed in the per-protocol (those who received the first 4 scheduled vaccinations) cohort of 185 vaccine recipients and 37 placebo recipients, except ADCP responses, which were measured on the durability subset cohort (described next) at all timepoints. Immune responses at months 12, 12.5, and 18 were analyzed on the durability subset cohort, a subset of 70 vaccine recipients and 5 placebo recipients, randomly selected from among per-protocol cohort participants who had month 6.5 samples available; subset selection was stratified by sex to match the sex ratio observed in HVTN 100.</p>
                <p>McNemar’s test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare response rates and magnitudes (overall and among responders), respectively, between 2 timepoints. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using the Wilson method [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for the positive response rates, using the central CIs from McNemar’s test for the difference in positive response rates between 2 timepoints, and using the normal approximation for the mean of the log-transformed magnitudes. The magnitude–breadth curve, with the area under the curve (AUC) computed as a summary measure, was used to describe the magnitude and breadth across a panel of antigens [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The AUC, or “breadth score,” represents the area under the magnitude–breadth curve for an individual vaccine recipient, calculated as the average of the log<sub>10</sub> (MFI-blank) over the panel of antigens, where each antigen receives equal weight. Antigen-specific T-cell subsets were analyzed by COMPASS (Combinatorial Polyfunctionality Analysis of Antigen-Specific T-cell Subsets), where the functionality score is defined as the estimated proportion of Env-specific subsets detected among all possible subsets, while the polyfunctionality score is similar but weights the different subsets by their degree of functionality, favoring subsets with higher degrees of functions [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. COMPASS posterior probabilities were reported for all observed 6-function CD4+ T-cell subsets (interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, CD40 ligand, interleukin-4, and granzyme B) over time.</p>
                <p>All tests were 2-sided, and differences were considered statistically significant if <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05. Multiplicity adjustments were not made. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R statistical software (version 3.3.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We followed CONSORT guidelines for reporting clinical trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003038.s001">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>).</p>

                <p>Vaccinations were generally safe and well tolerated. Grade 3 pain and/or tenderness was reported by 1.4% (3/210) of vaccine recipients, Grade 3 erythema and/or induration was reported by 1.4% (3/210) of vaccine recipients, and maximum systemic reactogenicity (headache, arthralgia) of Grade 3 was reported by 1.4% (3/210) of vaccine recipients. No Grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicities were reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003038.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All Grade 3 systemic reactogenicity events and local pain and/or tenderness events resolved within 3 days of vaccination, except for 1 Grade 3 arthralgia event, which occurred after the first vaccination and resolved within 9 days. One vaccine recipient reported Grade 3 erythema and induration on the right deltoid beginning on day 3 after the fifth vaccination: antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic medications were taken for 3 days, and there was resolution by day 5. Another vaccine recipient reported Grade 3 erythema and induration in the right deltoid beginning on day 2 after the fourth vaccination that resolved within 1 day (induration) and 4 days (erythema) of onset (3 and 6 days post-vaccination, respectively). Antibiotics, analgesics, and antihistamines were prescribed, and the participant was discontinued from further vaccinations according to protocol but remained in follow-up. A third participant experienced Grade 3 erythema and induration in the left deltoid, with onset on day 0 after the fifth vaccination and resolving by day 3. Antihistamine, oral steroid, and analgesic/anti-inflammatory medications were taken. In all 3 participants with Grade 3 erythema/induration, the needle used for injection was &lt;1.5 inches long, consistent with weight-based guidance for needle length choice.

Eleven participants experienced 14 AEs deemed by the investigator to be attributed to the study products, including 3/42 (7.1%) placebo recipients (headache, diarrhea, injection site pruritus, and oral paresthesia) and 8/210 (3.8%) vaccine recipients (abdominal pain, gastritis, injection site pruritis in 2 participants, injection site nodule, lymphadenopathy in 2 participants, dizziness, decreased neutrophil count, and generalized pruritus): all were mild or moderate, and transient. There were 3 potentially life-threatening AEs, all deemed to be unrelated to study products: raised aspartate aminotransferase (asymptomatic with an alternative etiology, resolved within 1 week), depression (ongoing at end of study), and subdural hematoma. There were 2 deaths, both in vaccine recipients, and both deemed unrelated to study product (multiple injuries with subdural hematoma, and suicide). There were 8 serious AEs reported by 6 participants, and all were deemed unrelated to the study products.</p>
                <p>Before completing the trial, 16.7% (7/42) of placebo recipients and 12.4% (26/210) of vaccine recipients were terminated from the study, with reasons including HIV infection, inability to contact participant, persistent non-adherence to study schedule, participant refusal, relocation, death, and investigator decision. Vaccinations were discontinued in 7.1% (3/42) of placebo recipients and 8.1% (17/210) of vaccine recipients. In 7 participants, AEs led to early withdrawal/termination from study or discontinuation of vaccination: 1 placebo recipient (Grade 1 vomiting on day 1 after the first vaccination) and 6 vaccine recipients (2 psychiatric diagnoses unrelated to study product, death from multiple injuries, death from suicide, Grade 3 hypertension unrelated to study product, and Grade 3 erythema and induration reaction).</p>

No significant differences were seen in the response magnitude among positive responders to any of the vaccine-matched peptide pools between month 6.5 and 12.5 or between month 12 and 18 (all <italic>P &gt;</italic> 0.43). Higher magnitudes overall (not restricting to positive responders) were seen at month 18 than at month 12 for 1086.C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.030) and for ZM96.C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009), with some evidence of higher overall magnitude for TV1c8.2.C also (<italic>P</italic> = 0.052); these differences in overall magnitude are likely driven by the difference in response rates. There were no positive responses among placebo recipients at any timepoint.

              <p>Our study, HVTN 100, demonstrates that the durability of immune responses to an HIV vaccine regimen can be extended by the administration of a fifth vaccination booster given at month 12. Furthermore, the study also shows that the vaccines were well tolerated and have an acceptable safety profile.</p>
              <p>An ongoing challenge in the HIV vaccine field remains inducing immune responses that are durable. Response durability could plausibly be influenced by product-related factors such as vaccine design, dose, administration route, schedule, and adjuvants. Regimens that include more immunogenic adjuvants and repeated vaccination may help to extend and enhance levels of protective immunity for longer periods of time after vaccination [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Follow-up booster vaccinations have the potential to augment protective immunity; the maturation of the immune response can lead to increased affinity for antigen. The RV305 study, in which vaccine boosters were given 6–8 years after the primary regimen, observed expansion in a sub-pool of memory B cells whose germline precursors and affinity-matured B cell clonal lineage members neutralized a tier 2 HIV isolate [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, durability of the immune response could be influenced by host-related factors such as antibody titers resulting from vaccination, host genetics (e.g., HLA type) [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], health history, and microbiome. For some biomarkers and for some vaccines, including those administered in the RV144 trial, 2-week post-vaccination responses predict durable responses 6 months later [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our study of a heterologous prime–boost regimen demonstrates immune responses that vary considerably amongst individuals, suggesting that host factors contribute substantially to immune response durability.</p>
              <p>The HVTN 100 vaccine regimen was similar to the RV144 regimen, but there were regional adaptations to the immunogens and modifications to the regimen in an effort to extend durability. Immune responses 2 weeks after the fourth vaccination were at least comparable to those observed in the RV144 trial. A fifth vaccination was given at month 12 in HVTN 100 to extend the levels of vaccine-induced immune responses. With the fifth vaccination, we observed that, in general, immune responses could be significantly boosted, and that thereafter the response rates and magnitudes decayed more slowly than after the fourth vaccination. We observed significant enhancement of IgG and IgG3 bAb, ADCP, tier 1A nAb, and CD4+ T-cell responses 2 weeks after the booster, with the expected waning of immunity over the subsequent 6-month time period. Notably, some antibody responses were persistent (e.g., IgG responses to the 1086.C vaccine-matched antigen and ADCP responses to 1086.C gp140), indicating that potentially long-lived memory B cells were stimulated by vaccination.</p>
              <p>Our results demonstrate that the month 12 booster of the subtype C pox-protein vaccine regimen can restore both tier 1A neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses to peak levels after 2 weeks, and that these levels are sustained reasonably well for 6 months after the booster. This regimen, like that in the RV144 trial, has been able to neutralize only tier 1A HIV isolates, indicating that inducing a broader tier 2 neutralization requires an alternative approach.</p>
              <p>Decreased HIV acquisition risk has previously been associated in RV144 vaccine recipients with polyfunctional CD4+ T cells producing multiple cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin-4, interleukin-2, and CD40L) in response to HIV-1 Env antigen [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although the booster served to restore T-cell functionality and polyfunctionality initially, these also waned over time.</p>
              <p>Our study focused on the immunogenicity and durability of immune responses induced by this subtype C pox-protein vaccine regimen adapted to the sub-Saharan population, and was not designed to answer clinical questions around vaccine efficacy. The HVTN 702 trial, which has completed enrollment of 5,407 participants and is currently ongoing in South Africa, is designed to provide evidence on the efficacy of this vaccine regimen from 0 to 36 months after enrollment. The durability data from HVTN 100 presented here support the vaccine schedule utilized in HVTN 702, which includes a booster at month 12 along with a subsequent booster at month 18 in order to extend even further the total immune response coverage over time. Decay of measurable antibody and cellular immune responses may or may not signify waning of protection; likewise, restoration of immune responses may or may not improve protection. However, it is possible that even if immune responses dip to low levels, upon exposure a rapid recall response that prevents the establishment of infection could occur.</p>
              <p>More than 10,000 human volunteers have received other ALVAC-HIV recombinant canarypox vector vaccine constructs, mostly vCP205, vCP1452, and vCP1521 [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this paper provides to our knowledge the first description of safety data for vCP2438, the construct of ALVAC-HIV developed against HIV subtype C. Similarly, although recombinant monomeric gp120 subunit vaccine formulations have been tested in many clinical trials, ours is the first safety profile description to our knowledge for bivalent subtype C gp120/MF59. MF59 is a registered adjuvant with an established safety record. Our trial results demonstrate a satisfactory clinical safety profile and support further administration of ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) and bivalent subtype C gp120/MF59 vaccine to humans, as in the HVTN 702 efficacy trial currently underway.</p>
              <p>A limitation of our trial design was that it did not evaluate higher doses of gp120, which may have increased the durability of the immune response. The gp120 dose administered in HVTN 100 was one-third the dose used in the RV144 trial, with the expectation that MF59 would be dose-sparing relative to the alum adjuvant [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There are 2 caveats in interpretation of our data. First, this study was conducted in a population of healthy young adults at low risk for HIV acquisition in South Africa, and it is unknown whether findings can be generalized to different populations. Second, this study was not designed to investigate efficacy. Further evaluation of the full breadth of antibody Fc effector functions (e.g., ADCC [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and complement binding [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) is needed to understand the depth of potentially protective immunity elicited by this vaccine. To inform future vaccine immunogen design, further evaluation is needed of the antibody specificities that comprise the antibody functions and the kinetics of the antibody isotype [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and subclass profile [<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003038.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] after boosting, and how they relate to antiviral functions.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Based on the decay kinetics of vaccine-induced immune responses of pox-protein heterologous prime–boost regimens, it seems that additional boosters are required to improve the immune response durability. We demonstrate that a 12-month booster of subtype C pox-protein vaccines boosts bAb, tier 1A nAb, and ADCP responses, which persist in many participants to 18 months after initial vaccination, and prolongs robust CD4+ T-cell, ADCP, and tier 1A nAb responses. Further research is also being conducted with a subset of the HVTN 100 trial participants to evaluate immune responses after a late booster at month 30.</p>

                  <p>In (A), bar charts show response rates with 2-sided 95% CIs, and boxplots show magnitude as the percent expression of IFN-γ, IL-2, or CD40L by CD4+ T cells to Env 1086.C and are based on positive responders, shown as colored circles; negative responders are shown as grey triangles. Boxplots in (B) show functionality and polyfunctionality scores of CD4+ T-cell subsets recognizing Env 1086.C. In (C), columns correspond to cellular subsets modeled by COMPASS, color-coded by the cytokines they express. Each cell of the heatmap shows the probability that a given cell subset (column) has an antigen-specific response in the corresponding participant (column), where the probability is color-coded from white (0) to purple (1).</p>
