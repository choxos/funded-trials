                <p>Introduction. Innovations are needed for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and for reaching diverse communities in remote regions. The current study reports on a telemedicine-delivered intervention promoting a traditional heart-healthy diet and medication adherence with Alaska Native men and women residing in the Norton Sound region of Alaska. Methods. Participants were 299 men and women with high blood pressure or high cholesterol smoking daily who were randomized to receive telemedicine-delivered counseling and printed materials on diet and medication adherence or on smoking and physical activity. Intervention contacts were at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up, with a final assessment at 18 months. Nutrition outcomes were the ratio of heart-healthy foods and traditional heart-healthy foods relative to all foods reported on a 34-item food frequency questionnaire. Recent and typical adherence for heart medications were self-reported. Results. Intervention effects were significant for the heart-healthy foods ratio at 6 months only (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.014) and significant for the traditional heart-healthy foods ratio at 6 months only for those aged 47+ (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.031). For recent and typical medication adherence, there were no significant group differences by time. Discussion. In a remote region of Alaska, telemedicine proved feasible and acceptable for engaging Alaska Native men and women in counseling on CVD risk behaviors. The findings indicate that more touchpoints may be necessary to impart comprehensive lasting change in heart-healthy eating patterns. Medication adherence group differences were not significant; however, medication adherence was high overall.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the second leading cause of death for Alaska Native people, with a mortality rate of 183.3 per 100,000, significantly higher than among Alaska non-Native people (120.8 per 100,000) [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The CVD mortality rate is even higher for Alaska Native people in the Norton Sound Region of Alaska (211.8 per 100,000) [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>An estimated 79% of American Indian and Alaska Native adults have at least one CVD risk factor, and 46% have two or more [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Interventions that address multiple risk behaviors for change offer a comprehensive approach to reducing disease risk [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For the Norton Sound region, treatment strategies must be culturally targeted and remotely accessible.</p>
              <p>In Alaska, declines in traditional food consumption have shifted toward more shelf-stable, highly processed, store-bought foods associated with a higher risk of CVD [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In more rural and removed Alaska Native communities, there are challenges to obtaining whole, fresh, and minimally processed foods, as many commercial and Western foods must be flown in on small planes sometimes without refrigeration [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, fresh, whole foods are often more expensive and less available. The traditional diet of Alaska Native people, however, comes from the land, and is high in marine sources of omega-three fatty acids (e.g., salmon and seal), which are linked to cardiovascular health [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Omega-3 fatty acids decrease CVD risk through a number of different mechanisms [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and recently, a cross-sectional study demonstrated significant inverse relationships between habitual omega 3 intake levels in Yup’ik Alaska Native adults (via a validated blood biomarker) and three systemic inflammatory biomarkers [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Adherence to traditional dietary practices also correlate with the connection to one’s culture and community, which, in turn, have been associated with greater mental well-being and greater quality of life [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications also reduce the risk of CVD, but adherence can be poor. In the general population, about half of patients achieve adherence to heart medications [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For Alaska Native people, federal funding and other insurances provide coverage of many heart medications, with specifics varying by region. Barriers to medication adherence, however, extend beyond cost [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] such as: preferring lifestyle changes over medication; disliking medication; having trouble remembering to take medication [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
              <p>Intervention trials that tackle multiple risk behaviors can be an impactful and ethical way to address a broader profile of participants’ disease risk. However, the literature documents mixed effects. One meta-analysis noted only modest risk factor changes [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while another review found success intervening on multiple risk behaviors when there was a common disease state focus [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More research is needed to examine interventions on multi-behavioral risk factors, and specifically in understudied, high-risk communities [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Healing and Empowering Alaskan Lives Toward Healthy-Hearts (HEALTHH) was designed in response to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s request for applications for indigenous-health-focused research on multiple health behavior changes for secondary prevention of CVD [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The HEALTHH study aimed to test two culturally tailored, telemedicine-delivered interventions, based in the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], each focused on changing two CVD risk behaviors to improve heart health. One condition promoted traditional, heart-healthy food intake and adherence to cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive medications; the other condition promoted tobacco cessation and regular physical activity (outcomes to be reported elsewhere). The current paper compares changes in dietary intake and medication adherence between the two study conditions. We hypothesized that those randomly assigned to the nutrition and medication adherence condition would increase the self-reported intake of traditional heart-healthy foods; increase heart medication adherence, if prescribed medication.</p>

Randomization was to one of two study conditions: nutrition and medication adherence or tobacco cessation and physical activity.

Counseling sessions were provided after randomization at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up, with assessments at baseline, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months follow-up. The protocol has been described in detail [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

The study health coaches had college degrees in psychology, public health, or related fields. All study team members received extensive on-boarding training in the following: motivational interviewing; Alaska Native indigenous cultures; the history of research ethics violations with the Alaska Native peoples; dietary, tobacco, physical activity, and medication adherence guidelines; stage-tailored interventions; the use of the Transtheoretical Model-guided computer-counseling program [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

Counseling promoted a heart-healthy Alaska Native diet and heart medication adherence or tobacco cessation and physical activity, depending on study randomization. Because counseling sessions were individualized based on the participant’s stage of change, contamination across conditions was minimized.</p>
                <p>The intervention materials for each condition were directly informed by the research team’s prior fieldwork in Alaska and continued community partnership [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and culturally targeted to reflect traditional Alaska Native values such as respect for elders, land, and family, and included photos of Alaska Native traditional foods, land, and people. The nutrition and medication adherence condition provided a cookbook featuring heart-healthy Alaska Native recipes [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and a bag to organize medications. As produce is not widely available and is often expensive in many Alaskan regions, we adapted nutrition materials to focus on the promotion of traditional foods rich in heart-healthy omega-3 polyunsaturated fats from marine mammals and fish [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], rather than the USDA guidelines’ emphasis on increased produce intake. Counseling sessions and materials highlighted participants’ regular access to traditional foods through subsistence activities, food sharing, public eateries, and community celebrations/gatherings. The intervention materials were reviewed by team members of Alaska Native heritage; data safety monitoring board members of American Indian and Alaska Native heritage; the Norton Sound Research Ethics Review Board, comprised of tribal stakeholders; the Alaska Area Institutional Review Board. Feedback-informed enhancements and targeting of the intervention included photos, language and cultural terms, and Alaska Native stories.

Response options for each food item were: Did not eat it this week; Once this week; 2–3 times this week; 4–6 times this week; Once or twice each day; More than twice each day; Refused (i.e., declined to answer). Nine of the 34 foods were traditional to the Alaska Native diet, or local to the region and enjoyed by communities prior to Western state influences (e.g., wild berries, moose, and whale oil) [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These were selected in consultation with team members who were of Alaska Native origin to reflect the traditional diet in the Norton Sound region. Sixteen of the 34 foods were considered heart-healthy, as determined by a dietitian and in line with either the DASH (Dietary Approach to Stopping Hypertension) diet or research on the heart healthiness of foods native to the Alaskan region, and each was available in the regions of study; a subset of 7 foods were both traditional and heart-healthy (e.g., traditional greens, whale skin and fat, walrus soup, and wild berries) [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

The full nutrition measure can be found in the <xref rid="app1-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="app">Supplementary Materials</xref>. To minimize participant burden and survey fatigue, the 34-item food questionnaire was not intended to be an all-inclusive list of foods consumed. Instead, the foods were selected with the team members of Alaska Native origin to serve as a proxy for traditional and heart-healthy choices in a subset of foods, and to provide a consistent measure of this proxy over time.</p>
                  <p>For analyses, interpretability, and to be consistent with the baseline paper analyses (under review), response options were converted to estimate the number of times consumed per week with recoding to the midpoint of the range when needed (e.g., once or twice each day was recoded as 10.5, the midpoint between 7 and 14 times in a week). Reports of consumption more than twice daily were recoded as 14, the minimum, to be conservative and not inflate the distribution of responses. The two primary outcomes were ratios reflecting the relative change in the relationship of healthy to nonhealthy foods assessed. The <underline>ratio of heart-healthy foods</underline> was calculated as the sum total of times per week that heart-healthy foods on the list were consumed divided by the sum total for all foods reported. The <underline>ratio of traditional heart-healthy foods</underline> was a subset of the heart-healthy foods that were traditional, summed, and divided by the sum total for all foods reported.</p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>Delivering innovative, culturally targeted, remotely deliverable, and effective interventions for CVD prevention is an important and needed endeavor. HEALTHH was a multi-behavioral intervention, delivered via telemedicine to Alaska Native adults in their community clinics. Intervention effects were significant for some healthy eating proxies midway through the study period, though the effect size was small. The study was novel in delivering CVD prevention counseling via telemedicine to remote regions of Alaska; tailoring the interventions for relevance to the region and Alaska Native culture; and comparing two distinct, multiple risk behavior interventions so that all participants received counseling on CVD risks.</p>
              <p>While, overall, we found limited evidence that the intervention improved nutrition and medication adherence, there was indication of a possible treatment effect at 6 months on heart-healthy foods. Additionally, age related to both study participation and diet, particularly the ratio of traditional heart-healthy foods to other foods. At baseline, older (47 and up) participants reported eating a greater proportion of traditional heart-healthy foods, and during the study, older participants in the nutrition intervention group showed a relative boost in traditional heart-healthy foods at 6 months compared to the comparison group. As reported by members of the community and in published literature, more recent generations tend to have a diet consisting of fewer traditional foods than older generations whether due to globalization, climate change, or other reasons [<xref rid="B42-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Younger participants appear more prone to select readily available, highly processed Western foods [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Targeting the cultural diet intervention to younger adults, with more explicit instructions on how to procure and prepare more traditional foods, may be warranted for future interventions. Additionally, earlier intervention with youth (under 18) may be beneficial. For example, a successful pilot intervention with middle and high school Alaska Native students focused on improving attitudes around traditional foods and increased fish intake and diet quality [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Of note, a majority of participants in both conditions reported recent adherence to heart medications at baseline (~77%), and both groups appeared to improve over time in typical medication adherence. This is a positive outcome that could, in part, be explained by both groups simply being asked about their adherence to medication at each study measurement time point and by study participants having access to and coverage for heart medications in their health care system.</p>
              <p>As noted earlier, a study strength was the use of telemedicine to deliver CVD prevention counseling in a remote region of Alaska. The telemedicine component was an important means of providing access to health coaching in remote regions in Alaska. Previous reporting of telehealth counseling satisfaction in a subset of the sample was high overall, with mean scores greater than 8 out of a possible score of 10 across treatment conditions, time, community, and gender [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another strength, particularly for the nutrition intervention, was the engagement of Alaska Native men and women in culturally targeted interventions. The nutrition messaging was attentive to seasonal variability and affordability challenges in access to fresh produce and to traditional food sharing and procurement. Having a culturally targeted nutrition intervention with measures that attended to geographic accessibility and cultural values make this an important contribution to the larger field of nutrition studies promoting heart-healthy eating. A third strength is that the design compared two active interventions and multiple risk behaviors. While this leads to multiple primary outcomes statistically, having an active control and providing counseling on multiple health behaviors optimizes potential impact and study retention for all participants.</p>
              <p>Study retention of 79% at 18 months exceeded the CDC guidance of 70% retention or higher [<xref rid="B44-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Due to various and sometimes unspecified reasons (e.g., internet connectivity issues, assessment fatigue, participant not knowing an answer), there were missed assessments and missed counseling sessions, which weakens the dose of the intervention and statistical power to detect treatment effects. The study design minimized participant burden by having surveys at the same study touchpoints as counseling sessions, but this does lead to a correlation between measurement and counseling.</p>
              <p>A study limitation was the reliance on self-reported outcome measures. The desire to please may have led to response bias in the reported medication adherence and food choices. Additionally, because the diet measure was a short list of foods, we cannot determine if the non-heart-healthy foods that were decreased were replaced by other unhealthy foods that were not on the list (e.g., swapping out Crisco for bacon lard). Short food frequency questionnaires have been shown to be valid for monitoring changes in food patterns over time [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A more complete diet assessment would include multiple 24 hour recalls, though these are time-intensive, and one study on women found this method to be less valid than a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire [<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further, for this intervention, we prioritized the increase in traditional heart-healthy foods, specifically a subset of foods included in the cookbook and reviewed by team members of Alaska Native heritage and members of the community board; therefore, we adapted the questionnaire measure to ask about our specific foods of interest instead of a free recall or an exhaustive list of all possible foods eaten. The measure may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in diet, even among those foods assessed. Finally, we chose to do a median split on age based on the sample to look at the traditional food intake. A more optimal age split by generation or a different age cut-point may be warranted for future work and could yield different outcomes.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Heart disease contributes to significant morbidity and mortality in Alaska Native people [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-09885" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given unique differences in land, weather, community living, cultural values, and lifestyles in the Norton Sound region of Alaska, this study developed and deployed a culturally targeted, multi-behavioral, telehealth intervention that both addresses and promotes these unique features to promote heart health. While more touchpoints may be necessary to impart lasting change, the study is novel in testing telemedicine-delivered, culturally targeted nutrition and medication adherence interventions in a remote region of Alaska. This study established the feasibility of the telehealth modality in reaching remote populations, positive acceptance of the culturally tailored intervention, and a format for intervening on multiple CVD risk behaviors at once while maintaining a randomized design. Future work can incorporate these key features in programs to advance the health of Alaska Native people.</p>
