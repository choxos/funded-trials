                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-superfamily have speculated roles in the response against T-independent type II antigens (TI-II) including pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS). Dysregulation in their expression is associated with an enhanced risk for pneumococcal disease in neonates but their expression in other high-risk populations including HIV-positive individuals remains to be elucidated.</p>

                  <p>Current studies highlight a potential role for TACI in PPV23 response based on its enhanced expression on PPS-specific B cells. Although surface levels of TACI were similar, diminished soluble TACI (sTACI) in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative individuals could potentially decrease BAFF responsiveness and Ig response.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-positive individuals. Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is significantly higher in HIV-positive (173/100,000) compared to HIV-negative adults (3/100,000) [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite widespread availability of highly anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), newly diagnosed and HAART-experienced individuals are at a ≥35-fold increased risk for pneumococcal disease [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for HIV-positive individuals [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>As protection is dependent on production of opsonic antibodies against capsular pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS), both quantity and quality of B cells play a critical role in vaccine response [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The onset of HIV is, however, characterized by early and severe B cell dysfunction including hypergammaglobulinemia, polyclonal B cell activation, increased cell turnover and impaired responses to vaccines amongst other defects. Although HAART has been successful in correcting several HIV-associated B cell defects, perturbations including loss of IgM memory B cells remain irreversible [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given these perturbations, efficacy of pneumococcal vaccine in this population has remained controversial [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Capsular pneumococcal polysaccharides (PPS) are T-independent type II (TI-II) antigens as they elicit antibody production without direct T cell contact. In contrast, T-dependent (TD) response requires T-cell recognition of MHC restricted antigens [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Secondary signals that contribute towards TD-response are well established but those governing TI-II antigens (PPS) have remained elusive [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several lines of evidence suggest a role for TNF receptors in TI-II responses. Two TNF ligands, BAFF and APRIL act on B cells through shared receptors. BAFF binds BAFF-R, BCMA and TACI while APRIL binds TACI and BCMA. Extensive studies have focused on these receptors in the context of tumor and autoimmunity [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, their role in immune defense is less explored. BAFF was found to play a non-redundant role among TNF ligands in supporting B cell survival. BAFF-/- mice exhibit profound reduction in antibody production against TNP (2, 4, 6-Trinitrophenyl)-Ficoll, a prototypic TI-II antigen [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. BCMA-/- mice do not show a defect in primary B cell responses but survival of long-lived plasma cells was impaired compared to wild type controls [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Increasing evidence also links TACI with antibody production during TI-II responses. TACI-/-mice exhibit significant defects in secretion of NP (TI-II)-specific IgG and IgM [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In support, humans with TACI mutations show defective switched-memory B cells and recurrent susceptibility to bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Decreased expression of TACI, BAFF-R and BCMA in neonatal B cells also coincides with an enhanced risk for IPD [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but its expression in HIV-positive adults remains unknown.</p>
              <p>The role of TNFs CD40 and CD40L in TI-II responses is conflicting. CD40 and CD40L deficient mice were able to mount normal response to TNP (TI-II antigen) [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, antagonistic antibody against CD40L inhibited IgM and IgG response in PPS immunized mice [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The relevance of this receptor in PPS-response thus remains uncertain in humans.</p>
              <p>In addition to TNFs, complement C3d and its receptor CD21 have been speculated to contribute in pneumococcal defense [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Binding of C3d to CD21 reduces the activation threshold required for B cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. C3d conjugated capsular polysaccharides exert enhanced immunogenicity in mice and cultured human B cells [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Reduced CD21 expression on infant B cells coincides with an inability to respond to PPS and increased susceptibility to infection [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Diminished CD21 levels have also been reported in B cells of HIV-viremic individuals [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but its expression in PPS-specific B cells remains to be elucidated.</p>
              <p>In our previous studies, we showed significantly diminished PPS-specific serological response in newly diagnosed and HAART-experienced HIV-positive adults compared to HIV-negative individuals post-PPV23 immunization [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The influence of chronic inflammation and potential TNF-associated dysregulation in PPV23 response however remains to be determined.</p>
              <p>The goals of the current study were to determine the underlying mechanisms that account for diminished PPV23-response in HIV-positive individuals. We compared the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in HIV-positive and -negative volunteers and evaluated their potential use as prognostic markers of PPV23-response. Next, we compared serum TNFs with speculated roles in TI-II responses between HIV-positive and -negative individuals to assess if potential dysregulation accounts for diminished PPV23 response. Lastly, we extended our previous work on PPS-specific B cells and characterized B cell surface expression pattern of BAFF-R, BCMA, TACI, CD40 and CD21. To our knowledge, expression pattern of speculated TI-II signals in overall (unselected) and PPS-specific (antigen-selected) B cells have not been examined in humans post PPV-immunization. Investigating PPS-specific B lymphocytes using fluorescently labeled PPS offers the novel advantage of assessing rare antigen-specific population while minimizing potential cross-reactivity by indirect labeling methods.</p>

Lymphocytes were separated using Ficoll Hypaque method immediately and 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells were added per staining tube for analysis the same day. Fluorescently conjugated pneumococcal PPS23F (5-DTAF) was added for the analysis of PPS-specific B cells [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lymphocytes were also stained with anti-human CD19 (APC-Cy7), CD27 (PerCP-Cy5.5), IgM (APC) to assess unselected- and PPS-specific-naïve and -memory B cell subsets. Anti-human BAFF-R PE (eBioscience), BCMA-Alexa 700 (R&amp;D System), TACI-PE (eBioscience), CD40-PeCy7 (eBioscience) and CD21-BV421 (BD) antibodies were used to assess expression pattern of receptors on unselected, PPS23F-specific total, memory and naïve B cell subsets. While adding stains to the tube, caution was taken to avoid fluorophor combinations that would cause spectral overlap.</p>
                <p>Lymphocytes were plotted (FSC-A, FSC-H) for doublet discrimination. Singlet lymphocytes were assessed for the expression of CD19+ B cells. B cells were plotted using 5-DTAF: PPS23F to identify PPS23F-selected vs. unselected cells. PPS-selected and unselected cells were further divided into sub-populations: naive (CD27-IgM+/-), class-switched memory (CD27+IgM-) and IgM memory (CD27+IgM+) B cells. Total (unselected), PPS23F-selected and respective memory and naïve B cell subsets were analyzed for the expression of BAFF-R, TACI, BCMA, CD40 and CD21. All flow cytometry results were plotted and analyzed using fluorescence minus one controls (FMO).</p>

We used Shapiro-Wilk's test to assess for normality. Independent t-tests were used to compare the differences in unselected and PPS-specific B cells within each group. Unpaired t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s Post Hoc test or Mann Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare means of cytokine levels and B cell subsets across 2 and 3 donor groups respectively depending on variable normality. Correlations were assessed using Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation test for normally and non-normally distributed data respectively. Data is presented as mean ± SEM and were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 and Graph Pad Prism 5 software. p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

                <p>Recent studies highlight the inverse correlation between chronic expression of pro-inflammatory markers and impaired vaccine response [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We assessed serum levels of pro-inflammatory markers previously reported to be elevated in HIV-positive individuals as potential prognostic markers of PPV23 response. Elevated serum levels of CRP (554,300 ± 107100 pg/ml vs 1,246,000 ± 142,600 pg/ml), sCD27 (27.70 ± 2.176 U/ml vs 51.18 ± 5.353 U/ml) and sCD30 (11.80 ± 1.800ng/ml vs 52.73 ± 14.12 ng/ml) were noted in HIV-positive individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150261.g001">Fig 1</xref>). IL-6 was similar between HIV-positive and negative volunteers (18.32 ± 3.866 pg/ml vs 11.68 ± 1.969 pg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0150261.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>We previously reported significantly diminished serological response to PPV23 in newly-diagnosed and long-term HAART-experienced HIV-positive adults compared to HIV-negative individuals. These findings suggested significant damage to critical PPS-responding B cell subsets early on during HIV-infection that failed to recover with HAART, regardless of CD4+ T cell reconstitution[<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistently, we noted significantly diminished percentages of PPS-specific IgM memory B cells in HIV-positive individuals which correlated with diminished OPT indicating its pivotal role in pneumococcal defense[<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our current studies, we further explored overall competence of total and PPS-responding B cells in HIV-positive and -negative volunteers by assessing receptors and cytokines speculated to be critical for PPS response. We grouped HAART-naive and HAART-experienced individuals as no significant differences were noted between them unless otherwise stated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0150261.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Additionally, no differences were noted in the expression of these molecules regardless of CD4 count (data not shown).</p>
              <p>Reports in the recent years view HIV-infection as an accelerated aging process. Inflammaging, defined as excessive and continued presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a common feature in elderly, in people with HIV and is associated with morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Increasing evidence links chronic inflammation with impaired vaccine responses in the elderly. High levels of serum TNF-α in the elderly was associated with impaired influenza vaccine response [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers including members of TNF-family have been reported in the serum of HIV-infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] although their relevance to pneumococcal vaccine response remains unknown. We tested pro-inflammatory markers previously reported to be elevated in the serum of HIV-positive patients [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as potential prognostic markers for PPV response. Consistently [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we noted significantly elevated levels of sCD27, sCD30 and CRP in HIV-positive volunteers. Normalization of sCD30 but not sCD27 and CRP in HAART-experienced individuals was consistent with literature [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Elevated levels of the tested serum markers did not correlate with quantitative and qualitative antibody levels indicating response to each vaccine is different and not always adversely influenced by generalized inflammatory status.</p>
              <p>To further probe mechanisms that may contribute towards diminished PPS-response in HIV-infected individuals, we investigated serum levels of TNF ligands and its receptors with speculative roles in TI-II responses. Serum levels of ligand BAFF was significantly higher in HIV-positive individuals and could be a result of B cell hyperactivation during HIV-disease [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Serum levels of BAFF receptor BCMA were similar but sTACI was significantly lower in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative individuals. TACI renders B cells responsive to BAFF and APRIL mediated signals promoting class switching and TI-II responses. Although we did not assess the serum levels of these molecules over time, it is possible that antigen recognition by BCR triggers surface TACI cleavage to a greater degree in HIV-negative individuals promoting downstream signals and Ig response.</p>
              <p>We evaluated surface expression of BAFF-R, BCMA, TACI, CD40 and CD21 in unselected (total) and PPS23F selected (antigen-specific) B cells to characterize the nature of cells that respond to PPS and identify potential anomalies in HIV-positive individuals. TACI and BAFF-R have implicated roles in TI-II responses [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. While BAFF-R is expressed throughout B cell development except in plasma cells, TACI upregulation is known to occur only after B cell activation [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In support of this concept, B cells in influenza vaccine recipients exhibit decreases in BAFF-R+ B cells and increases in TACI+ B cells concomitant with antibody response [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In line, we noted lower expression of BAFF-R and higher expression of TACI in PPS-selected cells compared to -unselected B cells. Our findings are in line with reports that suggest antibody-secreting cells lose BAFF-R expression [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>Surface TACI is particularly high in marginal zone (MZ) and B1 B cells [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], key B cell subsets in pneumococcal defense [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Consistently, loss of TACI impairs IgM response and survival in pneumococcus infected mice [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In humans, subsets of circulating CD27+IgM+ (IgM memory) B cells are viewed as splenic MZ B cells and B1 B cells with a defensive role against pneumococci [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0150261.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consistently, we noted higher expression of TACI in PPS-specific CD27+IgM+ B cells compared to unselected IgM memory and other PPS-specific subsets in both HIV-positive and -negative individuals. These findings in PPS-specific B cells are consistent with reports that suggest an upregulation of TACI in antibody forming cells, highlighting a potential role for TACI in pneumococcal defense [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, no differences in the surface levels of TACI were observed between HIV-positive and -negative volunteers.</p>
              <p>Analysis of unselected compartment revealed the presence of CD21<sup>lo</sup> IgM and switched memory B cells in HIV-positive, specifically HIV-viremic individuals consistent with literature [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Surprisingly however, CD21 expression on PPS-specific B cells were lower than unselected B cells and comparable between HIV-positive and negative volunteers. The levels of CD40 were lower on PPS-specific B cells as well compared to unselected B cells. Implications of reduced percentages of CD21 and CD40 on PPS-specific B cells remains unclear. A limitation of this study is that it’s a non randomized controlled trial.</p>
              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that directly characterizes phenotypic expression of speculated TI-II signals on PPS-specific B cells. Direct characterization of PPS-specific B cells is critical as it highlights the nature of cells that respond to antigens. Based on our findings, PPS-specific B cells in both HIV-positive and -negative volunteers downregulate BAFF-R expression and enhance the expression of TACI indicating a role for TACI in PPV response. This is consistent with studies where TACI-/- mice were impaired in pneumococcal defense [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, enhancing TACI expression on marginal zone (MZ) B cells by addition of CpG enhanced Ig secretion in murine studies [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In support of this concept, HIV-infected individuals receiving CpG along with pneumococcal vaccine showed enhanced Ig response in a placebo controlled trial, although mechanisms behind this effect were not investigated [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In our study, surface TACI expression was not dyregulated, but its serum levels were low in HIV-positive volunteers. It is possible that BCR recognition of antigens cleaves surface TACI from activated B cells to a greater extent in HIV-negative compared to HIV-positive individuals. Cleaving TACI could then potentially trigger robust downstream signaling and Ig secretion by mechanisms that needs further characterization. In support of this concept, ectodomain shedding of TACI from activated B cells by proteases belonging to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family was demonstrated in a recent study. The generated soluble form sTACI was analogous to its membrane form and bound ligands BAFF and APRIL [<xref rid="pone.0150261.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although sTACI was shown to have regulatory effects, its activation or Ig inducing function in our study cannot be dismissed given its well-established dual roles. How sTACI might impact vaccine response needs further understanding. Other receptors such as toll like receptors, could be defective in B cells of HIV-positive individuals leading to diminished PPV23 response and needs further elucidation. These studies are ongoing. Further investigation of PPS-specific B cells along with in-vitro stimulation studies may enlighten the mechanisms governing PPV23 response. In conclusion, our studies unravel the expression of TNFs and receptors speculated to be critical in PPV23 response in both healthy and high risk pneumococcal disease groups. Improved understanding of these cytokines, receptors and downstream signaling will be useful while considering the design of new robust pneumococcal vaccines.</p>

Lymphocytes were plotted (FSC-A, FSC-H) for doublet discrimination. Singlet lymphocytes were assessed for the expression of CD19+ B cells. B cells were plotted using 5-DTAF: PPS23F to identify PPS23F-selected vs. unselected cells. PPS-selected and unselected cells were further divided into sub-populations: naive (CD27−IgM+/-), class-switched memory (CD27+IgM−) and IgM memory (CD27+IgM+) B cells. Total (unselected), PPS23F-selected and respective memory and naïve B cell subsets were analyzed for the expression of BAFF-R as indicated.
