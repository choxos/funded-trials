              <title>1. Background</title>
              <p id="P5">Fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) consumption plays an important role in the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Americans aged 19–60 should consume 2.5–3 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruits daily according to the U.S. Dietary Guidelines [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, more than two-thirds of Americans do not consume this amount, and intake differs widely by demographics [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, cost-effective approaches to help large and diverse segments of the population eat more F&amp;V are needed.</p>
              <p id="P6">The Socioecological Model (SEM) suggests that health behaviors (including eating habits) are “a dynamic interaction between the individual and the environment.” [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Thus, establishing meaningful change in health behaviors involves multiple levels of influence including personal characteristics, interpersonal relationships, organizational factors, and physical environments [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P7">One advantageous setting for multi-level interventions is the workplace [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The American workforce includes over 158 million people working an average of 34.6 h per week [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The average worker spends 8.9 h or 37% of each weekday at the workplace [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, workplace environments provide access to a variety of demographic groups, including those at high risk for low F&amp;V intake [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The workplace also provides modifiable physical environments and pre-existing organizational structures that allow for the implementation and dissemination of behavioral modification strategies [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">A variety of workplace interventions to increase F&amp;V intake have been studied with varying levels of success [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These include behavioral/nutrition education interventions [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], increasing access to F&amp;V [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and multilevel interventions that combine environmental strategies with behavioral nutrition programs [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Systematic reviews of F&amp;V interventions at worksites have concluded that workplace health promotion efforts need to include both educational and environmental changes to have a significant impact on dietary behavior [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P9">Most environmental worksite interventions to increase F&amp;V intake have focused on changing cafeteria or vending offerings and/or making fresh fruit available at no cost to employees [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. No studies have evaluated the implementation of regular, mobile, fresh F&amp;V markets at worksites. Two studies have piloted the sale of F&amp;V at worksites, one through a farm stand and another through online ordering of produce baskets [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], though neither included rigorous evaluation methodologies. In addition, the current literature is missing studies that compare the effectiveness of mobile markets with or without nutrition education.</p>
              <p id="P10">The objective of this paper is to describe the “Good to Go” (GTG) cluster randomized trial, which is evaluating an innovative multi-level workplace intervention that includes a discount, mobile, fresh F&amp;V market alone or in combination with behavioral nutrition education strategies at worksites to determine which interventions are most effective at increasing employee F&amp;V consumption.</p>

                <title>2.1. Aims, study design and hypotheses</title>
                <p id="P11">The primary aim of the GTG study is to implement a cluster randomized trial in 21 worksites to assess the efficacy of interventions to increase F&amp;V intake. The study will compare the efficacy of delivering: discount, fresh F&amp;V markets (Access Only arm); versus delivering discount, fresh F&amp;V markets along with educational interventions (Access Plus); versus a comparison intervention to serve as an attention placebo (Comparison arm). GTG will compare the efficacy of the Access Only intervention with the Access Plus intervention and compare both of these interventions with the comparison Arm.</p>
                <p id="P12">Secondary aims include: 1) Implementing extensive process evaluation to determine costs, reach, fidelity, and dose response as well as the relationship of these variables with changes in F&amp;V intake; 2) Applying a mediating variable framework to examine relationships among important psychosocial factors/determinants with changes in F&amp;V consumption; and 3) Analyzing the cost effectiveness of the different intervention arms. The study's hypotheses are that employees in both the Access Only and Access Plus arms will increase F&amp;V intake significantly more than employees in the Comparison arm and that employees in the Access Plus Arm will increase F&amp;V intake significantly more than employees in the Access Only arm.</p>

                  <p id="P13">This three group study design will provide assessment of both the F&amp;V access intervention and the educational intervention without the expense of a larger, more resource-intensive two-by-two factorial design (access alone, access plus education, education alone, neither). We will not include an arm that receives an education intervention alone (without market access) for several reasons. Worksite-based nutrition education/promotion interventions to increase F&amp;V intake have been previously studied [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], but no research has been dedicated to the efficacy of a F&amp;V market intervention alone or in combination with educational strategies. Moreover, worksites have been most interested in the mobile market access intervention; the mobile market intervention is more innovative and more replicable due to its potential self-sustainability, and research is needed on whether mobile F&amp;V markets alone can increase F&amp;V intake or whether nutrition education needs to accompany the markets.</p>
                  <p id="P14">An attention placebo control (physical activity and stress reduction intervention) was chosen rather than a no-contact control group to match the attention received between groups, but also because it was not ethical or fair to require evaluation but provide no intervention to half the worksites in the study. This study is approved by the Brown University Institutional Review Board. Latest approval date is 01/11/2016. All study participants will consent to participate prior to involvement in the study.</p>

                <p id="P15">Eligible worksites within 60 miles of Providence will be recruited into the study through a variety of methods including personalized mailings of recruitment letters and brochures to worksite human resource directors followed by telephone contact as well as networking events, news and media coverage stories and press releases. Meetings will then be convened with interested human resource directors and/or other key administrators to discuss the study in more detail, and to provide a Memorandum of Agreement delineating the responsibilities of research staff and the participating worksite. We originally planned to recruit 24 worksites (8 per condition), but dropped our sample size slightly (7 sites in each condition = 21 sites) because of large budget cuts from the funder at the beginning of the funding period. See sample size calculations in Section 5.3.</p>

                <title>2.3. Eligibility criteria for worksites</title>
                <p id="P16">To be eligible for the study, a worksite will need to have at least 135 employees working at a single site (or combined with a second site nearby); at least 75% of the employees speak English (as the intervention materials are in English only); expect to be in operation for the next 12 months; agree to be randomized to any of the three experimental conditions and to complete all of the study's intervention components; and not have a recent or current worksite nutrition education program. All interested worksites that meet the eligibility criteria will be grouped with two other worksites, that are matched on size, employee demographics and type of worksite, i.e., hospital, manufacturing, financial, high-tech, etc.</p>

                <title>2.4. Recruitment of evaluation cohort</title>
                <p id="P17">A random sample of employees from each worksite will be recruited to participate in the evaluation cohort; however, the interventions are made available to all worksite employees. This conservative design will likely “underestimate” the effect of the interventions as all individuals in the evaluation cohort may not participate in all the interventions. However, this approach of evaluating across the entire worksite, not just with employees who choose to participate in the various intervention components, is the most scientifically rigorous design to assure external validity and for collection of valid cost data. Also evaluation of only those who participate in the interventions would be complicated, as participation will likely differ by intervention component. Moreover, employees who participate in all intervention components would likely have characteristics that may not be generalized to others, potentially introducing a selection bias. To estimate the effect of participation we will assess intervention dose of each component and of all components together on change in F&amp;V consumption. We also will conduct a cohort outcome evaluation rather than a cross-sectional evaluation to capture changes at the individual level among employees “exposed” for the entire intervention period. Also, cohort data has lower sampling variability than estimates of change from repeated cross-sectional surveys [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>
                <p id="P18">To recruit the evaluation cohort, all employees will be contacted to provide the opportunity to ‘opt out’. Each participating worksite will provide the team with a list of all permanent employees to generate personalized opt-out letters for each employee. Letters notifying employees of the study and giving instruction of how to opt-out of the evaluation will be then distributed to employees through normal worksite communication channels. After the letters are distributed, employees will have 10 days to have their name removed from consideration for the evaluation cohort by calling the 1–800 number, by emailing the research team, or by returning the opt-out letter to a locked, drop box at the worksite. During the ten-day opt-out period, project staff will conduct an informational, Kick-Off Event at the worksite where they will distribute popcorn and answer employee questions about the study.</p>
                <p id="P19">After the “opt-out” period, the study data manager randomly will assign the remaining list of employees into batches using a computer generated algorithm. A batch list of potential evaluation cohort employees will be then sent to the designated worksite representative to request contact information for each listed employee. Employees will then be contacted by the research team to complete a short survey of eligibility criteria.</p>
                <p id="P20">Employees found to be eligible and interested in participation will then proceed to the research consenting process and baseline survey. If the targeted number of participating employees (94 from each site) is not enrolled into the evaluation cohort through the first batch list, contact information for a second or third batch list will be obtained from the worksite representative by the aforementioned process. Employees in each batch will be contacted until a final disposition is reached (e.g. enrolled, ineligible, declined, bad contact information or the maximum number of call attempts were made). This method will avoid a sampling bias associated with assessing only the easiest employees to reach, but could result in slightly different cohort sizes for each work site. The baseline sample will be treated as a cohort and is contacted to be re-measured at six and twelve-months post baseline.</p>

                <title>3.1. Formative research and intervention development</title>
                <p id="P24">Formative qualitative research was conducted prior to intervention development to inform the creation of all intervention components. Nine focus groups were conducted at worksites similar to those that will be involved in the evaluation study. Worksites participating in the formative research represented a broad spectrum of worksite types. Focus group participant recruitment methods included flyers, posters, and email distributed by worksite liaisons, as well as face-to-face contact by project staff. Focus groups were held in conference rooms at the worksites. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to participation. At the beginning of the focus groups, participants completed a brief questionnaire about their demographic characteristics and F&amp;V-related habits.</p>
                <p id="P25">A total of 81 employees participated in nine focus groups, of which five were conducted with white collar employees and four were conducted with blue collar employees. Focus group participants averaged 44 years of age. Most were college graduates (53%) or had some college or post high school training (27%) or were high school graduates (12%). Most participants were married (59%) or single (30%). The majority of participants (79%) were born in the US; those born elsewhere averaged 22 years in the US. Most participants described themselves ethnically as non-Hispanic (89%); racially as white (79%), though several participants described themselves as Black (3.7%), Asian (2.6) or of mixed race (2.5%). Participants were employed mostly (96%) full time, worked mostly daytime shifts (98%) and had been at the company for an average of 10 years. They averaged 40 h of work per week being paid mostly hourly (52%) or on salary (38%), though some also participated in piece work (10%).</p>
                <p id="P26">The focus groups, lasting about 1 1/2 h, were led by a trained moderator and co-moderator using standard focus group procedures, and were recorded. Each participant received a $25 cash incentive at the completion of the focus group. Transcriptions of the recordings (without participant names) were summarized by the group moderators and team investigators. Findings from these focus groups were used by the research team to design the project logo/name, adapt and refine intervention materials and programs, develop promotional materials, determine potential incentives, and finalize evaluation measures. Focus group findings are summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The findings from the focus groups informed the content development for all the educational intervention components as well as the plans for the F&amp;V markets.</p>

                <title>3.2. Intervention theoretical framework</title>
                <p id="P27">All intervention components are guided by the SEM framework, which recognizes that behavior is affected by multiple levels of influence, so that interventions should be most efficacious when they target changes in intrapersonal, interpersonal (social), and environmental domains [<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>–<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. We expect that the Access intervention will improve the nutrition environment of the workplace by increasing F&amp;V availability and access. We expect that the educational/promotional intervention in the Access Plus arm will improve the social environment (social support, norms, reinforcement) at the workplace and will increase personal determinants such as skills, self-efficacy, knowledge, outcome expectations, and readiness to change, improve perceived norms, perceived social support, and F&amp;V taste perceptions, and decrease perceived barriers of employees. We expect that the Access Only intervention may also change some of these determinants. Moreover, the markets will improve the F&amp;V taste perceptions of the employees because the F&amp;V will be so fresh. In addition, lower F&amp;V costs at the markets may encourage employees to purchase and try new F&amp;V. See the intervention logic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P28">The theoretical framework for the educational intervention focuses mainly on the social cognitive theory (SCT) [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], which defines behavior as a triadic, dynamic, and reciprocal interaction of personal factors, behavior, and the environment [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Behavior change is facilitated if the individual believes change is possible, has an opportunity to develop and practice new skills, and receives support from the environment [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, the Access Plus intervention will specifically target changes in individual behavior as well as the availability of and access to F&amp;V.</p>
                <p id="P29">Vicarious learning will be employed as employees may try out new behaviors during food demonstrations. Coping models for potential challenges are also highlighted in the DVDs and newsletters. The educational intervention components also address outcome expectations (i.e. eating more F&amp;V will lead to positive outcomes like weight control and better health). The campaigns and self-help materials use goal setting and feedback, and other SCT-based self-regulation techniques such as self-monitoring and problem-solving around barriers. Additionally, barriers are addressed including those that constitute personal impediments (e.g. pressure from work, being tired, depressed, desire for more “tasty” things to eat) in the educational materials. Environmental challenges (e.g. cost, lack of access and availability of high quality F&amp;V, lack of social support and social norms) are addressed directly with the F&amp;V delivery intervention. External motivation is enhanced through the use of incentives for participation and reaching goals in campaigns, and internal motivation is encouraged through recommendations for self-reinforcement in the educational materials.</p>
                <p id="P30">Self-efficacy, or belief that a person can exert control over their behavior and over their social environment [<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] can be increased using role modeling, which is portrayed via success stories in newsletters and on the website, as well as employees seeing others purchasing F&amp;V. Social and moral standards are addressed using direct instruction, feedback from others, and role modeling by others as discussed above [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and the F&amp;V market intervention.</p>

All intervention components for the given experimental group are available to all employees of the worksite (including evaluation cohort participants) to use or participate in as much or as little as they decide. All materials are provided in English and will be developed by Brown staff and investigators. The details of the components for each intervention group are detailed below.</p>

                  <title>3.3.1. ‘Fresh to You’ (FTY) discount, fresh F&amp;V markets</title>
                  <p id="P32">The Access Only (n= 7) and the Access Plus (n = 7) intervention worksites receive weekly, discount, fresh F&amp;V markets for one year. These FTY markets are not local farmer's markets, but rather mobile markets selling both local and non-local produce on a year-round basis at prices at or below local supermarket prices [<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The best times and locations for the weekly markets are identified through a negotiation process with worksite contact personnel and market staff. The produce distributor brings between 50 and 70 different produce items, including staples (e.g., potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes and bananas); seasonal items (e.g. clementines in the winter and peaches and blueberries in the summer); and exotic produce (e.g. Asian pears and purple eggplant) to introduce new F&amp;V to employees.</p>
                  <p id="P33">The FTY Markets are held either indoors or outdoors depending on the weather and the preference of the worksite administrators. When held indoors, F&amp;V are arranged in boxes on the tables in a central location, usually a cafeteria or other highly trafficked area. In good weather, the markets are held outside in a designated area on the worksite property. Our produce distributor retrofitted a car trailer to serve as an outdoor, ‘mobile fresh F&amp;V market’. This retrofitted trailer is pulled by a van and brought weekly to each of the intervention group worksites at pre-determined days and times. The produce items are set up on racks affixed to three sides of the trailer and shoppers enter through the side and rear doors and exit through the rear door. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">3</xref> for market photos. A scale, cash register (accepting cash, debit/credit cards and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Electronic Benefit Transfer (SNAP-EBT) cards) and point of sale (POS) data collection system are set up on a table separate from the produce (for indoor markets) or outside of the rear door of the trailer (for outdoor markets). Each market lasts two hours and the produce is sold on average between 15 and 20% below retail supermarket prices.</p>
                  <p id="P34">Research staff, with the help of a graphic designer, created a logo for the FTY markets, which is included in all promotional materials. Signs, posters, email blasts and flyers are used to advertise the markets. The FTY Market intervention begins at each site with a highly-publicized ‘Kick-Off’ event at the first FTY market for each site. Each employee who attends the first market receives a large, reusable shopping bag with the ‘FTY’ logo on it. The bag also contains a freezer pack that can be used to keep the F&amp;V fresh during the work day until the employee goes home.</p>

At the Kickoff event, these employees receive the first month's newsletter and an educational DVD (see below) in addition to the reusable shopping bag and freezer pack. At these sites, a chef-run cooking demonstration/taste-testing (see below) is also presented at the Kick-Off event, along with recipes and information about the upcoming intervention activities.

                    <p id="P36">Two educational/motivational campaigns are conducted. The first campaign, ‘<italic>Just Add 2</italic>’, is held within the first six months at each worksite and the second campaign, entitled ‘<italic>Choose Color, Choose Health</italic>’, takes place after the six-month surveys are completed at each site. Both campaigns include full-color booklets with goal-setting activities, educational and motivational content, and F&amp;V trackers as inserts that ask participants to record the servings of F&amp;V they eat each week. Participants are instructed to read a section of the booklet each week and complete the activities in that section. At the end of the week, participants are asked to deposit their F&amp;V intake trackers into a raffle box kept at each worksite. A midpoint event and a final event are also held as part of the campaigns with chef-led cooking demonstrations and taste-testing events (see below). At these events, a staff member pulls several participant trackers out of the raffle box and distributes prizes (blenders, microwaves, woks, crock pots, etc.) to the winners. Approximately $500 in incentive prizes are given away at each site over the course of the intervention. The campaigns are designed to be ‘self-directed’; however, staff members attend the markets to answer any questions.</p>
                    <p id="P37">‘<italic>Just Add 2</italic>’, the first, six-week kick-off campaign, is designed to increase participants' F&amp;V consumption by two servings by the end of the campaign. Participants receive a full-color, campaign booklet, which includes: a description of the campaign; instructions; a table of recommended daily F&amp;V intake (in cups) by age, gender and activity level; a goal-setting form; the weekly F&amp;V tracker as well as motivational and informational, tips and interactive weekly activities. The weekly chapters and activities are: 1: Getting Started; 2: Cooking with Fruits &amp; Vegetables; 3: Fruits &amp; Vegetables when you're on the go; 4: Stocking your shopping cart with fruits &amp; vegetables; 5: Variety is the spice of life: Add some this week and 6: Staying on Track.</p>
                    <p id="P38">‘<italic>Choose Color, Choose Health</italic>’, the second, six-week campaign, is focused on increasing the variety of F&amp;V that participants eat by the end of the campaign. Campaign participants receive a colorful campaign booklet that includes a F&amp;V tracker, a laminated information sheet that includes the health benefits of each F&amp;V color group, as well as educational and motivational content for each of the six weeks. Each weekfocuses on a specific F&amp;V color. The weekly chapters are: 1. Record your baseline colors; 2. Green F&amp;V; 3. Red F&amp;V; 4. White and Brown F&amp;V; 5. Yellow and Orange F&amp;V; and 6. Blue and Purple F&amp;V. Each weekly section includes a daily chart where participants record how many F&amp;V of that color they eat each day of the week. Each section also includes tips for how to eat more of that color F&amp;V during the week and the associated health benefits of those F&amp;V. Then, at the end of the week, participants are instructed to add up the numbers in this chart and write the total number on the weekly F&amp;V tracker, which they can deposit into the raffle box for prize drawings as above.</p>

                      <p id="P47">The ‘<italic>Take 10!</italic>’ campaign is delivered during the first six months and aims to increase participants' daily physical activity by 10 min per day until they reach the goal of at least 30–60 min per day. Participants are given a campaign booklet with six weekly sections focused on a particular goal and includes: educational and motivational content, a goal setting and action step form, tips and suggestions for how to achieve that goal and the benefits associated with reaching the goal. The focus areas for each week are: 1. Move More, Sit Less; 2. Strength Training; 3. Increase Flexibility; 4. Walk More; 5. Add Intensity; and 6. Make Simple Changes.</p>
                      <p id="P48">Each week, participants are encouraged to read through that week's section of the booklet, review their weekly goals and do the activities included in that week's ‘Action Plan’ along with the bonus point activity. At the end of each day, participants are asked to write down the total number of minutes they spent being physically active on the activity tracking sheet. Then, at the end of each week, they are asked to fill out the weekly raffle form and return it in order to earn points toward the incentive prizes. For every ten points earned, participants receive a raffle ticket that will be entered into a drawing at the midpoint and final events when prizes are given to participants. Approximately $500 in incentive prizes are given away at each site.</p>

                      <p id="P49">The ‘<italic>Stress Less</italic>’ campaign is delivered in the second six months and aims to help participants reduce the amount of stress that they experience by adding stress reduction activities into their daily routines. Campaign participants are given a booklet that includes six weekly sections focused on a particular stress reduction technique. Each section includes: educational and motivational content, a goal setting and action step form, tips and suggestions for how to achieve that goal and the benefits associated with reaching the goal. The focus areas for each week are: 1. Muscle Relaxation and Tension Release; 2. Visualization; 3. Adequate Sleep; 4. Mindfulness and Meditation; 5. Time Management for Stress Reduction; and 6. Music for Relaxation. Each time the participants try one of the recommendations, they record it on their activity tracking sheet along with how they feel about the techniques. Then, at the end of the week, participants are asked to submit forms indicating activities they tried. Points are attributed to each activity recorded and raffle tickets are given to employees based on the points they earn. These tickets are drawn for incentive prizes at the midpoint and final events with approximately $500 in prizes given away at each site.</p>

                <p id="P50">For the Access Only intervention, detailed FTY market sales data, including total sales, number of shoppers, items purchased and tender types are captured by the FTY POS cashiering system. For the Access Plus intervention, research staff record the number of participants who participate in the kick off events, campaigns, and taste-testing events. Project staff also keep records of the number and type of educational materials (newsletters, food demo handouts/recipes, campaign materials, DVDs, etc.) distributed to employees as well as those materials that are picked up at intervention activities. We also assess actual use of the web site including number of hits; hits/use of various parts of the website; and number and types of materials downloaded.</p>
                <p id="P51">The six and twelve month surveys include questions about participation in each component of the intervention including frequency of shopping at the FTY markets; perceptions of prices, quality and availability of F&amp;V; participation in, or reasons for not participating in, each campaign; helpfulness of each campaign; participation in, and usefulness of, the cooking demonstration and taste testing events; and the use and usefulness of the recipes, newsletters, DVDs and website. These surveys also include open-ended questions that ask participants about what they learned and the behavioral changes that they made as a result of the intervention as well as suggestions for how the intervention could be improved.</p>

                <p id="P52">We will estimate the costs that would be necessary to replicate the intervention delivery as well as cost-effectiveness. Measures of cost include only the costs related to intervention delivery, not the costs related to intervention development or evaluation/research. Component costs include research staff time to promote and deliver the intervention, and the direct costs for the intervention components themselves. For the F&amp;V delivery intervention we measure the direct costs of bringing the markets to worksites including staffing, transportation, insurance, shrinkage (F&amp;V loss), bags and signage, etc.. We also include direct costs for the educational interventions: staffing, reproduction of the DVDs, newsletters, campaign booklets and other printed materials; campaign prizes; food demonstrations; promotional materials; website hosting costs, etc. For each intervention arm we will determine costs per participant as well as costs per worksite.</p>

                <title>4.3. Context</title>
                <p id="P53">To measure context, we use key informant interviews. Interviews of key worksite gatekeepers including the CEO and the human resources director are conducted at baseline and twelve months at all study worksites. All of these interviews are audiotaped, with consent for research, taping, and later use of audio footage for research purposes obtained from all participants. These interviews provide us with data on organizational factors that may influence implementation of the proposed intervention or influence employee outcomes. These interviews also provide data to monitor organizational changes in policies, procedures and/or norms that could be related to F&amp;V access and availability. The follow-up interviews also help us to gain a better understanding of the perceptions of these worksite gatekeepers to the overall intervention and key intervention components, perceived changes attributable to the program, and provide process evaluation context data on barriers/impediments/facilitators to implementation, and opportunities for sustainability of the program. These data will be helpful for future dissemination purposes as well. The majority of the interview responses are in survey format so will be analyzed in a similar manner to other surveys. However, answers to open-ended questions will be transcribed and coded similar to the focus group data.</p>

                <title>5.1. Survey methods and measures</title>
                <p id="P54">The baseline, six and twelve month surveys are created and programmed in DatStat Illume software, a tool that allows for secure, web-based data collection. Participants with active email addresses are invited to take the survey online via an email that includes a link to a self-administered survey. If they do not complete the online survey within seven days, participants are then contacted by phone and invited to complete a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) survey. Employees without active email addresses are also contacted by phone to take the CATI survey. The primary outcome is F&amp;V intake, which is measured using several validated instruments. We will analyze changes in fruit intake alone, vegetable intake alone, and F&amp;V together; specifically, we will look at fruit and F&amp;V measures without juice and vegetable and F&amp;V measures without French fries. Outcome measures, demographic questions and measures of potential mediating variables are described in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

                <title>5.2. Data analysis</title>
                <p id="P55">To evaluate potential differences between groups that may have occurred by chance in the random assignment process, demographics will be assessed by group using chi squared tests for categorical data and analysis of variance for continuous data. Also, group differences in baseline values for outcomes and mediators will be assessed using ANOVA models. To assess demographic differences in baseline F&amp;V intake and mediators, ANOVA models will be constructed to assess outcomes and mediator variables (dependent variables) by demographic categories (independent variables). To examine F&amp;V intake, mixed-model analysis of variance using SAS PROC MIXED will be used to account for a potential cluster effect within each worksite. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).</p>
                <p id="P56">Cost-effectiveness will be calculated looking at costs related to mean change in F&amp;V intake as measured by the F&amp;V screener between baseline and twelve months. We will look at this both at the participant and worksite levels. Costs will be calculated as described above. We will then divide the cost per participant by the mean F&amp;V change per participant to calculate cost per unit change in F&amp;V intake for each of the three interventions. We will also divide the cost per worksite by the mean F&amp;V change per worksite to calculate cost per unit change in F&amp;V intake for each of the three interventions at the worksite level. Cost effectiveness will then be compared by intervention condition. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated and compared by intervention group.</p>

                <title>5.3. Sample size considerations</title>
                <p id="P57">The sample size calculation is based on the simple pre-post design with 2 time points that uses the estimated variance that one would obtain from a repeated measures regression model. Our effect size is estimated as the difference in the change scores between the Access Only group and Access Plus group, i.e., Δ = (F&amp;V Screener<sub>Post</sub>-F&amp;V Screener<sub>Pre</sub>)<sub>Access Plus</sub> – (F&amp;V Screener<sub>Post</sub>-F&amp;V Screener<sub>Pre</sub>)<sub>Access</sub>, using Murray [<xref rid="R102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] as a reference for power calculations that account for clustering. Using reasonable estimates of the ICC (0.01) and S.D. (2.5) based on previous worksite studies, and with 80% power, the sample size projections show that with 75 participants in each worksite and 7 sites per experimental condition, we will be able to detect a difference of 0.62 cups of F&amp;V using the NCI screener. We anticipate this effect size to be the smallest incremental change between the Access Plus intervention and the Access Only intervention. The effect size between these intervention groups and the Comparison group is expected to be even higher.</p>
                <p id="P58">Since 75 participants is the number of participants who need to complete the 12-month follow-up, and we assume that approximately 20% of participants will be lost to follow-up between baseline and twelve months, we plan to enroll 94 participants at each worksite into the evaluation cohort.</p>

              <title>6. Discussion</title>
              <p id="P59">Good to Go is the first study to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of a discount, mobile F&amp;V market at worksites on employee F&amp;V intake. Moreover, it is one of the few studies examining the efficacy of a F&amp;V access intervention with and without an educational/behavioral intervention. Additionally, no other published studies have examined the efficacy of F&amp;V market interventions in rigorous cluster randomized trials in any setting. This study will also fill other research gaps identified in the literature for worksite based nutrition interventions [<xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>–<xref rid="R106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] including a rigorous cluster-randomized design with well-matched comparison groups; addressing cost as a barrier; and clearly linking behavioral theory constructs with intervention components. We will also use mixed methods to examine not only what changes using quantitative measures, but also ‘how’ and ‘why’ these changes take place by identifying mediators of F&amp;V change and using qualitative measures (i.e. key informant interviews) to better evaluate reasons for success or failure of the intervention, which few other studies have done. We will also be conducting detailed process evaluation including assessing cost-effectiveness, which will fill important research gaps.</p>
              <p id="P60">Other strengths of the study include the large number of worksites of varying types, which increases the potential generalizability of the results. The variety in worksite types and the recruitment methods used will also likely result in recruitment of a broad spectrum of employees representing very different job types. Lastly, the Good to Go intervention covers several levels of the socioecological model.</p>
              <p id="P61">One limitation of the study is that our research design will be unable to differentiate the effects of the educational/promotional intervention separately because we did not use a factorial design. However, we will be able to estimate the efficacy of this intervention alone by subtracting the effect of the Access Only intervention from the effect of the Access Plus intervention. Another limitation is that our research design will be unable to differentiate the effects of the specific educational interventions (campaigns, website, food demonstrations, newsletter, and self-help program) in the Access Plus intervention. While our research design will not allow for specific effect sizes to be calculated for each specific intervention component, our process evaluation will allow us to examine reach, dose and participant satisfaction for each intervention component and the relationship between dose and F&amp;V change. If the educational interventions are shown to enhance the environmental access intervention, future implementation deconstruction research could decipher the incremental effects of each educational component.</p>
              <p id="P62">Another potential limitation is that we will be measuring the efficacy of the interventions at the worksite level by evaluating a random sample of employees who may or may not have participated in the interventions, which may limit the effect size observed. We feel that this type of evaluation is most appropriate for examining the efficacy of a worksite-wide intervention. Only measuring the efficacy of the intervention in those employees who participated fully would not provide much external validity. With our extensive process evaluation, we will be able to examine whether F&amp;V consumption increases with intervention dose, and we will describe the employees that participated compared with those that did not to define characteristics of employees who may be targeted to increase participation.</p>
              <p id="P63">The FTY discount mobile markets are an innovative environmental intervention providing access and availability to F&amp;V at the worksite. Such markets have the potential to be highly sustainable and replicable if found to be efficacious, cost effective and financially viable for the produce distributor. As such markets are becoming more numerous in the community, it is important to know whether they can improve dietary habits alone or whether accompanying educational interventions are also necessary. Thus, the Good to Go study will provide an important contribution to public health research and practice.</p>
