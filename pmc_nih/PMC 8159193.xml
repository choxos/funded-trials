                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Evidence suggests a role for excessive inflammation in COVID-19 complications. Colchicine is an oral anti-inflammatory medication beneficial in gout, pericarditis, and coronary disease. We aimed to investigate the effect of colchicine on the composite of COVID-19-related death or hospital admission.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The present study is a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, adaptive, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. The study was done in Brazil, Canada, Greece, South Africa, Spain, and the USA, and was led by the Montreal Heart Institute. Patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by PCR testing or clinical criteria who were not being treated in hospital were eligible if they were at least 40 years old and had at least one high-risk characteristic. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician, and masked randomisation was centralised and done electronically through an automated interactive web-response system. The allocation sequence was unstratified and used a 1:1 ratio with a blocking schema and block sizes of six. Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally administered colchicine (0¬∑5 mg twice per day for 3 days and then once per day for 27 days thereafter) or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death or hospital admission for COVID-19. Vital status at the end of the study was available for 97¬∑9% of patients. The analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The COLCORONA trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04322682" id="interrefs20">NCT04322682</ext-link>) and is now closed to new participants.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Trial enrolment began in March 23, 2020, and was completed in Dec 22, 2020. A total of 4488 patients (53¬∑9% women; median age 54¬∑0 years, IQR 47¬∑0‚Äì61¬∑0) were enrolled and 2235 patients were randomly assigned to colchicine and 2253 to placebo. The primary endpoint occurred in 104 (4¬∑7%) of 2235 patients in the colchicine group and 131 (5¬∑8%) of 2253 patients in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0¬∑79, 95¬∑1% CI 0¬∑61‚Äì1¬∑03; p=0¬∑081). Among the 4159 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, the primary endpoint occurred in 96 (4¬∑6%) of 2075 patients in the colchicine group and 126 (6¬∑0%) of 2084 patients in the placebo group (OR 0¬∑75, 0¬∑57‚Äì0¬∑99; p=0¬∑042). Serious adverse events were reported in 108 (4¬∑9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 139 (6¬∑3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0¬∑051); pneumonia occurred in 63 (2¬∑9%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 92 (4¬∑1%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p=0¬∑021). Diarrhoea was reported in 300 (13¬∑7%) of 2195 patients in the colchicine group and 161 (7¬∑3%) of 2217 patients in the placebo group (p&lt;0¬∑0001).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>In community-treated patients including those without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo. Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, this safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of PCR-positive community-treated patients is recommended.</p>

                  <p id="para50">We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane central to identify studies investigating the role of the host inflammatory response in COVID-19 complications and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-inflammatory agents aimed at preventing this response, from inception until April 12, 2021. To maximise sensitivity, we also searched for citations in Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Search terms included ‚ÄúCOVID-19‚Äù, ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù, ‚Äúinflammation‚Äù, ‚Äúinflammatory storm‚Äù, ‚Äúcytokine‚Äù, ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù, ‚Äúanti-inflammatory agents‚Äù, and ‚Äúcolchicine‚Äù, either separately or in combination. The inhaled steroid budesonide was shown in the open-label STOIC trial to reduce the requirement for urgent medical care in patients with early COVID-19. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2 was observed in lung tissues of patients with COVID-19.

                  <p id="para70">Potential clinical benefits of colchicine have been reported in observational studies and two small RCTs (including GRECCO) of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. In our COLCORONA double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of 4488 non-hospitalised patients, including the 327 (7%) without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among the 4159 (93%) of patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Given the absence of orally administered therapies to prevent COVID-19 complications in community-treated patients, the burden on health-care systems caused by hospital admissions, and the benefit of colchicine in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, we propose that colchicine is a safe and inexpensive anti-inflammatory agent that could be considered for use in those at risk of complications. Notwithstanding these considerations, replication in other studies of patients who have positive PCR tests and have been treated in the community (such as the PRINCIPLE trial) is recommended. Additional trials such as the AGILE-ACCORD might enrich our therapeutic armamentarium to prevent COVID-19-related complications in ambulatory patients.</p>

The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made by local laboratories using PCR testing on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen. Given the restrictions in laboratory testing early in the pandemic, a diagnosis was also accepted as an epidemiological link with a household member who had a positive nasopharyngeal test result for patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, or by a clinical algorithm in a symptomatic patient without an obvious alternative cause, as per official guidelines (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>).<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Women were either not of childbearing potential or practicing adequate contraception.</p>

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either colchicine treatment or placebo, using an allocation sequence that was computer-generated using a blocking schema with block sizes of six. Allocation sequence was not stratified. Eligible patients were randomly assigned by research nurses through the IWRS system that provided the bottle number to send to patients. The randomisation list was computer-generated by an unmasked biostatistician and uploaded to an interactive web response system (Dacima). The database was a validated electronic-data-capture system (eCRF) using InForm 6.0 provided by Oracle. The eCRF was developed by the MHICC as per their internal standard-operating procedures. All eCRF users were trained as per completion guidelines and the data entry was done directly by the study staff during phone calls with the patients. The data cleaning activities were done as per the MHICC data-management plan. All staff involved, including study investigators, nurses, and patients were masked to the treatment received.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para200">Assuming a primary endpoint event rate of 7% in the placebo group, we estimated that a sample size of approximately 6000 patients randomly allocated to treatment with 3000 patients in each treatment group would be required to detect a target 25% relative-risk reduction with colchicine (corresponding to a primary endpoint event rate of 5¬∑25% with colchicine, for an absolute difference of 1¬∑75%) with a power of 80% and a two-sided test at the 0¬∑05 significance level. Because the efficacy interim analyses were done with the conservative O'Brien-Fleming approach, their impact on final significance was deemed to be minimal and no sample-size adjustment was done for interim analyses.</p>
                <p id="para210">Efficacy analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The primary endpoint was compared between the two treatment groups using a œá<sup>2</sup> test, and the odds ratio (OR) along with the 95¬∑1% CI was provided. Secondary endpoints were analysed similarly. Because of potential limitations to the specificity of COVID-19 diagnosis made on clinical or epidemiological criteria alone, a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint examined patients who were enrolled based on a positive PCR test. Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were done using logistic-regression models including the treatment group, the subgroup factor, and the treatment x subgroup-factor interaction. Investigation of secondary endpoints in subgroups were done as post-hoc analyses. A pre-specified sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was done by imputing a primary event in event-free patients who did not complete the study (ie, discontinued before day 30 or for whom no information was available at end of study).</p>
                <p id="para220">Three formal interim efficacy analyses on the primary endpoint were planned after 25%, 50%, and 75% of the primary endpoint events had occurred. The prespecified stopping rule for efficacy was based on the Lan-DeMets procedure with the O'Brien-Fleming Œ±-spending function to determine the significance level. Futility was assessed by computing the conditional power under the original alternative and judged at 15%. Results of the interim analyses were generated by an unmasked biostatistician and were provided only to the data-safety monitoring board members. During the entire duration of the trial, the study team, including the biostatisticians who wrote the statistical analysis plan and generated the final results, remained masked to treatment allocation.</p>
                <p id="para230">Following its review of the first two interim results, the monitoring board recommended that the trial should continue as planned (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). On Dec 11, 2020, the steering committee chairman informed the data-safety monitoring board that the investigators had decided to terminate the study once 75% of the planned patients were recruited and had completed the 30 day follow-up. This decision was made due to substantial logistical, personnel, and budgetary issues related to maintaining the central study call centre active 24 h per day for a prolonged period of time, which were compounded by the inability to reliably model the additional time required to reach the target number of patients through the successive waves of the pandemic. To account for the two interim analyses that were done, the final statistical significance level was calculated as 0¬∑049 for the final analysis of the primary endpoint. No other statistical adjustment for bias was made. All other statistical tests were two-sided and done at the 0¬∑05 significance level.</p>
                <p id="para240">Statistical analyses were done using SAS version 9.4. There was no prespecified plan to adjust for multiple comparisons across the multiple methods used to analyse the primary outcome and secondary endpoints; results of these analyses are reported with point estimates and 95% CI, without p values. 95% CIs are not adjusted for multiple comparisons, and inferences drawn from them might not be reproducible.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para340">In COLCORONA, the risk of the primary composite efficacy endpoint of death or hospital admission due to COVID-19 infection in the 30 days following randomisation was not statistically significantly lower among the patients who were randomly assigned to receive colchicine than in those who received placebo.</p>
              <p id="para350">Because of the shortage of reagents for PCR tests and the restriction in the use of such testing early in the pandemic, diagnosis of probable COVID-19 through an epidemiological link or compatible symptoms was initially allowed in the study. These patients had a primary event rate that was half (3%) that observed in those with confirmed diagnosis by PCR testing (6%).</p>
              <p id="para360">When the patients who had a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are considered, the benefit of colchicine on the primary-efficacy endpoint was more marked and statistically significant. The relative-risk reduction that we observed was similar to the one planned in the sample-size calculation. Treatment with colchicine was associated with concordant effects on hospital admissions, use of mechanical ventilation, and deaths in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by PCR testing.</p>
              <p id="para370">The effect of colchicine on the primary endpoint was consistent across subgroups of patients on the basis of various clinical characteristics. Although the benefits of colchicine appeared to be more marked in patients with diabetes and men, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity in the results. Because the event rates were higher in patients with these characteristics, the effect of colchicine might have been more readily detectable. Diabetes is a pro-inflammatory state, which might explain the greater risk of complications of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes than in those without. Despite the link between weight, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, the effects of colchicine did not differ whether the body-mass index was higher or lower than 30 kg per m<sup>2</sup>. Sex-related differences in immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 exist. Men have higher plasma concentrations of IL-18 and IL-8, whereas women have stronger T-cell activation.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These differences might at least in part explain the apparent difference in response to colchicine in COVID-19. Of note, the concomitant use of an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system did not appear to modify the clinical response to colchicine.</p>
              <p id="para380">The most common adverse events that we observed were gastrointestinal. Diarrhoea was reported by 13¬∑7% of patients in the colchicine group and 7¬∑3% in the placebo group. Dehydration was reported in three (0¬∑1%) patients in the colchicine group and six (0¬∑3%) patients in the placebo group. Deleterious effects of COVID-19 are numerous and can affect among others the lungs, heart, and brain. The seriousness of the disease is reflected by the high incidence of serious adverse events in patients of the placebo group in the COLCORONA trial. The number of patients with any serious adverse event was smaller in the colchicine group than in the placebo group, which might reflect the benefits of systemic-inflammation reduction in this disease. Pneumonia was reported less frequently in patients of the colchicine group than those of the placebo group. This is concordant with the statistically significant reduction of hospital admissions in patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with colchicine, and the numerically lower number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, although this was not significant. Our results are supported by the results of two smaller clinical trials showing reductions in the need for oxygen supplementation, the duration of hospital treatment, and the deterioration of clinical status.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Colchicine has previously been shown to reduce acute lung injury in an experimental model of acute respiratory-distress syndrome.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The risk of viral inflammatory pneumonitis therefore appears to be lowered by colchicine in patients with COVID-19. Reassuringly, there was no evidence of an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia in COLCORONA.</p>
              <p id="para390">The number of reported cases of pulmonary embolism was higher in patients of the colchicine group than in patients in the placebo group in COLCORONA. The 13 cases of pulmonary embolism were included in the analysis of the primary composite endpoint as hospital admissions due to COVID-19. Despite this apparent imbalance, the numbers of hospital admissions, use of mechanical ventilation, and deaths were numerically lower in the colchicine group than in the placebo group. Additionally, the pulmonary emboli did not lead to the need for mechanical ventilation or to death in these 13 patients. By contrast, there was no imbalance in other reported thrombotic or embolic events such as deep venous thrombosis or myocardial infarction. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials involving more than 10‚Äà000 patients with coronary disease followed for approximately 2 years has not shown a statistically significant difference in the rate of pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis between the colchicine and placebo groups.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> In addition, a significant reduction in the concentration of D dimer, a plasma biomarker used for the diagnostic investigation of pulmonary embolism, was observed with colchicine compared with the control in the GRECCO study.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Furthermore, colchicine has previously been shown in murine models to lower the release of Œ± defensin associated with large thrombus burdens and in clinical studies to reduce the aggregation between neutrophils and platelets.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Thus, there is no known potential biological basis to suggest a causal link between colchicine therapy and thromboembolic disease. The incidence of pulmonary embolism is high in COVID-19, and occurs in up to 25% of patients with associated pneumonia.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> More than 57% of patients dying from COVID-19 have evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus at autopsy.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In COLCORONA, the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients requiring hospital admission was 11 (10¬∑9%) of 101 patients in the colchicine group and two (1¬∑6%) of 128 in the placebo group. The totality of the evidence suggests that the low rate of pulmonary embolisms in the placebo group represents an anomaly. The more common presence and greater severity of COVID-19 pneumonia infiltrates in patients receiving placebo might have reduced the clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism in symptomatic patients.</p>
              <p id="para400">Our trial has certain limitations. The study was stopped when 75% of the planned patients were recruited and had completed the 30 day follow-up. We nevertheless believe that our results are clinically persuasive. The duration of follow-up was relatively short at approximately 30 days. We did not investigate the evolution of persistent COVID-19 symptoms and the effects of longer-term treatment with colchicine. The benefit of a shorter course of colchicine therapy for less than 30 days is also not entirely known, although the results of two smaller trials showed benefits of treatment administered for 10‚Äì21 days.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Finally, our results apply to patients who have a proven diagnosis of COVID-19, are at risk of clinical complications, and are not admitted to hospital at the time of treatment initiation. The number needed to treat with colchicine to prevent one primary endpoint event was 70 (95% CI 36‚Äì1842) for patients with PCR-proven COVID-19, 29 (14 to not defined) for those with diabetes, 31 (11 to not defined) for patients aged 70 years and older, 39 (21‚Äì259) in men, 52 (21 to not defined) in patients with respiratory disease, and 25 (10 to not defined) in those with cardiovascular disease.</p>
              <p id="para410">In conclusion, in community-treated patients including those without a mandatory diagnostic test, the effect of colchicine on COVID-19-related clinical events was not statistically significant. Among patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, colchicine led to a lower rate of the composite of death or hospital admission than placebo.</p>
