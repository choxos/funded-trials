                <p id="Par1">Observing successful pain treatment in others can induce anticipatory neural processes that, in turn, relieve pain. Previous studies have suggested that social learning and observation influence placebo hypoalgesia. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to determine the neurophysiological changes associated with pain relief acquired through the observation. Thirty-one participants observed a demonstrator undergo painful heat stimulations paired with a “control” cream and non-painful ones paired with a “treatment” cream, which actually were both Vanicreams. After their observation, the participants then received the same creams and stimulations. We found that the treatment cream led to lower self-reported pain intensity ratings than the control cream. Anticipatory treatment cues elicited smaller P2 in electrodes F1, Fz, FC1, and FCz than the control condition. The P2 component localization indicated a higher current density in the right middle frontal gyrus, a region associated with attentional engagement. In placebo responders, the sensorimotor cortex activity captured in electrodes C3, Cz, and C4 indicated that hypoalgesia was positively correlated with resting state peak alpha frequency (PAF). These results suggest that observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia may be driven by anticipatory mechanisms that modulate frontal attentional processes. Furthermore, resting state PAF could serve as a predictor of observationally-induced hypoalgesia.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Research on placebo hypoalgesia has gained momentum in the last decade as healthcare professionals have begun to unravel how context, rather than the specific actions of a drug, can lead to beneficial outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Among the mechanisms that drive placebo hypoalgesia, expectancy plays a crucial role. Anticipation of pain relief from a treatment reduces self-reported pain intensity. Placebo hypoalgesia can be acquired in several ways, including classical conditioning, where the patient associates pain relief with a specific medication, verbal instructions, where the health provider tells the patient that a specific drug will reduce pain, and observational learning, where the patient observes pain relief in another patient while they receive the same medication (for a review, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>).</p>
              <p id="Par3">The ability of observation to generate treatment expectancies with an aim to alter pain perception is a fruitful area of study. Observation is a powerful way to gain information and change behaviors, accordingly. Bandura termed this process “observational learning”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. At the behavioral level, observation as well as classical conditioning and verbal suggestion have been found to influence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or mediate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par4">An advantage of electroencephalography (EEG) is the ability to record temporal dynamics of neural processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Recently, resting state peak alpha frequency (PAF) has been associated with cortical excitability rate, which influences how information is processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and can potentially predict pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Studies exploring painful contact-heat stimulations have identified a late event-related potential (ERP) approximately 250–350 ms after the onset of a painful stimulation in the vertex region of the brain (e.g., electrodes Cz). This component was coined as P2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Previous studies on ERP and placebo hypoalgesia have demonstrated that placebo manipulations reduced the amplitude of pain-stimulation-induced P2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Although anticipation of pain was thought to play a key role in shaping hypoalgesia, as far as we know, none of the previous studies examined the ERP response during the anticipation phase. A recent Magnetoencelography (MEG) study has demonstrated that, in sensors located in the frontal central brain areas, an anticipatory visual cue associated with low pain induced a smaller P2 event-related field (ERF) component compared to a higher pain anticipatory cue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Given the importance of anticipation, our study aimed to understand how and when the brain responds to observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia. To achieve this, 31 healthy study participants (19 women) completed an observation and an experience phase while undergoing EEG acquisitions. During the observation phase, volunteers saw pictures of a demonstrator experiencing heat pain on his left forearm. The demonstrator had two colored creams (green and blue, randomized) applied that were described as treatment and control. Participants were instructed that one of the two creams had analgesic properties but were not told which one was the control and the active treatment. This distinction was acquired throughout the observational phase. During heat stimulations, the demonstrator showed a pained facial expression for the control cue and neutral facial expression for the treatment cue. During the experience phase, the same creams were applied to the participants, and they received identical levels of heat during both of the cues. Their pain ratings after each cue were recorded to determine how the anticipatory cues would modulate their pain. In line with previous result<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia would be associated during anticipatory phase with reduced frontal lobe neural activity, such as the P2 component of the evoked potentials.</p>

                <title>Participants characteristics</title>
                <p id="Par6">In this cohort of 31 healthy participants, we found no significant effects of sex (F<sub>1,26</sub> = 0.69, p = 0.413), age (r = −0.23, p = 0.290) and race (F<sub>1,25</sub> = 0.22, p = 0.804) on observationally-induced hypoalgesia (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Also, as the same demonstrator (a White male) was presented throughout the observation phase, participants completed the Implicit Association Test (IAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> to determine their racial preferences. The IAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> measured differential associations of White vs. African American/Asian with good vs. bad attributes. The IAT D score was calculated as an index of each participant’s racial attitude. We tested for the possible influences of racial preference in observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia and found no significant relationship between the IAT D score and observationally-induced hypoalgesia (r = 0.04, p = 0.829), suggesting that racial preferences did not influence observationally-induced hypoalgesia.

              <p id="Par21">In this study, we sought to explore the neurophysiological correlates of observationally-induced hypoalgesia. Behaviorally, we observed that participants reported significantly lower pain ratings in response to a treatment cue compared to a control cue. This behavioral difference was induced by observing other people experiencing pain relief under similar experimental conditions. In terms of ERP results, we found that treatment anticipatory cues elicited smaller P2 components than control cues. More importantly, smaller P2 amplitudes elicited by treatment anticipatory cues were associated with larger observationally-induced hypoalgesia. Placebo responders and non-responders displayed distinct patterns in terms of the associations between observationally-induced hypoalgesia and resting state PAF. No EEG changes were detected in the test-phase despite the behavioral significant hypoalgesia suggesting that the heat model and the EEG techniques we used may not be specific and sensitive enough to detect these changes.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Colloca and Benedetti<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> were the first to report a modulation of placebo hypoalgesia induced by observing a therapeutic treatment in a demonstrator. In line with this pioneering study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we replicated the evidence that individuals reported pain reductions simply after observing beneficial treatment outcomes in others. Observationally-induced hypoalgesia was independent of the color of the creams (green versus blue), the order of the anticipatory cues, or the site of thermode (upper versus lower left ventral forearm). Additionally, we found the magnitude of pain reduction remained comparable in sessions 1 and 2, meaning that the observationally-induced hypoalgesia did not decrease, even at the end of 80 pain stimulations. These results align with previous research on video observation and placebo hypoalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, individual differences in pain threshold and pain tolerance did not influence the magnitude of observationally-induced hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par23">At the level of neurophysiological measurements, during the test phase, the anticipatory treatment cue elicited a significantly smaller P2 component than control cue at approximately 200 ms to 400 ms after the cue onset, and this P2 was maximal in the electrodes located in the frontal-central area of the brain. The visual-stimuli-induced P2, which has been found to be larger for threatening images compared to neutral ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, is considered to reflect early attentional processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This implies that the participants showed reduced attentional engagement in the early processing of anticipatory treatment cues than control cues. Similar to our findings, a recent MEG study showed that an anticipatory cue for lower pain elicited smaller event-related field (ERF) P2 component than higher pain anticipatory cues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">We further explored the potential sources of the observed P2 component using sLORETA. The source localization results indicated the control anticipatory cues tended to show a higher current density than the treatment cues in right middle frontal gyrus (MFG, coordinates: X = 25, Y = 0, Z = 50), a region which has already been found as one of the sources of P2 component in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Activation of right MFG regions has been associated with attentional processing in cognitive tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and is connected to attentional networks during resting state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This evidence highlights our results, in which attentional engagement was reduced at early stages of processing treatment cues, compared to control cues. More importantly, we found that the smaller P2 amplitudes elicited by treatment cues were associated with larger observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia. Thus, the reduced attentional engagement for treatment cues was associated with greater observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Similar to a previous study that employed a video to induce placebo hypoalgesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we did not observe a significant correlation between empathetic concern and magnitude of observationally-induced hypoalgesia. This was likely due to using pictures of the demonstrator, rather than live face-to-face observation, to induce placebo hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par26">It should be noted that not every participant responded to placebo manipulations with a reduction of pain. In line with a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, we performed a permutation test that offered the advantage of accounting for trial-by-trial variability across pain ratings to identify placebo responders. The responding rate in our current study was 38.7%, which is comparable to what has been reported in a review 34% placebo responding rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. There was a distinct pattern between responders and non-responders regarding the link between resting state PAF and observationally-induced hypoalgesia. The resting state PAF, which has the maximal power within 7.4–12 Hz, has been considered to reflect shifts in the cortical excitability and information-processing rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Recently, the resting state PAF has also been linked to subjective pain reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The current results indicated that higher pain-free state PAF was associated with lower pain intensity ratings, which was in line with Furman <italic>et al</italic>.’s findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We found that higher resting state PAF, suggestive of brain faster information processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, was positively associated with greater placebo hypoalgesic scores in the placebo <italic>responders</italic>. Conversely, faster brain information processing in the <italic>non-responders</italic> was negatively associated with observationally-induced hypoalgesia. Moreover, non-responders presented with higher PAF in association with the anticipatory-cue-elicited P2 amplitude, suggesting that the faster information processing of the non-responders may indicate high attentional engagement that lead to lesser observationally-induced hypoalgesia. The distinct patterns between placebo responders and non-responders of the PAF-placebo hypoalgesia associations suggest that not only does the information processing speed matter in formation of observationally-induced hypoalgesia, but also the core nature of the information, per se. Together, our findings suggest that placebo response status should be considered when examining the association between information processing rates and observationally-induced hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Moreover, we observed an Alpha suppression at the level of the occipital areas of the brain (P1 and P3) in both control and treatment conditions at latencies of about 500 to 1300 ms (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), suggesting cortical activation in response to pain. Previous studies have found that pain-induced alpha band activities were closely related to the intensity of painful stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and the suppression of alpha band activities, known as a reflection of cortical excitability, has been observed in the sensorimotor and occipital cortex at latencies of about 300 to 1000 ms in response to experimental pain (see review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). In the current study, likely due to using the same intensity pain stimulation for both treatment and control conditions, we failed to observe differences in the alpha band mean power. Alpha band suppression might not be as sensitive to placebo manipulations as previously thought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The current study has some limitations. First, this study employed a relatively long, 2-second painful stimulation. Specific durations of laser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> and contact heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> stimulations have been associated with reduced ERP responses (e.g. shorter painful stimulation in the range of milliseconds larger ERP responses). Therefore, the 2-second contact heat painful stimulations might limit the possibility of observing a pain-related ERP during the test phase of this study. Future studies should use shorter duration of the painful stimuli (e.g., pulse mode) to explore whether pain-related potentials (e.g., N2 and P2 component) are different between treatment and control conditions. Secondly, the sLORETA algorithm uses a relatively low spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> to identify the source of the P2 component. Alternative algorithms or methods, such as fMRI, should be employed to increase the spatial resolution of the data. Thirdly, we cannot exclude sex, race, and age differences because the study is not fully powered to address the influence of demographic features on observationally-induced analgesia and larger studies are needed to explore psychosocial factors influences. Fourth, because we used an EEG approach, we were limited to use very simple observational scenes (e.g. pictures of the demonstrator) that were repeated numerous times. To further understand the potential clinical relevance of observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia, studies should use more ecological and realistic clinical contexts. Finally, we adopted a within-subjects design with control and treatment trials counterbalanced across study participants for color, area of cream administration, pre-test participants’ expectation ratings, and neutral instructions related to the active and control creams. Computerized Visual Analogue Scales were used to minimize reporting biases. Future studies may include a trial-by-trial measurement of expectations for the test phase to better understand and model computational approaches for the role of expectations in observationally-induced hypoalgesia.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In conclusion, this study demonstrated that merely observing other people experiencing pain relief can induce significant hypoalgesia under similar conditions via modulation of anticipations. Most importantly, anticipatory treatment cues elicited smaller P2 components than control cues, and these smaller P2 amplitudes were associated with larger placebo hypoalgesia. Thus, it is likely that anticipations and attentional engagement during the anticipation of an upcoming event played a critical role in inducing observationally-induced hypoalgesia. EEG measurement of both anticipatory P2 and resting PAF might provide predictive information about the formation of subsequent observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia and, as such, may serve as markers of placebo responsiveness upon replication of these information. Overall, mechanistic knowledge about the anticipatory neural processes associated with observationally-induced pain relief might lead to novel developments in therapeutic strategies for pain, anxiety and other outcome.</p>

Forty-three participants were recruited for this study, of which data from 31 participants (23.4 ± 4 years age range, 19 females) were deemed complete and analyzable. Twelve were excluded due to misinterpretation of instructions and inability to complete the EEG montage due to logistical issues (e.g., thickness of hair). Participants were phone-screened as well as screened in person to confirm their eligibility as a healthy volunteer. Specifically, participants were excluded based on the following criteria: left-handedness; impaired hearing; color blindness; any allergies or sensitivities to creams and/or food colorings; any history of chronic pain; current ongoing pain; neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney and liver diseases; psychiatric disorders; and/or use of pain and other medications. A drug test detecting the use of amphetamines, buprenorphine, oxazepam, cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, opioids, oxycodone, phencyclidine, propoxyphene, notriptyline and cannabinoids was completed before starting the experimental procedures. Participants with positive tests were excluded from the study. All participants were negative for the drug tests. The University of Maryland, Baltimore Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Prot. HP-#00069094) and all participants gave written informed consent. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the relevant guidelines and regulations. A compensation of 100 dollars was given at the completion of the study. Since deceptive information was used during the procedure, participants were debriefed at the end of their experimental session using a study exit form that detailed the full nature of the study and the involvement of deception (see Suppl. Materials). Participants were offered the chance to withdraw their data from the study, but none did.</p>

They were informed that we wanted to investigate differences in the neural processes driving observation of someone else’s pain as compared to their own pain experience. Vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, height, and weight) were collected before starting the study procedures to assist with study monitoring (Suppl.

                <p id="Par34">The participants were then instructed about the experimental tasks. They were informed that the experiment would be divided into two phases – the observation phase and experience phase. A treatment comprised of two creams was applied to their left forearm. Both creams, in reality, were VanicreamTM, a hypoallergenic cream that is free of dyes, fragrances, masking fragrances, lanolin, parabens, and formaldehyde and which is routinely used as a vehicle by pharmaceutical companies. This cream was colored in either green or blue using FDA-approved food dyes. To establish a treatment context, the participants were instructed that one of the creams had analgesic properties, but were not told which one was the control and the analgesic treatment. They were also not told how efficacious the analgesic cream would be. This allowed the participants to learn about the supposed effectiveness of the creams by observing the analgesic experience of the demonstrator in the visual cues. The color of cream was counterbalanced to further avoid that participants could link the efficacious cream to the color prior to the observational phase. In fact, the color that was associated with treatment and the location of the application (upper vs lower ventral forearm, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was randomized across participants.</p>

The blocks were randomized across participants (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). During each trial, participants started by seeing a colored cue (green or blue, between 2–2.5 s) indicating the color of the cream on which a demonstrator would receive the heat stimulus.

After a delay (white cross, 2 s), the pain rating of the demonstrator was showed on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 = no pain to 100 = maximum tolerable pain (2 s). For the treatment condition, the pain rating was randomly presented on the VAS between 10–30 and between 70–90 for the control condition. This was followed by an inter-trial interval (4–7 s).

Specifically, a participant was classified as a responder if participants reported significant pain reduction for treatment trials compared to control trials (with the cut-off set at p = 0.05). The null distribution was generated by randomly resampling 1,000 times the distribution of the pain ratings within each participants. After identifications of placebo responsiveness status, we aimed to explore the potential neurological factors that can significantly distinguish placebo responders and non-responders. Pearson correlations between neurological factors and observationally-induced placebo hypoalgesia were calculated within placebo responders and non-responders, respectively. Due to exploratory nature of the analyses within responders and non-responders, no multiple comparison corrections were applied for the correlations.</p>
