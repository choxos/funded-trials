                <p>Well-regulated clinical trials have shown FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines to be immunogenic and highly efficacious. We evaluated seroconversion rates in adults reporting ≥ 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort study of nearly 8000 adults residing in North Carolina to validate immunogenicity using a novel approach: at-home, participant administered point-of-care testing. Overall, 91.4% had documented seroconversion within 75 days of first vaccination (median: 31 days). Participants who were older and male participants were less likely to seroconvert (adults aged 41–65: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64, 0.73], adults aged 66–95: aHR 0.55 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.60], compared to those 18–40; males: aHR 0.92 [95% CI: 0.87, 0.98], compared to females). Participants with evidence of prior infection were more likely to seroconvert than those without (aHR 1.50 [95% CI: 1.19, 1.88]) and those receiving BNT162b2 were less likely to seroconvert compared to those receiving mRNA-1273 (aHR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.90]). Reporting at least one new symptom after first vaccination did not affect time to seroconversion, but participants reporting at least one new symptom after second vaccination were more likely to seroconvert (aHR 1.11 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.17]). This data demonstrates the high community-level immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines, albeit with notable differences in older adults, and feasibility of using at-home, participant administered point-of-care testing for community cohort monitoring.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0030">As of March 29, 2022, over 6 million people worldwide have died due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are currently approved for use by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, both as a two-dose series <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Studies showing decreased vaccine effectiveness over time and with variants prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that everyone receive a booster shot 5 months or more after their last COVID vaccine <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Approximately 66% of people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and approximately 50% of those eligible have received a booster dose <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Based on evidence that protection may wane over time in certain populations, the FDA authorized a second booster dose of either mRNA vaccine for those 12 and older with immunocompromising conditions or anyone over 50 years of age <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. As more time passes and additional variants arise, additional boosters or boosters targeting new variants may be needed.</p>
              <p id="p0035">In clinical trials of the mRNA vaccines, participants had rapid and robust immune responses. The participants in the Phase 1 trial of mRNA-1273 all seroconverted by 15 days after first vaccination <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Titers varied by age in the Phase 1 trial of the BNT162b2 vaccine: for participants receiving the FDA-approved dose, those aged 18–55 years mounted titers that surpassed that of convalescent plasma 21 days after the first dose, but participants aged 65–85 years took until seven days after the second dose to reach this level <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Antibody responses to BNT162b2 in healthcare workers in Israel 21 days after the first dose did not differ based on sex, but IgG titers decreased with increasing age and increased in those with a history of COVID-19 infection (regardless of whether the participant had detectable antibodies at the time of vaccination) <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Another study in Israeli healthcare workers showed that likelihood of seroconversion after one dose of BNT162b2 decreased with increasing age and was lower in males compared to females <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A study in healthcare workers in Belgium showed similar differences in antibody titers by age and previous infection status, and also showed higher titers in those receiving mRNA-1273 compared to those receiving BNT162b2 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Additional information regarding timing of seroconversion and any potential differences in seroconversion between groups on a population level could inform the need for further monitoring of antibody responses in groups over time to help stratify groups that may require more frequent boosting. Currently, information about antibody responses after vaccination in real-world settings in the U.S. is limited.</p>
              <p id="p0040">To address gaps in knowledge about vaccine-induced seroconversion in a real-world setting in the U.S. and evaluate the use of home point-of-care testing for monitoring of antibody responses, we evaluated seroconversion rates in adults vaccinated with mRNA COVID–19 vaccines in a large longitudinal cohort study, the North Carolina COVID-19 Community Research Partnership (NC-CCRP). We also assessed the effect of sex, age, race/ethnicity, prior seropositivity, vaccine product, and symptoms following vaccination on rates of seroconversion in our cohort.</p>

                <p id="p0045">Participants from this study were drawn from the NC-CCRP study. This cohort included participants recruited through patient portals, public websites, and community outreach from the following health systems: Wake Forest Baptist Health, Atrium Health, Wake Med, New Hanover Regional Medical Center, Vidant Health, and Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine. Adults over 18 years of age were eligible for inclusion, and there were no exclusion criteria. Study procedures included daily online questionnaires for all participants, gathering electronic health records (EHR) for those who are patients in the participating health system, and periodic at-home serological testing for a subset of participants. The Wake Forest Baptist Health Institutional Review Board (IRB), which served as the central IRB for this study, approved the study protocol. The study conformed to the principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. Appropriate informed consent was obtained from study participants prior to any study procedures. The study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="ir010">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, NCT04342884. Enrollment began April 2020.</p>

Participants also reported history of COVID-19 vaccination (date of receipt, product, dose one or dose two, participation in a clinical trial). Where EHR data and vaccination records were available, self-report of vaccination status and vaccination records were compared for agreement.</p>

                <p id="p0055">A subset of participants representing local demographics with oversampling for high-risk groups (healthcare workers, minorities) was invited to complete at-home test kits for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every one to two months between April 16, 2020, and November 1, 2021. Participants performed an at-home lateral flow assay, the Scanwell SARS-CoV-2 IgM IgG Test from Teco Diagnostics, which tests for IgM and IgG to both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. This assay was tested at the National Cancer Institute against Panels 2 and 3 and was found to have a resultant combined sensitivity (IgG and IgM) of 90% and specificity of 97.5% against Panel 2 and a combined sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 100% against Panel 3 (<xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>

As of November 1, 2021, the NC-CCRP had 21,215 participants enrolled in the serological arm of the study. Of these, 16,996 (80.1%) participants reported receiving at least one mRNA vaccine.</p>

Follow-up time was from 5 days after first dose to day of documented seroconversion, last serological test, or 75 days after first dose, whichever came first. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate cumulative incidences. To obtain adjusted hazard ratios while controlling for possible violations of the proportional hazards assumption, a weighted Cox regression model adjusted for sex, age group, race/ethnicity, prior seropositivity, vaccine product, and reported symptoms after vaccination was used <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Prior seropositivity was comprised of participants who had previously tested positive on a serological test but seroreverted to negative on or before their last serological test prior to vaccination. For the analysis of reported symptoms after vaccination, participants were defined as having missing data if they did not complete at least one symptom survey in the seven days prior to vaccination and one in the seven days after vaccination. Wald-type 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed. R version 4.0.3 was used for all analyses.</p>

Our study found an increased rate of seroconversion in females compared to males, which is consistent with a retrospective study of healthcare workers in Israel, a community cohort study that found higher IgG levels in females after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and the general observation of sex differences in immunogenicity and efficacy of other vaccines <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our findings that participants previously seropositive were more likely to seroconvert than previously seronegative participants and those receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine were less likely to seroconvert than those receiving mRNA-1273 mirror findings from other recent cohort studies done in other countries <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Participants reporting at least one new symptom of fever, chills, muscle pain, chest pain, fatigue and/or headache in the seven days after second vaccination was also associated with a higher likelihood of seroconversion. This mirrors findings in a cohort study of healthcare workers in Japan, which found that higher fever, fatigue, headache, and chills were all independently associated with higher IgG titers after second BNT162b2 vaccine <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The consistency of our findings with previous literature also provides evidence that at-home point-of-care testing can provide important and meaningful information in a community cohort.</p>
              <p id="p0105">There are several limitations to this analysis. First, we relied on participant report for dates of first and second vaccinations. We found a high correlation between participant report and cross-checked EHR data, which suggests that our participant report data is reliable. The lateral flow assay used in this study had differing performances on two NCI panels, with the calculated positive predictive value ranging from 65.5 to 100% and a negative predictive value of 99.5–99.8% <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. While test performance characteristics could have inflated the overall rates of seroconversion, it is unlikely that they affected the subgroup analyses, as all subgroups utilized the same lateral flow assay. Serological testing kits were mailed to participants approximately monthly, but testing intervals varied between participants and had variable timing in relation to vaccination. At-home testing also may have missed some seroconversion events because ≥ 1 test between 4 and 75 days after vaccination was required for inclusion into this study, but in many cases, a single early negative test was the only available data point and was interpreted as a lack of seroconversion. Of note, variability of testing intervals based on the convenient, home-based testing design and inclusion criteria were consistent throughout the cohort, which should have allowed for unbiased subgroup comparisons. Generalizability of our study is likely limited to those with a higher socioeconomic status because the study procedures required informed consent, online participation, and connection with a healthcare system. Due to small numbers of various racial and ethnic groups, we were unable to analyze each racial and ethnic group separately. We acknowledge that by grouping racial/ethnic groups together, we are potentially missing more nuanced differences in responses.</p>
              <p id="p0110">A strength of our analysis is the collection of real-world immunogenicity data from a large longitudinal cohort using an at-home serology kit. To our knowledge, our cohort is larger than any previously described cohorts that have evaluated immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in community settings and is the first to provide associations between participant characteristics and seroconversion after vaccination using point-of-care testing. Concordance with previous studies validates our findings <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Follow up studies estimating rates of seroreversion and long-term vaccine effectiveness in our community cohort are ongoing.</p>
              <p id="p0115">While vaccine hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines has decreased over time, vaccination rates in the U.S. remain much lower than desired, and only about half of those eligible have received a COVID-19 booster. Second booster doses for certain groups with known blunted responses to vaccines are now recommended by the US FDA, and, in anticipation of possible seasonal COVID-19 vaccination <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccines are ongoing. Continued investigations and methods to identify those most in need of booster doses are needed. Our study shows that at-home point-of-care testing can provide robust, biologically plausible data. With further information regarding the correlation of vaccine effectiveness with seropositivity, point-of-care testing could potentially be used to monitor responses over time, providing real world data that could help inform decision making surrounding the need for booster vaccinations.</p>
