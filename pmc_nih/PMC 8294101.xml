                  <p>We recruited and trained 66 media reporters in Changzhi, Shanxi province,
China to conduct a randomized controlled trial on blood pressure lowering
effect of salt substitute in Dec, 2012 and Jan 2013 among their own
relatives or friends (253 from 129 families in the salt substitute arm and
263 from 133 families in the control arm for two months). We shared trial
results and other information on salt and health with the reporters within a
month after the trial. We monitored all local newspapers for the number of
relevant articles in 3 months before, 3 months during and 3 months after the
intervention and at the 6<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 18<sup>th</sup>,
24<sup>th</sup> and 48<sup>th</sup> months after the intervention.
Additionally, we conducted two independent surveys on knowledge, belief and

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In China, the prevalence of hypertension has been increasing. The most recent
official prevalence of hypertension in 2012–15 was reported to be 25.2% in adults,
translating to over 200 million patients with high blood pressure, making China a
country with the highest number of patients with hypertension in the world [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypertension-related
diseases such as stroke and coronary heart disease as well as deaths from these
diseases have also been increasing [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Population salt reduction has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO)
as one of the three ‘best buys’ for prevention and control of cardiovascular disease
globally [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many
observational studies [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], animal
studies [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and randomized clinical
trials [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have confirmed that
reducing salt intake can reduce blood pressure levels [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], thereby reducing the incidence of
cardiovascular diseases [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; recent observational
studies showing a purported ‘U’ shape curve between salt intake and cardiovascular
mortality [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have been criticized on
methodological grounds [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>WHO and professional societies around the world have recommended lower salt intake
for prevention and control of hypertension [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Salt reduction has become a global action
in prevention and control of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However,
significant challenges remain to implement such a policy widely. Per capita salt
intake is 8–13 g per day in some European countries, such as 9.5 g per day in the
UK, 12 g per day in China, all markedly higher than the WHO recommended 5 g per day
[<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Among strategies for population salt reduction, leveraging the media to educate the
public to reduce salt intake and promote health could be convenient and
cost-effective, especially in countries like China where most of salt intake derives
from salt added during cooking at home [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mass media plays a critical role in public
health promotion and disease prevention [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, current methods of engaging mass
media for public health education either have little effect or are limited to having
a one-off or transitory effect that does not last long [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, we described an innovative approach, involving media reporters to
implement a trial designed to rigorously test the effect of salt substitute in
lowering blood pressure among their own families, neighbours or relatives, which
aims to increase the number of media reports on salt and health in the local media
over short and long-term; and therefore to further change the population’s
knowledge, belief and behaviours on salt intake and health among local citizens.</p>

                <p>We employed a before-and-after comparative study design to evaluate the effects
of the intervention. The study was carried out in Changzhi, Shanxi Province of
China, which is a medium size city with a total population of 3.46 million. The
intervention targeted all local newspaper reporters and included a
reporters-implemented salt reduction randomized trial followed by dissemination
of trial results and additional information sharing. The intervention took place
for 3 months in total from Dec, 2012 to Feb, 2013, two months for the trial and
one month for information sharing. We monitored all local newspapers for the
number of relevant articles in 3 months before, 3 months during and 3 months
after the intervention and at the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th and 48th months after
the 3-month intervention. In addition, we conducted two independent surveys
among local residents to understand the changes in knowledge, belief and
behaviour before and after the intervention (<xref rid="pone.0252989.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The work of monitoring newspapers
ended in Feb, 2017.</p>

                  <title>1) Randomized controlled salt substitute trial implemented by
reporters</title>
                  <p>The main part of the study intervention was designed as a randomized
controlled salt substitute trial to be implemented by local newspaper
reporters. To be eligible, the reporters had to have a national press
reporter certificate with health column reporters preferred, had planned to
live in Changzhi in the next 12 months, had easy access to at least 4
families including relatives, friends or neighbors who would be asked to
participate in the study. Among a total of 78 local media reporters, 12
refused to take part, leaving 66 reporters participated in the study.</p>
                  <p>We chose salt substitute as the intervention for the randomized trial because
its effect in lowering blood pressure had previously been demonstrated in
Chinese populations [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
The trial was planned for a period of two months and each study reporter was
responsible to recruit 4 families to participate in the trial, according to
the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: had at least two family
members aged 50 years or more, had no plan to move within 6 months, and
living conveniently for the reporter in charge to take the blood pressure
measurements in their leisure time. For an individual to be eligible, he/she
should be at least 50 years old and consume 3 meals a day at home for at
least 5 days a week. We excluded those with severe kidney disease or
receiving potassium-sparing diuretics. The 66 study reporters recruited a
total of 262 families and 516 study participants. All study participants
provided written informed consent.</p>
                  <p>The families were randomly divided into two groups: intervention group and
control group in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization stratified by the reporters
was done by an independent staff at the Changzhi Medical College using the
random digit table. The family allocated to the intervention group received
free salt substitute (70% sodium chloride and 30% potassium chloride).
Sufficient salt substitute was provided to the entire family for the use of
two months. Families in the control group received no salt substitute and
continued to use the regular salt. We chose not to use a salt enriched
placebo for the control group for the following considerations: 1) We were
interested in observing the effect of the trial in changing the media
reporters’ will and writing to report on salt intake and health, rather than
replicate the findings of the previous studies; 2) Blinding would increase
the difficulty and cost of implementing the trial, and our budge was
constrained; 3) Salt is a daily necessity, and the participants would have
to use regular salt anyway if they were randomized into the control group;
4) When the study was done, the salt substitute had not been marketed and no
salt reduction campaigns took place in the study area, both the study
participants and media reporters were not familiar with the product and its
function in lowering blood pressure.</p>
                  <p>Before and after the intervention, the reporters measured the blood pressure
for all study participants in both intervention and control groups at the
participants’ homes using a validated automatic blood pressure monitor
(Omron HEM-7301-IT) with an appropriately sized cuff. After participants had
rested for 5 minutes in a quiet room, two readings were taken in the right
arm at 1-minute interval with the participants in the sitting position and
the arm supported at heart level. We used the average of the two
measurements in all analyses. Body weight and height were measured in
participants without shoes or heavy clothes, following a standardized
protocol. The reporters sent the measurement results via mobile short
messages to the data center at Changzhi Medical College. All reporters
received training by the study staff before the implementation of the study.
A project manager was recruited to manage the trial and remind reporters of
on-time blood pressure measurements.</p>

to treat. Study results were shared with the reporters through emails. In
addition, text messages with information on salt and health were sent by the
study personnel, one specific topic each day, to all participating reporters
in the month following the two-month salt substitute trial.</p>

                  <p>Personnel who were independent of the study were recruited, to collect
relevant articles published in the local newspapers in the 3 months before
intervention (September to November, 2012), 3 months during intervention
(December 2012 to February 2013), 3 months after intervention (March to May
2013), and also at the

after the intervention (The initial plan was to follow up to the 12 months
after the intervention. We decided to extend to 48 months after the
intervention to better understand the longer term effect). The relevant
articles were defined as any type of article that contained description of
‘salt’, ‘high salt intake’, ‘salt reduction’, ‘salt substitute’, or ‘types
of salt’ in relation to prevention and control of chronic diseases. On a
weekly basis, the designated personnel went through all newspaper articles
to record all relevant articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Before the
data collection, the personnel was trained by the first author of the study
on the methods and criteria to be used.</p>

                  <title>2) Surveys of local residents</title>
                  <p>At the weekend immediately before and the weekend immediately after the
3-months intervention (2-months salt substitute intervention, followed by
1-month information sharing), we conducted two independent surveys of local
residents in the same places, the largest shopping center and the largest
public square in the city. We adopted the convenience sampling method to
intercept volunteer residents according to a pre-defined number of people in
each age- and sex-group. In each survey, we aimed to survey 100 individuals
in each 10-year age group, starting from age 31–40 years to age 51–60 years,
with 50 individuals in the group age 61 years and above. In each age group,
we aimed for half men and half women. In total, 772 men and women were
surveyed, 387 in the survey before and 385 in the survey after the
intervention.</p>
                  <p>We used self-developed questionnaires for the interview of the residents, and
only five simple questions about salt and health were asked in addition to
age, sex, occupation, education and place of residence. The multiple-choices
questions included 1) “Do you believe that high salt intake is harmful to
your health? (Choices: yes, no, and don’t know)”; and 2) “if yes, what
diseases could it lead to or aggravate? 3) “Do you know how much salt a day
the Chinese Nutrition Society recommend to take in? (Choices: 3 g/d, 6 g/d,
10 g/d, and don’t know)”; 4) “What type of salt do you use at home (choices:
iodine-fortified, Se-fortified, salt substitute, regular salt, and don’t
know), and 5) “Do you know how much salt you take every day? and if yes, how
much?” We used answers to question #1 to count the number who believe salt
is harmful to health, answers to questions #2 and 3 for the number who were
aware of sodium and health issues, and answers to question #4 for the number
who complied with lower sodium choices. We derived a new variable of ‘paying
attention to the amount of salt intake’ (as a behaviour) from the question
#5 by accounting for those who answered ‘yes’ to the question and were able
to give the amount specifically.</p>

                <p>For the built-in salt substitute trial by reporters, we estimated the sample size
on the basis of our previous randomized trials [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which indicated an effect size of the
salt substitute of between 5.4 mmHg to 9.1 mmHg for systolic blood pressure
(SBP) with a standard deviation about 13.4 mmHg to 22.3 mmHg. We assumed that
two-sided α = 0.05, intra-family correlation coefficient = 0.4 and % lost to
follow up = 10%. A total of 240 families (480 participants) with 1:1 ratio of
intervention to control had 85% power to detect an effect size of 5 mmHg in SBP
with standard deviation of the changes in SBP = 15 mmHg.</p>
                <p>For the series of media reports monitoring study, all local newspapers were
monitored. We assumed that the baseline rate would be less than one article per
newspaper per month, and an increase to five articles per month would have 80%
power to be detected at 5% significance level.</p>
                <p>For the resident convenience sample surveys, with reference to previous studies
[<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we assumed that
the proportion of Chinese residents with the knowledge, belief and behaviour on
salt intake and health in this part of China was 30%, 60% and 30% respectively.
We assumed α = 0.05, a study sample size with 400 individuals in each survey
would have 85% power to detect an effect size of 10% change in each of these
proportions.</p>

                <p>The difference in number of relevant articles and proportions of knowledge,
belief and behaviour between pre- and post-intervention was compared using the
Chi-square test. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between
intervention and control in the reporters-implemented randomized trial were
compared using generalized estimation equation model adjusting for clustering
(families) effect and baseline blood pressure levels. All statistical tests were
two-sided and the level of significance was set at P = 0.05. The statistical

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our study demonstrated that inviting media reporters to participate in a rigorously
designed intervention trial, asking them to be responsible for study participant
recruitment, intervention delivery and outcome measurement, and having the trial
results shared with them, could significantly increase the number of media reports
of relevant articles–in this case, by 3 to 5-fold,with an effect that lasted over
the long term (up to 4 years) (See <xref rid="pone.0252989.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig
2</xref>). The effect of intervention was not limited to an increase in the
number of relevant articles, but was also observed in city residents’ knowledge and
behaviour relevant to salt intake and health (See <xref rid="pone.0252989.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The study offers an effective and
innovative approach to mass media health education and involvement that could be
taken and extended to other areas of health interest.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have found that mass media often has little effect on people’s
behaviour, particularly for on-going behaviours such as diet, physical activity and
smoking; while short-term changes can be achieved, sustained effects are difficult
to maintain after the campaigns end [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, how were we able to achieve an increasing
number of media reports on salt and health and maintain the effect for years?
According to the Theory of Reasoned Action [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] the reporters’ adoption of writing on salt
and health is a function of their intention to do it. The intention to write on the
topic is, in turn, a function of their attitude toward writing on that topic and of
perceived social norms and motivations to comply. Reporters, especially in the
health and science fields, tend to be well-educated with good scientific reasoning.
If they had the chance to do a study by themselves and the study used a design they
trust to generate a solid conclusion, they would believe in that conclusion. The
randomized controlled trial is such a robust study design. Compared with being
presented with results from studies done by others, often a stranger, receiving
results from their ‘own study’ in which they are the actual ‘players’ may positively
affect their beliefs in what is concluded from the study and increase their
motivation to report on the topic.</p>
              <p>The evaluation of mass media campaigns is often difficult. Randomized controlled
trials, although being considered the ‘gold standard’, are often not feasible or
appropriate for the evaluation of mass media campaigns [<xref rid="pone.0252989.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, we used a traditional
method of newspaper article review to monitor the number of relevant articles
published in local newspapers, periodically for over 4 and half years. The clear
relationship between our intervention and the change in number of relevant articles
subsequently published supports a potentially causal association between the two. In
addition, we used the same method in conducting two convenience sample surveys, one
before and one after the intervention, and we chose the same places to recruit the
survey interviewees–both the biggest mall and the most popular public square–in
order to ensure the compatibility between the two samples.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="sec022">
              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>Our study has several limitations. First, we only invited newspaper reporters. Other
media reporters including those from TV and social media were not included. Thus,
the effect of our intervention on the public’s knowledge, belief and behaviours may
have been under-estimated compared with what might be achieved. It explained why the
intervention effect on KABs was not as large as expected, i.e. people paying
attention to amount of salt intake still below 50% after the intervention. Second,
it is possible that the increase in numbers of relevant articles published and
public knowledge and behaviours resulted from other interventions and dissemination
on the importance of salt on health beyond the local trial. While this possibility
cannot be ruled out, we are unaware of any national or regional campaigns that would
have resulted in such a rapid change in media interest on this particular topic.
Third, we can not entirely eliminate the possibility that a reporter who had biased
view on salt substitute would introduce a biased intervention effect on blood
pressure in the build-in randomized salt substitute trial, due to its open nature.
However, we believe that possibility should be very minor if existed. The reasons
are: 1) The information sharing undertook after the randomized trial; 2) Blood
pressure was measured using an auto-device; 3) Most of the media reporters in China
are not having a medical degree. Their level of knowledge on salt and health were
almost the same as that of the common people in the society; 4) Salt substitute was
not available on the local market then and the reporters were unfamiliar with it
too; 5) The number of media reports did not increase during the randomized trial
implementation and increased sharply right after the trial, indicating most of the
reporters were waiting for the results from the trial before they took any action.
Fourth, we did not measured blood pressure in the KAB surveys and could not measure
the change in population blood pressure level. However, since the two
cross-sectional surveys took part in only 3 months and the change in climate and air
temperature might affect blood pressure significantly, the usefulness of measuring
blood pressure changes in such a short period should be limited. Last, we did not
plan and conduct more surveys after the intervention due to financial constraints.
Hence, the long term effects of the intervention on population knowledge, belief and
behaviour remain unknown.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>The study demonstrated that involving media reporters in conducting a rigorously
designed salt reduction trial significantly increased the number of relevant media
articles, and the effect was sustained for an extended period. Such a strategy is
novel and we used several methods and outcome measures to evaluate the impact of
this strategy. If substantiated by studies in other locations, we recommend mass
media public health education programmes consider adopting a similar strategy for
more effective and sustained impacts than traditional approaches.</p>
