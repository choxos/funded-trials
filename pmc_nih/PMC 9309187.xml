                  <p id="P9">Metformin may have anticancer effects that are independent of its hypoglycemic effects. Retrospective studies have shown that metformin use is associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Preclinical studies suggesting additive anticancer effects of combining metformin and bicalutamide prompted this clinical trial (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614859" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02614859</ext-link>).</p>

                  <p id="P11">29 patients were enrolled from March 2015 to January 2020. No difference was seen between the 2 arms in the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA. Modest PSA decrease ranging from 4 to 24% were seen in 40.0% (95% CI: 19.1% - 64.0%) of patients with metformin monotherapy, compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 0.3% - 48.3%) in the observation arm. Metformin monotherapy reduced PD-1<sup>+</sup> NK cells, and increased NKG2D<sup>+</sup> NK cells. The combination of metformin and bicalutamide led to greater reductions in PD-1 expressing NK, CD4<sup>+</sup> T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets compared to bicalutamide alone. The trial was stopped early due to predicted inability to achieve its primary endpoint.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P13">Metformin is a well-tolerated drug that is commonly used to treat diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. Several retrospective studies have reported that diabetic patients taking metformin had a lower cancer incidence, prompting evaluations of metformin as an anticancer agent. In 2005, Evans et al. first reported an association between decreased cancer incidence and metformin use [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while subsequent studies showed that diabetic patients treated with metformin were less likely to be diagnosed with cancer and/or to die from it. Post-hoc analysis of the ZODIAC trial showed that patients with type 2 diabetes are overall at increased risk for cancer mortality, however metformin use was associated with lower cancer mortality (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23–0.80) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P14">Two-thirds of adult males in the United States are overweight or obese, and several studies have demonstrated an association between obesity and incidence of prostate cancer (PCa) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Obese patients have reduced adiponectin levels and increased leptin levels, which may promote PCa growth [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, an increased insulin level in a patient with metabolic syndrome can cause an increase in free androgens by decreasing sex hormone-binding globulins, which may also lead to a worse PCa prognosis [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, obesity was associated with more aggressive cancer, a higher rate of PSA failure and a trend toward increased risk of positive surgical margins [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 16 studies analyzed 26,479 PCa patients after their curative treatment and found that an increase in BMI of 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with a 21% increase in risk of primary treatment failure (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.11–1.31, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P15">Despite promising preclinical evidence of metformin’s antineoplastic activity, clinical studies of metformin monotherapy in PCa have been somewhat confusing. A phase 2 study enrolled 42 chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and treated them with metformin 1000 mg twice daily until progression. Metformin showed modest activity: 36% of patients were progression-free at 12 weeks; 9.1% were progression-free at 24 weeks, 2 of whom had PSA declines of ≥ 50% [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Another clinical study treated 24 men with newly diagnosed PCa with metformin 500 mg 3 times daily prior to radical prostatectomy for a median of 41 days (range 18–81 days). Compared to baseline biopsy, treatment with metformin reduced the Ki67 proliferation index by 29%, while PSA reduction was not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.08) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P16">Colquhoun and colleagues investigated whether the anticancer activity of metformin could be further improved by combining it with bicalutamide.

Eligible patients were required to have had a primary treatment with curative intent (surgery or radiation therapy). Biochemical failure was declared when PSA reached ≥ 0.2 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy, or a PSA rise of 2 ng/mL above the nadir achieved post-radiation (2006 RTOG-ASTRO Consensus Definition). Patients were required to have hormone-sensitive PCa as evidenced by a total serum testosterone level of &gt; 150 ng/dL, a PSA doubling time (PSADT) of 3–9 months calculated per the MSKCC nomogram [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], PSA &lt; 30 ng/mL at study entry, BMI &gt; 25, no evidence of diabetes mellitus (HgbA1c &lt; 6.5% or fasting blood glucose &lt; 126 mg/dL), and no evidence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging. Eligible patients may have had prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, vaccines, or experimental agents) up to 4 weeks prior to randomization if the PSA rise and PSADT were documented after the testosterone level was &gt; 150 ng/dL.

Blood samples were taken at prespecified time points to assess immune activation at baseline, after 8 weeks, and at the end of the trial (32 weeks). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL) at 32 weeks. Adverse events were assessed by the investigators and graded per the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0. An early stopping rule for futility was set at 39 patients, but due to slow accrual an unplanned interim analysis was undertaken after 29 patients were enrolled.</p>

For serum assays, blood was collected in serum separator tubes, centrifuged, and stored at −80°C prior to analysis. Serum levels of cytokine/soluble factors were evaluated before and after treatment using commercially available kits per the manufacturers’ instruction. Interleukin (IL)-8 was measured by AlphaLISA (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), soluble (s) CD27 (sCD27) and sCD40L were measured using Instant ELISA kits (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and Granzyme B were measured using ELISA kits from R&amp;D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). For the analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets, blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes and PBMCs were isolated after Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient separation. Cells were cryopreserved in 90% heat-inactivated human AB serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL prior to analysis. Cryopreserved PBMCs collected from 13 patients with available PBMCs were examined by multicolor flow cytometry using 30 markers in 4 panels to identify 158 peripheral immune cell subsets [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], following methods previously described [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Flow cytometry files were acquired on an LSR Fortessa equipped with 5 lasers and analyzed using FlowJo v.9.9.6 for Macintosh, with nonviable cells excluded and negative gates based on fluorescence-minus-one controls. The frequency of all subsets was calculated as a percentage of PBMCs to eliminate any bias that might occur in the smaller populations with fluctuations in leukocyte subpopulations. These studies were performed by the NCI’s Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology.</p>

To detect a difference between 20% and 40% with 80% power and type I error &lt; 5%, a cohort of 39 patients was initially planned and, if the study continued, a second cohort of 27 patients was planned to be randomized 1:2 to arms A and B respectively, with a planned final sample size of 66 patients [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Data cut-off was in April 2021. Standard descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. Binomial proportions with exact, two-sided 95% confidence intervals or medians with ranges were used to summarize binary and continuous efficacy endpoints, separately by arm. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare baseline to 32-week changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) between arms. For immune analyses, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) and RStudio (Boston, MA). Changes in immune parameters between two time points were assessed for statistical significance using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Immune parameters compared between treatment arms, as well as between patients with PSA declines vs those without PSA declines, were assessed for the significance of the difference using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P26">Several recent studies have reported the positive benefit of metformin in the incidence and prognosis of PCa, making it a promising anticancer agent which has been tested in prospective trials. However, extensive research has failed to identify the exact mechanism of metformin’s anticancer effects. Possible mechanisms include activation of the AMPK signaling pathway [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], inhibition of protein synthesis [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], activation of the tumor suppressor p53 [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], induction of apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], activation of the immune system (protecting tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from apoptosis) [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or killing of cancer stem cells [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized, phase 2 trial to evaluate metformin treatment in men with biochemical recurrence of PCa.</p>
              <p id="P27">From December 2015 to January 2020, 29 patients were randomized and treated on this 3-center, investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial. Although as anticipated, treatment was well tolerated with no dose reductions or discontinuations due to safety, the study was not going to reach its primary endpoint showing a difference in the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA values at the end of study and thus was stopped for poor accrual and futility. Although PSADT is a better surrogate for survival than PSA response alone, limited evidence in specific settings (such as hormone-sensitive disease) suggests that PSA response may be used as a surrogate for an ultimate effect on survival and therefore may be used for early stopping in case of futility [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our study showed that fewer participants had undetectable PSA in the combination arm compared to the bicalutamide-only arm, likely due to chance since study did not have enough power due to small sample size.</p>
              <p id="P28">However, a key secondary endpoint (number of patients with a PSA decline with metformin monotherapy after 8 weeks) was reached. Eight patients (40%) had a PSA decline ranging from −4% to −24%, suggesting modest anticancer activity. It is important to note that all patients had rapidly rising PSA with a PSADT of 3–9 months at baseline, prior to enrolment.</p>
              <p id="P29">Three other prospective studies of combination treatments with metformin in mCRPC have been published since 2015, when our study was initiated. The combination of metformin plus abiraterone in mCRPC after PSA progression (abiraterone failure) reported no clinical benefit [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while the combination of metformin and enzalutamide in mCRPC was reported as active. A PSA response of ≥ 50% was observed in 19/24 patients (79%), although this was not a randomized study and patients had not been exposed to enzalutamide [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A third study, a randomized phase 2 trial of docetaxel vs docetaxel plus metformin in mCRCP (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01796028" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01796028</ext-link>), was also reported as negative in 2019 [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P30">Our immune correlative analyses suggest that metformin, given alone and/or in combination with bicalutamide, has some modest immune potentiating activity, as evidenced by reductions in the frequency of subsets (NK, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) that express the exhaustion marker PD-1, reductions in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express CD73, which is involved in adenosine metabolism and implicated in suppressing an anti-tumor immune response [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and increases in NK cells that express the activating receptor NKG2D. Others have similarly reported in lung cancer patients with diabetes, that metformin can reduce T cell exhaustion [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P31">While this study was negative, observed PSA responses to metformin monotherapy are interesting and warrant further research. This study also demonstrated that metformin can be safely prescribed to non-diabetic patients at higher doses without significant toxicities and with good compliance. Unanswered questions still remain: 1) Is 1000 mg twice daily sufficient therapeutic dosing of metformin as an anticancer agent? 2) What is the duration of PSA response and what is the resistance mechanism to metformin? 3) What is the efficacy in patients with a BMI &lt; 25? and 4) Would diabetic patients with PCa receive the same or greater benefit from metformin given its ability to reduce insulin resistance, insulin levels, and circulating levels of glucose, which can affect cancer progression?</p>
              <p id="P32">It is hoped that ongoing trials of metformin treatment for PCa, including the Metformin Active Surveillance Trial (MAST), which is recruiting men with low-risk cancer (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01864096" ext-link-type="uri">NCT01864096</ext-link>), and a large phase 3 trial adding metformin to standard therapy for newly diagnosed metastatic castration-sensitive cancer (STAMPEDE – Arm K; <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00268476" ext-link-type="uri">NCT00268476</ext-link>) will shed more light on the role of metformin in the treatment of PCa.</p>
