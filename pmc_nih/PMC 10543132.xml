                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 1000 mother-child dyads experiencing poverty, a monthly unconditional cash transfer did not improve children’s health or sleep in the first 3 years of life. However, the cash transfers led to increased consumption of fresh produce at age 2 years.</p>

                  <p>In this study, unconditional cash transfers to mothers experiencing poverty did not improve reports of their child’s health, sleep, or health care utilization.

              <p>Children experiencing poverty are more likely to experience worse health outcomes, including injury,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> chronic illness,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and poor sleep<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and are more likely to use emergency health services.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Numerous factors likely contribute to these associations, including poor prenatal care,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> exposure to environmental toxicants,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> low quality housing and neighborhoods,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and lack of access to medical care<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and nutritious foods.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Poverty may also impact young children’s sleep through parental mental health<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and the quality of the sleep environment<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and bedtime routines.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Previous quasi-experimental work suggests that even small increases in income may improve health trajectories for children experiencing poverty. For example, expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the largest antipoverty policy in the United States prior to pandemic-related tax expansions, reduced the incidence of low birth weight infants in the population.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Similarly, exogenous increases in minimum wage were found to improve children’s nutritional status in low-income countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, the health impacts of poverty reduction for otherwise healthy infants in the United States is unknown.</p>
              <p>Monetary investment and improvements in parental stress are 2 potential pathways by which we have theorized that poverty reduction may improve developmental trajectories.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> For example, greater financial resources may allow parents to invest in high-quality inputs that support child health and sleep, including nutritious foods, preventive medical care, a separate sleep space, and safe housing. Additionally, reduced financial strain may reduce parental stress and mental health symptoms, which may subsequently improve the quality of family interactions, bedtime routines, and child sleep quality.</p>
              <p>The present study evaluates the effect of a poverty reduction intervention on children’s health, nutrition, sleep, and health care utilization in the first 3 years of life. Such an intervention exemplifies a scalable public health approach. We hypothesized that a monthly, unconditional cash transfer would improve maternal assessments of children’s health, nutrition, and sleep, and reduce use of emergency health care.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>Baby’s First Years (BFY) is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of poverty reduction. Between May 2018 and June 2019, 1000 mothers experiencing poverty were recruited from postpartum wards after giving birth, and were offered a monthly, unconditional cash transfer (referred to as a “cash gift”). Mothers were randomly assigned to either a high-cash gift group (n = 400) or a low-cash gift group (n = 600). The monthly gifts were initially promised for the first 40 months of their child’s life and were subsequently extended through 76 months. More information on study design can be found in <xref rid="note-ZOI231012-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref> and in Noble et al.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Upon providing written informed consent, mothers completed a baseline interview and received compensation for their participation ($50). For the next 3 years, mothers were invited to complete annual surveys around the time of their child’s birthday. All study procedures were approved by the institutional review board of Teachers College, Columbia University. This study follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/" ext-link-type="uri">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline for RCTs.</p>

                <p>Mothers were recruited from 12 hospitals across 4 US metropolitan areas: New York, New York; Omaha, Nebraska; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Minneapolis/St Paul, Minnesota. Eligibility criteria included (1) being of legal age to provide consent; (2) reporting a household income less than the federal poverty line; (3) being able to speak English or Spanish; (4) the infant not being admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit; (5) residing in the state of recruitment; (6) planning to remain in-state within the next year, and (7) infant to be discharged into the mother’s custody.</p>

                <p>Randomization occurred within hospitals, with 60% randomized to the low-cash gift group and 40% randomized to the high-cash gift group. After obtaining written informed consent and conducting the baseline survey, interviewers retrieved the randomized group assignment, informed participants of their assigned group, and activated the debit cards; therefore, interviewers could not be masked to condition during recruitment. However, interviewers were not informed or reminded of participants’ treatment status during follow-up assessments.</p>

                <p>Mothers in the high-cash gift group received $333/mo ($3996/y), whereas mothers in the low-cash gift group received $20/mo ($240/y). Funds were disbursed monthly onto an electronic debit card (branded 4MyBaby), accompanied by a text message notification.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The receipt of $4000 in cash gifts increased the average family’s income by approximately 20%.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Provisions instituted by state agencies and legislation ensured the cash gifts affected neither mothers’ eligibility for nor amount of public benefits.</p>
                <p>Participants were informed they could spend the money how they wished, and receipt of the funds was not conditioned upon continued participation in the study. Among those who consented to allow access to transaction data (n = 900), only 5 families (all in the low-cash gift group) had not withdrawn funds from the debit card 3 years after randomization.</p>

                <title>Measures</title>
                <p>At the baseline interview, mothers provided demographic information including racial and ethnic identity to allow possible exploration of heterogeneity in treatment effects. Participants were provided with the options of American Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut; Asian or Pacific Islander; Black or African American; White; or other for race; ethnicity was assessed by whether the mother identified as Hispanic. Each following year, mothers completed surveys of their child’s health, nutrition, sleep, and health care utilization. Such parent-reported measures are frequently used as proxies for child health outcomes (eg, Page et al<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>) and correlate with objective assessments.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The primary outcomes for this RCT used to determine sample size centered on child development at age 4 years<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and are beyond the scope of this article. We additionally preregistered primary outcomes in child health and sleep at age 3 years, including an additive Child Health Index which is further described in the eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI231012-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>. The secondary outcomes of interest were child health and sleep disturbances at ages 1 and 2 years and children’s consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods at age 2 years. Outcomes were preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov. We also explored impact estimates for some outcomes that were not preregistered, including types of postbirth diagnoses, bedtime routines, cow’s milk consumption, vaccinations, missed medical care, Medicaid receipt, and 4 global measures of health, nutrition, sleep, and health care utilization.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This preregistered study found that 3 years of monthly, unconditional cash transfers for families experiencing poverty did not improve maternal reports of children’s health, sleep, or health care utilization. However, the cash gifts did lead to increased reported produce consumption at age 2 years. Previous work has found that low-income mothers tend to perceive fresh produce as expensive and inaccessible<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and may be averse to introducing novel foods that their children may reject.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The cash gifts may have encouraged low-income mothers to take the financial risk of investing in fresh produce.</p>
              <p>By design, this sample consisted of infants who did not require neonatal intensive care at birth, of whom the vast majority were born at-term, and of normal birth weight. It is therefore unsurprising that most mothers rated their children as having excellent or very good health, with rates of health conditions or disabilities aligned with national averages. Most studies linking poverty reduction to children’s health do not utilize such exclusionary criteria (eg, Strully et al<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>). Although national estimates vary, between 5% and 14% of all children have a disability, with those experiencing poverty demonstrating higher rates than more economically advantaged peers.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It is possible that positive impacts of the cash transfers on health were less likely among this sample of children who were generally healthy at birth.</p>
              <p>Rates of emergency medical use among this sample were higher than the national average for low-income mothers: 11% of children living in poverty reported at least 2 ED visits in 2019, and 14% reported at least 2 urgent care visits that same year.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In comparison, 15% to 28% of this sample reported at least 2 ED or urgent care visits annually. Notably, the mortality rate for this sample was higher than the national average of 2.03 deaths for every 1000 full-term infants.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The lowest rates of emergency and routine medical care use were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, age-2 and age-3 data collection), suggesting that parents may have altered their care-seeking behaviors in response to the pandemic.</p>
              <p>Structural barriers might interfere with preventive care use,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> leading to higher emergency health care utilization. Given the complex lives of poor families, a modest increase in monthly income may be insufficient to overcome barriers to accessing a regular medical home, resulting in the high use of emergency health care services. Direct interventions that connect families with services may be more effective at reducing emergency health care utilization among children experiencing poverty (eg, Goodman et al<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>).</p>
              <p>We have previously reported that the monthly cash gifts resulted in greater parental investments in their children, both by increasing expenditures on child-focused goods (eg, books and toys) and increasing parental time spent engaged in developmentally supportive activities (eg, reading and playing).<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> eTable 5 in <xref rid="note-ZOI231012-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref> provides a summary of recent papers reporting impact estimates of the BFY study. However, we also found no effect of the cash gifts on other potential pathways that may have improved outcomes in health-related domains. For example, the cash gifts did not improve maternal stress, mental health symptoms, or relationship quality,<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> which are closely associated with the quality of children’s sleep and bedtime interactions.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The cash gifts also had no effect on reported food insecurity, housing quality, or the likelihood of purchasing a crib.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It is possible that the modest cash gifts were simply not large enough to provide relief to families in ways that would improve such social determinants of health. Indeed, although the gifts resulted in a nearly 20% increase in income for the families in the high-cash gift group, most families were still residing in poverty.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The effects of a poverty reduction intervention on children’s health may not emerge until later in development. Many illnesses associated with childhood poverty, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, tend to emerge in adolescence or adulthood.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Natural experiments such as the Great Smokey Mountain Study report that cash transfers during middle childhood are associated with positive effects on physical and mental health in adulthood.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> It will be important to follow the BFY sample to measure the extent to which investments in early childhood may reduce the incidence of disease processes that emerge later in life.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>
              <p>An important strength of this study is its large sample, experimental design, low rates of attrition, and preregistered analysis, which represents an improvement over prior studies that have examined associations between income and children’s health, sleep, and nutrition in cross-sectional or observational studies. Additionally, as both groups received a monthly cash gift, there was no confounding between receipt of the cash gifts and either possession of a debit card or receipt of communication from the research team.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>A limitation of the present study is that it relies entirely on maternal assessments, which may introduce bias and be less reliable than objective assessments. However, parental report of children’s overall health, medical history, and sleep duration tends to be highly correlated with objective assessments, including abstraction of medical records and actigraphy.<sup><xref rid="zoi231012r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi231012r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Another limitation is reflected in the limited variability on some survey items, potentially indicating that the truncated response options provided were not ideally suited for assessing medical care in young children. Furthermore, to the extent that even a small cash transfer may have promoted positive impacts on health, it is possible that true impacts may have been masked.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The present study found no effect of monthly, unconditional cash transfers in the first 3 years of life on maternal reports of children’s health, sleep, or health care utilization. However, the cash transfer caused an increase in toddler consumption of fresh produce. Healthy newborns tend to grow into healthy toddlers, and the impacts of poverty reduction on children’s health and sleep may not be fully borne out until later in life. We intend to follow up with the families through middle childhood and will continue to assess the children's health and development over time.</p>
