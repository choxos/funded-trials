                <sec id="ab-zoi180108-1">
                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Compared with standard cessation approaches, can long-term nicotine replacement therapy lead to higher rates of cessation or reductions in carcinogen exposure among smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi180108-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 398 smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 23 of 197 (11.7%) receiving a standard smoking cessation intervention had quit at 12 months, compared with 24 of 197 (12.2%) receiving long-term nicotine replacement therapy. Both groups had comparable reductions in carcinogen and smoke exposure.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>Long-term nicotine replacement therapy provides an option for smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but does not result in greater rates of cessation or harm reduction.</p>

                <p>This randomized clinical trial compares the effect of long-term nicotine replacement therapy vs standard smoking cessation on exposure to cigarette smoke, harm related to smoking, and smoking cessation among smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>

                  <p>Smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have particular difficulty quitting. Long-term nicotine replacement therapy (LT-NRT) might offer a strategy for reducing harm from cigarettes and provide a pathway for later cessation.</p>

                  <p>Among 398 patients who were randomized (59.8% female; mean [SD] age, 56.0 [9.3] years), the mean (SD) CPD was 23.1 (12.3). Twelve-month follow-up was completed by 373 participants (93.7%), and 394 (99.0%) were included in the primary analysis. At 12 months, CO-verified abstinence occurred in 23 of 197 participants (11.7%) in the SSC arm and 24 of 197 (12.2%) in the LT-NRT arm (risk difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.9% to 6.9%). Continuing smokers in the SSC and LT-NRT arms had similar, significantly reduced harms caused by smoking, including cigarette consumption by 12.4 and 14.5 CPD, respectively, exhaled CO level by 5.5 and 7.8 ppm, respectively, and mean urinary NNAL excretion by 21.7% and 23.0%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, continuing smokers with greater adherence to NRT experienced less reduction in NNAL exposure. The frequency of major adverse cardiac events was similar in both groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Most chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United States can be attributed to smoking, and smoking cessation should be the first step for treating the disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Compared with those who quit, patients with COPD who continue to smoke have higher mortality<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and more rapid decline in pulmonary function.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These persistent smokers have particularly high levels of nicotine dependence<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and lower self-efficacy for quitting<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and find it more difficult to quit.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Despite the effectiveness of counseling and smoking cessation pharmacotherapy,<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> smokers with COPD are less likely than other smokers to succeed in their quit attempts.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Better strategies are needed for treating patients with COPD who continue to smoke. Long-term nicotine replacement therapy (LT-NRT) as a pathway to cessation or as a method for harm reduction might be an option. Most smokers trying to quit fail in the attempt and quickly resume smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> These smokers might benefit from continued pharmacotherapy to reduce harm from smoking or support subsequent quit attempts. Several investigators<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> have looked at extended treatment with NRT for 6 to 12 months after a quit attempt. These studies have had mixed results, with 2 showing improvements in smoking cessation at 6 months that were not sustained at 1 year.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Another study<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> failed to demonstrate differences at 6 months but showed improvements in cessation 12 to 18 months after study enrollment. None of these studies examined smoke exposure or harm reduction among continuing smokers, and none of these studies were focused on patients with COPD.</p>
              <p>Heavy smokers, such as those with COPD, may be particularly interested in gradual tapering or cutting down the number of cigarettes smoked (reduce-to-quit strategy) rather than quitting right away.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> A meta-analysis of 7 trials using NRT among smokers not willing to quit right away<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found a reduce-to-quit approach doubled the chances of eventually being able to quit. The actual effect size in these studies, however, was small (number needed to treat = 29).</p>
              <p>Prior studies using extended NRT to support a cessation attempt or to help smokers reduce to quit were not focused on patients with COPD and did not examine the effect of ongoing NRT on smoke exposure among smokers unable to quit. The purpose of this study was to compare a standard smoking cessation (SSC) program with LT-NRT provided to smokers with COPD regardless of their readiness to quit and examine the effect of long-term NRT on smoking cessation and harm reduction.</p>

Recruitment occurred from May 23, 2014, through November 30, 2015, with final follow-up completed by December 6, 2016. Consistent with the principles of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Initiative,<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> patients and stakeholders (ie, members of the community with a stake or interest in specific health care issues, including clinicans, advocacy groups, and policy makers) were engaged during all phases of research.

                <p>Potential participants were identified by querying electronic health records<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> at 2 academic medical centers; they were mailed a recruitment letter followed by telephone calls. Participants were also referred by other participants and health care clinicians in the Kansas City, Missouri, metropolitan region, including physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses.</p>
                <p>Participants were considered eligible, regardless of their willingness to quit, if they were 18 years or older, smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day on at least 25 of the last 30 days, spoke English or Spanish, reported physician-diagnosed COPD, and were willing to complete study requirements. Smokers were excluded if they had a terminal medical condition, would be pregnant or breastfeeding in the next year, resided in a long-term care facility that restricted smoking, exhibited severe cognitive impairment, had another household member enrolled in the study, had no home address, or had been hospitalized with a heart attack, experienced an irregular heartbeat, or reported increasing angina in the past 30 days.</p>

Those not ready to quit were included in the study but did not receive active treatment unless they set a quit date within 6 weeks of randomization. Participants in the SSC arm who set a quit date were proactively contacted for telephone counseling 1, 3, 6, and 10 weeks after the baseline visit. The mean (SD) length of the counseling sessions was 15.4 (7.0) minutes. In addition, they received a 10-week supply of combination NRT to start on their quit date.</p>

                  <p>Participants randomized to the LT-NRT arm completed baseline counseling that focused on use of NRT and interest in quitting. Counselors helped participants develop personalized quit plans or, for those who declined to set a quit date, cigarette reduction goals. Regardless of whether participants set a quit date, follow-up telephone counseling was provided at 1, 3, and 6 weeks and 9 months after baseline and in person at months 3 and 6. The mean (SD) length of the counseling sessions was 15.5 (7.3) minutes. Follow-up counseling provided support for NRT adherence and addressed relapse prevention for quitters or cigarette reduction and cessation planning for continuing smokers. Participants in the LT-NRT arm started their NRT immediately and received a new supply of NRT every 3 months.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Data were analyzed from March 8 through November 30, 2017, using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc). We generated descriptive statistics for each of the baseline measures. We used the χ<sup>2</sup> test to assess for group differences in the primary and secondary cessation-associated outcomes. A 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test, assuming equal variances, was used to test for differences between groups in change in forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration after testing for the equality of variances. We used generalized linear mixed models to test for differences between groups across time and for interactions between group and time for emergency department visits and hospitalizations, quit attempts, respiratory symptoms, expired CO level, and NNAL excretion.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Measurements of NNAL excretion were adjusted for creatinine level<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and log-transformed. The correlation of multiple measurements from the same participant across time was modeled using heterogeneous, first-order, autoregressive structures. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to examine the association among participant characteristics, month 12 abstinence, and reduction in CO levels and NNAL excretion (eTables 1-3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI180108-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 with a 2-sided test.</p>
                <p>For our primary outcome, we treated those with missing data as continued smokers. We conducted a variety of sensitivity analyses, including a completers-only analysis, an analysis assuming that all nonrespondents had quit smoking, and an analysis using a CO level cutoff of no greater than 5 ppm. We performed logistic regression analyses controlling for variables that were unbalanced across treatment arms at baseline. Our linear and generalized linear mixed models addressed missing data under the missing-at-random assumption using likelihood-based analyses.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
                <p>The sample size was based on the primary outcome. We estimated that 60% of participants in the SSC arm would be interested in quitting smoking at the time of recruitment<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> and would receive active treatment and that the cessation rate in this group would be 10%. Previous trials have shown that LT-NRT, provided as part of a reduce-to-quit strategy, is associated with a 2-fold increase in smoking cessation among smokers not yet ready to quit.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Among smokers ready to quit, LT-NRT has been associated with odd ratios for quitting of 1.70 to 1.81.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although prior studies of LT-NRT have primarily used a single form of NRT, combination therapy is associated with a 34% higher quit rate when compared with use of a single agent.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Based on these data, we projected a 2-fold increase in cessation; a sample size of 398 participants provided a power of 80% to detect a 2-fold increase in cessation with a type I error of 5%.</p>

                <p>At 12 months, among the participants who continued to smoke, both groups reported similar reductions relative to baseline in self-reported CPD (LT-NRT group, −14.5; SSC group, −12.4 CPD), expired CO level (LT-NRT group, −7.8 ppm; SSC group, −5.5 ppm), and NNAL excretion (LT-NRT group, −23.0%; SSC group, −21.7%). During the 12-month follow-up, these changes were significantly different from baseline, but did not differ significantly between groups (<xref rid="zoi180108t3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In multivariate analyses, baseline cotinine levels (exponentiated β coefficient, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.97; <italic>P</italic> = .04), depressive symptoms (exponentiated β coefficient, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.98; <italic>P</italic> = .02), and daily use of NRT at month 12 (exponentiated β coefficient, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-1.00; <italic>P</italic> = .03) were inversely correlated with changes in NNAL levels (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI180108-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study of patients who continued to smoke despite being diagnosed with COPD, LT-NRT led to comparable rates of smoking cessation at 12 months compared with a traditional, NRT-supported, smoking cessation program. Long-term NRT and SSC were associated with modest rates of smoking cessation at 12 months (approximately 12%), highlighting the difficulty in achieving cessation in this group of smokers at high risk for treatment failure.</p>
              <p>Although we tried to enroll smokers at all stages of readiness to quit, given the large number of patients in this study interested in quitting, our study has less in common with reduce-to-quit studies<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and more in common with prior studies of extended treatment with NRT for patients willing to quit.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In 2 of these studies of extended treatment, Schnoll et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> compared 8 weeks of NRT with 24 to 52 weeks of extended NRT treatment. In both trials, extended NRT therapy was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates at 24 weeks, but abstinence declined over time and, by week 52, abstinence was similar across treatment arms.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although our study failed to confirm the effect of extended NRT on abstinence at week 24, we observed a similar lack of benefit from extended treatment at week 52.</p>
              <p>Another study, however, demonstrated long-term differences in outcomes associated with extended treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Joseph and colleagues<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> compared 8 vs 48 weeks of NRT treatment. They found that point prevalence of abstinence at 6 months was virtually identical in both groups, but at 18 months, those receiving the extended treatment had significantly higher 6-month prolonged abstinence (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74). However, Joseph et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> attempted to contact smokers every 2 to 4 weeks throughout the course of the study and engage them in new quit attempts if they were still smoking. Although abstinence rates declined from months 6 to 12 in the 2 studies of extended therapy by Schnoll et al,<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> abstinence rates in the study by Joseph et al<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> increased during the same period. In our study, where recipients of long-term NRT received counseling at months 6 and 9, confirmed abstinence increased from 9.6% at month 6 to 12.2% at month 12, whereas a slight decline in abstinence occurred during the same period for recipients of SSC. Together these findings suggest that the benefits of extended pharmacotherapy may depend on ongoing behavioral support and re-engagement of continuing or relapsed smokers in new cessation attempts. This conclusion is further supported by a previous study of long-term disease management for smoking cessation in which repeated engagement of smokers at 6-month intervals also demonstrated progressively increasing rates of cessation over time.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Long-term NRT and SSC resulted in comparable levels of harm reduction among patients who continued to smoke. Persistent smokers in both study arms reported similar reductions of 62% to 66% in CPD, 30% to 39% in expired CO levels, and 19% to 30% in NNAL excretion; these reductions represented statistically significant changes from baseline. As seen in other studies, the reductions in CPD in our study exceeded the reductions in biological markers of cigarette exposure.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Nevertheless, these reductions may be clinically significant. Reductions of 50% or more in CPD have been linked to improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, respiratory symptoms,<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and lung cancer risk.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> More importantly, reductions in smoking appear to support future quit attempts and ultimate cessation.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although participants who continued to smoke in both arms of this study reduced their cigarette consumption, LT-NRT was not the major factor in achieving these reductions. Indeed, continuing smokers who reported ongoing use of NRT at month 12 actually had less reduction in their NNAL excretion than those that had stopped using their NRT. This finding is consistent with other evidence that supplemental nicotine alone is not associated with reduced carcinogen exposure among continuing smokers<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and that addiction-associated factors (eg, sensory and environmental stimuli) other than nicotine play a major role in cigarette dependence in patients with COPD.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This study adds to existing research establishing the safety of combination and higher-dose NRT among patients with multiple comorbidities,<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi180108r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> even if they continue to smoke. Although many participants continued to smoke while receiving high dosages of supplemental NRT, major adverse cardiovascular events were rare and appeared to have no association with the use of NRT.</p>
              <p>The recruitment strategies used in this study highlight the potential value of proactive outreach and engagement of smokers with COPD. Our proactive queries of electronic health records provided lists of patients with COPD who were still smoking. We reached out to these smokers through direct mailings and follow-up telephone calls and were able to engage a large proportion of these patients in smoking cessation attempts.</p>
              <p>The low overall rate of cessation in this study suggests the need for better strategies to help patients with COPD quit smoking. Future research could examine repeated interventions over time<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> or modifications in therapy after an initial treatment failure.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Extended treatment with other agents or delivery devices could also be tested. We chose to study combination NRT based on patient concerns about varenicline tartrate and data suggesting that combination NRT was as effective as varenicline.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Varenicline, however, may be more effective than NRT in reducing reinforcement from cigarettes and results in higher rates of delayed cessation.<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> New oversight by the US Food and Drug Administration<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> should facilitate research on the use of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation, but our findings and those of others<sup><xref rid="zoi180108r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> suggest that unless smokers quit completely, NRT, whether offered through patch, gum, lozenge, or electronic cigarette, may not result in meaningful harm reduction.</p>
              <sec id="H2-11-ZOI180108">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Less than two-thirds of the patients randomized to LT-NRT were still using NRT at month 12, whereas many SSC participants reported ongoing use of NRT at 6 and 12 months. In our multivariate model, ongoing use of NRT was not associated with CO-verified cessation (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI180108-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>); nevertheless, nonadherence in the LT-NRT group and ongoing use of NRT by SSC participants could have diminished our ability to identify a treatment effect. The intensity of treatment in the SSC group may have exceeded the intensity typically offered in clinical practice and may have further limited our ability to detect a difference. Our study was conducted among volunteers prepared to take part in a research study; it is not clear how offers of LT-NRT in actual clinical practice might affect the potential reach of smoking cessation; findings might be different among less motivated smokers. Finally, our study was powered to detect a 2-fold difference between treatment arms; we cannot exclude the possibility of a smaller effect size that might still be clinically significant.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>For smokers with COPD, LT-NRT did not provide any advantages over a traditional smoking cessation program in terms of smoking cessation. The traditional smoking cessation intervention had a shorter duration of treatment and would appear to be the preferred treatment for smokers ready to quit. Long-term NRT can lead to rates of cessation comparable to SSC programs and might provide an option for smokers not immediately willing to quit. However, in the absence of cessation, LT-NRT, even at high dosages, does not appear to affect smoke exposure any more than a failed cessation attempt.</p>
