                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in adults is an intensive medical procedure for a variety of haematological malignancies. Although there is a large body of evidence demonstrating the negative effects of HSCT on physical function and psychosocial parameters, there is limited evidence on the impact of HSCT on body composition and bone health. Further, aerobic and resistance-training exercise interventions aimed at improving physical function and patient-reported outcomes largely take place during the peritransplant and post-transplant period. Prehabilitative exercise, or exercise prior to medical treatment, has been successfully deployed in presurgical candidates and other tumour sites, yet there is a paucity of evidence on the effect of prehabilitation in HSCT patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and safety of a resistance training exercise programme in patients with haematological malignancies prior to HSCT.</p>

                  <p>IMpact of PRehabilitation in Oncology Via Exercise-Bone Marrow Transplant is a single-site, pilot randomised controlled trial of an exercise intervention compared with usual care. The primary aim is to assess the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the resistance-training exercise intervention prior to HSCT. Secondary aims include evaluating the differences in physical function, body composition, bone mineral density and patient-reported outcomes between the exercise group and usual care control group. Outcome measurements will be assessed: prior to HSCT, on/around day of HSCT admission, +30 days post-HSCT and +100 days post-HSCT. The exercise intervention is a home-based resistance training exercise programme that incorporates resistance band and body weight exercises. The primary outcomes will be reported as percentages and/or mean values. The secondary outcomes will be analysed using appropriate statistical methods to portray within-group and between-group differences.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a potentially curative yet intensive and high-risk medical treatment option for patients with haematopoietic disorders. The two major forms of HSCT include: autologous (AUTO) and allogeneic transplantation (ALLO). In 2020, a number of AUTO and ALLO HSCTs performed in the USA were 11 557 and 8326, respectively, demonstrating a 44% and 34% increase in the past 10 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Mortality rates post-HSCT are dependent on a number of factors including remission status at the time of transplant, donor stem cell source and compatibility, and frequency and severity HSCT-related complications.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Medical approaches to improve clinical and functional outcomes post-HSCT include reduced-intensity ablative chemotherapy, measures to reduce the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease and initiation of prophylactic regimens during immunosuppressive therapy administration.</p>
              <p>The number of AUTO and ALLO survivors in the USA is projected to grow to 294 000 and 234 000, respectively, by 2030.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> HSCT involves periods of prolonged reduced physical activity, which combined with HSCT therapy-related toxicity and symptoms, places survivors at a higher risk of developing longstanding physical, psychological and psychosocial issues. These may include lower levels of physical function, declines in quality of life (QoL), reduced levels of physical activity and ongoing negative changes to body composition and bone health.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref></p>
              <p>Although there is a large body of evidence documenting the negative effects of HSCT on physical function and various psychosocial parameters, less is known about the impact of haematological malignancies and HSCT on changes in body composition and bone health. Sarcopenia is defined as a generalised, progressive musculoskeletal disorder that affects muscle function, muscle mass and muscle quality.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures, reduced ability to perform activities of daily living, risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and overall survival.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Retrospective studies report that 34%–55% of prospective AUTO and ALLO recipients present with sarcopenia.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> In a prospective cohort study by Morishita <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, 51% of patients who experienced sarcopenia exhibited significant decreases in muscle strength, lower scores in physical functioning, pain and health-related QoL compared with patients without pre-HSCT sarcopenia.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The presence of sarcopenia prior to HSCT also carries increased risk of longer hospitalisations, worse 2-year overall survival and increased risk of death due to infection or organ failure.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Further, the incidence of sarcopenia increases over time post-HSCT with studies reporting sarcopenia in 64% and 75% of patients at 1 year and 2.5 years, respectively.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Bone density loss is a well-recognised complication in HSCT-recipients. In addition to disease-related bone abnormalities, prolonged administration of high-dose chemotherapy and long-term corticosteroid use interferes with the bone turnover and formation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Several studies report that 25% of HSCT survivors present with osteoporosis and 50% present with osteopenia.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–16</xref> While bone loss does not currently carry the strong survival implications associated with sarcopenia, it is a serious preventable comorbidity that afflicts a large majority of HSCT-survivors.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Currently, clinical guidelines for bone health in HSCT-recipients recommend vitamin supplementation and bisphosphonate therapy, and only briefly mention lifestyle changes, including promotion exercise, diet changes, tobacco cessation and reduced alcohol intake.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 17</xref></p>
              <p>The current evidence suggests that aerobic and resistance-training exercise in HSCT patients during the peritransplant and post-transplant period is safe and effective at improving cardiorespiratory function, muscle strength, physical function, fatigue, anxiety and a variety of other treatment-related side effects.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> Randomised controlled trials have also shown that exercise has a positive impact on total and non-relapse mortality,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> haematological reconstitution, immunological capacity and stem cell survival.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23–25</xref> However, exercise during these time periods do not address the possibility of preventing HSCT-related muscular, functional and psychosocial declines.</p>
              <p>Prehabilitation, or prehab, takes place between cancer diagnosis and the beginning of treatment and aims to intervene and improve on physical and psychological health to reduce the incidence and severity of possible future treatment-related and disease-related impairments.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Prehab has been investigated in other cancer sites such as breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancer with positive changes seen in physical function, QoL, surgical outcomes, and overall morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Despite the growing evidence of exercise during and after HSCT treatment, there is a paucity of evidence focusing on the feasibility and efficacy of prehabilitative exercise prior to HSCT. To our knowledge, there are only a few completed or currently active trials that include exercise during the pre-HSCT phase. The trials by van Haren <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> and Rupnik <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> are non-randomised feasibility trials, which do not allow for comparison to a non-exercising group.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> In addition, the PREeMPT trial,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the PERCEPT trial<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and the feasibility trial by Mawson <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> focus on patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma who are receiving an AUTO transplant, while Wood <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> used only aerobic exercise for ALLO patients. Finally, the trials completed by Wiskemann <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and Santa Mina <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> included exercise for ALLO patients during multiple phases of the transplant process, making it more difficult to discern the impact of the pretransplant exercise intervention. Further, Santa Mina <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported a low 20% recruitment rate and a 70% attrition rate, making it difficult to draw conclusions from this small study.</p>
              <p>Given the demonstrated deficits that HSCT patients experience before, during and after transplantation, and the growing evidence of pretreatment exercise in other cancer entities, including HSCT, we planned a randomised controlled two-arm exercise intervention trial prior to HSCT- IMpact of PRehabilitation in Oncology Via Exercise-Bone Marrow Transplant (IMPROVE-BMT)—to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and safety of an exercise prehabilitation programme in HSCT patients (NCT03886909). IMPROVE-BMT has the potential to elucidate how exercise can act as a preventative intervention to improve functional, physical and psychosocial outcomes while addressing changes in body composition and bone health, all of which contribute to improving and prolonging survival in HSCT-recipients.</p>

                <p>Following baseline assessments, patients will be prescribed resistance training exercises to complete at least five times per week at home, unsupervised. An exercise and cancer specialist, certified by the American College of Sports Medicine with multiple years of experience working with patient living with and beyond cancer, builds the resistance training programme by selecting exercises from a catalogue of preselected exercises that include modifications of each exercise to target varying levels of physical function. Based on the patient’s clinicopathological history, the exercise and cancer specialist will select exercises that can be safely performed yet effectively target upper-body and lower-body strength development. Each exercise session takes approximately 30–45 min to complete. Each patient in the exercise group will receive a study manual containing study information, guidelines for safe exercise and exercise logs to complete for each exercise session. The exercise and cancer specialist will review and collect the exercise logs at clinic visits with patients. If patients have large gaps (ie, greater than 3 weeks) between scheduled clinical visits, the exercise and cancer specialist will review the exercise logs with the patient over the phone and provide new exercise logs via mail. The exercise logs will be used to track completion and adherence of the prescribed exercise programme. Each resistance training session consists of 1–2 warmup exercises, 4–6 upper-body and lower-body strength exercises, followed by 2 cool down stretches. All resistance exercises will be completed using a combination of the patient’s body weight and resistance bands. Training intensity will be adapted using the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale (target scores 14–16 out of 20 for resistance exercises). Patients will also be encouraged to walk at least 15 min every day at an intensity of 12–14 on the RPE scale and will be increased or 5–10 min per session if possible until patients are achieving a minimum of 15 min of walking per session.</p>
                <p>The exercise and cancer specialist will progress the exercise sessions if the patient does not report any new or worsening side effects or symptoms. Incremental progression of the exercise sessions will entail modifying one or more of the FITT principles on prescribing exercise, specifically, increasing or decreasing sets, repetitions, weight, and/or the number of exercises prescribed. Patients may be withdrawn from the intervention if the patient requests to discontinue the study, the treating physician and/or exercise and cancer specialist deems it is unsafe for the patient to exercise, or if the patient meets any of the exclusion criteria. In addition to the structured intervention, patients will receive an educational counselling session from the exercise and cancer specialist which includes information on HSCT-related effects and transplant precautions and expectations.</p>

The session also goes over common potential effects of having HSCT and how to incorporate physical activity into their care routine.

To test gait speed, patients are instructed to walk 4 m at their usual pace with assistive devices if needed. Four progressively more challenging positions are used to test balance (bipedal, semi tandem, full tandem and unipedal stance). To test lower extremity strength, patients are asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible. The SPPB has been established as a valid and reliable test of physical performance and has been shown to be associated with muscle mass, risk of falls and mortality.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p>

                <p>Our primary outcomes are descriptive. Acceptability will be defined by the proportion of approached patients who agree to participate and complete at least the prehab counselling session. Our a priori threshold is 50%. We will consider the intervention feasible if 50% of included patients complete at least one third of the prescribed exercise sessions for 2 weeks or more. Safety will be reported by the number of exercise-associated events. Exercise adherence during the prehabilitation period will be calculated as the proportion of completed exercise sessions over the number of prescribed exercise sessions. Summary statistics including mean and SD for continuous variables and frequency with percentage for categorical variables will be reported. We will examine differences within-group and between-group using linear mixed-effects models for physical performance measures, patient-reported outcomes and body composition. A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used for all statistical tests. Various clinical covariates including transplant type, prehabilitation duration and baseline differences will be included as statistical covariates to address heterogeneity. Evaluation of missing data will occur at the time of analysis in order to select the best method to evaluate and analyse missing data. This study will provide estimates of mean and SD to support a sample size calculation for a larger, fully powered trial. The anticipated sample size for this pilot trial is 84 participants—42 in each intervention arm—based on the PSCI HSCT programme annual enrolment and projected withdrawal rate from similar previous trials within our working group. All data will be entered and stored on secure servers at PSCI. Regular data range checks will be performed to promote data quality.</p>

              <p>This study will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and safety of a pre-HSCT exercise intervention. Given the intensity of HSCT and the long-standing toxicities many recipients experience, additional supportive care methods must be explored. Currently, there is limited evidence on how prehabilitative exercise prior to HSCT affects physical function, QoL, body composition and bone density. This study uses a home-based, pragmatic and personalised exercise programme to enhance feasibility and adherence and to address barriers such as distance, transportation, access to equipment and avoidance of public spaces. It is anticipated that the results from this study will largely contribute to the foundational knowledge of how prehabilitation exercise affects the preparation and recovery process of HSCT-recipients. Further, results from this pilot feasibility trial will provide data to calculate effect sizes and sample size for a larger, fully powered multicentre trial. Pilot results will potentially demonstrate that exercise given in a clinical setting is something that patients may want and can change the way oncology standard of care uses the time prior to HSCT. Recruitment started in June 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an institution-wide hold was put on all in-person clinical trial recruitment and face-to-face study-related activities from March 2020 to July 2020 and again from September 2020 to March 2021. The pandemic-related pauses in research did not affect the home-based exercise sessions for enrolled participants, however, DXA scans for patients enrolled during restricted periods were not collected. The estimated completion date for recruitment is October 2022 and study-related follow-ups will be completed in early 2023.</p>
