                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases (MSS CLM) maintain an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Historically, immune-based approaches have been ineffective. VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a genetically-modified adenoviral vector targeting the TME; its unique dual mechanism induces an immune response and disrupts neovascularization. Checkpoint inhibition may synergize the immune response induced by viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy. We aimed to examine the safety and antitumor activity of VB-111 and nivolumab in patients with refractory MSS CLM and to characterize immunological treatment-response.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a phase II study of adult patients with histologically-confirmed MSS CLM who progressed on prior therapy. A priming dose of VB-111 1×10<sup>13</sup> viral particles was given intravenously 2 weeks prior to starting biweekly nivolumab 240 mg and continued every 6 weeks. The combination continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objectives were overall response rate and safety/tolerability. Secondary objectives included median overall survival and progression-free survival. Correlative studies were performed on paired tumor biopsies and blood.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Between August 2020 and December 2021, 14 patients were enrolled with median age 50.5 years (40–75), and 14% were women. Median follow-up was 5.5 months. Of the 10 evaluable patients, the combination of VB-111 and nivolumab failed to demonstrate radiographic responses; at best, 2 patients had stable disease. Median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8), and median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9). The most common grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events were fever/chills, influenza-like symptoms, and lymphopenia. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Qualitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining of paired tumor biopsies did not demonstrate significant immune infiltration after treatment, except for one patient who had exceptional survival (26.0 months). Immune analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed an increase of PD-1<sup>high</sup>Ki67<sup>high</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> T cells after VB-111 priming dose. Plasma cytokines interleukin-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α increased after treatment with both drugs.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>In patients with MSS CLM, VB-111 and nivolumab did not improve overall response rate or survival but were tolerated with minimal toxicities. While challenging to distinguish between antiviral or antitumor, correlative studies demonstrated an immune response with activation and proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells systemically that was poorly sustained.</p>

                    <p>VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a unique viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy that can disrupt tumor-specific vascularization and induce a tumor-directed immune response. It has been successfully used in early-phase clinical trials with glioblastoma, thyroid, and ovarian cancers; however, the only phase III trial conducted thus far did not meet its primary endpoint in recurrent platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. Only one clinical trial has assessed tumor immunogenicity of VB-111 and was limited to biopsies of only two patients.</p>

                    <p>With its novel insight into the immune mechanisms induced by this viral-mediated gene therapy, this study validates the importance of on-treatment tumor biopsies and paired peripheral blood samples. It also provides rationale for future trial design in colorectal liver metastases. A single priming dose may not be the optimal strategy for viral-mediated therapies; rather, multiple sequential doses of viral vector, administration of dual checkpoint inhibition, or combinatorial approaches with chemokines/cytokines may be required to elicit a stronger immune response to result in tumor killing.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Immune-based approaches in colorectal cancer have been largely unsuccessful with the notable exception of immune checkpoint inhibition in microsatellite instability-high disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> The reasons for this are unclear, but no doubt related to the poor immunogenicity evident in advanced gastrointestinal malignancies such as lack of infiltrating lymphocytes in advancing T-stages and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5</xref> While advances in tumor immuno-oncology are promising, most patients will not benefit from these strategies. Mechanisms for tumor-mediated immune evasion and primary adaptive resistance to immunotherapeutics remain elusive.</p>
              <p>Even more complex, liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as opposed to peritoneal-limited or lung-limited metastases, appear to be less responsive to immunotherapy compared with these other metastatic disease sites. For example, recent progress in a first-in-human trial (NCT0386272) with botensilimab (a novel innate/adaptive immune activator) and balstilimab (an Fc-enhanced next-generation anti-PD-1, or programmed cell death 1, antibody) led to a fast-track designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for this novel combination but limited to mCRC <italic toggle="yes">without</italic> liver involvement due to substantial survival differences based on the presence of active liver metastases: 12-month overall survival of 40% (95% CI: 17% to 62%) in active liver metastases versus 81% (95% CI: 66% to 90%) without active liver metastases.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Therefore, currently, the standard of care for microsatellite stable colorectal liver metastases (MSS CLM) remains chemotherapy and may be combined with an anti-angiogenetic therapy, such as bevacizumab, but the overall prognosis for this subset of patients remains quite limited with 5-year overall survival of 15.6%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) is a viral-mediated anti-angiogenic gene therapy with a unique dual mechanism of action: vascular disruption and induction of a tumor-directed immune response (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). This viral gene therapy is an E1 deleted, non-replicating adenovirus-5 vector with a modified murine pre-proendothelin promoter (PPE-1–3 x) and a human Fas-chimera transgene (Fas-c) given intravenously.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> The murine PPE-1–3 x promoter requires endothelin-1 to express its pro-apoptotic transgene and specifically restricts expression of Fas-c to activated <italic toggle="yes">angiogenic</italic> endothelial cells, as compared with <italic toggle="yes">quiescent</italic> endothelial cells,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> resulting in its promising properties as an anti-angiogenic disrupter. The non-replicating viral vector is internalized by endothelial cells of blood vessels, and the Fas-chimera transgene is expressed, constructing a transmembrane chimeric death receptor with an extracellular portion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (p55) and an intracellular and transmembrane portion of Fas (CD95).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Found abundantly within the TME, TNF-α activates the apoptotic pathway, resulting in tumor-specific angiogenic endothelial cell death. Subsequently, direct tumor cell death occurs as neovascularization is disrupted, generating neoantigens. A tumor-directed immune response then results as antigen presenting cells ingest neoantigens and prime tumor-specific effector T cells, inducing cellular and antibody-mediated immune responses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Like oncolytic viruses, the adenovirus vector may also trigger a localized inflammatory reaction in response to the virus itself, recruiting proinflammatory cytokines into the tumor milieu.</p>

              <p>Preclinically and clinically, VB-111 has shown highly specific anti-angiogenic activity and immunotherapeutic effects in a variety of tumors.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13 15–21</xref> In several rodent models, prolonged survival was observed in animals treated with one does of VB-111 (ie, nude rats with intracranial U87 glioma xenografts) or inhibition of tumor growth with central tumor necrosis (ie, nude mice with multiple thyroid cancer-derived cell lines and C57BL/6J mice with subcutaneous B16 melanoma or injected with Lewis lung carcinoma metastases).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 15 16</xref> Immunological studies demonstrated an increase in tumor infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after treatment with VB-111 in a Lewis lung carcinoma mouse model,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the anti-angiogenic properties of VB-111 were shown through significant reduction of CD31<sup>+</sup> expression, an endothelial cell marker of angiogenesis, after treatment with VB-111 in mouse models with thyroid cancer.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In early-phase clinical trials, promising results have been reported in glioblastoma, ovarian, and thyroid tumors.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 18–21</xref> For example, in glioblastoma, primed VB-111 (given prior to) or unprimed VB-111 (given concurrently) with bevacizumab was well-tolerated, prolonged survival (median overall survival in the primed vs unprimed groups: 414 vs 141.5 days, HR 0.24, p=0.0056), and correlated to expansive areas of necrosis on imaging in the phase I/II trial<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; however, the phase III GLOBE study was unable to validate these findings, showing worse survival outcomes with increased toxicity in the combination arm with VB-111 and bevacizumab in comparison to the control arm with bevacizumab monotherapy. Median overall survival was reported as 6.8 versus 7.9 months in the combination versus control arm (HR, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.59, p=0.19), and higher grade 3–5 adverse events were seen with the combination (67% vs 40%).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The differences between the early phase and phase III trials were attributed to the change in treatment schedule where the priming dose of VB-111 was omitted in the larger randomized control trial, suggesting the importance of this priming dose in combination therapies. With the well-established role of anti-angiogenesis therapy and difficult-to-overcome immunosuppressive TME, MSS CLM is an interesting model for this novel immune inducing vascular disruptive agent. However, the antitumor immunity induced by VB-111 through release of neoantigens from hypoxic, dying tumors may not be enough to produce a clinically significant antitumor response in such an immunosuppressive TME. Therefore, the combination of VB-111 with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) may enhance responsiveness by reversing T-cell anergy and potentiating T-cell activation.</p>
              <p>This phase II study aimed to investigate the antitumor activity, safety, and tolerability of VB-111 in combination with nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in previously treated patients with MSS CLM.</p>

              <p>As shown in the study consort diagram (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 4</xref>), the safety analyses included 13 patients who received at least one study drug, and the efficacy analyses included 12 patients who received at least one dose of each study drug. One patient did not receive any investigational agent due to disease progression and was removed from study prior to treatment, and another patient was taken off treatment after receiving only the VB-111 priming dose due to clinical disease progression. The median doses of VB-111 given was 2 (range 0–2). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression. All patients died from progressive disease.</p>

                <p>Ten patients were considered evaluable for radiographic response. Although the study design called for a pause after nine evaluable patients in the first stage, one patient had been initially excluded from evaluability due to clinical disease progression. In retrospect, early restaging scans were evaluated for tumor measurements, and thus, this patient was included in the analysis of overall response rate. Ultimately, the combination of VB-111 and nivolumab did not result in any radiographic responses. At best, two patients had stable disease, and eight patients had progressive disease.</p>
                <p>As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, the median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.4 to 1.9 months), and all patients experienced progressive disease by 6 months. The median overall survival was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 to 10.8 months) with three patients living longer than 10 months (26.0, 25.7, and 10.8 months). Tumor progression was the primary cause of death for all patients.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this small phase II study of patients with MSS CLM treated with VB-111 and nivolumab, this therapeutic combination did not improve overall response rates, nor meaningfully prolong survival but was generally tolerable with mild toxicities. Nevertheless, two important contributions resulted<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>: three heavily pretreated patients had unexpectedly impressive prolonged survival (26.0, 25.7, and 10.8 months), suggesting that this novel combination of immunotherapies may have impacted the immunosuppressive environment of CLM in certain patients, and<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the availability of paired tumor biopsies and peripheral blood allowed for immune profiling before and on-treatment, enriching our understanding of viral-mediated oncology treatments.</p>
              <p>For patients with mCRC treated in the third-line setting, the median overall survival approaches 7–8 months.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Therefore, the three patients with survival times greater than 10 months was quite impressive given their treatment-refractory advanced disease; the clinical features and treatment history of these three individual patients with exceptional survival are outlined in the supplemental materials (<xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 7</xref>). In particular, patient 9 had marked TILs after treatment with only a VB-111 priming dose, mostly comprised of CD8 T cells, and PD-L1 expression was seen focally within the tumor (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). We were unable to fully assess baseline infiltration due to necrotic tissue comprising most of the sample, limiting our interpretation on contribution of VB-111 in inducing this observed response. Nonetheless, the on-treatment tissue biopsy of this patient exhibited the most significant number of lymphocytes of the six available tumor biopsies after treatment, and this patient went on to survive for 26.0 months after enrollment, only receiving 2.2 months of treatment with VB-111 and nivolumab before dying from progressive disease. Interestingly, while this patient shared many molecular features and baseline clinical characteristics as others in study, patient 9 was the only participant to undergo liver-directed therapies (microwave ablation and Y-90 embolization) prior to enrolling in study. It is possible that these liver-directed treatments modulated the TME in a manner that overcame immune regulation and sensitized nearby liver tumors to subsequent immune-based therapies, such as VB-111 or nivolumab.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref></p>
              <p>In addition to these observed exceptional survivals, this study provides unique insight into the immune mechanisms induced by this novel immunotherapy combination, adding to the sparse literature on the immunologic mechanisms of viral-mediated therapies. Specifically, there is only one other clinical trial that assessed tumor immunogenicity of VB-111 and was limited to biopsies of only two patients.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study provides greater insight due to larger tumor sample size and suggests a trend towards prolonged survival with increased tumor-infiltration of lymphocytes in some patients. We were unable to correlate treatment-related changes with radiographic response like Arend <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, which may provide more direct evidence of VB-111 induced immunological changes. However, we were able to show VB-111 induced expansion of activated and proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the flow cytometry analysis of PBMCs, validating the immunogenicity of this gene therapy. Cytokine analysis suggested a trend up in several proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-ɣ, IL-1b, and IL-12) over time; however, our ability to observe peak changes in cytokines that would be expected from an antiviral immune response within the 5–7 days after treatment with an adenoviral vector was limited by the small sample size and timing of phlebotomy draws every 2 weeks. While we did observe an increase in IL-10 and TNF-α, this likely reflected ongoing, longitudinal disease progression, rather than treatment effect. Notably, the observed immunogenicity in PBMCs was transient and not sustained after two infusions of nivolumab, suggesting that a single priming dose or an ICI alone may not be the optimal strategy for this viral-mediated gene therapy; rather, multiple sequential doses of viral vector clustered closer together may be required to elicit a stronger, prolonged immune response to result in clinically meaningful tumor killing.</p>
              <p>It is well-demonstrated that the strength of the immune response, as reflected by IFN-ɣ production, is critical for tumor killing, not simply the presence of an immune response<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref>; therefore, we decreased the frequency between VB-111 infusions that had been previously tested in the clinical trials with VB-111 in other solid tumors. The original dosing frequency of every 8 weeks was based on the pharmacokinetics observed in the phase I trial of VB-111 with advanced solid tumors that established a decline in adenoviral vector levels by at least 2-log fold or undetectable after 56 days post-infusion,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the studies reported in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref> demonstrated safety and tolerability of this dosing schedule. A shorter interval of 28 days was even evaluated in a small cohort of the phase I/II study of VB-111 with bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma, showing toleration but lacked clinical significance likely due to the small sample size, negative impact of precluding a priming dose, and counteraction of bevacizumab to the mechanism of VB-111.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Intending to strengthen the immune response, we tested an interval of 6 weeks between VB-111 infusions, which induced a transient immune response and was well-tolerated, but future considerations should reduce dosing intervals further, potentially to every 4 weeks and using IFN-ɣ production as a measure of activity. The limited clinical efficacy of VB-111 in colorectal cancer, as compared with other early phase clinical trials in glioblastoma, thyroid, and ovarian cancers (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>), may be related to different immunosuppressive pressures within the liver. CLM (in contrast to lung-dominant or peritoneal-limited colorectal cancer) tend to poorly respond to ICIs and may be related to the TME composition of immune cells and chemokines/cytokines that mediate tumor migration, drug resistance, and immune evasion.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> An increase in tumor-associated macrophages, MDSC, and Treg have been reported in CLM; these specialized cells can maintain the immunosuppressive environment and inhibit adaptive antitumor immune responses, disrupting the immunologic balance by also</p>

              <p>depleting protective NKs cells.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> Combinatorial approaches with adding or targeting cytokines/chemokines (ie, recombinant IFN-ɣ, anti-IL-10 therapies, IL-12, IL-2 or related cytokines) may overcome this challenge and restore equilibrium.</p>
              <p>Another possibility for the differences observed in our clinical trial as compared with others with VB-111 is that liver metastases, unlike other sites of disease, may be impervious to anti-angiogenic therapies by using vessel co-option, or incorporating pre-exiting vessels from surrounding normal tissue, for tumor vascularization, avoiding immune surveillance.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> VB-111 requires activated angiogenic proliferating endothelial cells for the transgene to be expressed and disrupt neovascularization; hence, if CLM co-opt quiescent endothelial cells for their blood supply in this non-angiogenic mechanism, avoiding neovascularization, VB-111 and other anti-angiogenic therapies may be ineffective. We were limited in our ability to assess the role of anti-angiogenesis in the mechanism of action of VB-111, or even demonstrate viral expression of VB-111 within on-treatment tumor biopsies, since the transgene is specifically expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells, and the inclusion of blood vessels within biopsy samples is difficult to reliably reproduce with image-guided core needle biopsies. Therefore, our tumor-directed biopsies were insufficient to address these questions fully.</p>
              <p>The success of viral-mediated oncology therapies depends on the balance between antiviral immune response and antitumor immunity. With viral vectors that use endemic viruses, such as adenovirus or herpes simplex virus, there is a valid concern that patients may have pre-existing neutralizing antibodies that could result in rapid viral clearance. This may be even more detrimental in formulations given intravenously where viruses can be cleared systemically by circulating neutralizing factors (antibodies and complement factors) prior to reaching the tumor. Neutralization of the adenoviral vector in VB-111 may have played a role in the observed transient immune response and lack of clinical response; however, in the phase I trial of VB-111 in advanced solid tumors, there was no correlation between baseline neutralizing antibody levels and post-therapy disease state or peak anti-Ad-5 IgG titers.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (or development of these antibodies during treatment) have failed to correlate with generation of tumor-specific immune responses in other viral-based therapies.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref></p>
              <p>An important limitation to this study was the small sample size (n=14). However, despite the low number of biospecimen, this study provided insightful contributions into the molecular mechanisms of this novel combination. While an immune response was observed, it was challenging to distinguish between antiviral or antitumor responses, which will require further characterization in future studies with VB-111.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In summary, although negative, the novel anti-angiogenic gene therapy with immune-inducing properties, VB-111, in combination with nivolumab demonstrated activation and proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells after treatment in patients with MSS CLM. Future considerations may involve shorter intervals between doses of VB-111, administration of dual ICIs that may synergistically enhance immune responses, and combinatorial approaches with chemokines/cytokines to overcome the immunosuppressive pressures within the liver.</p>
