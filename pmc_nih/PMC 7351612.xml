              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P11">Project BEGIN (Body Composition, Exercise, and Growth in Preterm Newborns) was designed to 1) fill gaps in our understanding of the relationship between body composition, neuromotor development, and sex in infants born prematurely during the first year of life and 2) determine whether these relationships could be altered by a parent/caregiver administered program to increase motor and physical activity in these infants. We hypothesized that in prematurely born infants during the first year of life following discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU): 1) neuromotor development would be correlated to body composition; 2) these interactions would be influenced by sex; and 3) a caregiver administered intervention to increase motor activity would lead to more rapid increases in the development of fat free mass and neuromotor responsiveness. Although there is some evidence that physical activity interventions early in life can benefit body composition (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the effect of the energy-<italic>expenditure</italic> side of energy balance (namely, motor or physical activity) on neuromotor development remains inadequately understood.</p>
              <p id="P12">Extreme, moderate, and late premature birth are associated with adverse effects across the lifespan, in particular impairment in neuromotor function (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Remarkable progress has been made over the past several decades in improving the NICU care of prematurely born infants. Far less is known about how to optimize neuromotor development in these infants following NICU discharge, and the transition from NICU to home can be profoundly challenging for the caregivers (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Both body composition and neuromotor performance rapidly evolve (and often in an abnormal manner) early in the lives of prematurely born children. Consequently, physical rehabilitative interventions administered by caregivers following NICU discharge are compelling, minimally invasive, and potentially modifiable approaches for mitigating long term health consequences of prematurity (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P13">Neuromotor performance and body composition components [i.e., lean body mass (LBM), bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and fat mass (FM)] are linked across the lifespan both in young children (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and adults (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and in studies performed in animal models, increasing motor activity in the immediate postnatal period led to increased muscle mass later in life (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Circulating osteocalcin is an early indicator of bone mass development in preterm infants (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The development of LBM is mediated by growth factors like insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and inhibited by inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The clinical relevance of IGF-1 in particular is highlighted by its therapeutic use in preterm infants to attenuate retinopathy of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P14">Consequently, we measured IGF-1 and osteocalcin and, as indicators of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). IL-1RA is elevated in inflammatory states and there is mounting preclinical data indicating that therapeutic IL-1 antagonism may reduce inflammation-induced injury in prematurity (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Equally important are data highlighting the need to address sexual dimorphism. For example, sex-associated differences in motor performance can be observed in children as young as 3 years-old (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and in neuromotor function in adolescents exposed prenatally or in early childhood to environmental toxins (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>

                <title>Study Overview.</title>
                <p id="P15">The overall study strategy is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Prematurely born infants were randomly assigned to either: 1) a parent/caregiver implemented assisted exercise and enhanced social interaction program (E), or 2) an enhanced social interaction alone comparison group (C). At NICU discharge and one year following discharge, enrolled infants were studied for body composition [by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)], circulating mediators of growth and inflammation, and neurodevelopment by the progression of standardized tests [Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP), which was specifically designed to test neuromotor performance in the first months of postnatal life (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)]. The TIMP was performed at hospital discharge and again at 3 months corrected age, and the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS)— an observational assessment scale constructed to measure gross motor maturation in infants from birth through independent walking (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) was performed at 3 months and 1 year corrected age.</p>
                <p id="P16">Both the assisted-exercise and comparison groups received structured social interaction approaches developed by Spittle and colleagues (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Social interaction activities were designed to enhance the engagement of caregivers with their infants through singing, speaking, and storytelling, activities which have been shown to improve postnatal development in prematurely born newborns (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). We purposefully chose to provide the social interaction instruction to the comparison group, rather than randomize to a more traditional “routine care” control group because we reached the conclusion that it would be ethically appropriate to offer potentially beneficial programs to both groups. This study was approved by the UCI Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <title>Target Population.</title>
                <p id="P17">The target population for this study was relatively healthy developing preterm infants nearing discharge from the NICU and their primary care givers (most likely a parent). Infants were enrolled from NICUs in our region, predominantly, UCI, Children’s Hospital of Orange County, and Miller Children’s Hospital. These institutions are part of the regional Clinical Trials Ecosystem, a collaboration sponsored by the UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS). The study population consisted of all preterm infant-caregiver dyads who meet the inclusion criteria (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also relied on the attending neonatologist’s general impression of whether the infant-caregiver dyad would be likely to complete the study if enrolled.</p>

              <sec id="S9">
                <title>Instruction for Caregivers.</title>
                <p id="P18">Caregivers were taught to perform guided infant exercises by specially trained occupational and physical therapists and shown how to differentiate between appropriate and unsafe handling of infants during the exercises. Training occurred predominantly in the 2 weeks prior to discharge. The families were visited in the home 2 weeks post discharge and the training personnel determined the necessary number of sessions for an individual caregiver/infant dyad based on the trainer’s assessment of how well the caregiver understood and implemented the exercises and how the infants responded. Each parent/caregiver received about 40 min of instruction. No formal assessment of parent/caregiver skill was undertaken. Additional training of the parent/caregiver occurred at the participants’ home at 3, 6 and nine months. As the infants grew and motorically progressed, the intervention protocol was adapted to include exercises neurodevelopmentally appropriate for the infants’ abilities.</p>

We modified the NDT-based activities every two months to address anticipated changes in motor performance over the first year of life. At each home visit the exercises were observed by a physical or occupational therapist and parents were provided direction and training in the new exercises to use for the following 3-month period. In addition, caregivers were provided with a printed, updated list of exercises which many placed in a prominent place (like a refrigerator) to remind them of the daily regimen. Study staff contacted each family 2–3 times per month to touch base and field questions and concerns.</p>

Among the participants who did not complete the study but were willing to inform us of their discontinuation, the most common explanation was that the study burden (need to keep track of interaction with their infants and/or to perform the prescribed exercises) was too great in the context of busy family life. There were no significant differences between the assisted-exercise and comparison groups in terms of mean gestational age (E, 27 weeks; C, 27 weeks) or birthweight (E, 933 g; C, 930 g). Small for gestational age infants (SGA) comprised 9% of the E-group infants and 13% of the C-group infants (NS).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P31">Gauging the effect of physical and motor activity on the development of body composition in premature infants is challenging due to factors such as achieving an adequate study sample size, distinguishing specific effects of motor activity on body composition when rapid changes in growth and growth mediators are occurring naturally, and the limited methodologies capable of precise measurements of muscle, fat, and bone. The longitudinal data that we observed over a roughly one-year period in a cohort of prematurely born infants provide novel insights into the patterns of body composition growth in this at-risk population. Sexual dimorphisms were observed in key metrics, thus, sex must be accounted for in studies of growth and development from very early in life. We did not demonstrate that our specific caregiver implemented exercise intervention altered the trajectory of growth and development, perhaps because we underestimated the degree of training and support necessary for a caregiver administered program to succeed. Nonetheless, we speculate that the association between LBM and neuromotor assessment over the study duration suggests that levels of physical and motor activity may play a role in the broader development of body composition.</p>
              <p id="P32">An intriguing observation from the study was that neuromotor assessment at the end of the study was significantly correlated with DXA measures of LBM (<xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), in support of a key study hypothesis. The TIMP and AIMS rely on the baby’s motor response to various external stimuli and scale functional capacities and the quality of movement. Muscle function and size, in turn, depend in large measure on the repetitive use of the nerves and muscles involved in physical activity. This is the basis of the training effect known to occur later in life, but the connection between muscle utilization and muscle size and function can be observed early in life as well. Brachial plexus injury at birth leads to reduced muscle mass in the first year of life (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Our earlier study in postnatal rats cited above showed that increasing motor activity in the immediate postnatal period could lead to increased muscle mass later in life (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We speculate that higher levels of motor activity in some infants (for whatever reasons, environmental or innate behavior) were ultimately reflected in both better standardized tests of neuromotor function and increased LBM.</p>
              <p id="P33">An additional major goal of the study was to determine whether growth and neuromotor trajectories in prematurely born infants could be influenced by a caregiver implemented intervention designed to increase physical and motor activity. The intervention appeared to have no effect on DXA measures of body composition or on neuromotor function. A few previous studies conducted before discharge from the NICU have shown that a variety of interventions involving assisted exercise (recently reviewed by Eliakim et al (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)) and massage (recently reviewed by Alvarez et al (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)) may positively influence growth indexes and hospital stay. These previous studies were short term in duration and the intervention was conducted by trained personnel in the NICU.</p>
              <p id="P34">In contrast, our study attempted to train caregivers/parents to provide assisted exercise in the participants’ homes. A major limitation of this approach was the difficulty in quantifying the exercise “dose,” the actual amount of interaction time between the caregiver and the baby and amount of increased physical and motor activity and performance that resulted from the interaction. While we did visit the participants’ home every three months to teach the parents developmentally appropriate exercises, and attempted to contact the care providers up to three times on the months that they were not visited, we recognize that these are not optimal metrics of dose fidelity. Studies designed to improved neuromotor development in premature infants in the post NICU discharge period have been successful, but have also demonstrated that the beneficial effects of regular neuromotor and physical activity can disappear upon cessation of active intervention and supervision by trained professionals (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It is possible that we underestimated the amount of training and support needed by often-busy and stressed caregivers(<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) to consistently administer a motor-activity program capable of altering neurodevelopment and/or body composition. This burden may have contributed to the 39% dropout rate we observed over the course of the year-long observation period.</p>
              <p id="P35">There was a small but significant reduction in the TIMP z-score between baseline and 3-months. The AIMS z-scores were lower at 3-months and remained lower at EOS (<xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Emerging data in premature infants suggests that sustained improvement in neuromotor function depends on continuous, regular intervention by caregivers or providers (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). One possible explanation for our data is that despite our efforts, the level of direct intervention to enhance neuromotor function in premature infants in our region remains suboptimal. Although the SGA infants demonstrated reduced TIMP over the first 3 months after discharge, we observed no further effect of SGA on the AIMS at EOS.</p>
              <p id="P36">We gained insight into some possible biological mechanisms that play a role in the control of body composition early in life in prematurely born infants. IGF-1 increased substantially in our cohort and there was a positive correlation between the increase in IGF-1 and the increase in LBM over the study duration (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Circulating levels of IGF-1 and its related binding proteins are associated with muscle mass, exercise training, and disuse across the lifespan(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). An inverse correlation between IGF-1 and circulating indicators of inflammation have been observed early in postnatal life in prematurity (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In the present study we noted increases in IGF-1 and decreases in IL-1ra (as well as a significant inverse correlation) suggesting that the inverse relationship between growth factors and inflammation can be observed during the first year of postnatal life in infants born prematurely.</p>
              <p id="P37">In recent years, the observation of increased rates of obesity later in life in infants born prematurely (whether SGA or appropriate-weight for gestational age) has formed the hypothesis that abnormal “catch-up fat” accumulation in early postnatal life may play a role (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). A novel observation from our study was the inverse correlation between body fat accumulation and circulating indicators of inflammation (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Murine models show that IL-6 inhibits growth in postnatal life (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In adults, circulating IL-6 is associated with sarcopenia and cachexia(<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and IL-6 stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), indicating, possibly, a direct inhibitory effect of inflammatory mediators on fat tissue accumulation in postnatal life. Our data suggest that the balance between growth factors and antagonistic proinflammatory mediators influence fat and lean tissue accumulation early in life in prematurely born infants.</p>
              <p id="P38">We found a significant decrease in osteocalcin over the study period. This was observed despite the increase in BMD and BMC. Osteocalcin is higher in children compared to adults, peaking in both boys and girls at the age of the pubertal growth spurt (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The decline in osteocalcin suggests that serum levels may reflect growth velocity rather than growth in absolute terms. Data from premature infants reveals that linear growth velocity is as high as 1.4–1.6 cm/week at 30–34 weeks post gestational age and declines to about 0.7 cm/week at 50 weeks post gestational (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Most likely, bone growth and mineralization continued over the duration of the study, but the declining rate of bone growth was reflected by the declining osteocalcin levels.</p>
              <p id="P39">Little is known regarding sexual dimorphism in growth and development in the first year of postnatal life in infants born prematurely. We found evidence for sex effects in body composition and growth mediators. BMD was lower at EOS in the females. Reduced peak bone mass has been observed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> decade of life of individuals with a history of premature birth and low birth-weight, but no sex differences were observed (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We also found greater lean body mass at EOS in the male infants. Fields et al. (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) noted greater lean tissue in full term male compared with female infants at 1 month of age, estimated using whole body plethysmography. In the Fields’ study, sex differences disappeared by 6 months of age, leading the authors to conjecture that the lean mass differences paralleled the higher levels of androgen levels at birth in male infants which dissipates roughly by 6 months. Despite the lower LBM levels in the females at EOS, their IGF-1 circulating levels were higher.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="P40">This study reports potentially useful information about changes in body composition and associated circulating growth biomarkers over the first year of life following NICU discharge in infants born prematurely. Our attempts to increase muscle mass and neuromotor development through a parent provided assisted exercise intervention was, however, not successful. We found a significant association between indexes of neuromotor development and body composition, but whether increased neuromotor development and/or motor activity stimulated LBM growth, or visa versa could not be determined from our data. These observations form the basis for studies that can optimize the enhanced physical activity “dose” over the long term and provides insights/considerations for how to support parent compliance for busy caregivers and families of prematurely born infants.</p>
