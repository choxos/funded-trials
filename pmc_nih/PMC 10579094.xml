              <abstract id="Abs1">
                <p id="Par1">Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise in capturing primary resistance to immunotherapy. BR.36 is a multi-center, randomized, ctDNA-directed, phase 2 trial of molecular response-adaptive immuno-chemotherapy for patients with lung cancer. In the first of two independent stages, 50 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer received pembrolizumab as standard of care. The primary objectives of stage 1 were to ascertain ctDNA response and determine optimal timing and concordance with radiologic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response. Secondary endpoints included the evaluation of time to ctDNA response and correlation with progression-free and overall survival. Maximal mutant allele fraction clearance at the third cycle of pembrolizumab signified molecular response (mR). The trial met its primary endpoint, with a sensitivity of ctDNA response for RECIST response of 82% (90% confidence interval (CI): 52â€“97%) and a specificity of 75% (90% CI: 56.5â€“88.5%). Median time to ctDNA response was 2.1â€‰months (90% CI: 1.5â€“2.6), and patients with mR attained longer progression-free survival (5.03â€‰months versus 2.6â€‰months) and overall survival (not reached versus 7.23â€‰months). These findings are incorporated into the ctDNA-driven interventional molecular response-adaptive second stage of the BR.36 trial in which patients at risk of progression are randomized to treatment intensification or continuation of therapy.

              <p id="Par3">Liquid biopsies are gaining momentum in immuno-oncology (IO) as they can be used to rapidly and accurately determine clinical response, especially in the metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As the landscape of IO-based therapies and clinical trials is expanding, we face emerging challenges related to heterogeneity in clinical responses and insufficiency of imaging to rapidly and accurately capture therapeutic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, currently used predictive biomarkers, such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression or tumor mutation burden (TMB), fail to consistently predict therapeutic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These challenges highlight the urgent unmet need to implement molecular response-driven approaches to interpret outcomes and guide therapy selection in IO. Liquid biopsy analyses of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) have shown promise in capturing tumor burden dynamics during immune checkpoint blockade, allowing patients with primary resistance to be rapidly identified and redirected to receive alternative therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Minimally invasive dynamic ctDNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses that can be used as an early endpoint of immunotherapy response may, thus, help guide therapy to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize toxicity risks for patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Focusing on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as a representative example, where both pembrolizumab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and combination pembrolizumabâ€“carboplatinâ€“taxane/pemetrexed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> are US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada approved first-line treatment options, it is crucial to determine which patients would benefit from pembrolizumab monotherapy and which should receive combination immuno-chemotherapy. Such therapeutic decisions are not currently supported by either tumor PD-L1 or TMB status, introducing an unmet clinical need and an opportunity for dynamic assessments of ctDNA to guide treatment selection based on real-time tracking of circulating tumor burden. Nevertheless, several outstanding urgent questions need to be answered before implementation of liquid biopsy-guided ctDNA molecular responses in clinical decision-making. What is the best measure for tracking circulating tumor burden and which ctDNA features accurately capture survival outcomes? Should a tumor-informed or tumor-agnostic approach be implemented? What signifies a ctDNA molecular response and when does it occur? What is the concordance between ctDNA molecular response and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) radiographic response? What are the patient subsets that would most benefit from a molecularly refined response assessment?</p>
              <p id="Par5">To address these challenging questions and further establish the role of ctDNA response as an early endpoint for clinical outcomes with immune checkpoint blockade, we designed a two-stage ctDNA-directed molecular response adaptive clinical trial, with the first stage focusing on answering the questions posed above and reported here.</p>

The trial consists of two stages. In stage 1 (observational), patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC who were eligible to receive standard-of-care single-agent pembrolizumab were enrolled in a single-arm study to evaluate, through serial liquid biopsy analyses, the optimal definition, timing and concordance of ctDNA molecular response with radiographic response (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The interventional randomized second stage of the trial will evaluate the potential clinical benefit of tailoring treatment to ctDNA molecular response (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Key eligibility criteria included <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ALK</italic> clinically actionable mutation-negative, immune checkpoint inhibitor-naive and chemotherapy-naive metastatic NSCLC with a PD-L1 expression level of â‰¥1% (<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Serial blood samples were obtained before treatment administration on cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1, pre-treatment), cycle 2, day 1 (C2D1, 3â€‰weeks) and cycle 3, day 1 (C3D1, 6â€‰weeks) for each study participant, and serial liquid biopsy analyses were performed for quantitative assessment of ctDNA dynamics. With the assumption that more than 80% of patients with metastatic NSCLC have detectable tumor-derived mutations in plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, a sample size of 50 patients was estimated to ensure acceptable sensitivity and specificity for ctDNA molecular response (<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>BR.36 trial schema.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, The first stage of the BR.36 trial enrolled patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC who did not harbor clinically actionable genomic alterations in <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>ALK</italic> and had a PD-L1 expression level of â‰¥1%.

Serial liquid biopsies were collected before treatment administration on C1D1 (baseline), C2D1 (3â€‰weeks) and C3D1 (6â€‰weeks), followed by ctDNA molecular response assessments at these timepoints.

C1D1 plasma was collected for all 50 patients; C1D1 and C2D1 plasma samples were collected for 45 patients; and plasma samples were collected for all three timepoints for 39 patients. Five patients were deemed not evaluable because of missed plasma collection or non-evaluable RECIST assessments. Of the 45 evaluable patients, 10 had undetectable ctDNA at all timepoints (no tumor-specific plasma variants detected), resulting in 35 patients with evaluable ctDNA and RECIST responses.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41591_2023_2598_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e613"/></fig></p>

The first and last patients were enrolled on trial on 26 May 2020 and 5 April 2022, respectively. A total of 50 patients were accrued to the trial; all patients were followed for ctDNA molecular response and clinical response for a minimum of 12â€‰weeks, and the clinical trial database was locked on 20 September 2022 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Patient disposition and CONSORT diagram are described in detail in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; there were two major protocol violations due to divergent timing of laboratory or imaging assessments (<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Median follow-up time was 13.5â€‰months (range, 2.5â€“23.0â€‰months; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.9â€“14.5â€‰months). Most patients were ever-smokers (98%), had stage IV NSCLC (98%) and had no prior systemic therapy (92%). The trial cohort consisted of 82% White, 52% female and 56% aged 65â€‰years or older, and 76% of participants had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 1 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Seventy-six percent of tumors were adenocarcinomas, and 96% had a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of â‰¥50%.

                <p id="Par18">As part of the studyâ€™s exploratory analyses, we evaluated whether a tumor-informed approach would more accurately capture ctDNA molecular responses. Of the 50 patients enrolled in the BR.36 study, only 19 (38%) had available matched tumor samples (<xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">9</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Furthermore, of the 19 patients with sufficient tumor samples sequenced, five had undetectable ctDNA, resulting in 14 (28%) patients with matched tumor NGS performed and detectable plasma variants. Of these, 11 (22%) patients had confirmed tumor-derived plasma variants by tumor NGS (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">10</xref>). We found a high concordance of 90.9% between the cellular origin of variants determined by the tumor-agnostic WBC DNA approach and confirmed tumor origin by matched tumor NGS. In the subset of patients with confirmed tumor origin of the plasma variants (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰11), ctDNA molecular responses were 100% concordant between the tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par19">There is an unmet clinical need to implement real-time minimally invasive molecular analyses to capture therapeutic response and guide decision-making in the context of precision IO. We report here the findings of stage 1 of the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) BR.36 trial, which aimed to define ctDNA molecular response, optimal timing of assessment and concordance with radiographic response. Employing a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed panel NGS approach, ctDNA molecular response, defined as complete clearance of circulating tumor load after two cycles of pembrolizumab, was largely concordant with radiographic response assessments but, notably, was more informative in predicting OS. These findings are now incorporated into the second ctDNA molecular response-driven interventional randomized stage of the trial that will assess the value of adjusting therapy based on ctDNA response.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The landscape of IO is expanding rapidly; however, optimal patient selection for immunotherapy represents a critical challenge that is intensified by the heterogeneity of clinical responses and insufficiency of imaging to fully and timely capture changes in tumor burden and therapeutic response. Snapshot biomarkers currently used to guide therapy selection, such PD-L1 expression and TMB, rely on analysis of tumor tissue obtained through invasive single-region biopsies, which may not sufficiently capture the clonal complexity of tumors, may be problematic in the event of low tumor purity sampling and, importantly, do not capture the evolving tumor under the selective pressure of immunotherapy. These challenges highlight the urgent unmet need to develop molecularly informed strategies to improve patient selection, enable early and accurate response assessment and facilitate long-term response monitoring during immunotherapy. To this end, liquid biopsies are emerging as powerful minimally invasive approaches to monitor tumor burden as cancer cells go through immunotherapy-induced evolutionary bottlenecks and to rapidly and precisely capture therapeutic response.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We hypothesized that ctDNA molecular response can be used as an enrichment strategy to identify patients at high risk of clinical disease progression (those with molecular disease progression), thus limiting the heterogeneity of the target population, which, in turn, opens a therapeutic widow of opportunity for early intervention and interception of therapeutic primary resistance. An increasing number of studies support the role of ctDNA molecular response as an early endpoint of therapeutic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Despite the substantial progress made, there remain outstanding questions that need to be answered before implementation of ctDNA molecular responses in clinical decision-making, starting with what signifies a ctDNA molecular response. Although different measures have been used to capture circulating tumor burden during immune checkpoint blockade, including the mean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or maximum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> MAF of tumor-derived alterations, a consensus definition of circulating tumor load is lacking. Similarly, several definitions have been proposed for ctDNA molecular response that are, in part, dependent on the NGS assay used and its sensitivity and negative predictive value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Circulating tumor load regression more than 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, any ctDNA reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or complete elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> have been proposed as potential definitions of ctDNA molecular response. In the ctMoniTR pooled analyses of ctDNA dynamics in IO-treated NSCLC, changes in maxMAF were shown to be the most predictive of therapeutic response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The heterogeneity in cohort composition, treatment administered, timepoints analyzed and ctDNA methodology used represent critical challenges in these previous retrospective proof-of-concept studies as well as their pooled analyses. BR.36 was prospectively designed to address these challenges, and serial liquid biopsy analyses revealed that ctDNA complete elimination better captured clinical outcomes in the context of the NGS tumor-agnostic assay used in the study, which also incorporated patient-matched WBCs. Furthermore, we investigated whether mean, median or maximal MAF of tumor-derived variants can differentially serve as a proxy for circulating tumor burden, but we did not identify any differences, which is, in part, related to our definition of molecular response that entails ctDNA reduction to undetectable levels.</p>
              <p id="Par22">How early does molecular response occur? Several proof-of-concept studies have indicated that the optimal timepoint for ctDNA response lies between 4â€‰weeks and 9â€‰weeks from single-agent immune checkpoint blockade initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the first stage of BR.36, we found that the optimal timepoint is at C3D1, after two cycles of pembrolizumab; taking into account treatment delays, ctDNA response in BR.36 was determined at 8â€‰weeks from treatment initiation. Importantly, understanding the true concordance between molecular and radiographic responses and how these differentially capture long-term outcomes in a clinical trial setting is imperative to support the clinical utility of ctDNA response. ctDNA molecular response may be most informative in characterizing the heterogenous group of patients with radiographically stable disease. ctDNA response has been shown to predict outcome with immune checkpoint blockade, such that patients with NSCLC with stable disease that cleared ctDNA had significantly longer PFS than patients who did not clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Patients with radiographic stable disease at first assessment who eventually attained a radiographic response have been reported to predominantly show ctDNA molecular responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although a dedicated analysis of the heterogeneity of stable disease with respect to ctDNA response and long-term clinical outcomes was not included in the pre-specified analyses of the BR.36 study, patients within the stable disease subset had differential clinical outcomes that matched their ctDNA molecular response. Taken together, radiographic imaging may fail to timely detect the magnitude of therapeutic response for patients with stable disease, and ctDNA response may be of particular value in assessing therapeutic response in this setting.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Furthermore, we explored whether a tumor NGS-informed approach would be feasible and more informative than the tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach that we employed in BR.36. Tumor-informed liquid biopsy approaches for patients with metastatic disease may not be feasible from a tissue sufficiency standpoint and may restrict the evaluable plasma variants to these detected by single-region heterogenous tumor sample NGS. WBC DNA-informed liquid biopsy approaches can improve the specificity for tracking circulating tumor load compared to plasma-only approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> while retaining the advantage of capturing tumor heterogeneity and, as such, serve as a compelling alternative to tumor-informed approaches. WBC DNA-informed approaches also address the emergent challenge with biological noise in liquid biopsies, driven by mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it is plausible that alterations deemed as â€˜tumor derivedâ€™ by a tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach may be derived from another lineage or represent ultra-low abundance clonal hematopoiesis alterations that were not detected by error-correction NGS of matched WBC. Notably, in the BR.36 cohort, only 22% of patients would have been evaluable by employing a tumor-informed liquid biopsy approach. Although the tissueâ€“plasma NGS concordance analyses were limited by the lack of a trial-mandated tissue biopsy, it is important to note that, for the small fraction of patients with matched plasma and tumor NGS, we noted 100% concordance in ctDNA molecular responses, which further supports the validity of our tumor-agnostic WBC DNA-informed approach.</p>
              <p id="Par24">This study has several limitations, including the cohort size and the RECIST BOR of 32%, which likely reflected the real-world nature of the trial and reduced the statistical power to assess correlation of ctDNA with RECIST responses. Furthermore, as expected, approximately 20% of patients enrolled were not evaluable for ctDNA molecular response due to undetectable ctDNA, which represents a limitation given the shrinkage of the study population. Conceptually, a more sensitive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tumor-informed liquid biopsy bespoke approach may reduce the number of cases with undetectable ctDNA; however, such an approach may not be feasible, especially in the context of a real-time ctDNA molecular response-adaptive interventional trial. Finally, the BR.36 study was powered to address the concordance between ctDNA and radiographic response, and, as such, assessment of additional endpoints may be limited by the study design. Per the trial design, we were limited in assessing the lead time between ctDNA response and RECIST response. ctDNA molecular response was assessed on C3D1 (2.1â€‰months, accounting for delays within the BR.36 study cohort, otherwise on week 6 after pembrolizumab initiation), whereas best radiographic response was assessed at 12â€‰weeks after treatment initiation. Although RECIST responses were evaluated at 6â€‰weeks, together with ctDNA responses, BOR did not occur at 6â€‰weeks, rather at 12â€‰weeks; as such, ctDNA response provides the earliest and most accurate readout of best overall therapeutic responses.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Taken together, we show that ctDNA molecular response can identify patients with metastatic NSCLC less likely to attain favorable clinical outcomes with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy, and this opens a therapeutic window of opportunity for treatment intensification for patients with molecular disease progression. Our findings were implemented in the design of the planned stage 2 of the BR.36 trial, which uses ctDNA detection after two cycles of standard-of-care pembrolizumab monotherapy to identify patients with metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 â‰¥50% at high risk for disease progression, who are subsequently randomized to treatment intensification with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy versus continuation of pembrolizumab. Overall, our findings support the implementation of liquid biopsies in interventional IO clinical trials and further advance the evidentiary roadmap toward integration of ctDNA molecular responses in clinical decision-making for the increasing number of patients receiving immunotherapy.</p>

                <p id="Par44">Of note, a PD-L1 TPS â‰¥50% was initially indicated as an inclusion criterion for the BR.36 trial, given the regulatory approvals in the United States and in Canada at the time of study design and activation. Throughout the duration of the BR.36 trial, the practice guidance changed in both the United Stated and Canada, allowing for pembrolizumab monotherapy for NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS â‰¥1%, and this was reflected in a trial amendment and revision of the eligibility criteria to include NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS â‰¥1%. This amendment was implemented in January 2021, after which 18 patients were enrolled. Despite the revised eligibility criteria, most patients enrolled in BR.36 had tumors with PD-L1 â‰¥50%, reflecting the preference for pembrolizumab monotherapy in this context given the higher magnitude of benefit.</p>

Subsequently, genomic DNA was sheared to a target size of approximately 200-bp fragments using Covaris focused ultrasonication. NGS libraries were prepared from cfDNA and fragmented genomic WBC DNA using a target of 40â€‰ng of sample input through end-repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation with custom molecular barcoded adapters. Subsequently, libraries were PCR amplified, and target enrichment was performed through in-solution hybrid capture using the PGDx elio plasma resolve 33-gene panel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Finally, libraries were pooled and sequenced with 150-bp paired-end reads using the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Although the liquid biopsy analyses in the first stage of the BR.36 trial were not performed in real time, the turnaround time of the assay is 6â€“8â€‰d, which allows for the implementation of this approach in the second interventional stage of the trial. An overview of the plasma and WBC DNA samples sequenced, together with their sequencing quality control metrics, is shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>. Somatic variant identification was performed using validated machine-learning-based algorithms, which have demonstrated high accuracy for somatic mutation detection and differentiating technical artifacts to enable analyses of single-nucleotide variants, small insertions/deletions, copy number amplifications, translocations and microsatellite instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

To further expand these analyses beyond contrived samples and incorporate the ctDNA findings from the BR.36 study, we evaluated the variants detected and used for ctDNA molecular response assessment to calculate the estimated limit of detection based on the error-corrected coverage obtained through a binomial model. To determine sensitivity of the assay, we analyzed the set of 56 genomic positions harboring tumor-derived mutations at the baseline timepoint (C1D1). At each position, given the observed distinct coverage, the probability of observing a minimum of three error-corrected mutation counts at any given alteration MAF level was calculated using the binomial distribution. For each MAF level, the median of the estimated probabilities across the 56 positions was determined and used as an estimate for the assay sensitivity.</p>

Variants were classified by origin in three categories: tumor derived, clonal hematopoiesis derived and germline. Non-cancer hotspot mutations with a MAF â‰¥25% in all plasma and WBC samples from the same individual were classified as germline and were removed from further analysis. Non-germline variants detected in plasma as well as in matched WBC DNA were classified as clonal hematopoiesis derived and were removed from further analysis, with the exception of cancer hotspot mutations. Cancer hotspot mutations (for instance, <italic>KRAS</italic> G12C) were considered tumor derived independent of detection in the matched WBC DNA samples, the latter likely indicating buffy coat contamination by circulating tumor cells or suboptimal pre-analytical processing. Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6</xref> summarizes the cellular origin of variants detected by matched plasmaâ€“WBC DNA NGS.

                        <p>To expand the post hoc analyses of differential outcomes based on ctDNA response for patients with radiographically stable disease on immune checkpoint blockade, we computed the concordance between radiographic and ctDNA responses from previously reported IO cohorts together with BR.36 (Anagnostou et al., Cancer Research, 2019, Bratman et al., Nature Cancer, 2020, Murray et al., Cancer Research, 2021, Sivapalan et al., Clin Cancer Research, 2023). (<bold>a</bold>) These analyses showed that the concordance between radiographic (CR/PR vs SD/PD) and ctDNA responses depends on the fraction of patients with stable disease, a group that shows heterogeneity with respect to ctDNA responses across all cohorts analyzed (<bold>b</bold>). (<bold>c</bold>) Looking at differences in progression-free and overall survival within the radiographically stable patients across studies, ctDNA response accurately captured longer progression-free and overall survival (Anagnostou et al.: median OSâ€‰=â€‰13.6 for mR vs 13.7 for mPD, logrank pâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.05; median PFSâ€‰=â€‰12.3 for mR vs 5.2 for mPD, logrank pâ€‰=â€‰9.8e-3. Murray et al.: median OSâ€‰=â€‰23.0 for mR vs 5.9 for mPD, logrank pâ€‰=â€‰8.0e-4; median PFSâ€‰=â€‰23.01 for mR vs 2.7 for mPD, logrank pâ€‰=â€‰4.8e-3). Stable disease annotation was not available for patients from Bratman et al. cohort, while only one patient who received immunotherapy had stable disease in the Sivapalan et al. cohort, resulting in exclusion of these cohorts from panels b and c. Median survival estimates were derived using survival fit function.</p>

At each on-therapy time point, the change in MAF measure (maximum, mean, or median) compared to the baseline sample was calculated, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess performance. These analyses supported a slightly higher analytical performance of ctDNA molecular response at C3D1, with no significant differences noted when maximal, mean or median mutant allele frequencies of tumor-derived mutations were used to measure circulating tumor burden. Area under the curve along with 95% confidence intervals are reported.</p>
