                <p>Caloric restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the incidence of diabetes in obese individuals. The underlying mechanisms whereby CR improves insulin sensitivity are not clear. We evaluated the effect of 16 weeks of CR on whole-body insulin sensitivity by pancreatic clamp before and after CR in 11 obese participants (BMI = 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared with 9 matched control subjects (BMI = 34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Compared with the control subjects, CR increased the glucose infusion rate needed to maintain euglycemia during hyperinsulinemia, indicating enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. This improvement in insulin sensitivity was not accompanied by changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity or oxidant emissions, nor were there changes in skeletal muscle ceramide, diacylglycerol, or amino acid metabolite levels. However, CR lowered insulin-stimulated thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) levels and enhanced nonoxidative glucose disposal. These results support a role for TXNIP in mediating the improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity after CR.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>More than one-third of adults and 17% of youth in the U.S. are obese (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Obesity is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance), with a high predilection to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Obesity results from the imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Altered function of skeletal muscle mitochondria (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), the predominant organelle responsible for cellular energy metabolism, is reported to occur in obese people. Moreover, increased oxidative stress (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and accumulation of lipids, ceramides, and diacylglycerol (DAG) are reported to occur in insulin-resistant states, including in obesity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Altered glucose (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), fatty acid (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and amino acid metabolism (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) are reported in obese people, including an inability to adjust to fuel availability (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Together, these data support a hypothesis that the failure to safely partition a chronic fuel surplus contributes to insulin resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, reducing caloric intake is a successful therapeutic strategy to improve insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>Caloric restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and reduces the incidence of diabetes and related metabolic disorders. The underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of improved insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, however, remain to be fully understood. An investigation of CR on muscle mitochondrial physiology reported that CR enhanced insulin sensitivity without improving mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A 16-week CR intervention was reported to decrease total skeletal muscle DAG and ceramide content (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) in obese people; however, whether these declines in lipid metabolites were related to the dietary differences before these measurements was not clear. Moreover, the changes in DAG and ceramide after CR did not correlate with improvements in insulin sensitivity, suggesting additional pathways might be involved (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Emerging evidence suggests a role for thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an α-arrestin family member, as a key negative regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and in cellular fuel substrate partitioning in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). TXNIP-deficient mice, for example, exhibit hypoglycemia during prolonged fasting (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), maintain skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity when challenged with a high-fat diet (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and are unable to utilize lipid fuels (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, high levels of TXNIP in vitro decrease insulin-stimulated glucose transport (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and elevate cellular oxidative stress (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, insulin-resistant individuals and those with T2D exhibit elevations in TXNIP mRNA (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Hence TXNIP represents a potential key regulator of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle and might be involved in the improvement in metabolic inflexibility and insulin sensitivity imparted by CR.</p>
              <p>To address these knowledge gaps, we performed a pilot study in which we systematically evaluated whole-body insulin sensitivity using the pancreatic clamp technique before and after 16 weeks of CR or control (CON). The CR program was designed to reduce total body weight by ∼10% without changing physical activity levels. We hypothesized that CR would improve peripheral insulin sensitivity and that the improvement could be explained by reductions in insulin-stimulated TXNIP expression. We therefore determined skeletal muscle TXNIP mRNA expression and protein content after a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in the postabsorptive state. Other purported causes of skeletal muscle insulin resistance were also measured after an overnight fast, including mitochondrial energetics, mitochondrial (mt)H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions, whole-body metabolic flexibility, skeletal muscle DAG, ceramide, amino acids, and plasma inflammatory factors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of CR on skeletal muscle insulin resistance.</p>

                <p>For the baseline studies, 29 participants gave written informed consent, which was approved by the Mayo Foundation Institutional Review Board. Participants were included if their BMI was ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and they were between the ages of 45 and 65 years at the time of screening. Exclusion criteria were smoking, participation in a structured exercise program more than twice weekly for ≥30 min, fasting blood glucose value ≥7 mmol/L, or taking medications known to affect energy metabolism or insulin sensitivity, renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL), chronic active liver disease (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase &gt;3 times normal), anticoagulant therapy, or active coronary artery disease.</p>
                <p>Before and after 16 weeks of CR or CON, two outpatient visits and one inpatient visit were scheduled. Before the outpatient visits, participants were instructed to fast overnight from 10:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> the evening before and to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 h preceding the visits. One outpatient visit consisted of an MRI to measure subcutaneous and visceral fat distribution and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The second outpatient visit was for measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE) for the calculation of a weight-maintenance diet (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 Canopy system), DEXA scan (Lunar DPX-L; Lunar Radiation, Madison, WI), and VO<sub>2</sub>peak test on a bicycle ergometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

One outpatient visit consisted of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, and the second outpatient visit was for measurements of REE, DEXA scan, and a VO<sub>2</sub>peak test on a bicycle ergometer. An inpatient visit at baseline and after 16 weeks of the intervention was conducted after 5 days of a weight-maintaining diet provided by the CRU metabolic kitchen. The inpatient visit consisted of a two-stage (low- and high-dose insulin) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic pancreatic clamp over 6 h, followed by a skeletal muscle biopsy. Blood samples were obtained every 10 min to adjust the GIR to maintain euglycemia at ∼90 mg/dL. After the clamp and biopsy were completed, standardized meals were provided to keep participants’ weight stable. The following morning in the postabsorptive state, a second fasted skeletal muscle biopsy was performed. *Blood draw.</p>

Upon admission to the CRU, no calories were consumed after 2100 h to achieve a 10-h fast before the two-stage insulin euglycemic pancreatic clamp the following morning, as previously published (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), with modifications as follows: the following morning at 0400 h, a primed [6,6<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose bolus (6 mg ⋅ kg fat-free mass[FFM]<sup>−1</sup>) was administered, followed by a 9-h continuous infusion of [6,6<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose (started at 4 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ h<sup>−1</sup> then titrated downward over the infusion time period to match anticipated changes in endogenous glucose production [EGP]). At 0600 h, gas exchange was measured by indirect calorimetry for 30 min for REE determination. Then at 0700 h, glucagon (0.001 μg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>), somatostatin (0.093 μg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>), and growth hormone (0.0047 μg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>) were infused for 6 h. Insulin was infused from 0700 to 1000 h at 0.62 mU ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup> and then from 1000 to 1300 h at 2.3 mU ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>. A 40% dextrose with 2% enrichment of [6,6<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose was infused as needed to maintain blood glucose above 4.7 mmol/L from 0700 to 1000 h and then between 4.7 and 5.3 mmol/L from 1000 to 1300 h.</p>
                <p>Blood samples were collected in a heated hotbox (131<bold>°</bold>F) through a retrograde intravenous catheter at baseline for glucose and hormone levels, and every 10 min during the clamp to maintain euglycemia. In addition, blood samples were collected every 20 min from 0600 to 0700, 0900 to 1000, and 1200 to 1300 to measure plasma [6,6<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]glucose. At 1330 h, a percutaneous needle muscle biopsy specimen (350–400 mg) was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under local anesthesia, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80<bold>°</bold>F for future analysis (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This biopsy sample was used for analysis of TXNIP mRNA and protein content. The participant remained in the CRU through the remainder of the day and was given a weight-maintenance diet until 2200 h.</p>
                <p>At 0700 h the following morning, a second muscle biopsy specimen was obtained under local anesthesia, and ∼100 mg was used immediately for mitochondrial function measurements of isolated mitochondria and mtH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The remainder was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80<bold>°</bold>F for future analysis, including DAG, ceramide, and amino acid measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>After the baseline study visits, participants were randomly assigned to CR or CON for 16 weeks. The CR program consisted of removing 1,000 kcal from the participant’s daily allowance of fat and carbohydrate. Protein content (g/day) remained constant. To assist in achieving a 1,000 kcal daily deficit, participants were provided meals from the Mayo Clinic CRU kitchen for the first 5 days and met with a registered dietitian weekly or more frequently if needed throughout the entire intervention to monitor weight loss and adherence to the CR diet. Portioned meal replacement products (New Lifestyle Diet Inc., San Ramon, CA) were also provided as needed by the dietitians throughout the intervention to assist in adherence. A participant who failed to lose weight on 2 consecutive weeks with the dietitians was provided with meals from the metabolic kitchen for another 5 days, together with additional weekly meetings to appropriately address adherence. The CON group participants were instructed to maintain their normal eating and activities of daily living. Both groups were instructed to wear an accelerometer throughout the 16-week period to ensure the daily physical activity level did not differ between groups or vary throughout the time of the intervention (data not shown).</p>

Body weight, lean mass, and fat mass were higher in the CON group at baseline. After the 16-week intervention, total body weight, visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, BMI, body fatness, and fasting insulin concentrations all decreased in the CR group, but there was no change in CON participants. Although FFA concentrations did not change, fasting β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations increased in the CR group. Participants in the CR group lost on average 10.1 ± 1.2% of total body weight during the 16-week period.</p>

                <p>The integrated area under the curve (AUC) for the GIR required to maintain euglycemia during the last hour of the clamp increased from baseline to follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic>–<italic>C</italic></xref>) with the AUC for the last hour equal to 431 ± 73.7 to 629 ± 61.7 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup> in the CR group, indicating that CR increased insulin sensitivity, whereas no change was found in the CON group (600 ± 94.3 to 610 ± 104.6 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>). This corresponded to a glucose Rd on high-dose insulin of 7 ± 1.1 to 11 ± 0.9 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 9 ± 1.4 to 9 ± 1.5 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup> in the CR and CON groups, respectively. Because randomization resulted in the CON group having a significantly higher AUC at baseline than the CR group and CR increased the AUC to a similar level to that of the CON group, we compared the AUC for the last hour from a reference population of nine lean but sedentary participants (66 ± 0.4 years, BMI 27 ± 1.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who underwent an identical clamp procedure and found the lean participants exhibited a significantly higher AUC of 848 ± 68.7 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared with the CON and CR group in the current study, demonstrating that indeed both groups were insulin resistant. EGP did not change after CR (3 ± 0.3 to 3 ± 0.1 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>) and did not change in CON (3 ± 0.8 to 3 ± 0.4 mg ⋅ kgFFM<sup>−1</sup> ⋅ min<sup>−1</sup>), whereas the percentage suppression of EGP from fasting to low-dose insulin slightly increased but did not reach statistical significance after CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). No change in the percentage suppression of EGP was found in CON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>). Insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone levels were effectively clamped, and C-peptide levels were repressed throughout the 6-h clamp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0675/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 2</ext-link>). Indirect calorimetry measurements after an overnight fast (basal) showed a significant decrease in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) after CR compared with CON (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). That decrease in the fasting RER drove increased lipid oxidation during basal conditions and the significant increase in ΔRER from basal to clamp conditions after CR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). CR significantly increased nonoxidative glucose disposal under clamp conditions (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p>

The absence of any change in mitochondrial capacity was confirmed in vivo using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The finding in the current study that insulin-induced skeletal muscle TXNIP mRNA and protein expression change after CR provides novel insight into the mechanism by which peripheral insulin sensitivity is enhanced by CR in adults at high risk of developing T2D. Importantly, these findings potentially provide an important link between skeletal muscle substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity. A primary defect in individuals with T2D is reduced skeletal muscle nonoxidative glucose disposal under insulin-stimulated conditions (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In the current study, enhanced nonoxidative glucose disposal, likely occurring in skeletal muscle as glycogen synthesis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), primarily accounted for higher glucose Rd (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). However, we did not observe any changes in many commonly purported determinants of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We did not observe any effect of CR on intramuscular DAG, ceramide, or amino acid metabolites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0675/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0675/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). No effect on skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity or mtH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The most important finding is the significant decrease in skeletal muscle TXNIP transcript and protein expression after the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) and lack of a similar change in TXNIP after the CON period. We further observed that the change in glucose Rd during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp during the 16-week period in all participants was significantly correlated to the change in TXNIP in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic> and<italic> D</italic></xref>), supporting a hypothesis that the reduction in TXNIP at least partly explains the increase in insulin-induced glucose disposal.</p>
              <p>The results thus provide new mechanistic insight on how CR enhances insulin-stimulated glucose disposal through a key redox-sensitizing protein in skeletal muscle. TXNIP impairs insulin signaling by inhibiting thioredoxin NADPH–dependent reduction of protein disulfides on phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). When stabilized, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphatase has been shown to oppose insulin signaling in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Furthermore, skeletal muscle TXNIP deletion that protects against high-fat diet–induced insulin resistance (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) is independent of any apparent changes in mitochondrial function (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Participants in the current study showed no changes in any of the measured indices of mitochondrial function or mtH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>), but demonstrated changes in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), supporting an independent role for TXNIP from mitochondrial function.</p>
              <p>There is growing interest in understanding how lifestyle interventions such as CR mediate their insulin-sensitizing effects in obese individuals at high risk of developing T2D. We previously showed that lifelong CR enhanced skeletal muscle antioxidant status and reduced oxidative damage to proteins, suggesting improved cellular redox status (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). More recently, we demonstrated that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training in insulin-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced skeletal muscle endogenous antioxidant activity, reduced markers of cellular oxidative stress, and lowered chronically elevated mtH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions to those of healthy control subjects. The current study demonstrated that improvement of insulin sensitivity by weight loss in CR is mediated by mechanisms other than by altered mitochondrial function, although we did not measure mitochondrial fatty acid oxidative capacity.</p>
              <p>Early reports indicated that CR enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity in obese individuals and in individuals with T2D in association with declines in skeletal muscle lipid content (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However, subsequent investigations of exercise training (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and acute lipid infusions in rodents (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) have identified that lipid content, although predictive of T2D risk (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), is unlikely to be directly involved in reducing insulin action on skeletal muscle. Instead, much work in the field has identified bioactive lipid species, including ceramide (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), DAGs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and elevated amino acid metabolites (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), as causes of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. We measured each of those known causes in the current study and found that CR did not change their levels in skeletal muscle but did improve peripheral insulin sensitivity. Our current results are therefore in contrast to others (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), who found significant decreases in skeletal muscle DAG and ceramide levels after 16 weeks of CR. We analyzed not only total ceramide and DAG but also the subcellular localization of DAG species that are likely to affect insulin sensitivity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db15-0675/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4</ext-link>). Of interest, anserine, an amino acid metabolite involved in scavenging endogenous carbonyls (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), increased after CR. This may potentially contribute to the reduction of carbonylated proteins, nucleic acids, and aminophospholipids, with a potential effect on protein function. It is reasonable to state that while on CR, insulin sensitivity and many metabolites may both change, but after CR and then a weight-maintaining diet, only insulin sensitivity improves without much change in metabolites, supporting a notion that improvement of insulin sensitivity after CR-related weight loss has a mechanism unrelated to the changes in metabolites.</p>
              <p>Insulin resistance has also been linked to metabolic inflexibility originally described across the leg in insulin-resistant individuals (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Recent exercise training (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and programs of diet plus exercise training (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) have shown improvements in metabolic inflexibility and changes in the lipid content of hepatic and skeletal muscle and insulin sensitivity. The link between metabolic inflexibility and insulin sensitivity is proposed to be through mitochondria (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>); however, metabolic inflexibility improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) in the current study, with no changes in any indices of mitochondrial function. The improvement in metabolic inflexibility was due to higher whole-body lipid oxidation in the overnight fasted state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), a finding that is supported by elevated β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations after CR in the fasted state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Lack of change in plasma FFA concentrations after an overnight fast on CR is consistent with a previous CR study in obese people (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and may represent increased clearance of FFA despite increased mobilization. How metabolic flexibility, substrate partitioning, and insulin sensitivity are mechanistically linked remains to be resolved. The current study did, however, demonstrate that CR enhances insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during hyperinsulinemic conditions mainly by nonoxidative glucose disposal in the peripheral tissues that is likely to occur primarily in skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our two-stage pancreatic clamp technique also allowed us to evaluate the responsiveness of EGP to insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). In those with obesity and overt T2D, CR restores elevated levels of EGP to those of normal control subjects in concert with substantial declines in hepatic lipid content (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). The current results in obese individuals, who are not overt patients with diabetes, demonstrated that the effect of CR was primarily on peripheral glucose disposal, with a minimal effect on EGP, and future investigations should be focused on whether hepatic lipid content is affected by CR in insulin-resistant individuals with prediabetes.</p>
              <p>In summary, 16 weeks of CR and related weight loss in obese participants at a high risk of developing T2D improved whole-body insulin sensitivity, with the main effect on peripheral glucose disposal. This improvement cannot be attributed to alterations in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, mtH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emissions, or intramuscular content of ceramide, DAG, or amino acid metabolites. However, the CR-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity occurred in concert with increased postabsorptive whole-body lipid oxidation. Moreover, we found that CR reduced levels of skeletal muscle TXNIP expression after hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, the changes in TXNIP expression correlated with changes in the glucose Rd during the hyperinsulinemic state during the 16-week period. Together, these results support a likely role of TXNIP in CR-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity.</p>
