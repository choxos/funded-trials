                  <p id="Par1">Youth experiencing homelessness are at high risk for suicide, yet few studies have evaluated risk reduction interventions targeting suicidal ideation in this vulnerable population. A comprehensive approach to risk-reduction is needed that addresses basic needs and provides targeted interventions for those at highest risk. The protocol described builds on the design of the first randomized trial of Housing First (HF) for homeless youth. The primary objective is to determine whether housing combined with supportive services that include suicide screening and targeted psychotherapy (Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention) is effective for reducing suicidal ideation and other secondary outcomes (depression and suicide attempts). Additionally, we will explore mediators of the treatment effect (housing stability and substance use) and determinants of implementation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Youth recruited to the HF trial will be randomized to HF + supportive services (<italic>n</italic> = 120), or supportive services alone (<italic>n</italic> = 120). The “Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention” (STEP) protocol will additionally screen youth in both arms at baseline and 3 months for suicidal ideation (SSI-W). Those who screen as moderate risk for suicide (SSI-W ≥ 10) will be offered CTSP, which includes up to 9 sessions over the first 6 months following enrollment. CTSP will be delivered in one-on-one sessions by a trained advocate. Research assessments will be collected to assess outcomes (including suicidal ideation) at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Qualitative interviews with subjects receiving CTSP and other stakeholders will explore implementation determinants.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The study will fill an important gap in the literature about the added benefit of HF combined with supportive services including suicide screening and treatment for reducing suicidal ideation in homeless youth. With the urgent need to address both homelessness and suicide risk, evidence is needed about services that can be integrated into delivery settings for youth experiencing homelessness.</p>

              <p id="Par33">Deaths from suicide among youth under age 24 years are increasing in the United States and suicide was the second leading cause of death in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the dire risk for suicide in young adults, with elevated reports of suicidal ideation in nationally representative U.S. samples in 2020 compared to 2018 (10.7% vs 4.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some populations of youth are at higher risk for suicide than others, particularly youth experiencing homelessness who have high rates of death from suicide in longitudinal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. An estimated 1 in 10 youth ages 18–25 (3.5 million) experience homelessness in a given year in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Homeless youth, a term often used to describe homeless adolescents and young adults under age 25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], are a vulnerable population who often experience trauma both before and after becoming homeless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], as well as significant mental health and substance use comorbidity. The lived experiences of homeless youth combined with a high prevalence of substance use disorders put them at increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Studies estimate approximately 40% of homeless youth have attempted suicide at least once in their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], much higher than the 1.9% of young adults in the U.S. general population who reported suicide attempts in a 2018 household-based survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">This randomized trial, entitled <bold>Housing First Combined with Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention (HOME + STEP)</bold>, is a secondary protocol that was funded as a competitive revision to the original trial with an additional focus on suicide prevention for both arms of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The parent study is a randomized controlled trial of housing first (HF) combined with opioid and related risk preventive interventions (<italic>n</italic> = 120), relative to opioid and related risk preventive interventions alone (<italic>n</italic> = 120). The primary outcomes are 1) time to opioid use disorder (OUD) and 2) percent of days of opioid use at follow-up (3, 6, 9, 12 months). In the present protocol description, we describe the design of the secondary study, including how the suicide prevention services will be delivered and how the study will answer important questions regarding the added benefit of housing first (HF) for addressing suicide risk in a high-risk population of youth.</p>

                <title>Evidence for suicide prevention and recommendations</title>
                <p id="Par35">The U.S. Surgeon General recently released a call to action for fully implementing the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, which was last updated in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although progress has been made toward some goals, more work is needed. Six action items were highlighted by the U.S. Surgeon General [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Among these, the call to address upstream risk factors for suicide has salience for homeless youth. Some examples to address these risks for homeless youth include increasing social connection, strengthening economic supports, and engaging underserved groups in preventive services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. As noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s technical guidance for implementation of the National Strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a comprehensive approach to addressing these goals is needed and should include identifying those at higher risk for suicide, delivering evidence-base preventive interventions such as psychotherapy, and efforts to increase financial stability. However, though homeless populations are recognized as vulnerable to suicide in these national reports, research identifying effective interventions to reduce their risk for suicide and ways of integrating interventions into comprehensive strategies that also address financial instability is lacking.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Cognitive Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CTSP) is an evidence-based intervention that shows promise in adults and youth with recent suicide attempts treated in hospital settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A recently completed trial of CTSP builds the evidence-base for adaptations of effective interventions that can be delivered to address suicide risk among homeless youth. Among 18–24 year old homeless youth with suicidal ideation at high risk for suicide (<italic>n</italic> = 150), suicidal ideation declined faster among youth randomized to CTSP relative to those in usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Importantly, the trial of CTSP among homeless youth demonstrated effectiveness and was delivered at a homeless youth drop-in center by the center’s staff therapists. Thus, this adaptation of CTSP demonstrates the potential to increase access in nontraditional settings. However, CTSP did not directly address housing instability experienced by homeless youth and most remained unhoused by the end of the study. Furthermore, low rates of participation for more than two or three visits hindered the fidelity of the treatment. It is unknown whether the addition of supportive housing to CTSP could further improve suicide-related outcomes by reducing stress, decreasing trauma, and allowing for more effective service delivery.</p>

                <title>Potential of housing First (HF) for addressing suicide risk</title>
                <p id="Par37">Providing housing and advocacy support increases financial stability and could have benefits for reducing suicidal ideation. The HF model is predicated on providing housing without preconditions of sobriety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Relative to community services as usual, prior controlled trials of HF in adults demonstrates efficacy for improving housing stability and reducing substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Following exposure to HF, suicidal ideation was significantly reduced in two prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], one of which was a randomized trial of HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, among chronically homeless adults with severe mental illness, suicidal ideation was not significantly reduced when compared to a community services control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These results suggest targeted suicide prevention may be needed for individuals with severe suicidal ideation who are at highest risk for suicide. There is also a critical need to study both effectiveness and implementation of evidence-based suicide prevention strategies to increase research translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">The increases in housing stability afforded through HF could impact how youth interact with service providers and has implications for implementation of suicide prevention interventions. Maintaining contact with youth who are experiencing homelessness is a known challenge for service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, when youth have a stable residence, they may be better able to participate in therapy sessions and barriers to maintaining contact with youth could be alleviated. In addition, youth may engage more fully in offered services when they aren’t focused on meeting immediate needs such as finding safe shelter. Exploring the determinants of implementing CTSP and possible differences based on housing status from both the perspectives of youth and stakeholders can inform future dissemination of suicide prevention among homeless youth. For example, differences may highlight variable implementation strategies needed to deliver suicide prevention based on youth receiving supportive housing services.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The present study will formally test a comprehensive system of care that addresses basic needs, while also offering higher levels of targeted intervention to those at highest risk of suicide. The HOME + Suicide Treatment Education and Prevention (STEP) will deliver comprehensive suicide screening for all enrolled youth and offer CTSP for those at highest risk in both arms of the study. The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of HOME + STEP, compared to STEP alone for reducing primary (suicidal ideation) and secondary (depression symptoms, suicide attempt) outcomes. We hypothesize that youth in the HOME + STEP arm will show greater improvement in outcomes over time, relative to the STEP alone arm. Secondary objectives include 1) exploring potential mediators of the treatment effect (substance use, housing stability, hopelessness, and stress coping); and 2) evaluating the treatment effect in a high-risk subgroup identified based on screening protocol, and 3) exploring determinants of implementation of CTSP across both conditions. The study will explore the implementation determinants of delivering CTSP to high-risk youth in both groups using mixed methods approach to inform future dissemination and implementation of suicide prevention services. We hypothesize youth who are randomized to receive HF (HOME + STEP) will participate more fully in CTSP.</p>

Thus, youth who did not initially screen into STEP at baseline will have an additional opportunity to screen into STEP if they meet the above criteria before the 6-month follow-up assessment. Severe suicide ideation is defined as scoring 16 or higher on SSI-W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Beck et al. (1999) reported that clients who scored 16 or higher on the SSI-W had 14 times higher odds to die by suicide. However, given our prevention goal, we will engage those with a score of 10 or higher so that moderate risk youth are engaged as well. Similar to a study by Stanley and colleagues (2009), suicidal ideation will be considered recent if it occurred in the prior 90 days.</p>

Unfortunately, youth who experience homelessness have limited access to medical care or mental health services and are thus unlikely to be screened for suicide in traditional settings. More efforts are needed to identify homeless youth at risk for suicide and link them to appropriate resources. The study will use the SSI-W to assess suicide risk at baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments, as well as past-year attempt at baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, if suicide attempts are reported to advocates at any time during the first 6 months of enrollment youth will be offered CTSP. Protocol to address imminent suicide risk through established emergency procedures (see below) will be followed for any individuals who screen for suicide risk. Those judged not at imminent risk will remain in the project and repeat screening; those with imminent risk will follow emergency procedures for hospitalization when appropriate and be referred to CTSP.</p>

                  <p id="Par44">CTSP is based upon the theoretical assumption that people’s thoughts and interpretation of life events determines their emotional and behavioral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, maladaptive cognitions associated with suicidal ideation are the primary focus of the treatment. The intervention protocol was developed to identify cognitive processes relevant to suicidal acts and targets vulnerability factors including: hopelessness, social isolation, poor problem solving, and impaired impulse control. The treatment is designed as a 10-session protocol including weekly or bi-weekly meetings (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. All subjects with severe suicidal ideation at baseline will receive the therapy from a trained research staff member. The therapy will be delivered by phone or in-person, depending on participant preference and safety precautions for COVID-19. If in person, sessions will occur in a private room set aside for research at the youth drop-in center or, alternatively, in a private room set aside for counseling at a transitional housing unit (if participant randomized to HF). However, youth will be offered up to 9 additional maintenance sessions over a six-month period, tapered in frequency, consistent with treatment offered in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To increase treatment participation, youth will receive a $5 food gift card (e.g. McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s, or other food gift card) for every CTSP session they attend.

The 11 items are summed to yield a CTRS total score, ranging from 0 to 66 (≥40 considered competent). The CTRS will be completed by the senior author during supervision. CTSP <bold><italic>costs</italic></bold> will be measured as the advocate time for training, delivering therapy, supervision, and contacting youth for follow-up appointments or rescheduling as well as the labor, equipment, and space costs, based on an activity-based costing method and semi-structured, in-person interviews of therapists and other relevant personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>

If data are missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], they will be estimated using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) or multiple imputations (MI) method. When data are missing completely at random (MCAR) or are missing at random (MAR), both FIML and ML produce unbiased results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The main statistical program used for this study, MPlus, can handle missing data by providing FIML estimation. If the missingness cannot be explained by observed data, that is, data are Missing Not at Random (MNAR), data analysis will be conducted using the pattern mixture model framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par55">The impact of housing on the primary (suicidal ideation) and secondary outcomes (depressive symptoms, suicide attempts) over time will be tested between the two main treatment conditions: housing combined with risk preventive services and risk preventive services alone. For these analyses we will control for CTSP treatment attendance, which has been positively associated with treatment outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Specifically, the primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using latent growth models (LGM) to estimate the trajectories of change across five time points (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up). LGM can also estimate joint trajectories with multiple outcome variables. Differences between the main treatment conditions on estimated growth parameters, including intercepts (i.e., initial status) and slopes (i.e., the rates of change), will be tested. It is expected that those assigned to the housing combined with risk preventive services group will show greater decreases in suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms, and that these improvements will maintain for a longer period of time, compared to those assigned to the prevention services alone group. We anticipate that number of participants reporting suicide attempts in the current sample will be relatively low. Thus, in the LGM analysis, we will dichotomize the measure of suicide attempts (i.e., presence vs. absence of suicide attempt) to test whether the likelihood of suicide attempt decreases faster in the combined housing and services group than in the services alone group. To increase validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis, the number of intervention sessions and contacts with other service providers will be covariates in the LGM analyses.</p>

                  <p id="Par56">A series of path analysis will be conducted to test the mediation hypotheses. <italic>Primary mediators</italic>: we will first test whether percent of days housed and percent days of substance use assessed at the 3- or 6-month follow-up mediates the association between intervention (combined house and services vs. services alone) and outcomes at 6-month and 9−/12-month follow-up, respectively. We expect that the intervention condition with the housing component will produce greater improvements in percent day housed and substance use, which in turn will predict reduced suicide ideation, depressive symptoms, and likelihood of suicide attempt. <italic>Secondary mediators</italic>: we will test the effects of hopelessness and stress coping on the relationship between primary mediators and outcomes. We expect that lower housing instability and substance use at 3 months will be associated with lower hopelessness and greater stress coping at 6, which will in turn be associated with reduced suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and likelihood of suicide attempts at 9−/12-months. Following MacKinnon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the product of the coefficient of the path from the independent variable to the mediator(s) and the coefficient of the path from the mediator(s) to the outcomes will be computed as the indirect (mediation) effect between the intervention and outcomes. The strength and significance of the mediation will be estimated using a bootstrap sampling method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Similar to the primary aim, we will control for CTSP treatment attendance, number of intervention sessions, and contacts with other service providers in the analysis.</p>

                  <p id="Par57">We will only include youth at high risk of suicidality in the analyses to provide an estimation of the effect of housing on high levels of suicidality between the two groups: housing combined with services and services alone. The expected sample size is approximately 100. Repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) will be conducted to examine the differences between the groups in continuous outcomes, suicidal ideation, and depressive symptoms. Specifically, a 3 (treatment condition) × 5 (time points) RMANOVA will be conducted with treatment as the between-subject factor and time as the within-subject factor, in order to test the differential change pattern over time between the two groups. For suicidal attempts (both count and dichotomous variable) generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) will be conducted. In the event that the high-risk sample would not provide sufficient power for the GLMM analysis, further exploration analysis will be conducted on the dichotomous suicidal attempts variable to examine the housing effect at the end of treatment (i.e., 6-months follow-up) and the end of the study (i.e., 12-month follow-up), using logistic regression, controlling for the baseline assessment.</p>

                  <p id="Par58">To understand how the determinants of CTSP implementation vary across settings, we will use a mixed-methods design. In the quantitative phase, we will examine and compare quantitative data on fidelity and costs across both study arms. Average start-up and ongoing estimated costs for all STEP-related services will be presented overall and across study groups. Qualitative interviews will be iteratively coded using a modified grounded theory approach – modified in that we will orient our initial open coding process around what Patton describes as “sensitizing concepts” including issues related to acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], NVivo 11 software will be used to organize and code the data. Data will be used to identify salient contextual features service delivery that need to be addressed in future implementation efforts and will provide greater explanation about why there are (or are not) differences in implementation outcomes across conditions. Results may also provide insight into which implementation strategies might be needed to deliver CTSP.</p>

                  <title>Statistical power analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par59">The power analyses were conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation method for the Primary Aim and Secondary Aim 1 and using GPower program for Secondary Aim 2. We assumed an overall attrition rate of 15% when calculating the power. The MPI’s ongoing study testing the effect of housing support on homeless mothers reveals medium effect size in reducing depressive symptoms (<italic>d</italic> = .59), favoring the housing intervention over treatment as usual (TAU)/assessment only. Few studies examined the effect of housing on suicidality; a recent observational study reported a small effect size from baseline to 2-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Given the large difference across studies and that the proposed study tests housing support against an active intervention, and the differences between the two conditions may be smaller than that between housing support and TAU, we assumed small-to-medium effect sizes when conducting the power analysis. For the Primary Aim, with dichotomous predictors (contrasts between intervention conditions) that have regression coefficients of .15 (small-to-medium effect size) for the slopes of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], a sample size of 240 can produce a power of .86 to detect the housing effect on the growth rate of outcomes. For Secondary Aim 1, the MPI’s clinical trial of housing support suggested a large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 1.26) in improving housing stability and a medium effect size in reducing substance use (<italic>d</italic> = .49). Similarly, a meta-analysis reported large effect sizes (<italic>d</italic> = 1.24 on average) of Housing First approaches in increasing housing stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Thus, we assumed a medium effect size for the intervention-to-mediator paths and a small-to-medium effect size for the mediator-to-outcome paths. Following the model specification suggested by Thoemmes et al. (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], the proposed sample size could provide a power of .91 to detect mediating effects for models with one mediator and a power of .82 for the serial mediation models with two mediators. For Secondary Aim 2, assuming a small-to-medium effect size (i.e., <italic>f</italic> = .20), the power to detect a group difference in an RMANOVA with 5 repeated measurements is .84. For the GLMM, to achieve 80% power, the effect size of the group differences in the slope needs to be of medium size (regression coefficient of .20). A smaller than medium effect size will not provide sufficient power to detect housing effect on suicidal attempts. However, our goal is to estimate an effect size that can be used to guide sample-size estimates for a future fully-powered study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par60">The HOME + STEP study will provide information to stakeholders on the effectiveness of supportive housing combined with suicide prevention for reducing suicidal ideation and addressing other secondary outcomes in homeless youth. Programs for housing transitional age youth experiencing homelessness have been implemented in cities across the United States and many observational studies have noted improvements in housing stability and reduced drug use. At a time when the homelessness and mental health crises in the United States are converging during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence for whether supportive housing can effectively reduce suicide risk and related outcomes is needed. Observational studies alone cannot provide stakeholders with the information needed to determine the extent to which supportive housing programs can improve upon preventive interventions alone. The financial resources needed for implementing housing interventions are great, but if health and well-being are improved this information can be used to argue for the importance of this investment.</p>
