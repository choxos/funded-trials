                  <p id="P3">The Botswana Combination Prevention Project tested the impact of combination prevention (CP) on HIV incidence in a community-randomized trial. Each trial arm had ~55,000 people, 26% HIV prevalence, and 72% baseline ART coverage. Results showed intensive testing and linkage campaigns, expanded antiretroviral treatment (ART), and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) referrals increased coverage and decreased incidence over ~29 months follow-up.

              <p id="P9">The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP, also known as the Ya Tsie trial) was a cluster-randomized trial designed to examine whether a combination of HIV prevention measures (CP) could reduce HIV incidence, compared to standard of care (SOC).<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Prevention measures in CP included activities approximating universal test- and-treat (intensive HIV testing campaigns, improved linkage to care, and expanded antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility) and increased referrals for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC).</p>

                <title>BCPP Trial Overview</title>
                <p id="P12">BCPP was a pair-matched, cluster-randomized clinical trial from October 2013 to June 2018, in 30 rural and peri-urban communities; it was designed to determine whether implementation of CP could reduce HIV incidence at the community level.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Fifteen matched pairs of communities were randomized between the CP arm and the SOC arm. Each arm had a population (age 16–64) of ~55,000 with HIV prevalence 26% and ART coverage 72% at baseline. SOC communities received limited technical support at local HIV clinics. Both SOC and CP communities received HIV testing in a random sample of 20% of households (with clinic referral of persons with HIV) as part of a baseline household survey and annual follow-up surveys. In addition, CP communities received a combination of prevention activities including an intensive “saturation” campaign of door-to-door and mobile HIV testing and counseling, increased linkage-to-care efforts for those testing positive, and increased VMMC referrals for men testing negative. The CP arm offered expanded ART eligibility relative to SOC, though SOC changed over time with international guidelines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>,<ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="P13">All trial participants provided written informed consent. Participants 16–17 years old provided written assent and written permission from their parents or guardians. The trial was approved by the institutional review boards at the Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
                <p id="P14">Indicators measured in a subset of three control and three intervention communities at baseline (random ~20% sample) and study completion (remaining ~80% of households) found an increase in ART coverage of 19 percentage points in intervention communities, compared to a ten-percentage point increase in control communities and a corresponding prevalence ratio of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.17).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> VMMC coverage in men aged 15–49 increased ten percentage points in intervention communities (30% to 40%) compared to two percentage points in control communities (33% to 35%) (prevalence ratio 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.35).<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> A 31% HIV incidence reduction (unadjusted incidence ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90, p = 0.09) was demonstrated in the intervention arm.

                <title>Modeling Analysis Overview</title>
                <p id="P15">We used results from the BCPP trial to populate CEPAC, a computer microsimulation of HIV disease. Outside the model, we used trial data to estimate key outcomes which were used to scale model output: the incremental number of PWH started on ART and number of infections averted during the trial due to CP. We then populated CEPAC with trial data to estimate lifetime HIV-related care costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy for people in the CP and SOC arms.</p>
                <p id="P16">Outcomes for each arm accounted for PWH started on ART and the people in whom infection was averted during the trial. We used CEPAC to estimate the additional infections that would be averted over a ten-year horizon after the trial due to the additional PWH started on ART. Therefore, the total health benefit comprises both quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by PWH who started ART earlier and QALYs gained by people in whom infection was averted due to CP. Lifetime care costs for these groups were combined with the programmatic cost of the CP intervention to estimate the total cost (2019 US$). We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CP vs. SOC by dividing the additional cost of CP by the additional QALYs generated. An overview of the approach is shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> (additional detail <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

                <title>The CEPAC Model</title>
                <p id="P17">CEPAC is a widely published and validated microsimulation of HIV infection, screening, disease progression, and treatment in resource-limited settings.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Simulated patients are generated from user-defined distributions of sex, age, initial CD4 count, HIV RNA, and treatment adherence, then followed monthly from model entry until death. HIV diagnosis occurs via testing or presentation with an opportunistic infection (OI).</p>
                <p id="P18">The model simulates probabilities of linkage to care, virologic suppression on ART, retention in care, and risk of OIs. ART is initiated according to strategy-specific CD4 count and viral load thresholds and the occurrence of user-defined primary and secondary OIs. When virally suppressed on ART, patients experience increasing CD4 counts. In the absence of treatment, patients experience a monthly decline in CD4 count and increased risk of OIs and mortality.

                <p id="P19">In the trial’s CP arm, 3,065 PWH were started on ART, 455 via the baseline survey and 2,610 via the testing campaign. Accounting for observed differences in linkage between the arms,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> we estimated that the baseline survey in the control arm resulted in 388 ART initiations. The trial did not collect data on HIV ‘background testing’ or ART enrollment occurring before trial activities. However, background testing is important since the testing campaign could ‘crowd out’ some background testing that would have otherwise occurred in the intervention arm. Case detection through background testing was estimated for each arm using trial data on ART coverage and case-finding associated with trial activities (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement</xref>,<ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842</ext-link>).</p>

                <p id="P20">We used the CEPAC model to project long-term differences in survival, onward transmission, and HIV-related care costs between CP and SOC among two cohorts. First, for CP we simulated a cohort representing additional PWH started on ART during the trial, with characteristics matching those observed in the group started on ART during the trial in terms of age, sex, CD4 count at ART start, and HIV RNA. For SOC, we simulated the same cohort under a counterfactual in which they were not started on ART during the trial. Second, for CP we simulated the cohort of people in whom infections were averted during the BCPP trial; characteristics matched those in both arms of the trial’s incidence cohort diagnosed with HIV during the trial. For SOC we modeled the counterfactual in which those people acquired HIV during the trial (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement Figure S1</xref>,<ext-link xlink:href="http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842" ext-link-type="uri">http://links.lww.com/QAI/B842</ext-link>). Comparing the intervention to the counterfactual, we calculated the difference in lifetime QALY and cost outcomes for both cohorts. The simulation started at the end of the trial (T0 in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and continued over a lifetime horizon.</p>

We varied each parameter from 10% to as much as 300% of its base case value. For multi-way sensitivity analysis, we varied the incremental increase in ART coverage from 0.5 to 9.0 percentage points (base case: nine percentage points) and simultaneously adjusted the number of infections averted from 5% to 100% of the base case level, as ART coverage and number of infections averted are expected to be correlated.

During the trial, 262 infections were averted over 29 months in the intervention communities due to improved case-finding and linkage, earlier ART initiation, and VMMC coverage increases. Based on simulation of the lifetime of persons started on ART during the trial due to CP, we estimate an additional 42 infections averted in the ten years post-trial, for a total of 304 infections averted (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

For people in whom an infection was averted, quality-adjusted life expectancy increased by 2.43 QALYs (from 17.03 to 19.46 QALYs) and $9,200 in HIV-related medical care costs were saved per person (from $9,970 to $730, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P34">Using CEPAC model results, we estimate that 2,086 discounted QALYs were generated by CP, split about evenly between the 1,418 PWH started earlier on ART and the 304 persons in whom an infection was averted.</p>
                <p id="P35">Testing and linkage activities in the intervention arm, including those related to the baseline survey, cost $2.22 million. We estimated that another $111,000 was spent on background testing and $207,000 on 1,777 VMMC procedures in the intervention arm. In the standard of care arm, we estimate a cost of $208,000 for testing and $41,000 for VMMC related to the baseline survey, as well as $592,000 in background testing costs. Thus, the incremental total direct cost of CP activities was $1.69 million (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P36">In addition to the incremental cost of delivering the intervention, we estimated the incremental cost of HIV care for the 1,418 PWH started on ART due to CP at $1.23 million. The $2.8 million in HIV care costs saved due to the 304 infections prevented offset most of the cost of the CP activities and consequent HIV care for PWH detected and started on ART, resulting in a net cost of $157,000 (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and an ICER of $79 per QALY gained.</p>

                <title>Sensitivity Analysis</title>
                <p id="P37">In univariate sensitivity analysis, the ICER for CP vs. SOC was consistently &lt;0.5x Botswana’s annual <italic toggle="yes">per capita</italic> GDP. Other parameters used in simulating long-term impacts did not substantially affect the ICER when varied across wide ranges (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P38">When we simultaneously varied the incremental cost of the CP intervention and the impact of the program on ART coverage and infections averted, CP remained cost-effective over a wide range of parameters (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). When the impact of the intervention was two-thirds of the base case, with an increase in ART coverage of six percentage points and 203 infections averted, CP remained cost-effective even when intervention costs were 2.5x the base case. When the impact of the intervention was reduced to one-third of the base case (a three-percentage point increase in ART coverage and 102 infections averted), CP remained cost-effective if the intervention cost did not exceed 1.5x the base case. If the impact of the intervention was only 10% of the base case (a 0.9-percentage point increase in ART coverage and 31 infections averted), the CP intervention would not be cost-effective at base case cost. In this case, costs would need to be 42% lower to meet the threshold of 0.5x GDP per capita per QALY gained. Even with a three-percentage point increase in ART coverage and ~10% reduction in infections, corresponding to the lower bound of the 95% CI for the incidence reduction observed in the trial, the ICER remained below 25% of annual <italic toggle="yes">per capita</italic> GDP in Botswana per QALY gained.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P39">We projected the long-term clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of a combination HIV prevention intervention implemented in the Botswana Combination Prevention Project. Based on trial outcomes, we estimated 1,418 additional PWH were started on ART and 304 infections were averted due to the combination prevention intervention, compared to the standard of care. The 2,086 QALYs of long-term total health gain produced by CP were split equally between prevalent cases starting earlier on ART and those in whom an infection was averted. Although the CP intervention required a large initial investment—about $1.7 million more than SOC prevention to cover a target population of 55,000—and will generate additional HIV care costs in those already infected who start ART earlier, these costs will likely be largely offset over time due to the prevention of new infections. Indeed, our analysis projects that HIV care costs saved by averting infections will offset nearly all CP program costs and treatment costs for the additional PWH started on ART, resulting in a long-run net cost of $157,000 and an ICER of $79 per QALY.</p>
              <p id="P40">These results were most dependent on the cost of the CP intervention, the cost of HIV care, and the impact of the intervention on infections averted and ART coverage gained. Within plausible ranges, the CP intervention would remain cost-effective.</p>
              <p id="P41">This study can also be interpreted in the context of two other major international trials assessing the ‘test and treat’ paradigm. The PopART trial (HPTN 071) in South Africa and Zambia tested two versions of combination prevention and showed that combination prevention improved ART coverage and viral suppression. A decrease in HIV incidence was observed with one version of combination prevention, but not the other. A report of cost-effectiveness suggests that for a comparable scenario the intervention as implemented in the trial had an ICER of $326/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) in South Africa and $258/DALY in Zambia.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The PopART results, though slightly less favorable when comparing base cases, are broadly consistent with our findings regarding the value of combination prevention considering differences in epidemiological context, case-finding and HIV treatment costs, adherence and viral suppression in people on ART, modeled time horizon, as well as parameter and model uncertainty in both analyses. The SEARCH study of over 350,000 people in Kenya and Uganda showed an increase in viral suppression in PWH from 68% to 80% but no change in HIV incidence. Cost-effectiveness results have not yet been reported.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P42">Other case-finding approaches such as index contact testing, social network testing and self-testing have also proven cost-effective.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> These approaches are not intended as alternatives; they complement one another as part of a strategic mix which depends on the context in which they are implemented. While the unit costs of an intensive “saturation” campaign are high relative to facility-based approaches, the testing campaigns led to the identification of nearly all remaining unaware and out of care PWH in the intervention communities, in turn leading to observed incidence reduction within the study period.</p>
              <p id="P43">This analysis of the BCPP trial has several limitations. We could not evaluate the contribution of each aspect of the CP intervention to the benefits observed in the trial. We did not have HIV care cost data from BCPP and used cost estimates from other studies.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Further, we only included first-order transmissions over ten years, so we may be underestimating the total number of infections averted over time from the intervention. The incremental cost of the testing campaign and the number of PWH started on ART attributable to the intervention are uncertain. The amount and cost of testing and the number of PWH started on ART in the control arm were not measured in the trial so our estimates of these rely on extrapolations from changes in ART coverage measured in a subset (three of 15 pairs) of the communities in both trial arms. Additionally, our analysis compares the CP intervention to a SOC counterfactual that included a baseline survey with HIV testing in 20% of households. If the SOC had not included the baseline survey, both the incremental cost of CP and the incremental health effect would be higher and the net impact on cost-effectiveness would likely be small. Finally, this analysis, based on the BCPP trial, compared CP to an evolving SOC that was short of universal test and treat. Despite these limitations, sensitivity analysis showed that our cost-effectiveness results were robust to variations in efficacy and cost: we found that at base case effectiveness the intervention would remain cost-effective at 2.5x base case cost. Even if effectiveness was substantially reduced, with only a three-percentage point increase in people starting on ART and a 10% reduction in incident infections (102 infections averted), the CP strategy would remain cost-effective compared to a threshold of 50% of Botswana’s annual <italic toggle="yes">per capita</italic> GDP.</p>
              <p id="P44">As with any study involving long time horizons, results are subject to uncertainty related to advances in testing, treatment, prevention, or other factors that may impact future transmission dynamics or the outcomes of HIV treatment. Despite these uncertainties, the results of sensitivity analyses increase our confidence that the CP intervention, as implemented in Botswana during the Ya Tsie trial, will be cost-effective. Even with substantially higher testing campaign costs, much smaller increases in ART coverage, and fewer infections averted, the ICER for CP would remain under 50% of Botswana’s annual <italic toggle="yes">per capita</italic> GDP, a reasonable cost-effectiveness threshold for a middle-income sub-Saharan African country.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> At the time of the study Botswana had, and still has, among the highest pre-existing rates of HIV diagnosis, linkage to ART, and viral load suppression of any country, particularly high HIV-burden countries—and despite this, the CP intervention was cost-effective. It is likely that similar interventions, if they can improve case-finding and provide robust linkage to ART services, would be cost-effective in other settings as well.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p id="P45">Despite high up-front costs, large-scale combination prevention interventions featuring intensive ‘saturation’ testing campaigns that reach PWH not in care and link them to ART are likely to be cost-effective in settings that are comparable to Botswana during the period of the Ya Tsie trial in terms of HIV prevalence, undiagnosed HIV, and care costs. Even in settings with high baseline testing and high ART coverage like Botswana, combination prevention may further improve health among PWH as well as improving population health and lowering HIV care costs by reducing HIV incidence.</p>
