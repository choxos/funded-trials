                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients were enrolled in four cohorts: MM-302 monotherapy (8, 16, 30, 40, and 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 4 weeks [q4w]); MM-302 (30 or 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q4w) plus trastuzumab (4 mg/kg q2w); MM-302 (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus trastuzumab (6 mg/kg) q3w; MM-302 (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus trastuzumab (6 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) q3w.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Sixty-nine patients were treated. The most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue and nausea. Grade 3/4 AEs of special interest included neutropenia, fatigue, mucosal inflammation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The MTD was not reached. With MM-302 ≥ 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, overall response rate (ORR) was 13% and median progression-free survival (mPFS) 7.4 months (95% CI: 3·5–10·9) in all arms. In 25 anthracycline-naïve patients, ORR was 28·0% and mPFS 10·9 months (95% CI: 1·8–15·3). Imaging with <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled MM-302 visualized tumor-drug penetrance in tumors throughout the body, including the brain.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">MM-302 monotherapy, in combination with trastuzumab, or trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide, was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy. The selected phase 2 MM-302 dose was 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> plus 6 mg/kg trastuzumab q3w.</p>

              <p id="Par6">Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, are efficacious in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> However, their use in early-stage trastuzumab-containing breast cancer regimens is limited by their adverse effects on the heart,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and some studies show that a taxane-based regimen may have similar efficacy in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> There is a strong need for efficacious regimens after taxane failure in the metastatic setting, and less toxic early-stage regimens. Compared with free doxorubicin, liposomal formulations of doxorubicin have less cardiac toxicity and fewer side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The introduction of targeted antibody conjugates has provided great promise to maximize cancer cell uptake while minimizing systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of doxorubicin to HER2-overexpressing cells would allow use of one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents while sparing the heart.</p>
              <p id="Par7">MM-302 is a HER2-targeted PEGylated antibody–liposomal doxorubicin conjugate that targets HER2­overexpressing tumor cells, delivers doxorubicin to tumor cells, and limits exposure to healthy cells such as cardiomyocytes (Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> In preclinical models of HER2-positive breast cancer, MM-302 demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to both doxorubicin and PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> MM­302 and trastuzumab bind different epitopes of HER2, and the combination of MM-302 and trastuzumab demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity compared with either agent alone in HER2­overexpressing tumor xenograft models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Preclinical studies have also shown that cyclophosphamide pretreatment increased the delivery and antitumor activity of MM-302.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> These findings support clinical investigation of MM-302 in combination with trastuzumab and trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide. Here we report the results from the first-in-human phase 1 study of MM-302 in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par8">This phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of MM-302 as a monotherapy (arm 1), in combination with trastuzumab (arm 2 and arm 3), or trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide (arm 4) in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01304797).</p>
                <p id="Par9">The primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and phase 2 dose of MM-302 as a monotherapy, in combination with trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus cyclophosphamide. Secondary objectives were to describe dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), objective response rate (ORR; confirmed complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]), clinical benefit rate (CBR; confirmed CR, PR or stable disease at 24 weeks), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), immunogenicity and PK of MM-302 in patients enrolled in arm 1–4. Exploratory objectives investigated the correlation of clinical activity with levels of HER2 amplification or protein expression, and MM-302 biodistribution and tumor deposition.</p>
                <p id="Par10">The trial was conducted at five sites in the United States and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each site. All patients provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Code of Federal Regulations and local regulatory requirements.</p>

                <p id="Par13">MM-302 (Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) was administered by intravenous infusion over 60 min and the dose based on a doxorubicin hydrochloride equivalent basis. Patients were sequentially enrolled in one of four arms (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A standard ‘3 + 3’ dose escalation design was used starting with MM-302 monotherapy (arm 1; 8, 16, 30, 40, and 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administered once every 4 weeks (q4w) with expansion cohorts at 40 and 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (each containing 12 patients, respectively). Arm 2 was a combination dose escalation of intravenous MM-302 (30 and 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q4w) plus intravenous trastuzumab (4 mg/kg with 6 mg/kg loading) every 2 weeks (q2w). Arm 3 cohort 1 investigated MM-302 (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1 cycle 1, initially in three patients; in subsequent cycles patients received trastuzumab (6* or 8 mg/kg [*with 8 mg/kg loading] every 3 weeks [q3w]) on day 1 followed by MM-302 on day 6. After safety had been established in the first cohort, a larger expansion cohort (cohort 2) of nine patients investigated trastuzumab administered on cycle 1 day 1, followed by MM-302 and <sup>64</sup>Cu-MM-302 on cycle 1 day 6. During subsequent cycles, trastuzumab was administered q3w on day 1 and a full therapeutic dose of non-radioactive MM-302 (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) was administered q3w on day 6. Similarly, arm 4 investigated intravenous cyclophosphamide (450 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w) and trastuzumab (6 mg/kg after 8 mg/kg loading) on day 1 followed by MM-302 (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w) on day 6 in 13 patients.

                <p id="Par16">Patients experiencing an asymptomatic reduction in LVEF to &lt;50% or &gt;10% absolute drop from baseline could continue treatment at the discretion of the medical monitor, provided that cardiac function tests were performed prior to each MM-302 dose. Study treatment was discontinued permanently if LVEF did not improve or declined further.</p>
                <p id="Par17">From September 2012, all patients starting treatment received prophylactic premedication with 25–50 mg diphenhydramine or equivalent (administered orally ≤30 min prior to MM-302 dosing or intravenously immediately prior to MM-302 dosing) in cycle 1. Patients who tolerated the initial dose without an infusion reaction could discontinue premedication in subsequent cycles according to investigator judgment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par34">In this phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study, MM-302 was well tolerated and active in patients with HER2-positive advanced/metastatic breast cancer. The study population was heavily pretreated with a median of five prior regimens for metastatic disease. The main study objective was to determine the safety of MM-302 as a monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab and cyclophosphamide. Consistent with the nature of a phase 1 dose escalation study, conclusions on efficacy are confounded by the heterogeneous doses and schedules of MM-302 used and the multitude of monotherapy and combination therapy cohorts. Nonetheless, there is notable lasting activity without cumulative toxicity.</p>
              <p id="Par35">MM-302 was designed to target delivery of doxorubicin to tumors via anti-HER2-directed antibodies. Owing to the low level of HER2-expression on cardiomyocytes, preclinical studies with MM-302 show no uptake into human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and no effect on cell viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> However, to safeguard against cardiac toxicity, effects on the heart were monitored very closely. No cardiac AEs were observed in patients treated with MM-302 monotherapy. With MM-302 in combination with trastuzumab, with or without cyclophosphamide, cardiac AEs were infrequent with no serious AEs.</p>
              <p id="Par36">MM-302 activity correlated with AUC and, in general, higher activity was observed at doses ≥10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w and 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q4w) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplemental Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Although MTD was not reached at 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q4w (12·5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week), dose intensity of 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week was also active and had fewer cumulative incidences of neutropenia. Based on phase 1 results, the recommended phase 2 dose was 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> q3w MM-302 (10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week) in combination with trastuzumab 6 mg/kg q3w (with 8 mg/kg loading).</p>
              <p id="Par37">The observed activity of MM-302 is promising. Median PFS of 7·4 months with ≥30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> MM-302 monotherapy, in combination with trastuzumab or with trastuzumab and cyclophosphamide, compares favourably with recent late-stage HER2-positive clinical trials that demonstrated median PFS of 3·3 months in patients treated with the physician’s choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, in the present study, the observed PFS and ORR in patients not previously exposed to an anthracycline were 10·9 months and 28%, respectively. Multiple studies of liposomal doxorubicin have observed similar trends, with improved activity in patients not previously exposed to an anthracycline compared to those previously exposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Additionally, grade 3 palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia with MM-302 (<italic>n</italic> = 1/69; 1%) was less frequent than that reported for the combination of liposomal doxorubicin plus trastuzumab (<italic>n</italic> = 9/30; 30%; respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par38">Exploratory analyses of tumor biopsies support a HER2-targeting mechanism for MM-302 consistent with preclinical data. Tumor deposition data using <sup>64</sup>Cu-MM-302 PET/CT revealed the potential of MM-302 to be delivered to difficult metastatic locations such as brain metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par39">In summary, these data suggest that MM­302 monotherapy, in combination with trastuzumab or trastuzumab and cyclophosphamide has a manageable safety profile and promising clinical activity in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. MM-302 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in combination with 6 mg/kg trastuzumab every 3 weeks was selected as the recommended phase 2 study dose. This study is now completed, and further clinical studies are under discussion.</p>
