pregnancy complications and health risks for birthing people and their
infants. Likewise, postpartum weight retention (PPWR), or not losing all
pregnancy weight, has long-term health consequences. EGWG among people who
enter pregnancy with overweight or obesity have worse obstetric outcomes and
increased PPWR compared to women who gain within Institute of Medicine
guidelines.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P7">Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for cardiometabolic
diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. People who enter pregnancy with overweight
and obesity increase those risks when they experience excess gestational weight gain
(EGWG), defined as gaining more weight during pregnancy than Institute of Medicine
(IOM) guidelines for prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
Importantly, national data show that EGWG complicates more than half of all
pregnancies when the individual enters pregnancy with BMI ≥ 25 [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. EGWG is associated with increased risk for:
(a) poor obstetric, neonatal, and maternal outcomes (e.g., gestational diabetes,
preeclampsia, fetal growth abnormalities) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; (b) postpartum
weight retention (PPWR) at 6 months post-birth, a time point now recognized as
critical for predicting whether individuals will ever return to their prepregnancy
weight [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; (c) moving to the next BMI class, thereby increasing
the risk status of subsequent pregnancies [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; and (d) offspring overweight, obesity,
cardiometabolic disease, poor cognition, and mood disorders across the lifespan
[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study found that postpartum
weight gain occurred in 57% of people and resulted from increased energy intake, not
decreased energy expenditure, thus highlighting the importance of nutritional
interventions to prevent PPWR [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">Attempts to prevent EGWG have had limited impact on the problem, particularly
in populations with overweight and obesity [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Most interventions to reduce GWG have not employed technology and
varied widely in approaches and success rates, including few large randomized trials
and inconsistency in: (a) provider type [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (e.g., dieticians, health
coaches, health educators; (b) approach (e.g., individual, group, in-person,
telephonic) [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (c) intensity [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] (e.g., 30–60
min sessions, 5-min session after prenatal visits, 16 90 min sessions). Results from
these trials have shown that higher intensity interventions with at least some
individualized support were associated with lower GWG compared to control
conditions.</p>
              <p id="P9">Interventions that leverage technology, social media, and other web-based
platforms are growing in popularity. In one such study, called,
“MomTech,” participants who received two daily text messages and four
lifestyle appointments with a midwife had lower GWG than control participants, but
the study was not powered for statistical significance [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. e-Moms Roc included an informational website with
mobile phone applications, weight gain trackers, and goal-setting tools for diet and
physical activity. Only participants with access to the personalized weight, diet,
and physical activity tools had lower GWG [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; however, results of this intervention in a randomized control trial
(RCT) were inconclusive, perhaps due to lack of participant use of the provided
behavior change tools [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The VideoDoctor
trial found no improvement in GWG from an actor-portrayed doctor delivering two
brief video messages about diet, exercise, and weight gain [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The Health in Pregnancy and Postpartum (HIPP) trial,
which tested counseling, podcasts, and social media, found that the intervention
group had similar total GWG at delivery as the standard care participants, albeit
fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g. low birth weight infants, gestational
hypertension). There also were differences in GWG outcomes among African Americans
with overweight versus obese BMIs [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These findings reflect the conclusions of
several recent reviews that technology-based interventions can improve physical and
mental health and monitor health markers remotely (e.g. blood glucose, blood
pressure, weight), however, an insufficient number of RCTs have been conducted to
establish clinical and economic benefits, safety, and mechanisms of potential
benefits [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interventions that tailor text messages to each
participant have been found to be more effective than those that send generic
messages [<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Additionally, a lack of
alignment between messaging and outcomes is a common methodological shortcoming in
text messaging studies for maternal and infant health [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P10">Behavior change interventions that focus on the postpartum period are
severely lacking, and this may be critical for limiting PPWR. Postpartum
interventions are difficult for new parents for many reasons including caregiving
duties, lack of time, and fatigue [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the postpartum period is also an
ideal window to help birthing people to mitigate new risks that may have been
discovered by diagnosed pregnancy complications [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Birthing people also may be particularly motivated during this
window due to their new responsibilities as a parent [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Additionally, research has shown that interventions
during pregnancy to limit GWG are not sufficient to prevent PPWR [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which is a risk factor for future chronic illness
[<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The proposed study addresses this gap by extending 6 months into
the postpartum period and encouraging healthy dietary intake that will not affect
milk supply for those who are breastfeeding [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Some participants may lose more weight than they gained, but we do
not encourage this as a specific goal.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p id="P11">We propose to conduct one of the first, fully powered RCTs to test the
efficacy of <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic>, a personalized digital dietary
intervention for people who entered pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI.
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> was adapted from the Interactive Obesity Treatment
Approach (IOTA) [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] for the specific needs of pregnant and
postpartum birthing people, given that dietary requirements change from
pregnancy through postpartum and with breastfeeding. <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> is
based on previous work of the study team and their collaborators. In one study,
pregnant, urban-dwelling Black people with overweight or obesity receiving WIC
(<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 66) were enrolled in a multi-faceted intervention that
included IOTA. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention
group were within IOM recommendations for prepregnancy BMI (66% vs. 37%,
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.033) with no loss to follow up [<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A second pilot was conducted to examine the
feasibility of goal-setting and action planning specifically for postpartum
birthing people who had gained excess gestational weight, because this has been
an understudied population. Intervention participants were recruited in the

compared to a mean weight gain of 16.6 pounds for the control group [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These studies supported the
feasibility and acceptability of our approach to leverage digital tools to
achieve personalized behavior change goals during pregnancy and postpartum to

                <p id="P12">The premise of our study is that a theoretically driven, standalone
mHealth tool with a high intensity intervention, timed during pregnancy through
six months postpartum, will help individuals with overweight and obesity to gain

employs algorithms and text messaging to personalize food preferences,
goal-setting, diet tracking, skills training, and adherence feedback to improve
diet quality and increase the proportion of days on which participants consume
diets that are consistent with nutrient needs for pregnancy and healthy
postpartum weight loss. <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> is based on Self-regulation
Theory [<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>–<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], which posits that individuals must consciously
plan their actions and monitor their behaviors to achieve desired goals (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Previous studies based on
Self-regulation Theory [<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] show that
goal attainment is enhanced when individuals receive support, including
problem-solving skills, that can be applied to their actions. Self-regulation
happens in this study through response to text messages regarding goals and
measurement of weight on a study-provided Bluetooth scale.</p>

                  <p id="P14">The weight of a pregnant person is one of the key clinical
indicators of the health of a pregnancy. This trial was designed to
determine whether pregnant participants can make dietary changes to impact
pregnancy and postpartum weights. While multiple behavioral change
interventions can prove helpful [<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>],
it is also difficult to isolate the effects of specific behaviors on
outcomes. We chose to focus on diet, as research shows that diet is more
important than exercise in terms of weight loss [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Goals are incremental and manageable, with
the “dose” being consistent with previous studies using IOTA
[<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>–<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. While gaining inadequate weight during
pregnancy introduces the risks of low birthweight and difficulties
breastfeeding, we focused only on EGWG due to the extra cardiometabolic risk
both during pregnancy and throughout the lifetime of the birthing person who
gains too much weight during pregnancy [<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> was designed to be an app-based
text messaging intervention because: (1) nearly 90% of the population
participates in text messaging, particularly racial and ethnic minorities
[<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; (2) regular (especially daily)
self-monitoring is very important for weight loss success [<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>];
(3) self-monitoring of food intake is positively correlated with weight
change [<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and while it can be done
on paper, technology is less burdensome and thus more likely to be used for
successful weight management [<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>];
and (4) text messaging has been shown to be very effective at promoting
weight control [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> is unique compared to other intervention
studies targeting weight gain in pregnancy because it: (1) is fully remote;
(2) provides personalized messaging to participants based on their progress
toward dietary goals; and (3) follows participants from early pregnancy to 6
months postpartum. Given the limited studies on postpartum weight management
and diet, we measured diet quality at 3 and 6 months to determine whether
dietary changes made during pregnancy persist postpartum and/or whether
differences in progress on goals during pregnancy impact diet quality at 3
and 6 months postpartum.</p>

                  <p id="P15">We are recruiting individuals aged 18–44 who are 10–16
weeks gestation of a confirmed pregnancy (i.e., ultrasound/heartbeat
detected) and nulliparous or &gt; 12 months since previous birth. Women
with BMI ≥25 and &lt;42 who are willing to receive and respond to
texts using their own cell phone or a study-provided phone can be included.
Exclusion criteria include: (a) known pregnancy or fetal
complications/high-risk status (e.g., fetal chromosomal abnormality, chronic
hypertension), (b) multiple gestation, and (c) unable to read/write English.
We also exclude individuals ≥45 years and at the extreme high end of
the BMI range (≥42) due to increased risk for pregnancy
complications, and thus higher likelihood of dropping out [<xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].
Smokers and those who quit smoking &lt;6 months prior to recruitment are
excluded given data that show smoking is associated with increased risk for
pregnancy complications [<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] and smoking cessation affects
eating patterns and weight [<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>–<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].
Individuals with untreated depression (i.e., not on a stable class/dose of
antidepressant for ≥6 months or with Edinburgh Scores &gt;12
based on first trimester clinic screening) are excluded due to documented
relationships between depression, appetite changes, and eating behaviors
[<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Our enrollment target for race/ethnicity is
50% non-Hispanic white and 50% historically minoritized groups. We are

                  <p id="P16">We are employing two primary recruitment strategies: (a) social
media and (b) clinic-based recruitment. Our California-targeted social media
campaign includes a variety of vibrant, animated ads on Facebook and
Instagram. We partner with an organization called StudyPages, by Yuzu Labs
PBC, to run our social media ad campaign. StudyPages provides reports based
on number of ads clicked, screening surveys completed, and enrollments
generated; the number of social media ads displayed each month is adjusted
accordingly to meet our enrollment goals. While a pregnancy must reach 10
weeks gestational age for a participant to enroll, we are allowing people
from 8 to 10 weeks gestational age to pass the screening and we follow up
once they have reached 10 weeks gestation. Meantime, we provide these early
pregnant people with information about the study and allow them time to
consider the study and ask questions. This helps online and clinic
recruitment because many people going to appointments at the clinic are
around 8 weeks pregnant. This early, active engagement very often converts
potential enrollments into official enrollments. Clinic-based recruitment
includes using clinical research coordinators (CRCs) reviewing the automated
appointment system in the electronic health record to generate weekly lists
of patients receiving prenatal care and delivering at our academic medical
center who meet preliminary eligibility criteria (i.e., age, gestational
week, singleton pregnancy, parity, BMI). CRCs either: (1) approach potential
participants at their usual obstetric visit after introduction from a member
of their provider team to describe the study and receive verbal consent to
administer formal prescreening; or (2) email opt-out letters from the clinic
director and follow up via phone with potential participants who do not opt
out to determine interest in study participation and conduct screening. All
participants consent using an IRB-approved form, which can be administered
virtually or in person on a mobile device.</p>

                  <p id="P18">Upon enrollment, participants take a brief survey on their specific
dietary behaviors, their readiness and self-efficacy to change these
behaviors, and dietary preferences/restrictions. The results are tallied,
and our prescription algorithm assigns two, personally tailored dietary
change goals. The algorithm prioritizes goals in highest need of change and
for which the participant has high self-efficacy and readiness, based on the
results of their intake survey. Daily texts help the participant with the
action planning aspect of self-regulation theory; these messages help
participants plan their actions to meet the prescribed goals, and include
meal suggestions, healthy cooking strategies, and educational messages on
the benefits of making the prescribed dietary change. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> demonstrates an example of how the mobile
app looks for participants. Participants engage with
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> Monday through Friday. Once weekly,
participants report via text or the mobile application how many days in the
previous week they adhered to their goal. The remaining four days,
participants receive supportive, goal-focused text messages with
problem-solving skills and dietary tips tailored to the previous
week’s progress on their goal. When participants do not respond, we
use a complex text-back protocol that reminds participants to report
adherence if they do not respond to the initial prompt. The protocol is
based on timing of initial and subsequent prompts and participant requested
times to receive study texts. This protocol has produced weekly
self-monitoring adherence rates between 72% and 84% at 12 months [<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Since we know pregnant people are often using their cell
phones and participating in text messaging[<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] [,<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], a digital
intervention like <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> has the potential to increase
adherence to dietary guidelines for pregnancy and the postpartum period,
which are notoriously low [<xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>–<xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="P19">During the prenatal period, the library of dietary behavioral goals
is consistent with controlling energy intake and meeting nutrition
recommendations for pregnancy. These recommendations include increasing
micronutrient needs such as iron, calcium, and folic acid, consuming a
balanced diet of whole grains, healthy fats, dietary fiber, fruits,
vegetables, and lean protein. <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
lists all of the <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> goals. These goals emphasize diet
quality, including reducing high energy dense foods and increasing low
energy dense foods, which has been shown to be associated with weight loss
and weight loss maintenance [<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="P20">As women successfully meet their goals with &gt;70% adherence
(i.e., at least 5 out of 7 days) for 2 consecutive weeks, they are assigned
the next goal for which they have the highest need combined with the highest

                  <p id="P21">Approximately 10–14 days postdelivery, participants retake
the <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> dietary assessment online. We also collect
information on breastfeeding status, including whether they left the
hospital breastfeeding, and if so, whether or not they were supplementing
with formula. The prescription algorithm assigns two new, personally
tailored dietary change goals based on breastfeeding status to meet
micronutrient needs (e.g., calcium, iron, protein, etc.) and promote safe
postpartum weight loss (½−2 pounds per week). Among
breastfeeding mothers, continued breastfeeding is reassessed with weekly
self-monitoring texts (e.g., Are you still breastfeeding? If yes: Full or
partial? If no, when did you stop?). When breastfeeding status changes
(i.e., full or partial to partial or none), the participant will receive a
link to retake the <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> assessment online so that new
dietary goals can be prescribed that reflect non-breastfeeding status. See

with overweight and gained more than 25 pounds or started pregnancy with obesity
and gained more than 20 pounds. Otherwise, participants will be categorized as
not gaining excess gestational weight. If a participant gained inadequate

categorized as experiencing PPWR if postpartum weight at 6 months is greater
than 1.05*preconception weight. Otherwise, participants will be categorized as
returning to their prepregnancy weight. Preconception weight will be obtained
from participant medical records or defined as the first measurement on the
Bluetooth scale if no preconception weight is available in the medical record.
Delivery weight will be obtained from participant medical records or the last
measurement on the Bluetooth scale if weight was not recorded at delivery.
Studies suggest that early prenatal weights (4–12 weeks gestation) are
accurate proxies for 90% of pregnant people in all BMI classes [<xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Still, because variation does exist, we will
address discrepancies in measuring both preconception weight and delivery weight
by using propensity score matching [<xref rid="R99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Using the imputed
weights will ensure that variance in preconception and delivery weight estimates
as a function of later entry into prenatal care, inaccurate recall, variance in
gestational age at delivery, variance in clinic or Bluetooth scales and other
sources of error is minimized. We have selected the 6-month time point given
research that shows if someone is not within 5% of their prepregnancy weight by
6 months postpartum, they are significantly less likely to return to
prepregnancy weight [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We
will compare the proportion of participants in each group who gain excess
gestational weight and retain postpartum weight versus examining statistical
differences in weights between because: (1) previous intervention studies aimed
at reducing GWG have demonstrated that, while reductions in weight gain are
achieved, birthing people are still gaining more than IOM recommendations for
prepregnancy BMI [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; (2) in clinical
obstetric practice, the current guidelines still use the classifications for GWG
(“inadequate,” “appropriate,” and
“excessive”) as a guide for weight/diet counseling in postpartum
and interpregnancy care [<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]; and (3)
raw weight gains do not have ecological validity when comparing across different
starting weights (e. g., a 150 lb. person and a 200 lb. person may both gain 20
lbs. but it is a different percent of starting weight and may or may not reflect
a clinically meaningful difference in appropriate weight gain).</p>

                <p id="P37">We will measure adherence to text-based self-monitoring cumulatively by
week as the number of times a participant responds to weekly prompts to report
on her progress to the number of times she was prompted, calculated to a
percent. Based on previous trials, we will consider good cumulative adherence to
be ≥70%. Rates will be calculated separately for the prenatal and
postpartum periods. We will measure adherence to prescribed goals cumulatively
by week as the proportion of goals for which a participant has “good
adherence” during the previous week. Because goals change over time with
improved adherence, participants are working on two goals at once, and some
behaviors are easier to change than others, we consider average weekly adherence
to be good at ≥50%. Rates will be calculated separately for the prenatal
and postpartum periods. We will monitor adherence based only on how well
participants do with their goals and how often they complete their check-ins.
For the intervention group this involves weekly goal reporting and the 4 online
follow-ups (26–28 weeks, 36–38 weeks, 3 months postpartum, 6
months postpartum). For the control group, check-ins occur at the 4 online
follow-ups. We also have check-ins regarding breastfeeding for participants who
leave the hospital breastfeeding.</p>

If a participant’s prepregnancy BMI is in the overweight category (25-

weight is greater than 25 pounds, then the indicator will be 1. If a

Hypothesis: The proportion of participants who retain pregnancy weight will
be significantly lower for those in the GROWell arm than those in the
attention control arm. An indicator variable for postpartum weight retention
will take the value of 1 if a participant’s 6-month postpartum weight
is greater than 1.05 of the participant’s prepregnancy weight, and 0
otherwise. A similar series of logistic regression models estimated in aim 1

                  <p id="P43">Our team’s preliminary work showed the proportion of
participants who gained excess gestational weight was 37% in the group using
mHealth vs. 66% receiving usual care, a 29-unit difference [<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Using a text messaging plus in-person
education intervention among obese pregnant women, Soltani et al. [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] found that 28% in the intervention
group gained excess gestational weight vs. 50% in the control group, a
22-unit difference. Based on power calculations for fitting a standard
logistic regression including all covariates, the proposed analyses for aims
1 and 2 have 80% power to detect a minimal adjusted difference of 15
percentage units (OR: 0.55) between the intervention arms for excess
gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention with a total sample
size of 354 for a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. This effect size is
consistent with previous studies and is nearly representative of a

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P45">Excess GWG and PPWR have significant negative long-term impacts on maternal
and offspring health, including increased risk for poor pregnancy and birth outcomes
and cardiometabolic disease across the lifespan. Thus, pregnancy and early
postpartum/infancy are critical time periods for dietary interventions that may
improve population health. We are implementing a large, RCT of a digital dietary
intervention that addresses several key deficits in previous approaches to reducing
GWG and associated postpartum weight retention. First, most studies that found no
reductions in GWG provided generalized dietary education rather than content
specific to pregnancy or the participant’s needs and goals [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Indeed, previous reviews of dietary interventions in
pregnancy have noted that future interventions should include specific,
person-centered dietary goals to improve success rates [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], which
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> offers. Second, among the studies that did find
positive intervention effects on GWG, the majority were high intensity and involved
either in-person or telephonic educational and counseling sessions, some lasting 1.5
to 2 h over multiple visits [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While the literature supports the need for
high-dose interventions to achieve positive behavioral change [<xref rid="R115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], such approaches frequently require significant
human resources to deliver these interventions, which limits generalizability in
real world settings. <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> offers high-intensity support using
digital health, thereby providing the level of contact necessary for change without
the need for significant human resources. Third, few technology-based interventions
have been investigated in large-scale RCTs [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is a significant missed opportunity given that among pregnant
people ages 18–44 across all race/ethnicities, incomes, educational levels,
and geographic locations, at least 90% own cell phones and at least 72% own smart
phones [<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Young adult women specifically
have high penetration of eHealth use, or using mobile and smart phones, Internet,
and social media for general health information seeking and sharing [<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and pregnancy-specific information, including
gestational weight gain [<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In fact,
national data show that being young and female is a consistent predictor of eHealth
use more than any other demographic [<xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>].
Thus, we are using an approach that is likely to resonate with birthing people
across all socioeconomic statuses, geographic locations, and race/ethnicities.
Lastly, and importantly, few previous interventions have extended into the
postpartum period, but rather, ended in the late third trimester despite calls for
inter-pregnancy weight control strategies [<xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>–<xref rid="R120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] and strong
evidence that PPWR six months post-birth is highly prevalent and increases risk for
poor midlife health, including morbid obesity, related cardiometabolic disease, and
cancer [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Continuing
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> through six months postpartum may provide participants
with longer-term support that has the capacity to improve dietary intake well beyond
pregnancy, including supporting intrapartum health for individuals who have future
children.</p>
              <p id="P46">During the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting non-essential clinical
trials has become ever more challenging. However, there is also a unique opportunity
to use technology to allow access to clinical trials to previously underrepresented
participants [<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Before the pandemic, we
included in-person study visits that would have been difficult for us to accomplish
for our more rural participants or for those with transportation, time, or other
barriers. Now we are able to reach people across the state of California.
Additionally, individuals who may have not wanted to participate due to the
in-person requirement can now participate entirely remotely. Making a clinical trial
completely virtual is not feasible for all studies, but it worked well for
<italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> after a few modifications, including creating options
for: (1) the ability to provide a signed consent via DocuSign; (2) mailing a
Bluetooth scale for weight data that interfaces with our application; and (3) online
surveys rather than in-person data collection.</p>
              <p id="P47">Novel approaches to maintaining GWG within IOM-recommended ranges and
supporting postpartum weight loss are critical to advancing health across the
lifespan. Additionally, given the rise in children’s rates of overweight and
obesity and associated cardiometabolic conditions (e.g., hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia) that have been linked to intrauterine exposures (e.g.,
maternal diet, over-weight/obesity, and adiposity) and dietary consumption in early
infancy, prenatal and early postpartum interventions are likely to have the greatest
impact on lifelong health. Establishing <italic toggle="yes">GROWell</italic> as effective at
reducing GWG and PPWR may provide a foundation for using digital health to promote
healthy behaviors during pregnancy for optimal population health in the 21st
century.</p>
