                <p>Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein which is highly expressed in several epithelial cancers and may have a role in cell adhesion and metastases. In this study, we used prospectively obtained clinical and pathological data to characterize mesothelin expression in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Tissue was obtained from patients who underwent molecular profiling of potentially actionable genes on a trial of molecular profiling and targeted therapies in advanced thoracic malignancies. We immunohistochemically evaluated the intensity, and the percentage of cells expressing mesothelin in 93 advanced lung adenocarcinomas. The evaluation was blinded for molecular data and outcome. Mutations of <italic>EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, AKT1, PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>HER2</italic> were assessed by pyrosequencing; <italic>HER2</italic> amplification and <italic>ALK</italic> translocation were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. 53% of advanced lung adenocarcinomas expressed mesothelin to some degree; high mesothelin expression, defined as mesothelin positivity in more than 25% of cells, was found in 24% of patients. High mesothelin expression was associated with inferior survival (median 18.2 months vs. 32.9 months; <italic>P</italic> = 0.014). High mesothelin expression was strongly associated with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Our results provide strong rationale to explore anti-mesothelin targeted therapies in advanced lung adenocarcinoma especially in the <italic>KRAS</italic>-mutant subgroup.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, accounting for more than one million deaths every year. [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes approximately 85% of lung cancers and about 40% of patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC have advanced disease. [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the past decade, the standard of care for patients with advanced disease was platinum-based chemotherapy, which improved survival, quality of life and symptom control compared with supportive care. [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, the median overall survival is only about a year; only 3.5% of patients are alive five years after diagnosis. Chemotherapy is also associated with high morbidity. [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In recent years, identification of “druggable” oncogenic alterations such as mutations in <italic>EGFR</italic> and <italic>ALK</italic> translocations, and development of drugs that specifically target these mutations have led to a substantial improvement in the prognosis of patients with advanced lung cancer. [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, “druggable” alterations have been detected in less than half of all advanced NSCLC patients. [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Mutations in the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene, for example, accounts for 20–30% of lung adenocarcinomas, yet no targeted agents are currently available. Hence there is an unmet need to develop new, effective and minimally toxic targeted therapies in advanced NSCLC.</p>
              <p>Mesothelin is a 40-kDa cell surface glycoprotein that is present on normal mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium. [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Mesothelin expression in normal human tissues is observed only in a single layer of mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium, surface epithelial cells of the ovary, tunica vaginalis, rete testis and the tonsilar and fallopian tube epithelial cells. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, mesothelin is highly expressed in several cancers, including epitheloid mesotheliomas, pancreatic, biliary adenocarcinomas, gastric and ovarian cancers. [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The high expression of mesothelin in cancers have prompted its therapeutic targeting using a variety of strategies including immunotoxins, monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, vaccines and adoptive T cell therapy. [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] We recently demonstrated major and durable tumor regressions in chemotherapy-refractory patients with advanced epitheliod mesothelioma using the anti-mesothelin immunotoxin SS1P. [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p>
              <p>Conceptually, SS1P and other mesothelin-targeted therapies might also confer efficacy in other tumor types that over-express mesothelin. Identifying these cancers could thus expand the therapeutic utility of these therapies. Mesothelin expression has been demonstrated in approximately 30–70% of lung adenocarcinoma. [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, these studies were retrospective, analyzed a limited number of samples, did not provide clinical information and did not study the patterns of expression in detail.</p>
              <p>Given the paucity of data and the heterogeneous and conflicting results of prior investigations, we sought to determine the expression patterns and prognostic value of mesothelin in advanced lung adenocarcinoma and the association of mesothelin expression with other molecular alterations and clinico-pathologic variables. We demonstrate here that 24% of advanced lung adenocarcinoma express high levels of mesothelin, and that high mesothelin expression is associated with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type and mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> and, independent of the mutation status, is associated with decreased overall survival. Our results suggest that mesothelin targeted therapies could be useful in patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant lung cancer, a subtype for which no targeted therapies are currently available.</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p>From February 2011 to December 2012, 272 patients with NSCLC enrolled and underwent molecular profiling in the pilot trial of molecular profiling and targeted therapies in advanced thoracic malignancies at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute. [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Two hundred and eleven had adenocarcinoma histology with 179 having advanced disease (stages III or IV) at diagnosis. Ninety three patients had adenocarcinoma histology, stage III or IV at diagnosis and had adequate FFPE samples available for further studies.</p>

                <p>A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the association between mesothelin expression and overall survival from date of diagnosis. The following covariates were included: age, smoking, <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations. Mesothelin vs. non-mesothelin expression remained not significantly associated with survival after adjusting for clinical covariates. However, high mesothelin expression remained significantly associated with survival when adjusted for covariates.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study, we used prospectively obtained clinical and pathological data to characterize mesothelin expression in lung cancer. We evaluated the intensity, and the percentage of cells expressing mesothelin in tissue obtained from 93 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who underwent molecular profiling for potentially actionable genes using a multi-platform approach. We found that approximately 50% of advanced lung adenocarcinomas express mesothelin and high mesothelin expression, defined as mesothelin positivity in more than 25% of cells, was associated with inferior survival. Importantly, we found that high-expression of mesothelin was strongly associated with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> and wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic>.</p>
              <p>In early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, a recent retrospective study found mesothelin expression in 69% of tumors. Patients with high mesothelin expression were more likely to have <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, compared with patients with low expression [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the advanced lung cancer setting, prior studies of mesothelin expression are retrospective, involved small number of patients and a very heterogeneous population. [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In addition to being the largest series of prospective assessment of mesothelin expression in lung cancer, the strengths of our study include a uniform patient population, all of whom enrolled in a trial of tumor molecular profiling, availability of robust clinical, pathologic, immunohistochemical, and mutational data and long-term follow-up.</p>
              <p>The mechanistic association of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation to mesothelin is not delineated by the present study. The observed enrichment for mesothelin expression within the <italic>KRAS</italic> mutated lung adenocracinoma population could occur due to a direct or indirect regulatory relationship between the two proteins. Transcription enhancer factor (TEF-1) is known to be upregulated in tumors from a <italic>KRAS</italic> mutated, genetically engineered mouse model of lung cancer. [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] TEF-1 has also been shown to directly bind an upstream enhancer sequence in the mesothelin gene, causing upregulation of mesothelin transcription. [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, concordance of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation and mesothelin expression have not been observed in mesothelioma and high grade serous ovarian cancers where robust mesothelin expression is nearly universal [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation quite rare. [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] By contrast, almost all pancreatic adenocarcinomas express both mesothelin and mutated <italic>KRAS</italic>. However, the temporal relationship of their expression in tumor development is not suggestive of a regulatory relationship since <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation is one of the earliest detectable changes in pre-malignant PanIN lesions while mesothelin expression does not occur until much later in adenocarcinoma development. [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] These data from other tumor types suggest that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation alone is neither necessary nor sufficient to universally induce mesothelin expression and that other pathways must also participate in regulation of mesothelin. Our data are consistent with these observations since complete concordance between <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status and mesothelin expression was not observed in our study. Nevertheless, this does not preclude the possibility that there may be a direct regulatory relationship in some lung tumors. Further studies would be required to establish whether this does occur.</p>
              <p>The results of this study and previous work by others provide strong rationale that anti-mesothelin targeted therapy should be explored as a therapeutic modality in advanced lung adenocarcinomas. Our prior studies have demonstrated that mesothelin mRNA and protein are present in a substantial number of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and that SS1P, an anti-mesothelin recombinant immunotoxin, was cytotoxic to mesothelin expressing lung cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 2 to 5 ng/mL. [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We have recently shown that in patients with chemotherapy refractory malignant mesothelioma, SS1P in combination with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide leads to durable tumor regression. [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] These lines of compelling evidence suggest that SS1P may confer clinical activity in mesothelin-expressing lung adenocarcinomas. Several other mesothelin-targeted therapies including a vaccine [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], antibody drug conjugate [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and a monoclonal antibody [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are undergoing phase I/II clinical trials.</p>
              <p>The current study provides a strong rationale to target mesothelin in advanced lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that clinical trials of mesothelin-directed therapies in lung cancer should focus on patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations, the most commonly mutated oncogene in NSCLC and one which has proven intractable even in the era of targeted therapy.</p>

                <p>Patients were prospectively enrolled in a pilot trial of molecular profiling and targeted therapies in advanced thoracic malignancies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT01306045). [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Main eligibility criteria were histologically confirmed, advanced stage lung cancer and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ≤ 2. Patients had to have biopsiable disease and be willing to undergo biopsy for molecular profiling or have formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks suitable for molecular profiling analysis. Patients underwent new tumor biopsies when possible but archival tumor samples were also used. Tumor samples were screened for mutations in <italic>AKT1, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, KRAS, NRAS</italic>, and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> by pyrosequencing; <italic>HER2</italic> amplification and <italic>ALK</italic> translocation were assessed by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Patients who did not have a FFPE sample available for mesothelin immunohistochemistry (IHC) were excluded from this analysis. All patients were followed for survival. The protocol was approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <p>Mesothelin IHC was performed on tumor samples obtained using monoclonal antibody 5B2 (Novocastra/Leica, Bannockburn, IL) at 1:40 dilution. One slide was tested for each case. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (20 mins in citrate buffer, pH 6.0) we performed prior to incubation with primary antibody. The detection was performed with Ventana Ultra View detection kit with DAB chromogen. All immunostaining was done using positive and negative controls and results were highly concordant.</p>
                <p>Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated by a pathologist (MM) with special expertise in evaluating anti-mesothelin IHC who was blinded to the clinical and molecular data. The positivity (strength of labeling) was assessed as negative (no labeling), weak 1+, moderate 2+, and strong 3+, and the percentage of positive cells was also estimated. High mesothelin expression was defined as mesothelin expression in &gt;25% cells.</p>
