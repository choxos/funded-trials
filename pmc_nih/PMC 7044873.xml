                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Many breast cancer survivors report an inability to fully participate in activities of daily living after completing cancer treatment. Reduced activity participation is linked to negative consequences for individuals (eg, depression, reduced quality of life) and society (reduced workforce participation). There is currently a lack of evidence-based interventions that directly foster cancer survivors’ optimal participation in life roles and activities. Pilot study data suggest rehabilitation interventions based on behavioural activation (BA) and problem-solving treatment (PST) can facilitate post-treatment role resumption among breast cancer survivors.</p>

                  <p>This protocol describes a multisite randomised controlled trial comparing a 4-month long, nine-session BA and PST-informed rehabilitation intervention (BA/PS) against a time-matched, attention control condition. The overall objective is to assess the efficacy of BA/PS for enhancing breast cancer survivors’ activity participation and quality of life over time. A total of 300 breast cancer survivors reporting participation restrictions after completing curative treatment for stage 1–3 breast cancer within the past year will be recruited across two sites (Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and University of Alabama at Birmingham). Assessments are collected on enrolment (T1) and 8 (T2), 20 (T3) and 44 (T4) weeks later.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>While the 5-year relative survival rate for breast cancer has risen to 89%,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> many breast cancer survivors report an inability to fully participate in vocational, social, physical and instrumental activities of daily living after completing cancer treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The activities most often affected by cancer and its treatment are those requiring sustained time and effort outside the home (eg, working, shopping and social events).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Reduced activity participation is linked to negative consequences at both an individual and societal level. Breast cancer survivors who report lower participation in productive and social activities experience greater depression,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> lower quality of life,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and shortened survival.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Additionally, the excess employment disability and reduced work productivity experienced by breast cancer survivors<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> can result in fewer financial and social opportunities for the individuals and lower productivity for society.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Two recent reviews concluded that there is a lack of evidence-based interventions that directly foster cancer survivors’ optimal participation in life roles and activities.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Our team developed a theory-driven intervention designed to directly foster cancer survivors’ role resumption and activity participation. We refer to the intervention as behavioural activation/problem-solving (BA/PS), as it integrates the cognitive–behavioural therapies of behavioural activation<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> and problem-solving treatment<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> and incorporates concepts from an occupational therapy theory called the person-environment-occupational performance model.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> BA/PS teaches breast cancer survivors to strategically adapt an activity and the environment in order to make the activity easier, more enjoyable and more sustainable. Over nine sessions, survivors set, adjust and achieve strategic goals that incrementally enhance and optimise their participation in daily activities. The present study builds on three pilot studies that previously demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of the brief, practical, telephone-delivered BA/PS intervention to fostering functional recovery after breast cancer treatment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref>

We obtained a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver to allow research staff to screen clinic schedules to identify potential study participants. Research coordinators consult with clinicians to confirm patient eligibility based on clinical characteristics and then clinicians deliver the study brochure to patients.

There is no upper age limit imposed, as evidence from our pilot studies suggests the intervention is flexible enough to be used with various challenges that occur across the age range.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 20</xref> Because our sites see a mean of 3.8 males each year with breast cancer, we will enrol only females as there are not enough males to draw sound conclusions generalisable to a male population.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Our approach to improving activity participation reflects self-regulation models that emphasise alignment between goals and circumstances.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> Recognition of a discrepancy between one’s goals and circumstances leads to either adaptive or maladaptive coping. Adaptive coping can be viewed as efforts to change the activity, environment or self. These efforts manifest themselves in active coping (ie, taking action instead of waiting for problems to disappear), planning (strategically deciding what actions to take) and positive reframing (adjusting expectations and interpretations of events).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Goal adjustment is another self-regulation strategy with two components.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The first component, goal disengagement, prevents the negative emotional consequences of pursuing a futile goal. The second component, goal re-engagement, directs renewed energy towards attainable goals. BA/PS is designed to promote adaptive coping and goal adjustment through a process of strategic goal setting, problem-solving and action planning centred on increasing the ease and enjoyment of activity participation and life roles, leading to lower distress, improved productivity and higher quality of life.</p>
                <p>BA/PS teaches survivors to (A) systematically examine the reasons an activity is challenging, (B) set achievable short-term goals that have the potential to improve participation, (C) brainstorm solutions including activity adaptations and environmental modifications, (D) construct and implement a detailed action plan, and (E) evaluate the results and level of goal attainment. The structured process gives participants repeated practice in goal re-engagement that leads them progressively closer to their long-term functional goals.</p>
                <p>The intervention was developed over a series of pilot studies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> In the first session, the interventionist presents the rationale for BA/PS, promotes a positive problem orientation and educates the participant about the framework for problem-solving and action planning. The interventionist then administers the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> to elicit participant priorities, motivation and long-term goals. In subsequent sessions, the interventionist guides the participant in using the BA/PS framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>) to set a goal, brainstorm solutions to challenges and create a detailed action plan for the coming week. Results of the action plan are used to refine goals and action plans and promote steady progress towards personally selected recovery goals.</p>

                <title>Attention control condition</title>
                <p>Using randomisation and a usual care control condition would eliminate threats to internal validity that arise with time and history (ie, participants might improve naturally as time goes by or because of an event occurring at the sites). However, BA/PS participants would be receiving more attention and support than the usual care participants. We recognise that the attention experienced within a weekly telephone call from a warm and supportive therapist could lift the spirits of participants and it is theoretically plausible that feeling more hopeful or supported could allow and encourage participants to become more active and engaged in life. It is important to control for this possibility so that we can determine if it is our specific BA/PS intervention, and not general support or attention, that drives any effects seen in our data. Thus, the attention control condition will allow us to account for the effect of time and history as well as other non-specific effects of attention.</p>
                <p>Increased attrition can occur if participants feel that an attention placebo is not a meaningful use of time.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> As such, we decided to provide education regarding participant-selected cancer survivorship topics (ie, healthy diets, physical activity, lymphoedema management, smoking cessation, fear of recurrence, cognitive challenges, communication with providers and family, fatigue, sleep, hot flashes and night sweats, and work accommodations) during the control telephone contacts. The control condition will match the intervention in terms of the number of sessions, the delivery by telephone and delivery by an occupational therapist. This will allow us to determine the effect of the specific BA/PS elements (ie, strategic goal setting, problem-solving, activity adaptation, environmental modification and action planning) on participation and quality of life.</p>

These items should also function as a manipulation check; at minimum, participants assigned to the BA/PS intervention should report higher levels of benefit on the goal-setting item as the control condition does not include goal setting as an active component.</p>

                <p>Using a time-averaged difference approach,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> at a corrected significance level of 0.05/3=0.017, and with three time points after baseline, the required sample size to test for the minimally important effects of BA/PS on participation (PROMIS scales) ranges from 63 to 117 in each arm to achieve 80% power for within-subject correlations ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. The required sample size to test for the minimally important effect of BA/PS on quality of life (overall FACT-G score) ranges from 45 to 83 in each arm in order to achieve 80% power for within-subject correlations ranging from 0.2 to 0.8.</p>
                <p>We will examine the balance between study groups with respect to baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics and measures of effect size. We will examine the patterns of missing data due to dropout, and whether baseline characteristics are associated with dropout. Baseline factors showing non-trivial imbalances between groups or that are predictive of dropout will then be used as adjusting covariates in the longitudinal group comparisons.</p>
                <p>Our objective is to compare functional recovery across conditions over time in terms of participation (PROMIS scales; Aim 1), productivity (Disability Days and WLQ-SF; Aim 1), quality of life (FACT-G; Aim 2) and coping style, distress and goal adjustment (Brief COPE, HADS and GDGRS; Aim 3). A longitudinal model fitted with linear mixed methods will be used for each outcome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). The focus of inference will be the between-group difference in outcome trajectories over the study time points, modelled by a time by group interaction. The overall treatment effect will be computed as the between-group difference in change from baseline (change from T1 averaged over T2–T4) estimated with a linear contrast.</p>

                <p>Mixed modelling techniques and covariate adjustment will reduce the impact of missing data, as the missingness is not assumed completely at random (MCAR) but conditionally (on the covariates) at random (ie, missing at random (MAR), a milder assumption).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Should dropout exceed the 20% allowed by the sample size, non-parametric multiple imputation<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> will be employed to determine the robustness of the conclusions for the main analyses under the milder MAR assumption. Due to the non-invasive, supportive nature of the BA/PS intervention, as well as the attention control condition, we do not expect to encounter non-random dropout. However, we will examine the tracking system records and logs with regard to dropout to determine the main reasons for dropout. If sufficient indication of non-random dropout is found, sensitivity analyses under different assumptions for the missing data mechanism will be conducted, following the methodology described by Molenberghs and Kenward<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> in which the missing data mechanism needs to be modelled explicitly.</p>
                <p>A false discovery rate (FDR) approach<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> will be used to adjust inferential results for multiple inferences on the same body of data, separately for the primary analyses and the exploratory analyses. The FDR is the expected proportion of true null differences among those that are declared ‘significant’. The FDR will be set at 10%. All research products will disclose the number of inferences conducted and whether outcomes were primary or exploratory.</p>
                <p>The BA/PS intervention is designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of a diverse group of breast cancer survivors and our diverse sample will provide an opportunity to identify any unanticipated moderator effects. Therefore, we will explore whether there are subgroups of participants who benefited most and least during the study, as per the primary outcomes. We will use recursive partitioning, that is, classification and regression trees (CART),<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> to conduct moderator analyses. CART is a non-parametric modelling approach that allows extracting of multivariate profiles from a sufficiently large data set under minimal modelling assumptions, based on values of an outcome and participant characteristics. Because CART is data driven, these analyses are considered exploratory.</p>
                <p>To avoid assuming that missing outcome data due to dropout are missing completely at random (ie, MCAR), a random forest-based algorithm<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 56</xref> will be used to generate three imputed data sets comprising baseline characteristics, group assignment and longitudinal outcome variables. CART modelling will be implemented on each imputed data set and results will be compared as a form of sensitivity analysis. The target variables for the CART modelling will be the average change from baseline in each primary outcome. Regression tree models for these target variables will be fitted using as predictors the group assignment and selected baseline characteristics. These baseline characteristics will include indicators of pertinent subpopulations of interest: site, race, income, age, and so on. We will implement the conditional inference approach<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> to fit the tree models and use repeated 10-fold cross-validation to determine the final tree size. The tree model is a decision-tree-like structure that is interpreted based on the characteristics of the resulting groups of participants.</p>
                <p>Primary analyses will use an intent-to-treat approach. All available data from all participants who undergo randomisation will be included in the analyses according to the group assigned, regardless of any postrandomisation protocol deviations.</p>
