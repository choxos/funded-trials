                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Natural killer (NK) cells are one of the main effector populations of immunotherapy with monoclonal antibody and cytokines, used in combination with chemotherapy to treat children with high-risk neuroblastoma on this phase II trial. However, the impact of chemoimmunotherapy on NK cell kinetics, phenotype, and function is understudied.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We prospectively examined NK cell properties from 63 children with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma enrolled in a phase II trial (NCT01857934) and correlated our findings with tumor volume reduction after 2 courses of chemoimmunotherapy. NK cell studies were conducted longitudinally during chemoimmunotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) with optional haploidentical NK cell infusion and additional immunotherapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Chemoimmunotherapy led to significant NK cytopenia, but complete NK cell recovery reliably occurred by day 21 of each therapy course as well as after autoHCT. Haploidentical NK cell infusion elevated the NK cell count transiently during autoHCT. NK cell cytotoxicity increased significantly during treatment compared with diagnosis. In addition, NK cells maintained their ability to respond to cytokine stimulation in culture longitudinally. Unsupervised cluster analysis of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell count and tumor volume at diagnosis and after two courses of chemoimmunotherapy identified two patient groups with distinct primary tumor sizes and therapy responses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>After profound NK cytopenia due to chemoimmunotherapy, endogenously reconstituted NK cells exhibit enhanced NK cytotoxicity compared with pretherapy measurements. Our data suggest a relationship between CD56<sup>bright</sup> expression and tumor size before and after two courses of chemoimmunotherapy; however, future studies are necessary to confirm this relationship and its predictive significance.</p>

              <p>Immunotherapy with an antidisialoganglioside (GD2) antibody, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), combined with <italic>cis</italic>-retinoic acid, is the standard of care for the treatment of children with high-risk neuroblastoma in a state of minimal residual disease (MRD).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These patients attain MRD (ie, at least a partial response (PR) to multimodal therapy) by completing induction chemotherapy, local control with surgery and radiation therapy, and myeloablative chemotherapy, followed by hematopoietic progenitor cell rescue (autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT)).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recently, we used immunotherapy (monoclonal anti-GD2 antibody with GM-CSF and IL-2) combined with chemotherapy (chemoimmunotherapy) as an upfront regimen, yielding early response rates that exceed those achieved by chemotherapy alone.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma relies on natural killer (NK) cells as one of the major effector cell populations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> IL-2 that is administered as part of immunotherapy activates NK cells and enhances their function.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the impact of chemoimmunotherapy on NK cell phenotype and function is not well understood. Here, we aimed to better understand the quantitative and qualitative differences in NK cells in children with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma who underwent chemoimmunotherapy and autoHCT with optional adoptive NK cell therapy and immunotherapy as part of a phase II clinical trial. We obtained longitudinal peripheral blood samples from these patients, performed NK cell immune profiling, and examined the relationship of these markers with clinical tumor response and NK cytotoxicity.</p>

                  <p>Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson (BD) LSRFortessa<sup>TM</sup> (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) equipped with five lasers. The machine was calibrated daily, rainbow calibration particles (Spherotech) were used to adjust and match the voltages between experiments, and a frozen stock of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as reagent control with each experiment. Irrespective of blood count recovery, phenotyping was performed on days 0, 7 and 21 of induction courses 1 (cyclophosphamide, topotecan), 3 (cisplatin, etoposide) and 4 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>), 7 days before (denoted as PREBMT; ie, prior to myeloablative conditioning) and 21 days after autologous hematopoietic cell infusion.

NK cells were grown in culture overnight in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (Lonza), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco media) and IL-2 (50 IU/mL) or IL-15 (10 ng/mL) when indicated (Biological Resource Branch at the National Cancer Institute). Their cytotoxicity was assessed in cocultured with yellow fluorescent protein-expressing K562 cells for 4 hours. Because of the limited blood sample volume, we were unable to perform effector-to-target (E:T) ratio titrations. Instead, an E:T ratio of 5:1 was chosen for all experiments because we have demonstrated that this ratio best distinguishes the differences in NK cytotoxicity among donors and NK cell activation status.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> After 4 hours, tumor cells were quantified by flow cytometry.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>Patient characteristics were summarized by descriptive statistics (count and percent, mean and SD or median and range). The distribution of cell counts over time was illustrated by descriptive statistics and box-and-whisker plots based on a transformation; however, statistical testing was performed on untransformed data. When using a transformation, non-zero data were transformed with a log<sub>10</sub> transformation and zero data were transformed with a log<sub>10</sub><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> replacement. A series of Friedman tests were used to examine overall differences in NK cell counts between study time points with complete data. The overall test was followed by pairwise comparisons between study time points using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and were adjusted using the false discovery rate. The Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the relationship between donor to patient mismatch against CD158e1 (yes/no) and survival status (alive/deceased). Wilcoxon rank sum tests adjusted using the false discovery rate were used to compare the percentage of receptor cells by early clinical tumor response after two courses of chemotherapy (SD vs CR, VGPR, or PR). Unsupervised clustering using k-means clustering with average silhouette direct optimization for determining the optimal number of clusters was performed on CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell count and clinical responses.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A visualization of the k-means partitioning method was performed using the R package factoextra where observations are represented by points using principal components and an ellipse is drawn around each cluster.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Generalized estimating equation models were used for modeling continuous outcomes with repeated patient information. The robustness of these marginal models were further evaluated using Bayesian generalized linear regression using normal prior distribution for the coefficients. Forest plots were used to visualize the results of regression analysis by displaying the point estimate and 95% CI or uncertainty interval for the coefficients estimated by modeling. Statistical analyses were conducted with R V.3.6.1 and SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute). A two-sided significance level of p&lt;0.05 was used for all statistical tests.</p>

                <p>Thirty-one patients received adoptive transfer of haploidentical NK cells (median cell dose, 20.7; range, 3–114). NK cell count was higher on day 7 (median 7.9 (0.0–38.6) cells/µL vs median 2.8 (0.0–23.8) cells/µL P=0.005) and lower on day 21 (median 141.6 (24.5–561.0) cells/µL vs median 170.2 (124.1–408.6) cells/µL, p=0.106) in patients who received a haploidentical NK cell infusion compared with those who did not. Median donor NK cell chimerisms were 6% (range, 0%–81%) on day 7% and 0% (range, 0%–35%) on day 21. Thirteen of 31 (42%) patients received more than 25× 10<sup>6</sup>/kg NK cells and had donor NK cells detectable 7–21 days after infusion. All six patients with undetectable donor NK cells at all time points after NK cell infusion received lower NK cell doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Among the 31 patients who received haploidentical NK cell therapy, 17 were infused with alloreactive NK cells, but only 12 of these patients had evaluable alloreactive NK cell counts at both day 7 and day 21 post-transplant. All twelve patients had a rise and therefore an expansion in total alloreactive NK cell counts from day 7 to day 21 post-transplant (median (range): 18.97 [0.03–106.23]; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2C</xref>). When stratifying by tumor response after two courses of therapy, it was observed that patients with SD (n=4) had greater expansion in alloreactive NK cells compared with patients with less residual disease (n=8; ie, in CR, VGPR or PR) after induction therapy (median 56.4 (11.8–106.2) cells/µL vs 8.43 (0.0–74.7) cells/µL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). Five of 23 patients (21.7%) without CD158e1 (KIR3DL1)-mismatch and none of the eight patients (0.0%) with KIR3DL1-mismatch died (p=0.291).</p>

                <p>Cytotoxic capacity of resting NK cells increased in comparison to baseline measures during the first three courses of chemoimmunotherapy before declining to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). The most significant effect was seen on day +21 after autoHCT. The robustness of these findings was confirmed when we applied a Bayesian generalized linear regression model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 2</xref>). Longitudinal ex vivo cytokine stimulation of NK cells from patients demonstrated that these cells had consistently higher cytotoxicity than resting NK cells, indicating that they maintain their potential to respond to stimulation and enhance their cytotoxic capacity ex vivo. The descriptive analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>. Regression analysis of fixed covariates reached statistical significance for type of activation (p&lt;0.001) and time point (p&lt;0.001).</p>

                <p>All studied NK cell receptors shared similar longitudinal expression patterns during chemoimmunotherapy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 3</xref>). Because we observed large variability in the CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell count and the change in pretreatment and postcourse 2 tumor volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary figure 4</xref>), we chose these parameters to perform an unsupervised clustering analysis. The final cluster algorithm considered only tumor volume at diagnosis, tumor volume at course 2, and CD56<sup>bright</sup> percentage. We identified two non-overlapping patient clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref>), among which we assessed the distributions of several demographic variables as well as tumor-related and therapy-related features. These two clusters differed in primary tumor size at diagnosis (p&lt;0.001) and after two therapy courses (p&lt;0.001), and tumor volume change (p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this phase II trial, children with high-risk neuroblastoma received immunotherapy throughout multimodal treatment, and NK cell kinetics, phenotype, and function were evaluated longitudinally. Chemoimmunotherapy led to profound NK cytopenia, as expected. However, all children demonstrated sufficient and reliable endogenous reconstitution at the end of each induction course with enhanced NK cytotoxicity compared with that of baseline measurements (ie, prior to therapy). In addition, these cells maintained their capability to mount an activation response following cytokine stimulation ex vivo, altogether suggesting that NK cell function is enhanced either due to replacement of old by new NK cells and/or due to the administration of IL-2 or IL-15. To differentiate whether enhanced NK cytotoxicity is a result of NK cell reconstitution or immunotherapy, we suggest comparing the presented data to NK cell function in children receiving standard chemotherapy without immunotherapy.</p>
              <p>When we examined the relationship between CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell count and degree of tumor response, we found two patient subgroups that are segregated by their primary tumor burden at diagnosis and after two courses of chemoimmunotherapy, tumor regression to chemoimmunotherapy, and therapy response. This finding suggests intrinsic differences in the NK cell repertoire and a relationship between tumor and NK cell features in this cohort that warrants further investigation. Our results also suggest that correlative biology studies in future clinical trials should incorporate broad unbiased phenotypic analyses as performed by mass cytometry, functional testing, and molecular analyses of NK cells. When correlated with clinical tumor response, these biological data may help stratify patients by their differential response to chemo-immunotherapy, resulting in individualized treatment approaches for high-risk neuroblastoma.</p>
              <p>After autoHCT, haploidentical NK cell infusion can transiently correct the profound NK cytopenia; however, they were subject to rapid clearance as previously described in other studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Haploidentical NK cells in the present study were purified and directly infused. It is possible that activation in culture<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> may increase their survival in the recipient as suggested by in vivo studies.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In addition, ex vivo NK cell expansion may allow the infusion of higher cell doses and could be beneficial given that all patients who received more than 25×10<sup>6</sup>/kg NK cells had transient engraftment. Whether more prolonged engraftment would result in improved outcome is not known. We noted that qualitative features of donor NK cells, namely the presence of CD158e1 (KIR3DL1)-mismatch, could potentially be associated with better outcomes in some children as previously described<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and support further studies to determine favorable donor criteria.</p>
              <p>Altogether, our findings suggest a relationship between NK cells and clinical responses to chemoimmunotherapy in neuroblastoma and encourage future investigations to improve our understanding of NK cell receptor biology and function in this context.</p>
