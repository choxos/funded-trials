              <abstract>
                <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a challenging disease to treat and urgently requires new therapies to improve its treatment outcome. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperative antileukemic activities of panobinostat and cytarabine or daunorubicin (DNR) in AML cell lines and diagnostic blast samples <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Panobinostat suppressed expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in AML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further, panobinostat significantly increased cytarabine- or DNR-induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis, and abrogated S and/or G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. Analogous results were obtained by shRNA knockdown of BRCA1, CHK1, or RAD51. Cotreatment of NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ<sup>null</sup> mice bearing AML xenografts with panobinostat and cytarabine significantly increased survival compared to either cytarabine or panobinostat treatment alone. Additional studies revealed that panobinostat suppressed the expression of <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> through downregulation of E2F1 transcription factor. Our results establish a novel mechanism underlying the cooperative antileukemic activities of these drug combinations in which panobinostat suppresses expression of <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> to enhance cytarabine and daunorubicin sensitivities in AML cells.</p>

              <p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge. Resistance to cytarabine (ara-C) and anthracycline [e.g., daunorubicin (DNR)]-based chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in this disease <xref rid="pone.0079106-Burnett1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079106-Zwaan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, new therapies are urgently needed for this deadly disease. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACIs) are a promising new class of anti-cancer drugs, which induce differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in human leukemic cells, but less so in normal cells <xref rid="pone.0079106-QuintasCardama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079106-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Despite their well-characterized molecular and cellular effects <xref rid="pone.0079106-Bolden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, single-agent clinical activities of HDACIs have been modest <xref rid="pone.0079106-Byrd1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079106-Kuendgen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Preclinical data indicate a compelling rationale for designing drug combinations using HDACIs with other chemotherapy agents <xref rid="pone.0079106-Nolan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that vorinostat can be given safely with standard chemotherapy and the combination is active against AML <xref rid="pone.0079106-Gojo2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-GarciaManero3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. We previously demonstrated synergistic antileukemic interactions between valproic acid (VPA) and cytarabine in pediatric AML cells, accompanied by cooperative induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.</p>
              <p>Our most recent studies involving the treatment of AML cell lines with structurally diverse HDACIs and shRNA knockdown of individual HDACs revealed that downregulation of both HDACs 1 and 6 is critical in enhancing cytarabine-induced apoptosis. At clinically achievable concentrations, panobinostat showed the best antileukemic activities and significantly enhanced cytarabine-induced apoptosis in AML cells, accompanied by cooperative induction of DNA DSBs <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Based on these new findings and previous studies that have shown panobinostat to be the most potent inhibitor among pan-HDACIs in clinical development <xref rid="pone.0079106-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Atadja1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, we chose panobinostat as our prototype HDACI for this study.</p>
              <p>The ability of HDACIs to enhance cytarabine-induced DNA DSBs and apoptosis in AML cells suggests that they may suppress the DNA damage response (DDR), a complex network involving cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, transcriptional programs, and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0079106-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In cancer treatment, the DDR occurs in response to DNA damaging agents (e.g., cytarabine and DNR), representing an important mechanism limiting chemotherapeutic efficacy <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. BRCA1 and RAD51 are two of the central proteins in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway <xref rid="pone.0079106-Plummer1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Breast and ovarian cancer cells harboring <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations are sensitive to DNA damaging agents and radiation therapy, highlighting the critical role of BRCA1 in response to DNA damaging agents <xref rid="pone.0079106-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Venkitaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. RAD51 expression was increased in a wide range of human tumors, most likely contributing to drug resistance <xref rid="pone.0079106-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Cell cycle checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage is another critical component of the DDR <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. CHK1 contributes to all currently defined cell cycle checkpoints <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It has been documented that inhibition of CHK1 with pharmacologic intervention or by siRNA knockdown sensitizes cancer cells to S/G2-phase-acting agents <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Garrett1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Downregulation of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 would enhance DNA damage and abrogate cell cycle checkpoints induced by DNA damaging agents, thus promoting apoptosis.</p>
              <p>In this study, we found that panobinostat suppressed the expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> in AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts at clinically achievable doses (40 nM and below). This was accompanied by cooperative induction of DNA DSBs and apoptosis, and abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints induced by cytarabine or DNR. Analogous results were obtained by shRNA knockdown of BRCA1, CHK1, or RAD51 in AML cells. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that panobinostat suppresses the DDR, which represents a novel molecular mechanism underlying the antileukemic activities of HDACIs combined with DNA damaging agents in AML and potentially other cancers, as well.</p>

                <title>Panobinostat Suppresses BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 Expression in AML Cell Lines and Diagnostic Blasts</title>
                <p>To test our hypothesis that HDACIs suppress expression of critical DDR genes in AML cells, we used 0–40 nM panobinostat to treat THP-1 cells for 48 h and determined protein and transcript levels for various DDR genes. Treatments resulted in hyperacetylation of histone H4 in a dose-dependent manner, while having no effect on total histone H4 levels. Treatment with the highest dose also caused hyperacetylation of alpha-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Panobinostat suppressed BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), accompanied by dose-dependent downregulation of transcripts for the corresponding genes (by real-time RT-PCR), suggesting a possible transcriptional mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This correlates with dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and the cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figures 1C&amp;D</xref>). In contrast, other critical DDR proteins, such as MRE11, RAD50, 53BP1, ATM, ATR, Ku70, and CHK2, were not altered (data not shown). Panobinostat suppressed BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 expression and induced minimal apoptosis at 10 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figures 1A&amp;C</xref>).

Transcript levels for <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> genes were determined by Real-time RT-PCR (<bold>Panels I–K</bold>).</p>

                <p>To further confirm these results, we treated nine diagnostic AML blast samples with varying doses of panobinostat. Decreased transcript levels for <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> genes were detected by real-time RT-PCR. This was accompanied by dose-dependent growth arrest, determined by MTT assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079106-t001">Table 1</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that panobinostat suppresses expression of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> genes in AML cell lines and decreases transcript levels in diagnostic AML blasts.</p>

                <p>Efforts were then undertaken to determine the effects of panobinostat on cytarabine- or DNR-induced DNA DSBs, cell cycle progression and apoptosis by treating THP-1 or OCI-AML3 cells for 48 h. Cytarabine- or DNR-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced by the addition of panobinostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g002">Figures 2A–D</xref>). Representative dot plots for the THP-1 cell line can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–F. Combined cytarabine and panobinostat treatment caused synergistic induction of apoptosis with cooperativity index values of 0.87 and 0.55 for THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively. DNR and panobinostat also caused synergistic induction of apoptosis with cooperative index values of 0.63 and 0.67 for THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells, respectively. Co-treated THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells had reduced protein levels for BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 compared to cells treated with cytarabine or daunorubicin alone. Downregulation of CHK1 decreased activation of the pathway, as reflected by the decreased phosphorylation of CDC25C (Ser 216, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g002">Figures 2C&amp;D</xref>). Importantly, panobinostat substantially enhanced cytarabine- or DNR-induced DNA DSBs, as reflected by the induction of γH2AX, an established biomarker for DNA DSBs <xref rid="pone.0079106-Redon1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g002">Figures 2C&amp;D</xref>).

                <p>Panobinostat treatment alone resulted in G0/G1 arrest in THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells. Cytarabine treatment resulted in S and G2/M arrest in both cell lines, which were decreased with the addition of panobinostat. DNR treatment resulted in G2/M arrest, which was reduced by the co-administration with panobinostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g002">Figures 2E&amp;F</xref>). Representative histograms for the THP-1 cell line can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s001">Figure S1G</xref>–L.

However, CTS cells treated with cytarabine and panobinostat resulted in increased S and G2/M, which parallels with modestly enhanced apoptosis compared to that from cytarabine alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s002">Figure S2F</xref>).

Administration of panobinostat suppressed expression of E2F1 protein and transcripts independent of cytarabine or DNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g005">Figure 5B&amp;C</xref>). This was accompanied by significantly decreased binding of E2F1 to the promoter regions of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> determined by ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). These results strongly suggest that panobinostat suppresses expression of <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> through modulation of E2F1 transcription factor.</p>
                <p>To provide direct evidence that E2F1 regulates the transcription of these genes in AML cells, we performed shRNA knockdown of E2F1 in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g005">Figures 5E&amp;F</xref>). Knockdown of E2F1 resulted in significantly decreased transcript levels for <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic>.

              <p>In previous studies, we demonstrated synergistic antileukemic activities of combined VPA and cytarabine or clofarabine in pediatric AMLs accompanied by cooperative induction of DNA DSBs and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xie2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. This observation was also confirmed with other HDACIs, such as panobinostat, when combined with cytarabine in AML cells <xref rid="pone.0079106-Xu2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperative induction of DNA DSBs and apoptosis remained unknown. The abilities of different HDACIs to enhance cytarabine-induced DNA DSBs suggest that this class of drugs may somehow impact the DDR to enhance DNA DSBs and apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents in AML cells.</p>
              <p>To test this possibility, we determined the effects of panobinostat treatments on the expression of critical DDR proteins in four AML cell lines and nine pediatric diagnostic AML blast samples. Though the use of only pediatric samples in this study is an admitted weakness, <italic>in vitro</italic> incubations of these AML cells with panobinostat demonstrated dose-dependent decreases in protein and/or transcript levels for <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0079106-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that panobinostat suppresses the DDR in AML cells by decreasing <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> transcript levels.</p>
              <p>Consistent with the above findings, panobinostat decreases the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51, potently enhanced DNA DSBs and apoptosis, and abrogated S and/or G2/M checkpoints induced by cytarabine or DNR in 3 out of the four AML cell lines (THP-1, U937, and OCI-AML3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s002">S2A</xref>, C, and E). In CTS cells these changes were observed in the DNR and panobinostat co-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s002">Figures S2B, D and F</xref>). Although the downregulation of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 protein expression was also observed in the CTS cells post combined treatment with panobinostat and cytarabine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s002">Figure S2D</xref>), more S and G2/M arrest were observed. It has been reported that a CHK1-independent S checkpoint pathway exists and parallels the CHK1-dependent S checkpoint pathway <xref rid="pone.0079106-Falck1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. This may explain the observed activation of the S checkpoint despite the decreased level of BRCA1 and CHK1 and the modest enhancement of panobinostat on cytarabine-induced apoptosis in the CTS cells. These results demonstrate that the enhanced antileukemic activities of cytarabine or DNR by panobinostat rely on abrogation of the S and/or G2/M cell cycle checkpoints induced by cytarabine or DNR.</p>
              <p>Our <italic>BRCA1, CHK1</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> shRNA knockdown results in THP-1 cells provide direct evidence that these proteins play critical roles in cytarabine- or DNR-induced DNA damage, which was confirmed by our COMET assay experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that both BRCA1 and CHK1 are critical determinants of both cytarabine- and DNR-induced apoptosis in AML cells as indicated by the enhanced apoptosis seen in the knockdown cells after single drug treatment, while the effects of RAD51 knockdown seem DNR-specific since it only enhanced DNR-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, both BRCA1 and CHK1, but not RAD51, are involved in the S and/or G2/M checkpoints induced by cytarabine or DNR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results are consistent with panobinostat and cytarabine or DNR co-treatments and strongly demonstrate that suppression of the DDR by panobinostat represents a novel and critical molecular mechanism underlying the cooperative induction of DNA DSBs and apoptosis by the combination of panobinostat and cytarabine or DNR. The role of CHK1 in the combined antileukemic activities of panobinostat and cytarabine or DNR was further confirmed by ectopically expressing it in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s004">Figure S4</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> NSG mouse studies showed decreased levels of CHK1 and RAD51 post panobinostat treatments. In addition, co-treatment of the tumor-bearing NSG mice with panobinostat and cytarabine resulted in significant delay of tumor growth and significantly increased survival compared to cytarabine or panobinostat treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0079106.s007">Table S3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Results from our additional studies suggest that panobinostat suppresses the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 through transcriptional mechanisms, in which E2F1 plays a critical role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g005">Figure 5</xref>), however, post-transcriptional mechanisms cannot be completely excluded. Studies are underway investigating the molecular mechanisms by which panobinostat regulates E2F1 expression in AML cells.</p>
              <p>Based on our own results and those previously reported <xref rid="pone.0079106-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, we have proposed a model for the molecular mechanisms underlying the cooperative induction of apoptosis by HDACIs and DNA damaging agents in AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0079106-g006">Figure 6</xref>). HDACIs suppress the expression of E2F1, leading to decreased E2F1 binding to the <italic>BRCA1, CHK1,</italic> and <italic>RAD51</italic> promoters and decreased transcription of these genes. This would result in weakened repair of DNA DSBs induced by DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cytarabine or DNR), thus enhancing apoptosis. At the same time, downregulation of BRCA1 and CHK1 would result in abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints (S and/or G2/M), thus forcing cells carrying DNA lesions to progress in the cell cycle and undergo apoptosis.</p>
