                  <title>BACKGROUND</title>
                  <p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma not associated with HPV (HPV-unrelated HNSCC) is associated with a high rate of recurrence and poor survival.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>We conducted a clinical trial in 14 patients with newly diagnosed HPV-unrelated HNSCC to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein that blocks programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and neutralizes TGF-Î².</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Bintrafusp alfa was well tolerated, and no treatment-associated surgical delays or complications occurred. Objective pathologic responses (PRs) were observed, and 12 of the 14 (86%) patients were alive and disease free at 1 year. Alterations in Treg infiltration and spatial distribution relative to proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells indicated a reversal of Treg immunosuppression in the primary tumor. Detection of neoepitope-specific tumor T cell responses, but not virus-specific responses, correlated with the development of a PR. Detection of neoepitope-specific responses and PRs in tumors was not correlated with genomic features or tumor antigenicity but was associated with reduced pretreatment myeloid cell tumor infiltration. These results indicate that dual PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade can safely enhance tumor antigenâspecific immunity and highlight the feasibility of multimechanism neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with HPV-unrelated HNSCC.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Our studies provide insight into the ability of neoadjuvant immunotherapy to induce polyclonal neoadjuvantâspecific T cell responses in tumors and suggest that features of the tumor microenvironment, such as myeloid cell infiltration, may be a major determinant of enhanced antitumor immunity following such treatment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Oncologic outcomes following standard-of-care treatment of newly diagnosed, advanced-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma not associated with HPV (HPV-unrelated HNSCC) are poor, with disease relapse occurring in approximately 50% of patients (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For patients who experience a relapse of disease, treatment with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) alone or in combination with chemotherapy results in improved survival compared with chemotherapy alone (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Preclinical mechanistic data suggest that neoadjuvant ICB may enhance tumor-specific immunity more effectively than adjuvant ICB through induction of polyclonal antigenâspecific T cell responses in the presence of tumor antigen (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Clinical studies of neoadjuvant ICB in resectable melanoma, nonâsmall cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma demonstrated improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) following neoadjuvant ICB and revealed that pathologic responses (PRs) may correlate with durable treatment responses and survival (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>â<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Initial clinical studies of neoadjuvant ICB in patients with newly diagnosed HPV-unrelated HNSCC indicated that PD-1, with or without cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockade, improves RFS (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), but tissue correlates and predictors of response have not been thoroughly studied.</p>
              <p>TGF-Î² induces cell-cycle arrest in normal epithelial cells but promotes a malignant phenotype in the setting of transformed carcinoma cells (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). TGF-Î² also disrupts innate and adaptive immunity, suppressing cytotoxic T cell function and promoting Treg development (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). For these reasons, therapeutic neutralization of TGF-Î² may inhibit tumor growth and enhance antitumor immunity. Bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain of the human TGF-Î² receptor II (TGF-Î²RII or TGF-Î² âtrapâ) fused via a flexible linker to the C-terminus of each heavy chain of an IgG1 antibody blocking programmed death ligand 1 (antiâPD-L1) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), has demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and is in various stages of clinical development for several cancers (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
              <p>Here, we report the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade with bintrafusp alfa in patients with newly diagnosed HPV-unrelated HNSCC. We used multispectral immunofluorescence (MIF), genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, and tumor antigenâspecific T cell response assays to explore correlations with PRs and to identify possible biomarkers of tumor regression following neoadjuvant treatment.</p>

                <title>Patient characteristics and safety.</title>
                <p>Fourteen patients were treated from June 2020 to February 2021 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The baseline characteristics of all 14 patients are listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Eleven (79%) patients had clinically or radiographically node-positive disease, and 10 (71%) had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 14.7 months (range, 10â19 months). Twelve (86%) patients received 2 doses of bintrafusp alfa. One patient did not receive a second dose after developing a nocturnal grade 2 tumor hemorrhage attributed to inadvertent mastication of the primary tumor. Another patient did not receive a second dose because of transient grade 1 bilirubin elevation of unclear etiology. Both patients proceeded to surgery without complications. The median number of days from first neoadjuvant immunotherapy treatment to surgery was 22. None of the patients experienced a treatment-related delay in the planned surgery. Free tissue transfer reconstruction was required for 71% of patients. There was no unexpected bleeding or delayed wound healing during or following surgery.</p>
                <p>Seventy-six percent of participants experienced an adverse event that was at least possibly related to the study treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are summarized in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. There were no TRAEs above grade 3. One participant developed grade 2 hyperthyroidism that improved with medical management and later required oral thyroid replacement once hypothyroidism developed. One participant developed grade 3 vasculitis that improved with corticosteroids.</p>

                <title>Pathologic, radiographic, and clinical responses.</title>
                <p>All 14 patients were scored for pathologic tumor response (pTR) in post-treatment surgical specimens. Primary tumors displayed pTRs ranging from 3% to 70% (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; examples of primary tumor histology and pTR scoring are shown in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>, AâC; supplemental material available online with this article; <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI161400DS1" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI161400DS1</ext-link>). Using standardized immune-related PR definitions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), no primary tumor had a complete (100% pTR) or major (pTR â¥90%) response, and 5 tumors showed a PR (pTR â¥50%), yielding an overall primary tumor PR rate of 36%. The primary tumor volume on CT imaging increased in 10 (71%) patients and decreased in 3 (21%) patients (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We found no obvious correlation between the magnitude of the pTR and changes in the radiographic volume of the primary tumors following treatment.</p>
                <p>Five patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of nodal disease before treatment (patients 2, 6, 8, 9, and 12) harbored no viable tumor upon post-treatment pathologic analysis of their lymph nodes (LNs), suggesting that a pathologic complete response (pCR) in the LNs may have occurred (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). These CRs are only speculative, because although the specificity of PET avidity for nodal metastasis is very high (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), the presence of carcinoma in these LNs was not proven before treatment with a biopsy. Two additional patients (patients 5 and 7) with pathologically proven LN disease had a 50% or higher pTR in the LNs. Ten of 11 (91%) patients with clinically suspicious or pathologically proven nodal disease demonstrated increased volume on CT imaging after treatment compared with before treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), including 5 patients with suspicious LNs at diagnosis that were pathologically without nodal disease (N0). We found no correlation between the LN pTR and the change in CT volume. Defining discordant responses as primary tumor and confirmed or possible LN responses that differed by more than 20% for an individual patient, we found that 8 (73%) patients had discordant responses (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Considering all evaluable surgical tissues, 6 of 14 (43%) patients definitively displayed at least a partial PR (pPR) in the primary tumor or LN. If patients whose pretreatment suspicious LNs were found to be pathologically N0 had true CRs in the neck, 10 of 14 (71%) patients had at least a pPR in the primary tumor or LN.</p>
                <p>Two patients had locoregional disease recurrence within 1 year of completing the study (disease in patient 1 recurred at 7 months; disease in patient 4 recurred at 9 months), resulting in a 1-year RFS rate of 86%. Both patients died of complications due to locoregional recurrence, and neither patient had evidence of distant metastatic disease at the time of death.</p>

                <title>Assessment of primary tumor TGF-Î² pathway signaling.</title>
                <p>Pre- and post-treatment primary tumor biopsies were available for correlative analysis for all 14 patients. We performed MIF analysis to evaluate changes in TGF-Î² pathway signaling (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>, A and B). In nonmalignant epithelial cells with intact TGF-Î² pathway signaling, TGF-Î² is antiproliferative, and neutralization is expected to result in decreased tumor cell phosphorylated SMAD2 (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3, and p21 and increased Ki67 (a marker of proliferation) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We observed this pattern of changes in only 2 (14%) patients (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, patients 9 and 10). Instead, tumors displayed inconsistent patterns of changes, with decreased expression of tumor cell p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3, and p21 in 4 (29%), 7 (50%), and 5 (37%) samples, respectively, and an increase in tumor cell Ki67 expression in 5 (37%) samples. Conversely, stromal nuclei, consisting primarily of immune cells, had increased Ki67 expression in 11 (79%) samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Patients who developed a primary tumor PR after treatment showed significantly reduced tumor cell Ki67 expression after treatment compared with patients who did not have a PR in the primary tumor (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3, C and D</xref>).</p>
                <p>We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) to determine the underlying mutational profile of primary tumors and whether pretreatment tumors harbored mutations in core TGF-Î² signaling genes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The mutational profiles of these tumors were generally consistent with profiles of carcinogen-associated head and neck cancers reported previously (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 5</xref>) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). One or more mutations in core TGF-Î² signaling genes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) were observed in 13 (93%) tumors, but only 1 mutation in 1 patient was in silicoâpredicted to be functionally deleterious (polyphen analysis) (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6A</xref>). We found no correlation between the number of mutated core TGF-Î² signaling genes and the PR (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6B</xref>). Changes in TGF-Î² target gene expression were measured with bulk RNA-Seq (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). No clear patterns of transcriptional changes were evident after treatment with bintrafusp alfa, possibly because of the difficulty of studying individual signaling pathways in bulk RNA-Seq data (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Overall, these results suggest that TGF-Î² signaling was uncoupled from direct control of primary tumor cell proliferation through mechanisms that were independent of canonical TGF-Î² pathway genomic alterations. These data also indicate that the most common cumulative primary tumor effect of dual PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade with bintrafusp alfa treatment was a reduction of tumor cell proliferation and increased proliferation of cells in the stromal compartment, possibly indicating immune activation.</p>

                <title>Measurement of immune cell density and spatial localization.</title>
                <p>To study immune responses in primary tumors, we first used MIF to measure changes in the infiltration and localization of T cells and myeloid cells (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). The immune cell phenotypes are listed in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 1</xref>. We observed an increase in total immune cell infiltration into the tumor parenchyma, indicating a more inflamed tumor phenotype after treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Stromal immune cell density was inconsistently increased or decreased, except for stromal Tregs, which were reduced in 12 (86%) tumors, and myeloid cell infiltration into the tumor parenchyma, which was frequently increased after treatment compared with before treatment. We observed no correlation between pretreatment tumor or stromal CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell or Treg density and a PR. Pretreatment tumor cell PD-L1 expression also did not predict a PR (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). We assessed the changes in T cell density following treatment and found that increased tumor parenchyma infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and an increased CD8/Treg ratio within the tumor parenchyma or stroma after treatment compared with before treatment correlated with a PR (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, representative photomicrographs shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Although we did not observe consistent changes in the density of proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after treatment (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8A</xref>), analysis of digitized MIF images allowed for the study of spatial relationships between proliferating or nonproliferating FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> or FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and FoxP3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Before treatment, replicating Ki67<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> or Ki67<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were, on average, a greater distance from Tregs than were nonproliferating Ki67<sup>â</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> or Ki67<sup>â</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). After treatment, the mean distance between proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs was reduced in patients who had a PR but was not reduced in patients who did not (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). We observed no change in the mean distance between nonproliferating T cells and Tregs (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8B</xref>). Measurement of the probability that a proliferating CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell is a given distance from a Treg revealed a shift to the left of the distribution curve in patients who experienced a PR (e.g., patient 3); no shift was observed in those who did not have a PR (e.g., patient 4) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). We did not find this to be the case when considering the distribution curves of nonproliferating T cells around Tregs (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 8C</xref>). These findings offer correlative evidence that Tregs were immunosuppressive in pretreatment tumors, and shifts in distribution curves after treatment suggest that Treg immunosuppression was inhibited in patients who experience a PR.</p>
                <p>We also performed myeloid MIF to study the density of neutrophilic cells (polymorphonuclear cells [PMNs]) and macrophages (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 4D</xref>). Although the pretreatment density of T cells was not correlated with the development of a PR after treatment, a reduction in the pretreatment density of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> or PD-L1<sup>â</sup> PMNs or macrophages in the stroma predicted a PR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, A and B</xref>). We assessed changes with treatment and found that an increased Ki67<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>/PD-L1<sup>+</sup> PMN or Ki67<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>/PD-L1<sup>+</sup> macrophage ratio after treatment compared with before treatment correlated with a PR (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Using bulk RNA-Seq data, we assessed the expression of a selected set of immune-related genes found to be predictive of a response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) for correlation with a PR following treatment with bintrafusp alfa. No clear pattern between expression of this gene set in pretreatment samples and the development of a PR was observed (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9A</xref>). Most tumors (11 of 14, 79%) displayed an increase in expression of these immune-related genes after treatment with bintrafusp alfa, but there was no clear correlation between the magnitude of the increase after treatment and the development of a PR (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9B</xref>). Immune deconvolution (FarDeep) was performed on bulk RNA-Seq data to estimate immune cell infiltration (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). FarDeep analysis estimated an increase in immune infiltration in tumors that displayed a greater PR (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9C</xref>). A strong positive correlation existed between the FarDeep estimation of changes in CD8<sup>+</sup> infiltration and the direct measurement of changes in CD8<sup>+</sup> cell density by MIF (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 9D</xref>). We did not observe a positive correlation for CD4<sup>+</sup> infiltration.</p>

                <title>Determination of tumor antigenâspecific T cell responses.</title>
                <p>We further studied changes in immune activation by determining whether treatment with bintrafusp alfa induced new or expanded existing tumor antigenâspecific T cell responses and if such changes correlated with a PR. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) cultured from pre- and post-treatment tumors from 12 patients were assessed for IFN-Î³ production upon coculturing with autologous antigen-presenting cells loaded with in silicoâpredicted candidate patient-specific, mutation-derived neoepitopes or common viral antigens. The high-affinity candidate neoepitopes selected from each patient for synthesis (see Methods for criteria) are listed in <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 2</xref>. Among all patients, we detected neoepitope-specific T cell responses among 24 of 108 (22%) predicted neoepitopes. All neoepitope-specific T cell responses were detectable (spot count &gt;0) in post-treatment TILs. Of 24 neoepitope-specific responses in post-treatment TILs, 12 (50%) were detected (spot count &gt;0) in patient-matched pretreatment TILs. Nineteen of 24 (80%) neoepitope-specific TIL responses were increased (difference &gt;5 IFN-Î³ spots) after treatment compared with before treatment. For individual patients, a greater number of post-treatment neoepitopes for which responses were measured and a greater cumulative neoepitope-specific magnitude of response (IFN-Î³ spot count) each correlated with a primary tumor PR (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6, A and B</xref>). T cell responses to common viral antigens (CEF) were detected in 6 of 12 (50%) patients. We found no correlation between a virus-specific T cell response and a primary tumor PR (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). From these data, we conclude that neoadjuvant PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade increased detectable neoepitope-specific immunity in 8 of 12 (67%) patients and that detection of neoepitope-specific responses, but not responses to viral antigens, correlated with the development of a PR.</p>
                <p>Neoepitope-specific responses were not detected in 4 of 12 (33%) patients. No correlation existed between the in silicoâpredicted neoepitope IC<sub>50</sub> or the neoepitope expression level and the detection of a neoepitope-specific T cell response (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The mutational burden and number of predicted neoepitopes with an IC<sub>50</sub> of less than 500 nM did not significantly differ in patients with or without detected neoepitope-specific responses (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) or a PR (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These data indicate that antigenicity was not a major determinant of the ability to detect neoepitope-specific responses in this data set. Considering the pretreatment tumor microenvironment, reduced stromal myeloid cell density predicted the detection of 1 or more neoepitope-specific responses after neoadjuvant treatment (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). The density of Treg in the tumor or stroma did not predict a response (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, pretreatment tumor myeloid cell infiltration may represent a biomarker that predicts the ability to detect neoepitope-specific T cell responses and the associated development of a PR after neoadjuvant treatment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here, we report what to our knowledge is the first study to describe the clinical results and tissue correlative analyses of neoadjuvant PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade in patients with newly diagnosed HPV-unrelated HNSCC. We found that 1 or 2 neoadjuvant doses of bintrafusp alfa were well tolerated in this patient population. Treatment-related adverse events that delayed standard-of-care surgery were not observed, consistent with prior studies of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade with or without CTLA-4 blockade (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although our study had a small sample size, the 1-year RFS of 86% with neoadjuvant bintrafusp alfa is similar to that observed in similar patient populations treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab with or without ipilimumab (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) or a neoadjuvant plus the adjuvant pembrolizumab (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Clinical development of bintrafusp alfa in the relapse setting has focused primarily on patients with HPV-associated cancer (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Here, we provide evidence of activity in cancer not associated with HPV in the up-front, neoadjuvant treatment setting, consistent with preclinical studies demonstrating efficacy in multiple cancer types (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Improved RFS is the goal of neoadjuvant treatment. Longer-term follow-up and larger studies are needed to determine whether the addition of TGF-Î² neutralization to neoadjuvant PD-(L)1 blockade improves RFS to a greater degree than PD-(L)1 blockade alone.</p>
              <p>Neoadjuvant trial designs allow for extensive analyses of pre- and post-treatment tumor samples. Our studies validate the ability of neoadjuvant bintrafusp alfa to enhance polyclonal neoepitope-specific T cell responses in tumors and provide correlative evidence for a reduction in tumor Treg density and immunosuppressive function. We were unable to conclude whether the enhanced T cell responses resulted directly from activation of cytotoxic T cells or indirectly through inhibition of Tregs. Both are possibilities, given the known biologic roles of PD-(L)1 immune checkpoint signaling and TGF-Î² (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>The ability to detect neoepitope-specific T cell responses and the development of a PR following neoadjuvant treatment did not correlate with mutational burden or the expression or IC<sub>50</sub> of predicted neoepitopes. This may be due to the relatively small sample size in our study. Yet, our finding that pretreatment myeloid cell density predicted both the development of a PR and the ability to detect neoepitope-specific T cell responses in tumors suggests that characteristics of the tumor microenvironment may also be a significant determinant of neoepitope-specific T cell function and PR in addition to genomic features such as mutational burden or antigenicity. This also indicates that the quantitative measurement of tumor myeloid infiltration may serve as a biomarker of response for neoadjuvant ICB. Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells have been experimentally proven to be immunosuppressive in HNSCC (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). If validated in larger clinical data sets, this finding suggests that concurrent neoadjuvant inhibition of myeloid cell tumor trafficking or function may be a rational strategy to improve PRs and clinical outcomes with neoadjuvant immunotherapy.</p>
              <p>T cells targeting neoepitopes in the tumor microenvironment are highly exhausted (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We believe our finding that only half of the validated neoepitope-specific T cell responses were detectable in pretreatment TILs is significant because it indicates that neoepitope-specific T cell profiling may be incomplete if the T cells being studied are from the microenvironment of untreated tumors (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Although challenging because of very low clonotype frequencies, detection of tumor antigen specificity in peripheral blood may yield a more comprehensive list of patient-specific neoepitopes if TILs cultured after ICB are unavailable for study (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>TGF-Î² is a pleiotropic cytokine with different effects on epithelial, stromal, and immune cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Our results indicate that TGF-Î² neutralization reduced tumor cell proliferation in most patients, a finding that is the opposite of that observed following TGF-Î² neutralization in normal squamous mucosa and papillomas (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Possibly related to tumor cell responses to effector molecules from T cells (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), evidence of reduced tumor cell proliferation was similarly observed following neoadjuvant ICB in patients with glioblastoma (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Mutations predicted to alter the function of key TGF-Î² pathway components were infrequent, suggesting that disrupted antiproliferative TGF-Î² signaling may be driven by an epigenetic mechanism in these tumors. Radiographic changes alone demonstrated that some tumors and LNs had enlarged during this short treatment window, but pathologic analysis revealed a regression of viable tumor. The discordance between radiographic and pathologic assessments may be due to tumor inflammation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Although the contribution of TGF-Î² neutralization to the observed tumor antigenâspecific immune activation in our study is unclear, our data indicate that the net effect of TGF-Î² neutralization with PD-L1 blockade in newly diagnosed HPV-unrelated HNSCC is induction of antitumor immunity. Because of the variable biology among malignancies, the effect of bintrafusp alfa treatment on diverse tumor types in the newly diagnosed or relapsed setting may need to be studied individually.</p>
              <p>The presence of detectable tumor antigenâspecific T cells in the primary tumor correlated with a PR in the primary tumor but not in the LNs. Considering possible pCRs in LNs and true responses, most patients with disease in the LNs developed a stronger PR in the LNs compared with the PR observed in the primary tumor. If tumor antigenâspecific T cell responses in the tumor reflect systemic antitumor immunity, a more immune-permissive microenvironment within LNs may be an explanation for these observed discordant PRs (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Testing of this hypothesis would require similar antigen-specific response studies to be performed on TILs from primary tumors and LNs cultured separately for each patient. This should be explored in future neoadjuvant immunotherapy studies with sampling of LNs before and after treatment to allow both confirmation of the presence of carcinoma within suspicious nodes as well as the study of antigen-specific T cell responses.</p>
              <p>Tumor antigenâspecific T cells within the tumor microenvironment often express tissue retention markers such as CD103 and display evidence of activation and exhaustion with expression of PD-1, Tim3, Lag3, and others (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The isolation and study of TILs before and after neoadjuvant immunotherapy treatment with technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq and T cell receptorâsequencing (TCR-Seq) could allow tracking of changes in individual T cell clonotypes. Such data could provide further insight into the baseline characteristics of tumor antigenâspecific T cell clones within tumors that expand and activate with neoadjuvant immunotherapy, with some of these features possibly representing additional biomarkers of response.</p>
              <p>Limitations of our study exist. The small sample size and 1-year follow-up make it difficult to draw conclusions about whether the rates of a PR or clinical benefit with PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade are superior to those observed with PD-(L)1 blockade alone. Validation of responses to PD-L1 and TGF-Î² blockade in additional cancer types would support further clinical development in the neoadjuvant realm. Also, our single-arm design did not allow us to determine whether a similar enhancement of neoepitope-specific responses in TIL occurs with PD-(L)1 blockade alone or whether TGF-Î² neutralization is required. Whether neoadjuvant PD-(L)1 blockade without TGF-Î² neutralization enhances neoepitope-specific tumor T cells should be studied. Our small sample size and low recurrence rate make it difficult to study predictors of recurrence. Both patients who experienced a recurrence of disease within 1 year had increased tumor volume radiographically during the treatment period. On-treatment tumor growth should be considered as a possible indicator of a higher risk of recurrence after surgery in larger, future neoadjuvant studies. Additionally, given the limitations of the number of markers that could be studied together in a single slide, we were unable to perform in-depth relationship analyses between subsets of myeloid cells and proliferating T cells. Such data could provide important correlative data supporting the immunosuppressive role of myeloid cells in these tumors, and experimental limitations for such work could be overcome with emerging spatial proteomic technologies that would allow the study of dozens of markers per slide.</p>
              <p>Our current study provides a framework for experimental approaches that can be used to study important correlates that aid in understanding the mechanism(s) of neoadjuvant treatments, such as immune cell infiltration and spatial localization in tumor sections as well as tumor antigenâspecific T cell responses in cultured TILs. Given the safety, early efficacy, and correlatives indicating enhancement of neoepitope-specific T cell responses we observed following treatment with bintrafusp alfa, future HNSCC clinical studies assessing whether similar findings are observed following PD-(L)1 blockade without TGF-Î² neutralization are warranted. Such studies could inform the design of future neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials that would maximally balance safety and enhance antitumor immunity for this highly lethal disease.</p>

                <p>Eligible patients had previously untreated, surgically resectable, pathologically confirmed T2-4b oral cavity or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, with or without nodal disease and no evidence of distant metastasis. All patients were evaluated by a head and neck oncologic surgeon at their home institution before referral to the NIH. Patients received 1 or 2 doses of bintrafusp alfa (1,200 mg) intravenously at weeks 1 and 3, followed by surgery. Surgical resection of the primary and nodal disease was performed based on initial clinical staging and was not altered on the basis of the immunotherapy response. The use of adjuvant therapy occurred off-study and was based on pathologic analysis of surgical specimens according to the standard of care as determined by the referring teams. Primary tumors were sampled for correlative analysis 1 day before initiation of bintrafusp alfa treatment and after completion of the treatment on protocol. LNs were not sampled.</p>

                <title>pTR.</title>
                <p>Digital pathology software (QuPath) assessment of H&amp;E slides from the surgical specimen was used to quantify the pTR in the primary tumor and LNs, defined as the percentage of viable tumor area within the tumor bed (surface area of residual viable tumor/surface area of total tumor bed Ã 100) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). All H&amp;E slides from each block of each surgical specimen were assessed, and a weighted (by surface area) mean was determined for each patient, rounded to the nearest 1 percent. Primary tumors and LNs were separately scored. Clinically or radiographically suspicious LNs were not biopsied before treatment. For each patient with LNs positive for carcinoma pathologically, all H&amp;E slides from all positive LNs were used to determine the PR. A pCR was defined as no residual viable tumor; a major pathologic response was defined as 10% or less residual viable tumor (or a pTR â¥90%); a pPR was defined as 11%â50% residual viable tumor (or pTR 50%â89%); and no response was defined as greater than 50% residual viable tumor (or pTR &lt;50%). For correlative studies, a PR was defined as a pTR of 50% or higher. Patients with suspicious LNs according to pretreatment imaging and no pathologic evidence of carcinoma within LNs were considered to have a possible LN CR. Two pathologists independently scored all slides for each patientâs surgical specimens.</p>

For patients with LNs positive for carcinoma pathologically, the volume of all positive LNs before and after treatment was considered. For patients that had suspicious LNs before treatment but had pathologically negative results, the volume of the clinically suspicious LN only was considered. Volume was defined as the product of the longest perpendicular bidirectional measurements for primary tumors and LNs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>

The resulting reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using bwa-mem2 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00041" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00041</ext-link>) with default parameters. Fixmate, sort, and markdup of the SAMtools toolkit were used to convert SAM files to the BAM format and include pairing information, sort by genomic coordinates, and mark duplicates, respectively, with default parameters.

In each comparison, tumor or mucosa and the corresponding control (PBMC) BAM files were provided as input. Before running lofreq somatic using âcall-indels, input BAM files were subjected to lofreq indelqual âdindel. Strelka2 was run using âindelCandidates obtained from Manta (version 1.6.0) (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, GATK Mutect2 calls were filtered using GATK FilterMutectCalls. Final SNV calls were made by integrating the results and retaining only SNVs that were detected by at least 3 of the 4 variant callers. Similarly, only INDELs that were detected by at least 2 of the 3 variant callers â LoFreq, Mutect2, and Strelka2 â were retained. Where needed, common SNPs in dbsnp_146.hg38.vcf.gz of the GATK resource bundle were used. Variant effect prediction was performed using VEP (version 101) (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

                <p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were sectioned at 5 microns, baked at 60Â°C for 30 minutes, soaked in Bond Dewax Solution (Leica), and rehydrated. Deparaffinization and staining of all slides was performed on the Leica BOND RX Autostainer (Leica). Before being used in combination, the specificity and optimal dilution of each antibody was individually determined with chromogenic immunohistochemistry (DAB) using slides from normal tonsil and head and neck carcinoma, consistent with best practice guidelines (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed by heating to 95Â°C in BOND epitope retrieval solutions ER1 or ER2 (Leica). Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) Opal technology was used for immunofluorescence staining. After individual primary antibody optimization, primary and secondary antibody and opal pairings were optimized for minimum background and desired signal amplification in monoplex immunofluorescence using head and neck carcinoma sections. <xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 3</xref> lists the primary and secondary antibodies used and the Opal details.

                <p>Whole-slide analysis of each stained slide was performed with HALO Image Analysis software (version 3.3, Indica Labs). Tumor, stroma, or whole-slide annotations were performed using the Random Forest Tissue Classifier Algorithm. Standard nuclear segmentation was used for the TGF-Î² panel. The HALO AI Nuclear Segmentation Classifier was trained to identify nuclei of various sizes and used for the T cell and myeloid cell panels. The immune cell fraction within the stromal compartment was estimated by calculating the fraction of cytokeratin-negative cells with rounded morphology and a maximum diameter of 15 Î¼m. Fluorescence intensities of each marker for each cell were determined using the HALO Highplex FL Analysis Algorithm. Separate Highplex FL Analysis Algorithms were used for tumor and immune cells, given the differences in nucleus size. Common fluorescence thresholds used to assign positivity or scaled intensity (1+, 2+, or 3+) for a given marker were used for each patientâs paired pre- and post-treatment tumor. Cell density was defined as the absolute number of lineage or activation markerâpositive cells per unit area (mm<sup>2</sup>). The H-score was used to describe protein expression in cells and was defined as follows: (% 1+ cells Ã 1) + (% of 2+ cells Ã 2) + (% of 3+ cells Ã 3) for a range of 0â300. Spatial analysis between CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and Tregs was performed using the HALO Proximity Analysis Algorithm on spatial plots generated from T cell and Treg object cell <italic toggle="yes">x</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">y</italic> coordinates.</p>

                <p>Correlations between paired sets of data were analyzed by linear regression and a goodness-of-fit test. Differences between nonparametric sets of data were analyzed with a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney <italic toggle="yes">U</italic> test. Differences between parametric sets of paired data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Comparisons of observed changes in immune cell infiltration with a hypothetical mean were analyzed with a 1-sample <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. In all box-and-whisker plots, the horizontal line inside each box indicates the median, the top and bottom of the box indicate the IQR, and error bars indicate the fifth and 95th percentile values. Some correlations were compared with a linear regression goodness-of-fit test. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 8.0.0 (GraphPad Software).</p>

(<bold>C</bold>) Waterfall plot shows LN PRs (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14), ranked from left to right by decreasing percentage of primary tumor regression within the tumor bed. A PR was defined as a pTR of 50% or greater. The pound signs indicate patients who had suspicious LNs on pretreatment workup but were found to be pathologically N0 and considered to have a possible LN CR. (<bold>D</bold>) Waterfall plot shows LN radiographic responses (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 14), calculated as the percentage of change in the product of the largest bidirectional diameter of a target suspicious LN, ranked from left to right in the same order as in <bold>A</bold>. In patients with LNs positive for carcinoma, the volume of all positive nodes was considered. For patients with suspicious nodes negative for carcinoma pathologically, only the radiographically suspicious LN volume was considered. The asterisks indicate that no clinically suspicious or pathologically positive LNs were found. The bottom black (yes) and white (no) boxes indicate patients with a disease-free status 1 year after completing the study.</p>
