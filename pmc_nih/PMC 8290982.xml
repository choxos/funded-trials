              <p>Pain is a common symptom of metastatic cancer that affects physical functioning and quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr4-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr5-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Patients with advanced cancer are particularly susceptible to debilitating pain, and identifying agents to control and relieve pain for these patients is a critical research need.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Although pain has often been included as a secondary endpoint in novel drug trials to support investigation of primary survival endpoints, some secondary endpoint analyses have been designed to lead to formal indications for pain palliation.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr10-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr12-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Evidence that palliative benefits of novel agents are not always consistent with survival advantages has also promoted the rigorous investigation of pain in clinical trials, including as a primary endpoint in randomized phase 3 drug trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="bibr14-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr15-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the investigation of pain in clinical trials and has outlined guidance for submitting patient-reported outcome (PRO) data as evidence of drug effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Because pain ratings come directly from patients, a recall period must be defined when designing trial protocols to evaluate pain as study endpoint. To avoid risks of recall bias, FDA guidance indicates that shorter recall periods are generally preferred. PRO theory provides general guidance for identification of appropriate recall periods, which depends largely on the context of use.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The empirical literature investigating the impact of various recall periods on the assessment of pain in cancer clinical trials is small.</p>
              <p>Prior research has detected differences in ratings of recalled pain and daily or momentary ratings of the same pain. Multiple studies have found that ratings of recalled average pain tend to be higher than the average of daily or momentary ratings.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="bibr19-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr20-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr21-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr22-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr23-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr24-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr26-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Fewer studies have investigated recall of pain at its worst. Results from those that have are mixed with evidence indicating that recall of pain at its worst could be higher<sup><xref rid="bibr25-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> or lower<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> than maximum daily or momentary ratings (i.e. the expected mathematical equivalent). While the direction of the differences in ratings is useful to identify cognitive biases that influence recall, the magnitude of the differences in ratings and the correlation of ratings are also important to consider when appraising a recall period for measuring pain as a clinical outcome. Studies to date have largely found small differences and moderate to high correlation of ratings that are recalled over a period of 1 week or less when compared with daily or momentary ratings.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="bibr24-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr25-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr26-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Yet, scant evidence confirms whether the use of a short-term recall period versus daily or momentary assessment leads to differences when measuring treatment outcomes.</p>
              <p>This study is the first to evaluate short-term recall to measure pain as an endpoint in a randomized phase 3 drug trial. The trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib versus mitoxantrone–prednisone to reduce pain from symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Participants provided weekly and daily ratings of their pain on the average and at its worst during multiple 7-day reporting periods throughout the trial. The trial thus provided a rare opportunity to compare weekly and daily ratings of two pain constructs and investigate whether differences in ratings translated to meaningful differences in pain assessment.</p>
              <p>This article presents results from four comparative analyses: (1) comparison of weekly ratings with summary descriptors (i.e. the mean and the maximum) of daily pain ratings; (2) comparison of the weekly ratings and the daily rating descriptors to detect change in pain for the sample; (3) comparison of the weekly ratings and the daily rating descriptors to detect change in pain within and across treatment subgroups; and (4) comparison of the weekly rating and mean daily rating of pain at its worst to detect treatment response. In Analysis 1, we tested two hypotheses based on the mathematical expected value of the weekly rating for each pain construct. For pain on the average, we hypothesized that the weekly rating would be more similar to the mean daily rating. For pain at its worst, we hypothesized that the weekly rating would be more similar to the maximum daily rating.</p>

                <p>The trial (COMET-2; NCT01522443) enrolled participants from health centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and Canada. Adult (≥18 years) patients were eligible to participate if they had a pathological diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, serum testosterone levels &lt;50 ng/dL, history of progression after prior treatment with docetaxel and either abiraterone or enzalutamide, and pain requiring opioid narcotic intervention.

                <p>Participants rated their pain during a 7-day baseline period prior to randomization and during 7-day reporting periods in weeks 3, 6, and 12 of study treatment. For each day of the reporting periods, participants rated their pain over the past 24 h according to two constructs—pain on the average and pain at its worst. Participants rated their pain using an 11-point numerical rating scale that ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 representing “No Pain” and 10 representing “Pain as Bad as You Can Imagine.” The survey items came from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form, an instrument that is widely used in contemporary pain studies and whose development and validation have been well-documented.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="bibr31-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr32-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> On the last day of each reporting period, participants rated their pain over the past 7 days.

                <p>Analyses were limited to weeks of reporting that included the weekly rating and at least four daily pain ratings. Weeks of reporting that were missing a weekly rating or that had fewer than four daily ratings were excluded from analysis, regardless of the number of other (i.e. daily or weekly) ratings that were provided that week. We defined statistical significance as <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05 with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and estimated robust standard errors that were clustered at the individual level to account for correlation from multiple ratings per patient.</p>

                  <title>Comparison of the weekly ratings with descriptors of the daily ratings</title>
                  <p>For each construct, we compared the weekly rating with the mean of the daily ratings and the maximum of the daily ratings (i.e. the most severe rating) in the corresponding 7-day reporting period. The mean daily rating is often used to score weeklong symptom severity in PRO analyses, whereas the maximum daily rating is often used to analyze adverse events. Absent of cognitive bias, the weekly rating of pain on the average is expected to approximate the mean daily rating of pain on the average, and the expected value of the weekly rating of pain at its worst is the maximum daily rating of pain at its worst.</p>
                  <p>To determine whether systematic differences in the weekly rating and each daily rating descriptor were detectable in our data, we estimated linear regression models that analyzed variation in the ratings by rating type, that is, weekly or daily. The coefficient for the rating type variable indicated the mean difference in the weekly rating relative to the daily rating descriptor, and the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-statistic associated with the coefficient tested the hypothesis of no difference in the weekly rating and the daily rating descriptor. Because statistical significance depends on sample size and differences that are not clinically meaningful can be statistically significant, we estimated Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> statistics to evaluate the effect sizes of the differences. Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> standardizes the mean difference in ratings using pooled standard deviations, and effect sizes are interpreted according to the absolute value of the <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>-statistic as follows: 0 to &lt;0.2 indicates a trivial effect, 0.2 to &lt;0.5 indicates a small effect, 0.5 to &lt;0.8 indicates a moderate effect, and ≥0.8 indicates a large effect.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
                  <p>We assessed strength of association between the weekly rating and each descriptor of daily ratings, that is, the mean value and the maximum value, by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The ICC takes into account multiple ratings of the same phenomenon by a single rater. We estimated ICCs for the weekly rating and each daily rating descriptor per reporting period. We determined that an ICC indicated high agreement if it and its corresponding 95% CI were greater than 0.70, in accordance with standard practice. We also compared the 95% CIs of the ICCs for each rating pair to assess whether the correlation of the weekly rating and the mean daily rating was significantly greater or less than that of the weekly rating and the maximum daily rating, as could be determined by no overlap in the CIs of the ICCs for each rating pair.</p>

                <p>Participants provided 431 weeks of pain data from baseline through week 12 of study treatment. Thirty-one (7%) weeks were missing the weekly rating and were excluded from analysis. One week that included the weekly rating had fewer than four daily ratings for pain on the average and was excluded from analysis of that construct. The 400 weeks included in the analysis for at least one pain construct comprised 199 (50%) weeks of pain reports from participants randomized to mitoxantrone–prednisone and 201 (50%) weeks of pain reports from participants randomized to cabozantinib. All trial participants provided at least 1 week of evaluable data. Attrition due to limited treatment efficacy, adverse events, and other causes contributed to fewer weeks of data over time yet completion of ratings by enrolled participants was high over all reporting periods; 107 participants (93%) provided weekly and at least four daily ratings at week 3, 100 (93%) at week 6, and 80 (89%) at week 12.</p>
                <p>Data included in the analysis comprised 312 (78%) weeks in which seven daily ratings were provided and 88 (22%) weeks in which four, five, or six daily ratings were provided. No significant differences were observed when comparing differences in the weekly rating and the mean or the maximum daily rating for weeks with no missing daily ratings and weeks missing one, two, or three daily ratings. The within-person variation per week of daily ratings, calculated as the mean standard deviation of the daily ratings provided per person-week of analysis, was 0.60 response-scale points for pain on the average and was 0.85 response-scale points for pain at its worst. <xref rid="table3-17407745211009547" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the sample mean, standard deviation, median, and interquartile range of the weekly rating and of the daily rating descriptors for each construct across and for each reporting period through week 12 of study treatment.</p>

                  <p>Analyzing pain ratings in aggregate from baseline through week 12 of study treatment, we found that the mean difference (standard error (SE)) between the weekly and mean daily ratings was 0.21 (0.05) response-scale points for pain on the average and 0.77 (0.08) response-scale points for pain at its worst (<xref rid="fig1-17407745211009547" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The mean difference between the weekly and maximum daily ratings was −0.64 (0.06) response-scale points for pain on the average and −0.38 (0.07) response-scale points for pain at its worst. The effect size of the mean difference between the weekly and mean daily rating was 0.12 for pain on the average and 0.36 for pain at its worst.

                  <p>We observed similar nonzero differences between the weekly rating and the daily rating descriptors (all <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when analyzing pain report data by each 7-day reporting period (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). ICCs indicated moderate to high correlation of the weekly rating and the daily rating descriptors (<xref rid="table4-17407745211009547" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For pain on the average, the ICCs were consistently higher when comparing the weekly rating with the mean daily rating rather than the maximum daily rating. For pain at its worst, the ICCs were consistently higher when comparing the weekly rating with the maximum daily rating rather than the mean daily rating. Yet, the 95% CIs of the ICCs for the weekly rating and each descriptor of daily ratings overlapped considerably, and we could not conclude that the weekly rating was more strongly correlated with the mean or the maximum daily rating for either pain construct.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>For both pain constructs, the weekly rating was consistently higher than the mean daily rating and lower than the maximum daily rating. While the differences were significant, the effect sizes of the differences ranged from trivial to small, and the correlation of the weekly rating and the daily rating descriptors was mostly high. The effect sizes of the differences in ratings and the magnitude of the ICCs for the rating pairs suggested that the weekly rating was more similar to the mean daily rating for pain on the average and to the maximum daily rating for pain at its worst, yet we could not conclude that the weekly rating was more strongly correlated with the mean or the maximum daily rating for either construct given overlap of the 95% CIs of the ICCs for the rating pairs.</p>
              <p>The pattern of differences in ratings that we observed for pain on the average is consistent with other evaluations of pain recall.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> For pain at its worst, prior findings have been mixed regarding the direction of the differences in ratings of recalled pain compared to maximum daily or momentary ratings. Our findings are, however, consistent with several studies, including a growing number of studies investigating symptom recall more broadly.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr38-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="bibr39-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr40-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Findings that ratings of recalled average pain tend to be higher than the mean of daily or momentary ratings of average pain have often been attributed to a cognitive bias that recall is unduly influenced by episodes of peak pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> For recall of pain at its worst (i.e. recall of peak pain), the field has largely been silent regarding cognitive biases. Based on our findings and those of a number of prior studies, we think that recall of pain at its worst is subject to a slight averaging bias.</p>
              <p>Our results could be limited if participants’ provision of daily ratings influenced their weekly ratings. Three symptom recall studies have investigated the possibility of weekly rating reactivity by randomizing participants to groups that did and did not provide daily or momentary ratings with weekly ratings.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> In these studies, the weekly ratings did not differ significantly between groups, and we think little risk of weekly rating reactivity exists in this study.</p>
              <p>The opportunities to compare the weekly rating and the daily rating descriptors to assess pain in the clinical trial were unique study strengths. All rating types detected a mean pain reduction from baseline to week 12 that did not differ significantly across treatment arms. Using the trial protocol opioid criteria alongside pain ratings, we found substantial agreement of definitions of treatment response that were based on the weekly and mean daily ratings of pain at its worst. Excluding opioid criteria, more participants were identified who experienced pain reduction, and the agreement of the weekly and mean daily ratings to detect pain reduction was moderate. In both cases, fewer participants met the ≥30% pain reduction threshold using the weekly rating, suggesting that it may detect pain reduction more conservatively. Given the controlled nature of randomized experiments, it is unlikely that variability in ratings that was introduced by excluding opioid criteria would be unaccounted for in future trials, yet greater variability in ratings could be more common in clinical practice.</p>
              <p>One study limitation was underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities. Gender and age-based demographic variation has previously been detected in the magnitude of the differences between symptom ratings recalled over a period of 1 week or longer and daily ratings.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr44-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-17407745211009547" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> The sign of the differences at least remained consistent with the broader population. Greater representation of minority groups would enable further investigation of demographic variation in ratings and strengthen future studies.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study confirmed that weekly ratings and daily rating descriptors of pain intensity differ. Yet, the differences were minor and consistent across reporting periods such that the ratings led to consistent results regarding change in pain and treatment response. Although daily symptom assessment is increasingly feasible due to electronic symptom reporting technologies and is warranted when measuring variation of ratings within a week, we did not discover added benefits of daily relative to weekly ratings to evaluate participant pain in this clinical trial.</p>
