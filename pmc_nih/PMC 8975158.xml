                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) cancer patients experience high caregiver burden and carry a significant amount of responsibility. Mindfulness has the potential to lessen caregiver burden by aiding in stress management. To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of mindfulness in reducing caregiver burden in this population. Based on our pilot study demonstrating initial feasibility and acceptability of FOCUS (Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress), this 3-arm randomized controlled trial aims to examine the efficacy of a 6-week mindfulness-based stress management program for allogeneic HCT caregivers. Hypotheses include that the FOCUS condition will have lower post-treatment caregiver burden and that patients of these caregivers will have better patient health outcomes compared to other treatment conditions.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Eligible caregivers will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: FOCUS, Healthy Living (HL; active control), and Enhanced Care (EC; usual care). Caregivers in FOCUS and HL will participate in 6-week weekly individual treatment sessions and will be sent brief daily momentary interventions/messages. Caregivers in all conditions will complete daily diaries over the course of treatment. Patients of enrolled caregivers will be enrolled for assessments only. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, end of treatment, 2- and 6-months post-treatment. Biomarker data will be collected via hair cortisol concentrations from caregivers at baseline and 6 months post-treatment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HCT) are considered a possibly curative treatment for hematologic malignancies and disorders (e.g., leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Given the extremely intensive nature of the HCT, a full-time caregiver is required [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] who carries a significant responsibility [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, for at least the first 100 days post-transplant, caregivers are responsible for medication administration, arranging patient appointments, food preparation, extensive hygienic precautions, and identifying any early symptoms of infection while managing their own responsibilities (e.g., work, childcare). In particular, allogeneic HCT caregivers experience higher levels of anxiety and stress pre-transplant, as compared to the general population [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which continues through post-transplant [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Such caregiver burden and distress can have an adverse impact on patient health outcomes, including increased anxiety and depression [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], increased healthcare utilization (e.g., emergency department use, [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) and decreased patient survival [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interventions that alleviate caregiver burden are needed not only to improve caregiver stress but also to have a positive impact on patient health.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, caregiver resources are typically limited to support groups and general stress management services available at the hospital, posing logistical challenges for caregiver attendance, particularly post-discharge. To the best of our knowledge, only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) tested the efficacy of a behavioral intervention using a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) approach among caregivers of only allogeneic HCT patients [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This intervention was only delivered post-transplant, after the caregiver was likely experiencing ongoing distress [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, challenges arose regarding caregiver engagement in all aspects of the intervention and the need for flexibility in scheduling treatment sessions [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A second study examined the feasibility of a CBT-based intervention among caregivers of both allogeneic and autologous HCT patients pre- and post-transplant with some flexibility in treatment delivery [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Results indicated the intervention was feasible, but the small sample size limited a full examination of treatment outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In sum, there is a need for novel intervention approaches tailored for the allogeneic HCT caregiver population with high flexibility in treatment modality assessing both caregiver and patient outcomes, and that provide support throughout all stages of the caregiving process (pre-transplant through discharge).</p>
              <p>Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have the potential to impact the allogeneic HCT caregivers’ psychological outcomes. Mindfulness is theorized to target increased awareness of thoughts, emotions, and sensations, with an emphasis on cultivating a nonjudgmental stance to present moment experience. Ultimately, MBIs strive to aid in the development of directed, flexible cognitive processing to observe one’s current experience with a sense of acceptance as opposed to trying to change or react to it [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Based on the extant theories of mindfulness [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the mechanisms that might alter caregiver burden and distress include (1) enhanced awareness of physical sensations and ongoing cognitive-affective processes, (2) increased cognitive flexibility that may allow a caregiver to try a new coping strategy, (3) improved emotion regulation, and (4) shifting in perspectives (i.e., decentering) from distressing thoughts to increased acceptance of the present moment. To expand upon this final point, when caregivers can make meaning of the experience and focus on areas of relational or personal growth, caregiving can be a positive experience [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, via these proposed mechanisms and through altering the way caregivers respond to stress, MBIs have the potential to lessen caregiver burden.</p>
              <p>Currently, a few small-scale, single-arm studies have investigated MBIs for cancer patients and caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, our team’s pilot study of FOCUS (Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress) remains the only study that developed and tested the acceptability and feasibility of an MBI for an allogeneic HCT caregiver population with promising results [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Importantly, FOCUS was systematically developed with feedback from allogeneic HCT caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>To fully test the efficacy of FOCUS, we will recruit caregivers of allogeneic HCT patients in the weeks prior to patient transplant and randomize caregivers to one of three-treatment conditions: FOCUS vs Healthy Living (HL) vs Enhanced Care (EC). Caregivers in the FOCUS and HL conditions will attend weekly 45–60 minute individual sessions for 6 consecutive weeks and receive daily brief interventions using a study-specific smartphone application (study app). Caregivers in the EC condition will receive existing usual care for caregivers. The primary hypothesis is that caregivers in FOCUS will report greater reduction in caregiver burden 2 months post-treatment compared to those in HL or EC. The secondary hypothesis is that the patient distress 2 months post-treatment will be lower among patients with caregivers in FOCUS compared to those in HL or EC. As an exploratory hypothesis, we will examine if patient healthcare utilization is lower 2 months and from 3 to 6 months post-treatment among patients with caregivers in FOCUS compared to HL or EC. Potential mechanisms and moderators of treatment on caregiver outcomes will also be explored.</p>

                <p>Verbal informed consent will be obtained separately for the caregiver and patient. All procedures were approved by Advarra IRB, including verbal informed consent. Both verbal consent and name of the staff who obtained the consent will be documented on the REDCap. Both caregiver and patient will be provided with a copy of the consent form. If the caregiver consents, then the patient will be invited to complete consent. At an upcoming patient medical appointment, caregivers will be asked to provide a small hair sample (approximately 10-30mg) from the posterior vertex of the scalp to test for cortisol levels as an initial index of chronic adrenocortical activity and a biomarker of physiological stress. A hair-care questionnaire will be completed by the caregiver to gather medical information which may interfere with the cortisol readings (e.g., lists of medications, use of steroids, hair-care questions). Both the patient and caregiver will be asked to complete a baseline survey. The caregiver will be told which condition they are randomized to and that the six upcoming treatment sessions will be scheduled for those randomized to FOCUS or HL.</p>
                <p>All caregivers, regardless of condition, will be asked to download a study app on their smartphones. Study staff will ensure the caregivers can download the app and the facilitator will instruct them on how to use the app during the first FOCUS or HL session. Staff will instruct those in the EC condition on use of the app following app download. Finally, all caregivers will receive a program packet that consists of a treatment booklet, headphones (for use with meditations for FOCUS or remote sessions for HL), and a list of support groups/resources at Moffitt Cancer Center. In terms of the treatment booklet, a FOCUS booklet will be provided to FOCUS caregivers, and the HL booklet will be distributed to both HL and EC caregivers.</p>

                <p><xref rid="pone.0266316.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> provides an overview of the timeline for treatment. Both FOCUS and HL caregivers will individually meet with a facilitator (in-person and/or Zoom videoconferencing) weekly for 6 consecutive weeks following enrollment into the study. They will also receive 1 to 3 daily brief momentary interventions/messages through the study app. Session 1 will be designed to be completed the week prior to transplant, session 2 the week of transplant, and session 3 the first week post-transplant. Thus, sessions 1–3 should occur in person while the patient is staying on the BMT unit. Sessions 4–6 will occur post-discharge once the patient is released within a 30-minute radius of the cancer center; these sessions will be conducted through Zoom videoconferencing. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person sessions may be modified to be delivered via videoconferencing as needed. At the end of session 1, the facilitator will assist in initiating the study app and describing its functions. All sessions will be audio-recorded for treatment fidelity purposes.</p>

                  <title>FOCUS condition</title>
                  <p>The session content of FOCUS is presented in <xref rid="pone.0266316.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. FOCUS was systematically developed and pilot tested with feedback from allogeneic HCT caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0266316.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides an overview of session content. Briefly, each session will include 2–3 formal mindfulness meditations led by the facilitator that last approximately 10 minutes each. The first few sessions will be centered on how to direct attention to the breath or some object of attention (e.g., parts of the body). As the sessions progress, caregivers will be asked to apply these skills to thoughts and emotions. Each week, home practices will be assigned which include exercises relevant to each session theme and the practice of formal meditations 2 times per day (audio recordings of meditations available on the app). At the end of session 3, caregivers will be asked to consider how to prepare for the discharge of the patient, as this is the usual timeframe for most patients to be discharged (this content can be moved if patient discharge is delayed).</p>
                  <p>During the 6 weeks of treatment, caregivers will interact with the study app in two ways: (1) Receive brief momentary interventions 1–3 times per day, and (2) Listen to the audio-recordings of meditations. A daily meditation reminder with a link to audio-recorded meditations will be deployed at 9am every day. However, caregivers will be able to choose to practice the meditation any time throughout the day by accessing the audio-recordings within the app itself. The brief momentary interventions will consist of brief mindfulness strategies and motivational messages. Brief mindfulness strategies will be randomly drawn from a pool of 96 potential strategies in the following content areas: focusing on the breath, noticing thoughts, awareness of sensations, motivational messages, acceptance/non-judgement, gratitude, lovingkindness, and uncertainty. These strategies aim to enhance and reinforce the use of mindfulness in daily life and should take 1–3 minutes to complete. Examples include: “Over the next several moments, notice any thoughts that come into your mind”; “Allow yourself a couple of minutes to just focus on your breathing in this moment”; “Not knowing sometimes causes distress. Observe this experience with curiosity and notice how it changes over time.” Upon completion, caregivers will have the ability to rate the helpfulness of each strategy (1–5 rating scale).</p>

Examples include: “Try to include a fruit and vegetable at every meal”; “If you decide to take a nap, try to take it earlier in the day”; “Staying active can help reduce your stress.” Upon completion, caregivers will have the ability to rate the helpfulness of each message (1–5 rating scale).</p>

A handout designed by the study team listing all hospital resources will be provided to those in EC at the consenting session. EC caregivers will also be provided with the same booklet given to HL caregivers. This booklet can be a stand-alone guide for self-care, and so it was provided to those in EC as an additional resource. Caregivers in the EC conditions will not receive any daily momentary interventions/messages or weekly individual sessions.</p>

Greeting cards will be also mailed at key points throughout the study (e.g., patient discharge, holidays, birthdays). Caregivers and patients will be financially compensated for completing the assessment measures. Caregivers will receive $25 for completing the surveys at baseline, end of treatment, and 2-month follow-up. For completing the 6-month follow up survey, the caregiver will be compensated $50. If the caregiver completes at least 70% of the daily diary questions, they will receive a bonus payment of $40 at the end of treatment. The patient will be compensated $20 at each assessment time point.</p>

                  <p>There will be 90 dyads randomized to each condition, with at least 63 per condition (30% dropout) expected to complete the 2-month assessment. PASS 16 was used to estimate power and effect size based on this sample size. To test the primary hypothesis, for the FOCUS vs HL comparison, with alpha set at .05, a two-sided test, and condition n’s of 63, it is estimated that power &gt;.80 will detect a standardized difference between means of 0.51, a medium effect size. For the FOCUS vs EC comparison, under the same conditions as above but with alpha = .025, it is estimated that power &gt;.80 will detect a standardized difference between means of 0.56, which can be described as slightly greater than a medium effect size. Power estimates for the secondary hypothesis on patient distress and the exploratory hypothesis of healthcare utilization are expected to have fewer participants and therefore the minimum effect sizes will be higher than those for the primary hypothesis (e.g., if condition n’s = 50, then effect sizes increase to 0.57 [HL] and 0.63 [EC] and).</p>

                  <p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize and evaluate the distributions of all study variables. Transformations (e.g., log, square root) will be applied, as needed, prior to hypothesis testing and the Shapiro-Wilks test will be used to evaluate normality.

Independent sample t-tests will be used to identify condition differences, despite randomization, in baseline measures that will then be included as covariates when testing hypotheses. Primary analyses for the primary and secondary hypotheses will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) with an identity link function, linear regression, and compound symmetry for the working correlation matrix. The Holm method [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] will be applied to control for experiment-wise error in the primary analyses, with alpha set at .025 for tests of FOCUS vs EC and set at .05 for FOCUS vs HL.</p>
                  <p>To examine the primary hypothesis, the primary predictors of the GEE model will be condition (e.g., FOCUS vs EC), time (end of treatment; 8 weeks vs 2 months), and their interaction. The GEE will include as a covariate any baseline measure that differs by condition (p &lt; .05) as a potential confound (e.g., age, relationship to patient, baseline burden). Missing data in the response variable will be handled using inverse probability subject specific weighting methods implemented in SAS PROC GEE. If baseline variables are significantly related to missingness of the response variable, then full information maximum likelihood or multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data. The hypothesis will be tested using a planned contrast of condition at 2 months assessing the prediction that FOCUS will have a lower mean burden than the comparison condition (HL or EC).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Studies that examine the efficacy of stress reduction for caregivers are limited. To the best of our knowledge, our team’s pilot study is the first that reported on the feasibility and acceptability of an MBI among allogeneic HCT caregivers [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As an extension of our team’s prior work, the current manuscript describes the rationale and design of an NIH-funded, 3-arm RCT that aims to recruit caregivers of allogeneic HCT cancer patients (N = 270) and their patients with the overall goal of testing the efficacy of a 6-week mindfulness-based stress management program on reducing caregiver burden, patient distress, and patient health care utilization, as compared to two comparison conditions.</p>
              <p>Several strengths of the study design are worth noting. First, the FOCUS intervention was systematically developed based on feedback from allogeneic HCT caregivers and HCT clinic staff, and extant literature on mindfulness and cancer caregivers more broadly [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our pilot study supported its potential to reduce caregiver burden/distress and increase post traumatic growth, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of the current study procedures [<xref rid="pone.0266316.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Second, the interventions will be provided over the entire course of the transplant process (pre- and post-transplant). Providing intervention content pre-transplant will hopefully aid caregivers in preparing for what to expect and how to cope. Continuing the intervention through the transplant and post-discharge period provides an excellent opportunity to apply what was learned in earlier sessions while the caregiver is in the role of taking care of the patient full-time. Third, the flexibility in scheduling and treatment delivery modality (in-person or videoconferencing) reduces caregiver burden and potentially maximizes treatment engagement. This should enhance future scalability to other health care settings regardless of unexpected events (e.g., COVID-19). Fourth, brief momentary interventions/messages supplement the main intervention providing an opportunity to apply learned skills to daily life. Fifth, collecting biomarker and daily diary data will allow a thorough investigation of proposed mechanisms. Sixth, if the primary hypothesis is supported, the results will provide strong evidence on the potential of an MBI for other cancer caregiver populations where caregiver burden and responsibilities are high (e.g., head and neck). Alternatively, if FOCUS does not demonstrate superior outcomes compared to HL, we will know that an intervention such as HL that requires fewer resources may be sufficient to reduce caregiver burden.</p>
              <p>Limitations should also be discussed. All caregivers are asked to complete daily diaries and those in FOCUS and HL will additionally complete aspects of the intervention in the study app, which may increase participant burden. To reduce burden, the daily diary was designed to take less than 1 minute to complete. All aspects of the app were also designed with the ability to delay responding and/or to not respond if unable to do so. It is also unclear what impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on study results. We have included questions to assess COVID-related distress at the end of the study.</p>
              <p>This project is the first full-scale RCT to evaluate the efficacy of an MBI for allogeneic HCT caregiver burden that also includes assessing patient distress and healthcare utilization. Other unique aspects of the study include the collection of biomarker data, incorporation of brief momentary interventions/messages, and a daily diary component to collect mechanistic data over the course of treatment. Study results will inform the next line research including dissemination and implementation within HCT clinics across different cancer centers, and its integration in the clinic workflow with provider training.</p>
