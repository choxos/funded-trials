                <sec id="S1">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P2">To investigate delivery of adenovirus to the prostate, fluorescently labeled vector was injected into fresh prostatectomy specimens and distribution visually analyzed. The optimal volume and site instillation was then used for transrectal ultrasound guided intraprostatic injection in 10 patients with adenocarcinoma scheduled for radical prostatectomy. Each received 2-apical and 2-basal 0.5 ml injections of AdV-tk for a total of 1×10<sup>11</sup> vp followed by 14 days of prodrug. Nine patients continued to tumor resection: 6 high-risk, 1 intermediate and 2 low-risk. In-vivo vector distribution was analyzed from resected tissue of four patients. Patients were monitored for tumor progression and acute and long-term safety.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="P3">Two apical and two basal injections of 0.5ml led to optimal organ-wide distribution of an adenoviral vector ex-vivo and in-vivo. Cytotoxicity was evidenced by transient rise in PSA and tumor histology. There were no significant adverse events deemed related to the treatment and no late toxicities after median follow up of 11.3 years. All six high-risk patients had positive surgical margins and one had seminal vesicle involvement. Despite slow PSA rise post-surgery in 3 of these patients, none developed metastases. The intermediate and low-risk patients had complete resections and none have progressed.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="P4">In-vivo transrectal ultrasound guided instillation of an adenoviral vector into four sites in the prostate was practical as an outpatient procedure, well tolerated and led to distribution throughout the intraprostatic tumor mass. AdV-tk demonstrated no significant acute or late toxicities. Trends in PSA and disease progression conveyed the possibility of a sustained immune response against residual disease.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Prostate cancer is second only to lung as a cause of death due to cancer in men in Mexico and worldwide <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. In many Latin American and other developing countries, screening for early prostate cancer detection is not widely applied. Thus, many patients present with advanced disease <sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The incidence of prostate cancer is expected to increase as health-care administration improves and life expectancy increases in these developing nations. Standard of care for localized prostate cancer consists of radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) with adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for higher risk patients <sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Despite advances in surgical techniques and radiotherapy in the last 20 years, even with the most modern techniques there continues to be a significant incidence of tumor recurrence, up to 30% or &gt;50% in intermediate and high risk groups, respectively, highlighting the need for improved therapeutic approaches <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">The use of an adjuvant tumor vaccine to combat residual tumor cells after debulking by surgery or radiation has the potential to decrease recurrence without adding toxicity. This approach could prolong disease free survival and improve quality of life by avoiding the need for castration and other subsequent treatments, all of which are essentially palliative and have significant toxicities and costs. This may be particularly impactful for patients in developing countries who may not have access to new agents for castrate-resistant prostate cancer.</p>
              <p id="P7">Gene-Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy (GMCI) is an approach that generates a tumor-specific vaccine effect through intra-tumoral delivery of an adenoviral vector containing the Herpes virus thymidine-kinase gene (AdV-tk) followed by systemic anti-herpetic prodrug (e.g. ganciclovir or valacyclovir) combined with standard debulking therapies, such as surgery and radiation <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Initial local cytotoxicity is mediated by the nucleoside analog generated through phosphorylation of the prodrug. Cell death via necrosis and apoptosis, viral factors that stimulate the innate immune system, and the acute inflammation from the debulking therapy, attract and activate antigen presenting cells that incorporate and present tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to T cells. The HSV-TK protein, in addition to its enzymatic activity, also functions as a super-antigen like molecule potently stimulating T cell proliferation and IL-2 production<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. This immunostimulatory milieu generates a systemic anti-tumor immune response to the released autologous TAAs. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the immune function of AdV-tk treatment. Treatment of local tumors with GMCI led to protection against metastases and tumor re-challenge in mouse syngeneic models <sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, these distant effects were present in immunocompetent but not immunodeficient mice <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, tumor growth inhibition could be adoptively transferred with splenocytes from animals bearing tumors treated with AdV-tk plus prodrug but not from controls treated with AdV-tk plus saline <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. These studies demonstrated the immune nature of the response and showed that tumor cell death, and its subsequent TAA release, was required to induce tumor specific responses. Thus GMCI could lead to immune protection against recurrence from minimal residual disease after tumor debulking.</p>
              <p id="P8">Although as an immunotherapy, GMCI does not require transduction of every cancer cell, it does require transduction of sufficient tumor cells to cause enough cytotoxicity for effective release of TAAs for tumor specific immune stimulation. Prostate tumors may be diffuse in the gland and may have necrotic foci. Thus, to assure vector instillation was not lost in a necrotic focus or missed tumor cell targeting, it was desirable to maximize vector distribution within the whole gland. However, evaluation of delivery methods to optimize vector distribution in prostate tumor tissue is not feasible in preclinical models. Yet, it is difficult to analyze multiple delivery volumes and site distribution in patients. It is also difficult to extrapolate the distribution of a virion, with its cellular interaction properties, using synthetic particles and expression patterns take days to develop. In the present study, ex-vivo vector distribution in freshly removed organs was evaluated using fluorescently labeled vectors to optimize delivery and in-vivo distribution from the chosen method was confirmed in the clinical study.</p>
              <p id="P9">The current study was the first gene transfer study initiated and conducted in Latin America. The GMCI approach has demonstrated safety with potential efficacy in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in multiple tumor types. This study further evaluates the acute and long-term safety of AdV-tk and analyzes vector distribution after multiple intra-prostatic injections. Conducting this study at the university hospital in Monterrey allowed evaluation in a setting where patients often present with high-risk characteristics and had poor long-term prognosis with standard of care. Long-term follow-up has allowed the observation of the impact of GMCI clinically and biochemically.</p>

PSA levels for patient A6 did not rise after injection but still decreased below baseline prior to surgery (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These PSA changes indicate cytotoxic activity of AdV-tk + prodrug.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P29">Conceptually, the immune system is most likely to be effective against minimal tumor burdens rather than large, late stage tumors. The latter, by definition, have already overcome the immune system and often have evolved systems that thwart immunity. Therefore, immunotherapy is most likely to be effective when used against minimal residual disease rather than as primary therapy for bulky or late stage disease. Local delivery of a cytotoxic agent with immunostimulatory properties can provide the geographic and temporal co-localization of tumor associated antigens and immunostimulation to generate a tumor specific vaccine that will inhibit tumor cell proliferation.</p>
              <p id="P30">Tumor cell killing by AdV-tk + prodrug is required to release the TAA and stimulate antitumor immunity, as evidenced in animal models <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, although transduction of every tumor cell is not required, a delivery method that improves vector distribution throughout the prostate gland maximizes the probability for adequate delivery to tumor cells in the prostate gland. This is important to assure release of TAA and create the immunostimulatory milieu necessary for the in situ vaccine effect <sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To optimize delivery to tumor cells throughout the prostate in a systematic way, different volumes of vector and sites of delivery were evaluated. Ex vivo analysis with fluorescein-labeled vector allowed easy analysis of multiple approaches and subsequent in vivo delivery confirmed that this method provided good distribution throughout the prostate. These results are applicable to intra-prostatic delivery of adenoviral vectors in general with the same viral capsid since the biological determinants of transduction, distribution and persistence in vivo are based on the protein components of the capsid independent of the genomic content of the vector.</p>
              <p id="P31">The 4-site intra-prostatic delivery of AdV-tk lead to broad distribution of vector throughout the prostate and resulted in necrosis and apoptosis as well as immune cell infiltration in the tumor. Additional evidence of tumor cell cytotoxicity was the transient rise in PSA observed after prodrug administration. This instillation method is practical for use as an outpatient procedure and well tolerated. This is the method being used for an ongoing phase 3 randomized trial of AdV-tk + valacyclovir in combination with radiation for localized prostate cancer (ProstAtak trial).</p>
              <p id="P32">The study presented here expanded the safety data for AdV-tk + prodrug and was the first clinical gene therapy study initiated and conducted in Latin America. The AdV-tk vector dose (1×10<sup>11</sup> vp) was based on previous dose escalation studies in prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Overall, the approach was well tolerated with the most common adverse event being mild flu-like symptoms during the first 48 hours after injection likely due to the inflammatory response to the AdV-tk vector. The only grade 3 adverse event was lymphopenia that occurred during ganciclovir administration in one patient. This abnormality resolved without treatment or complications. No late toxicities occurred after more than 10 years of surveillance, demonstrating long-term safety.</p>
              <p id="P33">Continuous follow-up of over 10 years has allowed the evaluation of long-term effects and the clinical outcome of patients. Despite high-risk features in 6 patients including positive surgical margins and seminal vesicle involvement, none of the patients developed metastases or death from prostate cancer. Although there is not a consensus on the definition of biochemical failure following prostatectomy, most studies use a value of 0.2 ng/ml or 0.4 ng/ml <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In a retrospective study of outcomes of 1997 men with clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins University, PSA failure occurred in 15% of patients of which metastases developed in 34% without treatment at the time of PSA failure <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Patients with locally advanced disease (capsular perforation, positive margins and/or seminal vesicle involvement) have a higher risk of PSA recurrence and metastases. Two randomized studies (EORTC 22911 and SWOG 8794) evaluated adjuvant post-operative radiation in these patients compared to delaying additional treatment until PSA recurrence <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Both studies found a significant improvement in recurrence free survival with immediate adjuvant radiation although with increased late adverse events. In the EORTC study, PSA dropped to ≤0.2 ng/ml within 4 months after RP in 70% of patients before radiation and recurrence occurred in 52% of the delayed treatment group versus 23% of the adjuvant group <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. In the SWOG study, PSA relapse was 64% in the delayed group and 35% in the adjuvant group <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. In our study, within 4 months after RP, 7/9 patients achieved a PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml, 1 achieved PSA &lt;0.4 ng/ml and 1 patient was started on bicalutamide for PSA failure. Subsequently, 2 patients developed PSA &gt; 0.4 ng/ml but were not treated for recurrence and had PSADT of 28 and 35 months. PSADT of &gt;10 months has been associated with decreased risk of metastases and prostate cancer death <sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. In our study, no patient has developed metastases or died of prostate cancer despite 6 of the 9 patients being locally advanced. These results are better than expected for this patient population especially without receiving additional treatment.</p>
              <p id="P34">Preclinical studies demonstrated that the local and systemic effects of AdV-tk are potentiated when used in combination with standard debulking therapies such as surgery, radiation and some chemotherapeutic agents <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In murine prostate and mammary models, AdV-tk delivered to the tumor bed following surgical resection delayed local recurrence and inhibited lung metastases <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. CD8 T cells and NK cells have been shown to be important for the systemic effect of AdV-tk + prodrug <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. In a lung tumor model, potentiation of the systemic effect by subsequent cytoreductive surgery was shown to be CD8 T-cell dependent using a Winn assay <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Mechanistically, this was shown to be due, at least in part, to a reduction in systemic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) after surgery <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In the current study, prostates from patients treated with AdV-tk + prodrug had increased infiltration of TIA<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic effector cells compared to control prostates. Abundance of TIA-1<sup>+</sup> cells has been shown to be a good prognostic feature in some cancer types <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Another study evaluating AdV-tk + prodrug prior to prostatectomy found increased infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells compared to controls and increased circulating DR<sup>+</sup>CD8 T cells compared to baseline before AdV-tk + prodrug <sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. These data strongly suggest that adjuvant use of AdV-tk + prodrug stimulates an anti-tumor immune response and may significantly prolong or inhibit the recurrence of a clinically meaningful tumor burden in prostate cancer patients.</p>
              <p id="P35">Intra-prostatic injections of AdV-tk, as adjuvant treatment for localized prostate cancer, has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible in an outpatient setting. More than 10 years of follow-up in the current study has allowed for the observation of the long-term safety.</p>
              <p id="P36">Using antitumor immunotherapy with surgery to increase the host’s adaptive immune system to minimize residual cancer cells after standard of care debulking therapy, may increase the patient’s metastasis free survival without added toxicity by generating a long-standing anti-tumor memory. This offers additional protection for patients that have a high risk of recurrence. Slow decline and slow rising PSA patterns seen in this study suggest that anti-tumor immunity may have been keeping residual cancer cells in check in these high risk patients, preventing clinical progression. The use of GMCI with surgery and radiation to target minimal residual disease has demonstrated great potential by acting synergistically with standard of care <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Efficacy of the approach in combination with surgery will require a definitive study such as the ProstAtak trial currently being conducted in combination with radiation therapy. The ability to easily deliver AdV-tk to the prostate in a simple, outpatient procedure to generate a patient-specific in-situ vaccine is a unique paradigm that can facilitate bringing immunotherapy to patients throughout the world.</p>

                <p>Adenoviral vector conjugated to isothiocyanate, a fluorescent marker, was injected into freshly resected prostates as described. Whole mount sections were visually analyzed using a fluorescent stereoscope. Representative examples from each of four conditions are shown above with three sections of each from apex to base shown from left to right. A) Control prostate without vector injection; note slight background fluorescence. B) Prostate after a single 1 ml injection into a lateral lobe; note localized fluorescence. C) Two one ml vector injections, one on each side of the prostate showing typical punctate distribution. D) Four injections, two on each side of the prostate, with 0.5 mL each. Fluorescence was typically diffuse throughout the organ. The latter was the method chosen for subsequent clinical studies.</p>
