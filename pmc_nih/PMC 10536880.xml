                  <p id="P12">The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was evaluated in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in an expansion of PREVENT-19, a phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial in the US. Participants were enrolled from April 26 to June 5, 2021, and the study is ongoing. A blinded crossover was implemented after 2 months of safety follow-up to offer active vaccine to all participants. Key exclusion criteria included known previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or known immunosuppression. Of 2304 participants assessed for eligibility, 57 were excluded and 2247 were randomized.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p id="P15">Among 2232 participants (1487 NVX-CoV2373 and 745 placebo recipients), the mean (SD) age was 13.8 (1.4) years, 1172 (52.5%) were male, 1660 (74.4%) were White individuals, and 359 (16.1%) had had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. After vaccination, the ratio of neutralizing antibody geometric mean titers in adolescents compared with those in young adults was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.7). Twenty mild COVID-19 cases occurred after a median of 64 (IQR, 57–69) days of follow-up, including 6 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients (incidence, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.31–6.46] cases per 100 person-years) and 14 among placebo recipients (incidence, 14.20 [95% CI, 8.42–23.93] cases per 100 person-years), yielding a vaccine efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI, 46.8%−92.1%). Vaccine efficacy for the Delta variant (the only viral variant identified by sequencing [n = 11]) was 82.0% (95% CI, 32.4%−95.2%). Reactogenicity was largely mild to moderate and transient, with a trend toward greater frequency after the second dose of NVX-CoV2373. Serious adverse events were rare and balanced between treatments. No adverse events led to study discontinuation.</p>

                <p id="P20">PREVENT-19 is a phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial initially conducted in adults in the US and Mexico evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX-CoV2373.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> After the primary objective for adults was achieved,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> the pediatric expansion enrolled adolescents at 73 clinical sites in the US from April 26 to June 5, 2021. This study was reviewed and approved by the WIRB-Copernicus Group Institutional Review Board. The protocol, amendments, and overall oversight were approved by the Institutional Review Board. Parents or guardians of participants provided written informed consent while participants provided assent before enrollment and randomization. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline for randomized clinical trials.</p>

Race and ethnicity were self-reported by the parents and participants as important parameters because the aim was to characterize the vaccine in a population that reflected the demographic composition of the US, and because certain minority populations had reported increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and death.</p>
                <p id="P22">Participants were allocated without age stratification in a 2:1 ratio to receive two 0.5-mL intramuscular injections of either NVX-CoV2373 (5 μg recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S plus 50 μg Matrix-M adjuvant) or normal saline placebo 21 days apart.

              <p id="P40">The expansion of the ongoing PREVENT-19 trial into more than 2200 racially and ethnically diverse adolescents in the US demonstrates that NVX-CoV2373 appears safe and effective (as determined by predefined immunogenicity criteria). Neutralizing antibody responses on postvaccination day 35 were noninferior for both GMFR and serologic response to those observed in young adults from PREVENT-19, in whom a high degree of protective efficacy (90.4% [95% CI, 82.9%−94.6%]) was demonstrated.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, protective efficacy of 79.5% (95% CI, 46.8%−92.1%) was demonstrated in the adolescents in a period with predominant circulation of the Delta variant.</p>
              <p id="P41">The high short-term vaccine efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 for the prevention of COVID-19 in adolescents aged 12 through 17 years corroborated the earlier results from the adult portion of the study.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These vaccine efficacy results were also consistent with those observed for mRNA vaccines in this age group. However, unlike phase 3 trials characterizing the efficacy of mRNA vaccines in adolescents,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> vaccine efficacy in this pediatric expansion was established during a period of almost exclusive circulation of the Delta variant, the only variant detected in all cases that yielded sequencing results (vaccine efficacy against Delta, 82.0% [95% CI, 32.4%−95.2%]). Even though vaccine efficacy was specified as a descriptive analysis in the pediatric expansion, the results recapitulate the high vaccine efficacy observed for NVX-CoV2373 largely against early viral variants during earlier phase 3 trials in adults,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which suggests that the vaccine may elicit broadly protective immunity.</p>
              <p id="P42">No safety concerns were identified during the follow-up period reported herein (median, 71 [IQR, 65–77] days after dose 2, with &gt;84% of participants followed up for at least 60 days for this analysis). Reactogenicity was mild to moderate in severity, self-limited, and, as expected, more frequent and more severe after the second vaccination. By contrast, similar rates of unsolicited adverse events (including serious or severe adverse events) were observed between vaccine and placebo recipients. However, given the sample size, this study did not have the power to identify rare adverse events, such as myocarditis following vaccination.</p>
              <p id="P43">Neutralizing antibodies and anti–S-binding IgG antibodies at day 35 (ie, 14 days after the second vaccine dose) have been correlated with vaccine efficacy for NVX-CoV2373.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> High levels of humoral responses at day 35 were observed in adolescents (as determined by both anti–S-binding IgG antibodies and functional microneutralization and hACE2 receptor–binding inhibition assays) against prototype virus as well as against more recent Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Mu, and Omicron variants, including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFigures 3</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref> in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>), which were 2 to 4 times higher than those observed in PREVENT-19 adult participants (G.A, S.C.-C., M.Z, et al; unpublished data, December 2022).</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="P44">This study has limitations, including its short period of time (median surveillance time: 64 [IQR, 57–69] days) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eTable 14</xref> in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>) during which the vaccine efficacy of the primary series of 2 doses of vaccine 21 days apart was evaluated. Placebo-controlled follow-up was limited by early implementation of the blinded crossover to ensure retention of this age group that provided active vaccination for all participants when other vaccines became available under emergency use authorizations,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which overall limited the ability to assess the efficacy of the vaccine against a larger number of viral variants.</p>
                <p id="P45">Notably, the protective efficacy was assessed during the predominant circulation of the Delta variant, which was later replaced by the Omicron variant. However, the post hoc analyses of immune responses against the more recent Omicron subvariants support potential effectiveness against a broad distribution of future variants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFigures 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref> in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). The effect of an NVX-CoV2373 booster dose given 5 to 6 months after the primary series is being assessed for all PREVENT-19 participants, including those exposed to Omicron.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P46">Although the study was not powered for the assessment of vaccine efficacy, another limitation of the study was the low number of cases that were accrued in each group due to the implementation of the blinded crossover, which made the 95% CIs appear wide. However, the lower bound of the vaccine efficacy 95% CI was over the threshold of 30% established by the US FDA to grant emergency use authorization to COVID-19 vaccines.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Another limitation of the study was the fact that, in all COVID-19 studies conducted in 2020 to 2021, the per-protocol efficacy population excluded participants seropositive at baseline, which was in line with the serostatus of the US population at the time the study was initiated and was the population for which the regulators primarily wanted to understand the efficacy of the vaccine.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P47">In this randomized clinical trial, NVX-CoV2373 was safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in preventing COVID-19, including the predominant Delta variant, in adolescents. NVX-CoV2373 is currently authorized for emergency use in the US among adults and adolescents 12 years or older.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The vaccine is expected to increase uptake in adolescents, more than 22% of whom have not yet received a full vaccination regimen with mRNA vaccines.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> A favorable safety profile, convenient storage and transportation requirements, and induction of broad, cross-reactive immune responses with the potential to provide protection against new variants suggest that NVX-CoV2373 offers an important choice for vaccination of younger individuals in the fight against the current COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.</p>
