                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Although shortcomings in clinician–family communication and decision making for incapacitated, critically ill patients are common, there are few rigorously tested interventions to improve outcomes. In this manuscript, we present our methodology for the Pairing Re-engineered Intensive Care Unit Teams with Nurse-Driven Emotional support and Relationship Building (PARTNER 2) trial, and discuss design challenges and their resolution.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the PARTNER 2 intervention to usual care among 690 incapacitated, critically ill patients and their surrogates in five ICUs in Pennsylvania. Eligible subjects will include critically ill patients at high risk of death and/or severe long-term functional impairment, their main surrogate decision-maker and their clinicians. The PARTNER intervention is delivered by the interprofessional ICU team and overseen by 4–6 nurses from each ICU. It involves: (1) advanced communication skills training for nurses to deliver support to surrogates throughout the ICU stay; (2) deploying a structured family support pathway; (3) enacting strategies to foster collaboration between ICU and palliative care services and (4) providing intensive implementation support to each ICU to incorporate the family support pathway into clinicians’ workflow. The primary outcome is surrogates’ ratings of the quality of communication during the ICU stay as assessed by telephone at 6-month follow-up. Prespecified secondary outcomes include surrogates’ scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale, the modified Patient Perception of Patient Centredness scale, the Decision Regret Scale, nurses’ scores on the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and length of stay during and costs of the index hospitalisation.</p>
                  <p>We also discuss key methodological challenges, including determining the optimal level of randomisation, using existing staff to deploy the intervention and maximising long-term follow-up of participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately one in five American deaths occur in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit (ICU).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Many of these deaths occur following a decision to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging therapies.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–13</xref> Because critically ill patients often lack decision-making capacity, surrogate decision-makers are asked to assist in making these difficult decisions. A large body of research has documented problems with the process and outcomes of surrogate decision making in ICUs, including frequent failure to discuss patients’ values, provide emotional support, hold timely family meetings or explain treatment options such as comfort-focused care.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref> Surrogates in ICUs perceive their role as challenging<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> and experience high levels of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> There is also evidence that critically ill patients often receive more intensive life-extending treatment than they would choose for themselves, which is problematic because of the impact on both individual patients and the costs of medical care near the end of life.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p>
              <p>Although the scope of problems with surrogate decision making for critically ill patients is well documented, there are few evidence-based strategies to improve patient, family and health system outcomes in patients with advanced critical illness.</p>
              <p>We, therefore, developed a multicomponent intervention delivered by the interprofessional ICU team to provide structured support of families throughout the ICU stay.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> The intervention is designed to follow national recommendations to use interdisciplinary teams to support patients and families<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> and leverage nurses’ professional orientation toward providing patient and family-centred care.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28 31</xref> The present trial differs from a previous trial of a similar intervention in several important ways. First, compared with the prior intervention tested,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> in the present trial, the scope of the PARNTER intervention was expanded to include a process to foster greater involvement of specialist palliative care (PC) clinicians into patients care and audit and feedback to be provided to each ICU. Second, the prior trial was completed with a small internal grant, which did not allow detailed collection of a variety of process outcomes, such as communication practices in both study arms and timing of decisions to limit the use of life-prolonging treatments or transition to comfort-focused goals of care. The present trial contains detailed data collection on these points. Third, the prior trial did not assess the impact of the intervention on bedside nurses which is included in the present trial’s secondary outcomes. Herein, we present the trial methodology, describe the study intervention and discuss our approach to three key methodological challenges—determining level of randomisation, integrating the intervention with existing clinical staff and retaining participants in long-term follow-up.</p>

                <title>Overview of trial methodology</title>
                <p>This is a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the Pairing Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-Driven Emotional Support and Relationship-Building (PARTNER) intervention compared with usual care control. We will assess the intervention’s effect on three domains of outcomes: measures of the patient-centredness of care and quality of clinician–family communication, surrogates’ symptoms of long-term psychological distress and healthcare utilisation.</p>

                <title>Trial centres and participants</title>
                <p>The trial will be conducted in five ICUs at four hospitals in Pennsylvania within the UPMC Health System: three medical ICUs within three community hospitals in which intensivist physicians serve as the attending physician of record for all patients, and a cardiac ICU and cardiothoracic surgical ICU within one academic hospital, in which intensivist physicians provide care for all patients in collaboration with a primary attending physician.</p>
                <p>The trial will include all patients in the study ICUs who meet eligibility criteria during the enrolment period. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarised in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref> for patients, surrogate decision-makers and nurses. Inclusion criteria for patients include an age of 21 years or greater, lack of decision-making capacity and at least one of the following: receipt of mechanical ventilation for at least four consecutive days, judgement by the attending physician that the patient has at least a 40% chance of death during the hospitalisation or at least a 40% chance of severe long-term functional impairment. Daily a designated staff member in the ICU will screen the census and discuss each patient with the attending physician to determine eligibility for enrolment in the intervention pathway. Nurse leaders will identify one surrogate decision-maker per patient whom the family identifies as the patient’s main surrogate and research staff will obtain their verbal consent for long-term follow-up over the phone. Nurses will be eligible if they were full time staff nurses in the ICU during the study period.</p>

                <title>Description of the PARTNER Intervention</title>
                <p>The PARTNER intervention is conceptually grounded in the Cognitive Emotional Decision Making (CEDM) framework and Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF).<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> The CEDM framework views medical decisions as influenced by not only cognitive and informational considerations, but also the emotional distress that arises from witnessing a critically ill loved one and being required to make difficult, highly consequential decisions for them. The ODSF conceives that better patient/family decision making can be achieved by (1) identifying decision support needs; (2) providing tailored decision support and (3) evaluating the decision-making process and outcomes.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 35</xref></p>
                <p>The PARTNER intervention will be deployed at the level of individual ICUs and delivered by the existing interprofessional ICU team. It will be overseen by four to six nurses from each ICU called the PARTNER nurses, nominated by their ICU director because they were judged to possess strong communication skills. The intervention entails guideline-recommended strategies for providing emotional support to surrogates and for ensuring frequent clinician–family communication.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 36 37</xref> The four main components, detailed below, are: (1) advanced communication skills training for 4–6 nurses from each ICU to deliver support to surrogates throughout the ICU stay; (2) deploying a structured family support pathway delivered by the interprofessional ICU team (3) enacting strategies to increase the timely consultation of PC clinicians when appropriate and (4) providing comprehensive implementation support to ensure reliable delivery of the PARTNER intervention (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>After the nurses are trained in communication skills for the PARTNER intervention, each ICU will institute the family support pathway. The pathway involves the PARTNER nurses meeting with families daily, according to a standardised protocol, and arranging interdisciplinary clinician–family meetings within 48 hours after enrolment and every 5– 7 days thereafter. In addition, the PARTNER nurses meet with families before and after each family meeting to prepare them for the meeting and to debrief after the meeting. They also huddle with the clinical team before each family meeting. The main objectives of each encounter are summarised in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and depicted in timeline format beginning from the day of enrolment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>The PARTNER intervention uses strategies from behavioural economics and implementation science to overcome barriers to achieving frequent, structured family meetings. For example, the intervention resets the care default regarding timing of family meetings by switching from an ‘opt-in’ to an ‘opt-out’ approach to scheduling. Specifically, the PARTNER nurses will schedule family meetings per protocol unless the attending physician takes active steps to override the protocol, rather than requiring the clinical team to take active steps to schedule family meetings.</p>

                <p>The primary outcome measure is surrogates’ total score on the QOC scale, measured during telephone follow-up 6 months after patient’s discharge from the index hospitalisation. The QOC Scale is a 13-item scale measuring QOC with good internal consistency, strong evidence of reliability and validity,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> and established responsiveness to change.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The QOC scale is a patient and family-centred outcome because it measures aspects of care rated as highly important to patients and their families. Higher scores on the QOC scale have been associated with higher ratings of the patient-centredness of care,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> more goal concordant care and shorter duration of ICU care before death.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 48</xref> We decided to focus long-term follow-up on only one time point in order to minimise the burden on family members, many of whom will be recently bereaved, and also to stay within budgetary constraints. We selected the 6-month time point because the QOC has established responsiveness to change at 6 months,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and the secondary measures of psychological distress are of uncertain clinical significance prior to the 6-month time point.</p>
                <p>The investigative team originally planned to use as the primary outcome surrogates’ scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 6 months follow-up. However, the primary outcome was revised to the QOC scale and updated within ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 April 2018. The change in primary outcome measure was made in consultation with the trial’s DSMC and the funding agency. The decision was based entirely on new evidence external to the trial. At no time did investigators have access to outcome data from the trial, which will not be made available to investigators until the trial is complete.</p>
                <p>The rationale for this change was accumulating evidence that the type of intervention tested in this trial (ie, an intervention restricted to the ICU setting) is unlikely to improve surrogates’ long-term symptoms of anxiety and depression. Two recently published RCTs of interventions focused on supporting family members acting as surrogates during their time in the ICU did not improve surrogates’ psychological distress<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and may have worsened symptoms of PTSD.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> One of the interventions was very similar in design to the intervention being tested in the current trial.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>

                  <p>Total hospitalisation costs: We will measure costs during the index hospitalisation using the UPMC computerised cost accounting system, which assigns specific costs to each service based on hospital expenses. UPMC developed this activity-based costing (ABC) system to align costs with patients based on actual utilisation of resources. Direct expenses, such as blood products, drugs and supplies, are allocated on a patient-incurred basis. Departmental labour and other expenses are allocated to patients using specific cost drivers, such minutes on a nursing unit or time in an OR. This costing method excludes expenses related to physician margin (Physician Services Division Sweep and Support), Enterprise Shared Services and other fully indirect expenses. These excluded categories total approximately 25% of total hospital expenses. Because this costing system excludes these fixed costs, the costs may alternatively be labelled ‘total controllable hospitalisation costs’. Further details of the ABC system can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.healthcatalyst.com/success_stories/activitybased-costing-in-healthcare-service-lines-upmc.">https://www.healthcatalyst.com/success_stories/activitybased-costing-in-healthcare-service-lines-upmc</ext-link>. To calculate direct variable costs, we will remove the fixed costs of overhead that are not related to patient throughput, determined through individual departmental usage patterns and will aggregate each patient’s total service specific costs.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></p>
                  <p>Healthcare utilisation through 6-month follow-up: We will measure healthcare utilisation that occurs between index hospitalisation discharge and 6-month follow-up using an established method based on in-depth interview with the patient’s surrogate during the 6-month follow-up call.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> The interview contains questions to determine the number of postdischarge hospital admissions, nursing home admissions, emergency department visits, physician visits, hospice use and home health service utilisation.</p>
                  <p>Cost of Implementing PARTNER Intervention: To calculate costs to implement the intervention, we will determine the cost of all training, inclusive of salary/fringe costs of nurses, actors and instructors. We will also include costs related to ongoing implementation support during the intervention phase of the study, including the implementation specialists’ time, mileage and parking for travel between sites.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. The individual ICU is the unit of randomisation and individual surrogate/patient is the unit of analysis. To compare surrogates’ characteristics across treatment groups, we will use t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous outcomes and X<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical outcomes. To determine whether the intervention impacts QOC scores (as well as other continuous secondary outcomes), we will use generalised linear mixed model to account for temporal and clustering effects typically encountered in stepped-wedge clinical trial designs.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63 64</xref> Clustering effects by ICU will be treated as random in the models. We will include time as fixed effects to account for secular trends over time and include time by treatment interaction to investigate whether treatment effect is time-varying. The model will also include random slopes of time to account for possible heterogeneous temporal effects across ICUs.</p>
                <p>A known limitation of the stepped-wedge cluster RCT design is that there are often imbalances in patient characteristics across study sites that site-level randomisation does not address. Therefore, it is an accepted strategy in stepped-wedge trials to prespecify that certain covariates will be adjusted for in the statistical analysis plan. We will, therefore, adjust analyses for patient age, modified Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) III, Elixhauser index, mechanical ventilation usage and admission source. In addition, if there are baseline differences between other demographic characteristics across treatment arms, we will adjust for those associated with the outcome in univariate analysis with a p value less than or equal to 0.20. Should missing data prove problematic we will use the methods of multiple imputations or inverse probability weighting.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Final models will be assessed for stability using routine model diagnostics to identify potential outliers and/or influential observations.</p>
                <p>Sample size determination. With a sample size of 690 surrogates, assuming 20% lost to follow-up and alpha=0.05, we will have 80% power to detect a small effect size difference (Cohen’s d: 0.30) between groups on the QOC scale. The MCID for the QOC scale has not been established, but differences between groups of this magnitude were observed in a recent trial of a family support intervention in ICUs and were associated with improved ratings of patient-centredness and family-centredness of care (measured with the modified PPPC scale), as well as a shortened ICU and hospital length of stay among dying patients.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> In addition, a recent trial of an intervention to improve communication about goals of care yielded significant improvements in the QOC with a Cohen’s d of 0.56, which were in turn associated with improved rating of goal-concordant care among patients with stable goals through 3-month follow-up.<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></p>
                <p>The power calculation was done via NCSS PASS 15 using the pooled outcome (SD=24.5) and coefficient of variation (0.15) from the Family-Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units study.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> We assumed a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a conservative estimate of 20% for the rate of surrogate lost to follow-up.</p>
                <p>The enrolment goal was initially 1000 and changed to 690 after a senior biostatistician joined the study team. We re-examined initial power calculations and concluded we were overpowered for our main outcome measure and any gains from obtaining a larger sample size would be only incremental. For practical reasons, because of recent decreases in ICU admissions to UPMC hospitals due to a split between UPMC and Highmark, one of the main health insurance companies, we determined that enrolment would likely be slower than we originally predicted. Given the nature of stepped-wedge trials (ie, control subjects enrolled first, then intervention subjects later) there was concern slow enrolment could led to a circumstance in which too few intervention patients are enrolled.</p>

If family members give permission for the research staff to contact them, forms will be faxed or emailed via secure server behind the institutional firewall to the research staff who then attempt to call within 48 hours.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>While planning the trial, we identified three key design and implementation challenges: (1) determining the optimal type of randomised trial design, (2) using existing clinical staff to deploy the intervention and (3) maximising long-term follow-up.</p>
              <p>We chose to use a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design rather than an individual-level RCT or a cluster RCT for two main reasons. First, we judged that randomising individual patients within ICUs would create a high risk of contamination of the control arm because the intervention is deployed at the ICU-level. Second, a cluster RCT would involve randomly assigning half of the ICUs to receive the intervention and half to receive the control for the duration of the study. Individual ICUs were unwilling to be randomised to a control condition for the duration of the study because of mounting societal pressure to improve end-of-life care for patients with advanced critical illness. We ultimately selected a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design because it allows randomization at the ICU-level and allows all ICUs to receive the intervention during the study period.</p>
              <p>We elected to use existing clinical staff to deploy the intervention for two main reasons. First, doing so increases the scalability of the intervention compared with either using research personnel to deliver the intervention or adding additional clinical personnel to the ICU care team to deliver the intervention. Second, we hypothesise that achieving durable improvements in family support will require changing ICUs’ overall culture and processes of care, which may be more likely to occur when the intervention targets the entire interprofessional team rather than external interventionists.</p>
              <p>Deploying the PARTNER intervention through the existing interprofessional team also presents several challenges. First, ICU clinicians are busy and the PARTNER intervention will likely result in an increase in the amount of time devoted to clinician–family communication. We address this by providing on-site support to develop efficient care processes and training multiple PARTNER nurses per unit. Second, few front-line clinicians have experience deploying complex, protocolised behavioural interventions, which may pose threats to intervention fidelity. We addressed the potential issue by developing a rigorous training programme that focuses on the need for high adherence to protocol. In addition, we designed an extensive monitoring programming that involves weekly site visits with direct observation and coaching by implementation specialists, quarterly ‘booster’ training sessions in which key communication skills are reviewed, and quarterly audit and feedback sessions where unit adherence is summarised.</p>
              <p>The third challenge is achieving adequately high rates of long-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up can be challenging in this population because most of the participants will either be recently bereaved or will be caregivers for survivors of critical illness. We developed three strategies to maximise retention during the follow-up period. First, we collect extensive contact information at initial consenting including phone numbers, mailing addresses and email addresses of both the patient’s surrogate and an alternate contact who will know how to contact the participant if the surrogate’s contact information is no longer valid. Second, we seek to maintain contact with the surrogate after hospital discharge beginning with a thank you note following the consenting process. We also send participants a letter 4-month posthospitalisation with information on scheduling the 6-month follow-up call at their convenience. Third, we developed a protocol for subjects who were hard-to-reach outlining appropriate use of retention strategies, such as voicemail, a hard-to-reach letter, mail return service requesting, use of the alternate contact, online searches for new information and a version of the follow-up interview to complete via mail. We ensure these protocols are implemented through use of software with detailed record of all follow-up activities.</p>
