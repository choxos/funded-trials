                  <p>Despite the availability of effective vaccines against COVID-19, booster vaccinations are needed to maintain vaccine-induced protection against variant strains and breakthrough infections. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen) as primary vaccination plus a booster dose.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>ENSEMBLE2 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial including crossover vaccination after emergency authorisation of COVID-19 vaccines. Adults aged at least 18 years without previous COVID-19 vaccination at public and private medical practices and hospitals in Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, the UK, and the USA were randomly assigned 1:1 via a computer algorithm to receive intramuscularly administered Ad26.COV2.S as a primary dose plus a booster dose at 2 months or two placebo injections 2 months apart. The primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy against the first occurrence of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after booster vaccination, which was assessed in participants who received two doses of vaccine or placebo, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR at baseline and on serology at baseline and day 71, had no major protocol deviations, and were at risk of COVID-19 (ie, had no PCR-positive result or discontinued the study before day 71). Safety was assessed in all participants; reactogenicity, in terms of solicited local and systemic adverse events, was assessed as a secondary endpoint in a safety subset (approximately 6000 randomly selected participants). The trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04614948" id="interrefs20">NCT04614948</ext-link>, and is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Enrolment began on Nov 16, 2020, and the primary analysis data cutoff was June 25, 2021. From 34 571 participants screened, the double-blind phase enrolled 31 300 participants, 14 492 of whom received two doses (7484 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 7008 in the placebo group) and 11 639 of whom were eligible for inclusion in the assessment of the primary endpoint (6024 in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 5615 in the placebo group). The median (IQR) follow-up post-booster vaccination was 36·0 (15·0–62·0) days. Vaccine efficacy was 75·2% (adjusted 95% CI 54·6–87·3) against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 (14 cases in the Ad26.COV2.S group and 52 cases in the placebo group). Most cases were due to the variants alpha (B.1.1.7) and mu (B.1.621); endpoints for the primary analysis accrued from Nov 16, 2020, to June 25, 2021, before the global dominance of delta (B.1.617.2) or omicron (B.1.1.529). The booster vaccine exhibited an acceptable safety profile. The overall frequencies of solicited local and systemic adverse events (evaluated in the safety subset, n=6067) were higher among vaccine recipients than placebo recipients after the primary and booster doses. The frequency of solicited adverse events in the Ad26.COV2.S group were similar following the primary and booster vaccinations (local adverse events, 1676 [55·6%] of 3015 <italic>vs</italic> 896 [57·5%] of 1559, respectively; systemic adverse events, 1764 [58·5%] of 3015 <italic>vs</italic> 821 [52·7%] of 1559, respectively). Solicited adverse events were transient and mostly grade 1–2 in severity.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>A homologous Ad26.COV2.S booster administered 2 months after primary single-dose vaccination in adults had an acceptable safety profile and was efficacious against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19. Studies assessing efficacy against newer variants and with longer follow-up are needed.</p>

              <p id="para10">The emergence of variant strains and occurrence of breakthrough infections<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> require the improvement and prolongation of vaccine-induced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. The initial WHO target profile recommended that COVID-19 vaccines be highly efficacious as a single dose, with booster doses administered for long-term protection.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine is a recombinant, replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a prefusion conformation-stabilised, full-length, membrane-bound, wildtype SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In the phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial, vaccine efficacy against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 at least 14 days after a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S was 56·3% (95% CI 51·3–60·8).<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Results of an earlier phase 1/2a trial showed that reactogenicity following a second dose of Ad26.COV2.S was lower than after one dose.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Ad26.COV2.S was first granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the USA on Feb 27, 2021, and in Europe on March 11, 2021, as a single-dose primary regimen, and has since been granted authorisation in numerous countries globally. Additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines have become necessary to maximise protection against emerging variants. The purpose of the ENSEMBLE2 study was to evaluate the protection that an Ad26.COV2.S booster might provide against COVID-19. We report here the results of the placebo-controlled, double-blind portion of the phase 3 ENSEMBLE2 trial investigating the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S administered as primary vaccination plus a booster dose after a 56-day (2-month) interval.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">We previously reported the final analysis of the phase 3 single-dose Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen) efficacy trial, which showed 56·3% (95% CI 51·3–60·8) efficacy against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 and 74·6% (64·7–82·1) efficacy against severe–critical COVID-19. Although several authorised vaccines are efficacious in preventing COVID-19 illness, waning efficacy over time for mRNA vaccines in particular and the continued emergence of variants highlight the need to consider booster vaccination. In a PubMed search up to June 1, 2022, with no language or date restrictions, using the terms “COVID”, “vaccine”, and “booster OR third dose” and filtering for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we retrieved 30 results. No phase 3 RCTs evaluating the clinical efficacy of boosters were identified. The publications generally described acceptable safety profiles for booster vaccinations and showed increased neutralising antibody responses after boosting. Several publications compared the effect of boosting regimens among different COVID-19 vaccines. Although some reports have shown effectiveness and immunogenicity of a third (booster) dose of mRNA vaccines and inactivated whole-virion vaccines, to date no available publications describe large phase 3 clinical efficacy trials of booster regimens for Ad26.COV2.S.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">We evaluated the efficacy of a homologous booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S given 2 months after a single primary dose in a large, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial. Observed vaccine efficacy varied by severity: a booster dose provided 75·2% (adjusted 95% CI 54·6–87·3) efficacy against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 and 100% (33–100) efficacy against severe–critical COVID-19 by 14 days after boosting. We observed an increase in antibody titres post-boost, which coincided with increased efficacy, and reduced severity of illness in breakthrough cases. The variants alpha (B.1.1.7) and mu (B.1.621) were responsible for most of the COVID-19 cases that contributed to the primary endpoint analysis (17 and 14 cases at least 14 days after booster vaccination, respectively). Data collection for the primary analysis (Nov 16, 2020, until June 25, 2021) took place before the global dominance of delta (B.1.617.2) or omicron (B.1.1.529). Median (IQR) follow-up post-booster was 36·0 days (15·0–62·0), and events accrued without any substantial gaps. Although it was not possible to draw conclusions for all cases caused by specific variants, in part owing to low case numbers, variant-dependent efficacy after primary immunisation and boosting was observed for alpha and mu variants. Because this global study was done while the variant landscape was rapidly evolving, these results provide valuable information on the use of Ad26.COV2.S as a booster vaccine in the context of the ongoing pandemic.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Despite the wide availability of vaccines, at least in most high-income countries, strategies are needed to manage COVID-19 surges, prevent the rise of new variants, and limit the effect of breakthrough infections. Available evidence suggests that homologous boosters are safe and effective, and Ad26.COV2.S represents a sound booster option. Additional studies and data are needed to evaluate Ad26.COV2.S vaccine efficacy against the current variants and over a longer period.</p>

                <p id="para90">ENSEMBLE2 is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (including crossover vaccination for the placebo group after EUA of COVID-19 vaccines) to assess vaccine efficacy against molecularly-confirmed moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after booster vaccination. The study was done at public and private medical practices and hospitals in ten countries: Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, the Philippines, South Africa, Spain, the UK, and the USA.</p>
                <p id="para100">Participants were adults aged at least 18 years, healthy or with stable and well-controlled comorbidities, and without receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine at any time before study vaccination or during the study (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>). Participants with abnormal function of the immune system (except for well-controlled HIV infection) were excluded.</p>
                <p id="para110">The protocol and amendments were approved by ethics committees and institutional review boards per local regulations.

                <p id="para120">Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 via computer-generated randomly permuted blocks of size 4 to receive either two vaccine doses (referred to as a primary dose plus a homologous booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S) as part of the vaccine group or two doses of saline placebo (placebo group) 56 days apart. Central randomisation was implemented in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two vaccination groups: active vaccine versus placebo. This was based on a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared before the study by, or under the supervision of, the sponsor. The randomisation was balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and was stratified by vaccination unit, age group, and absence or presence of comorbidities that were, or might have been, associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Investigators, study site personnel, sponsor personnel, and laboratory personnel who did assays were masked to assignment until the unmasking visit, which was implemented with protocol amendment 4 after EUA of some COVID-19 vaccines (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 13–14</xref>). Participants could be unmasked to enable vaccination of placebo recipients outside the study; once Ad26.COV2.S received EUA, placebo recipients without COVID-19 vaccination outside the study were offered open-label Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. The unmasking visit could occur at a scheduled (preferable) or unscheduled visit, as feasible for the participant.</p>

                <p id="para140">Participants were assessed for suspected symptomatic COVID-19 if they had a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 through a private or public laboratory independent of the study or prespecified clinical manifestations, including chest congestion, cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, sore throat, chills, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological symptoms, red or bruised looking toes, taste loss or new or changing sense of smell, or any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 16</xref> for a full list). Asymptomatic COVID-19 was identified by a positive RT-PCR result in the absence of symptoms through a private or public laboratory independent of the study or testing of blood samples collected at fixed visits (baseline, day 71, and unmasking visit) by means of an ELISA assay against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 15</xref>). For efficacy assessments, COVID-19 cases were confirmed centrally using molecular diagnostic tests based on real-time RT-PCR-based or isothermic amplification technologies. Disease severity was assessed independently by a Clinical Severity Adjudication Committee (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 15</xref>).

Participants were excluded from the PP population if they had a baseline PCR-positive result, a SARS-CoV-2-positive result by serology at baseline or day 71, or major protocol deviations before unmasking that might affect efficacy. Participants who became unmasked were thereafter excluded from the PP population.

The PPFD population included participants in the full analysis set (FAS; all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of trial vaccine or placebo in the double-blind phase) with no major protocol deviations affecting efficacy; participants with positive results at baseline by PCR or serology were excluded. The risk set of the PPFD population excluded participants from the PPFD population who had a positive PCR result (regardless of central confirmation) or discontinued the study before day 15.</p>

Participants were randomly selected from sites in North America, the Asia Pacific region, South Africa and Europe to ensure global representation. Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest were summarised descriptively in the FAS. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were summarised descriptively in the safety subset, which included approximately 6000 randomly selected participants from the FAS (accounting for participant availability and site capacity; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 19</xref>). The selection and tracking of enrolment of the safety and immunogenicity subsets was done through the interactive web response system.</p>
                <p id="para210">The sample size was based on an assumption of 65% vaccine efficacy against molecularly confirmed moderate to severe–critical COVID-19, a type 1 error rate of 0·025, and a 1:1 randomisation ratio. In total, we predicted that 104 events would provide approximately 90% power to reject the primary endpoint null hypothesis (vaccine efficacy for Ad26.COV2.S ≤30%, tested at a 0·025 one-sided significance level). The primary analysis was triggered when at least 90% of participants were unmasked. If the null hypothesis was rejected, confirmatory secondary endpoints (symptomatic infection of any severity, all SARS-CoV-2 infections, severe–critical COVID-19, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19 requiring medical intervention, all evaluated with onset at least 14 days post-booster dose) were tested against a null hypothesis using a lower limit of efficacy of 0% or less, with a prespecified multiple testing strategy preserving the 0·025 family-wise error rate (and indicated with adjusted 95% CI; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 20, 56</xref>). All other endpoints or subgroup analyses were summarised descriptively with 95% CIs.</p>
                <p id="para220">Efficacy and associated CI calculations were done by means of exact Poisson regression.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Estimated cumulative incidence rates to evaluate time to first occurrence of COVID-19 and vaccine efficacy over time were assessed by Kaplan-Meier methods. For any given endpoint, vaccine efficacy was derived from the ratio of the incidence of the endpoint (number of cases per person-years) in the vaccinated group relative to the incidence of the endpoint in the placebo group on the basis of Poisson regression (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 21</xref>). Subgroup analyses were done according to various demographics, baseline risk factors, and by variant; these were prespecified, except for presence or absence of each of the specific comorbidities.</p>
                <p id="para230">To assess immunogenicity, we calculated spike-specific binding antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and responder rates. A responder was identified by at least one of the following: a baseline sample value less than or equal to the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the ELISA, with a post-baseline sample greater than the LLOQ, or a baseline sample value greater than the LLOQ and a post-baseline sample with at least a 4-times increase from the baseline sample value. Statistical analyses were done using SAS (version 9.4) and R 4.1.0 and later versions. An independent data monitoring committee was used.

              <p id="para250">Enrolment began Nov 16, 2020, and the primary analysis data cutoff was June 25, 2021 (before delta became globally dominant and before the emergence of omicron). 34 571 participants were screened, 31 835 were randomly assigned, and 31 300 received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo (FAS). Of the FAS, 16 751 (53·5%) received both doses (Ad26.COV2.S, n=8655; placebo, n=8096), with 14 492 included in the PP population (Ad26.COV2.S, n=7484; placebo, n=7008; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>
). Most (28 836 [92·1%] of 31 300) participants in the FAS were still in the study up to the data cutoff date (see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 53</xref> for the disposition of the PP population); reasons for not being in the study on June 25, 2021, were premature termination (n=2459; reasons for premature termination shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>), completed follow-up (n=4), and missing demographic or study disposition data, meaning the participant could not be assigned as completed, discontinued, or ongoing (n=1). At the time of the cutoff date, 5868 (18·7%) of 31 300 discontinued treatment but remained in the study for further safety follow-up (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Unsolicited adverse events leading to study or vaccine discontinuation in the safety subset are summarised in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 55)</xref>. After unmasking, more placebo recipients (3653 [23·9%] of 15 298) discontinued vaccination and received another vaccine outside the study than Ad26.COV2.S recipients (417 [2·7%] of 15 472). The median (IQR) follow-up post-primary vaccination in the FAS was 70·0 (52·0–99·0) days. In the PP population, median (IQR) follow-up was 36·0 (15·0–62·0) days post-booster; 4245 (29·3%) of 14 492 participants had at least 2 months follow-up post-booster. Despite discontinuations, follow-up times in the double-blind phase between groups in the PP population and FAS were similar (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 23</xref>). Demographic and baseline characteristics are described for the FAS and PP sets in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>

              <p id="para390">In this analysis of ENSEMBLE2 (COV3009), a primary dose plus a booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S administered at a 2-month interval elicited an efficacy of 75·2% (adjusted 95% CI 54·6–87·3) against moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 and of 100% (32·6–100·0%) against severe–critical COVID-19 by at least 14 days after boosting. No cases of COVID-19 requiring medical intervention and no COVID-19-related deaths were observed in the active group of the study. Additionally, vaccination reduced the duration, number, and severity of symptoms in breakthrough cases, suggesting a shift from more severe to milder COVID-19. An anamnestic response was shown, as antibody titres increased from baseline approximately 40-times by 2 weeks after the Ad26.COV2.S booster, as compared with 7·2-times 4 weeks post-primary vaccination, coinciding with increased efficacy and suggesting that increased immunogenicity corresponds to increased protection.</p>

              <p id="para430">Previous studies have shown that Ad26.COV2.S administered as either a homologous or heterologous booster can induce neutralising antibody titres against the reference strain and the delta and omicron variants of concern.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In these studies, both homologous and heterologous Ad26.COV2.S boosters had less effect on neutralising antibody titres than boosters of mRNA vaccines; both Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA boosters generally yielded lower titres against delta and omicron variants relative to the wild-type or reference strains.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Direct comparison of immune responses elicited at a single, early point in time limits the interpretation of results reported in previous booster studies in the context of actual protection over time. For example, mRNA immune responses typically decline over time, whereas immune responses elicited by Ad26.COV2.S generally remain more stable over time. This principle has been shown in the 3-month analysis of the COV-BOOST trial in which the protection decay rate of the Ad26.COV2.S booster dose was lower than that of the BNT162b2 booster by 3 months post-boost.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Considering the difference in kinetics among vaccine types, real-world evidence over time might be a suitable indicator of booster performance.

              <p id="para440">The Ad26.COV2.S booster showed an acceptable safety profile in adults aged 18 years and older. Local and systemic reactogenicity was similar to that seen after the first dose, with no increase in adverse reactions post-booster.

Although more non-infectious arthritis events occurred after Ad26.COV2.S than after placebo in ENSEMBLE2, the converse was seen in ENSEMBLE (more after placebo), and no signal has been identified in post-marketing data. The difference in numbers of haemorrhagic disorders between the vaccine and placebo groups in this study was mostly driven by events related to vaccine administration. These inconsistencies in adverse event occurrence between studies suggest differences might be attributable to chance.</p>
              <p id="para450">There are limitations to this study. As ENSEMBLE2 was done at the peak of the COVID-19 wave in early 2021, when COVID-19 vaccines were first made available by EUA, it was no longer ethical to maintain the placebo control, leading to early unmasking. All participants could request unmasking to establish whether they qualified for COVID-19 vaccination outside the study, and placebo recipients could receive the open-label crossover vaccination (timing varied by country depending on the date of Ad26.COV2.S authorisation). Unmasking and crossover reduced participant numbers receiving both doses and planned follow-up time in the double-blind phase, and led to low numbers of COVID-19 cases being available for evaluation of the booster dose compared with placebo; data within subgroups, including by variant, should thus be interpreted with caution. More participants in the placebo group than the Ad26.COV2.S group terminated prematurely, possibly because of non-study antibody testing before unmasking that could reveal a lack of antibody to the spike protein, and partly because after unmasking, placebo recipients terminated participation to receive another COVID-19 vaccine outside the study. Most participants nevertheless completed the double-blind phase; with 66 cases of molecularly confirmed moderate to severe–critical COVID-19 under the protocol assumptions, the study had 58% power to reject the primary endpoint null hypothesis. The person-years of follow-up in the PP population and FAS were generally similar, indicating that masking was properly maintained and bias minimised. Moreover, vaccine efficacy estimation methods accounted for differences in follow-up between the vaccine and placebo groups. Additionally, the primary analysis cutoff occurred before the global dominance of delta and omicron, and insufficient cases accrued to evaluate efficacy against these variants. Finally, the sample size of the immunogenicity subset was smaller than planned (157 participants <italic>vs</italic> 400 planned) owing to delays in timely reconciliation of serum samples collected. However, this sample size is sufficient to understand the magnitude of the binding antibody responses elicited by Ad26.COV2.S as a booster dose given 2 months after the first dose.</p>
              <p id="para460">A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19, and a booster administered 2 months later substantially increased vaccine efficacy, including against symptomatic and severe–critical COVID-19. A booster dose of Ad26.COV2.S has received authorisation in several countries, including from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency in October and December, 2021, respectively. Additional studies and data are needed to characterise the incremental booster effect over a longer follow-up period, within subgroups, and for emerging variants.</p>
