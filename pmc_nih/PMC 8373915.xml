                <p id="Par1">Individuals post-stroke experience persisting gait deficits due to altered joint mechanics, known clinically as spasticity, hypertonia, and paresis. In engineering, these concepts are described as stiffness and damping, or collectively as joint mechanical impedance, when considered with limb inertia. Typical clinical assessments of these properties are obtained while the patient is at rest using qualitative measures, and the link between the assessments and functional outcomes and mobility is unclear. In this study we quantify ankle mechanical impedance dynamically during walking in individuals post-stroke and in age-speed matched control subjects, and examine the relationships between mechanical impedance and clinical measures of mobility and impairment. Perturbations were applied to the ankle joint during the stance phase of walking, and least-squares system identification techniques were used to estimate mechanical impedance. Stiffness of the paretic ankle was decreased during mid-stance when compared to the non-paretic side; a change independent of muscle activity. Inter-limb differences in ankle joint damping, but not joint stiffness or passive clinical assessments, strongly predicted walking speed and distance. This work provides the first insights into how stroke alters joint mechanical impedance during walking, as well as how these changes relate to existing outcome measures. Our results inform clinical care, suggesting a focus on correcting stance phase mechanics could potentially improve mobility of chronic stroke survivors.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Stroke is the leading cause of adult-onset disability, affecting millions of Americans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>; however, treatment of the locomotor dysfunction that often results has been limited. Up to 80% of stroke survivors experience persistent gait deficits even after standard rehabilitation therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> that increase their risk for recurrent stroke and vascular death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Changes in joint kinetics, kinematics and mechanics manifest as reduced gait speed, instability, asymmetry, and exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. While kinetic and kinematic impairments during walking have been studied extensively, altered joint mechanics (stiffness and damping) are poorly understood. Following stroke, the mechanical properties of muscle are fundamentally altered, causing an increase in passive and active muscle tone, as well as altered reflex facilitation and inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Clinically, changes to joint stiffness and damping are referred to as spasticity, hypertonia, and paresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Spasticity is thought to be a velocity dependent resistance to movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Hypertonia and co-activation can cause an increase in joint stiffness, while limb paresis can cause a decrease in joint stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To assess altered mechanics and their effects on mobility, clinicians often use coarse, qualitative assessments during non-weight bearing or resting conditions (<italic>e.g.</italic> Modified Ashworth Scale). These assessments are used to help guide treatment, and although current physical therapy and pharmacological treatments have been successful in passive conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, this success has not translated to functional improvements in locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Lack of improvement may stem from fundamental differences in how altered joint mechanics present between passive movement and dynamic movement. Furthermore, although stiffness and damping are well defined properties in engineering, their clinical analogs are not as distinct. Spasticity, hypertonia, and paresis are all changes to joint mechanics, but their clinical characterizations are broad and do not map to any specific impedance property (stiffness or damping). Directly characterizing altered joint stiffness and damping during walking may supplement the qualitative assessment metrics used in the clinic, while reconciling the mismatch between passive assessment and desired improvements in dynamic activities.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Joint stiffness and damping (along with inertia) are collectively known as joint <italic>mechanical impedance</italic>, and are fundamental to our ability to regulate interaction with the environment. There is evidence that the mechanical impedance of limbs helps provide stability during unstable tasks and compensates for unexpected environmental dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Biped walking is inherently mechanically unstable, and is one common task where joint stiffness and damping may play an important role in stability and forward propulsion. In young, healthy adults, ankle joint stiffness and damping vary continuously throughout the stance phase of walking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The stiffness component of impedance increases during loading response (early stance phase), mid-stance, and early terminal stance phase in preparation for push off<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, then decreases to values reported in swing throughout late terminal stance as the heel rises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Ankle joint damping values in young healthy adults remain constant throughout loading response, mid-stance, and early terminal stance phase of walking, and increased during late terminal stance as the heel rises<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Characterizing ankle joint impedance in young healthy adults during gait has improved our understanding of gait biomechanics and led to the design of novel biomimetic prosthetic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, knowledge of how joint impedance is altered following neurological injury (e.g. hemiparetic stroke) is limited, and therefore has not yet been incorporated into treatment strategies and standards of care.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Previous research into altered joint impedance following hemiparetic stroke has focused on static conditions, rather than dynamic tasks, such as walking. These studies show that stiffness of the affected ankle in static conditions is significantly increased in stroke survivors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, but the component of stiffness associated with reflexes was not found to be different between groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. These increases in ankle stiffness are not consistent throughout the population with some participants showing no difference in passive ankle stiffness from controls without a history of neurological injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Characterization of the damping component of impedance has been limited, but Mirbagheri et al<italic>.</italic> found no significant difference between paretic and non-paretic limbs under static conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Investigations of the relationship between joint impedance and kinetic and kinematic properties of the ankle have also been conducted. Under static conditions, joint impedance been shown to be related to muscle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, ankle position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and ankle torque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In seated static conditions, stiffness was found to increase proportionally with mean ankle torque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, increase with activation and co-activation of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and increase with degree of planterflexion or dorsiflexion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Therefore, although these works have provided valuable insight into how joint impedance is altered post-stroke and the relationship to kinetic and kinematic factors, their insights should not be extended to dynamic tasks such as locomotion.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The purpose of this study was to (1) estimate impedance of the ankle joint during walking in individuals with chronic stroke, (2) characterize the relationship between ankle impedance and muscle activity, and (3) investigate the relationship between impedance impairment and clinical measures of mobility, spasticity, and sensorimotor function. Our primary hypothesis was that joint stiffness of the paretic limb would be increased during loading response (early stance phase), where muscle activity at the ankle is limited and increased passive joint stiffness dominates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, and decreased during mid-stance and early terminal stance due to reduced muscle activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It was also hypothesized that standard clinical measures of mobility would correlate with impedance impairment during walking, but clinical measures of impairment obtained passively would not. This work provides a foundation for a new assessment paradigm where the factors guiding treatment such as orthotic bracing, pharmaceutical management or physical therapy, can be directly measured quantitatively, rather than inferred from coarse, qualitative studies at rest. Furthermore, these results could inform new clinical targets for therapeutic interventions and the development of novel assistive technologies that leverage knowledge of altered joint mechanical impedance during gait.

The average absolute difference in damping across stance phase between the paretic and non-paretic limbs (damping asymmetry) and the 6MWT distance showed a significant negative correlation, and asymmetry predicted 77% of the variance in 6MWT distance (slope = − 3.66E−5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0091, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.774).

              <p id="Par15">This purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to determine ankle mechanical impedance in individuals with chronic stroke during the stance phase of walking, (2) investigate how these properties relate to muscle activity, (3) quantify the relationship between mechanical impedance impairment, and clinical measures of mobility, spasticity, and sensorimotor function. We hypothesized that compared to the non-paretic and unimpaired joint, stiffness of the paretic ankle would be increased during loading response (early stance), where muscle activity is limited and passive stiffness dominates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, but decreased during mid-stance associated with reduced peak muscle activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As hypothesized, our results showed higher stiffness values at the beginning of stance phase for both the paretic and non-paretic limbs when compared to unimpaired participants. Additionally, paretic ankle stiffness was decreased in comparison to the non-paretic limb across stance phase, but this difference was not associated with differences in muscle activity. The damping component of impedance of the paretic and non-paretic limbs did not increase in preparation for toe-off, and did not significantly differ between limbs. Our secondary hypothesis was that clinical measures of mobility would correlate with impedance impairment during walking, but clinical measures obtained passively would not. The damping component of impedance correlated with mobility (6MWT and 10MWT), but the stiffness component of impedance did not. Furthermore, neither damping or stiffness impairment during walking correlated with clinical measures of spasticity obtained passively (MAS), or sensorimotor function (LE-FM).</p>

                <title>Impedance comparison between the paretic and non-paretic ankle</title>
                <p id="Par16">In early loading response and mid-stance the stiffness component of impedance of the paretic limb for participants with chronic stroke were similar in magnitude to results from passive impedance studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, our results show an even greater stiffness increase of the non-paretic limb across stance phase, which was not found in impedance studies conducted in static postures. As hypothesized, paretic limb stiffness did not increase throughout mid stance and was significantly different from the non-paretic limb at the end of mid-stance and throughout terminal stance phase of walking (70% and 85% of stance). Reduced stiffness during mid-stance and early terminal stance phase has important implications for mobility of individuals with chronic stroke; during terminal stance phase, energy is added by the ankle joint. Increased overall stiffness of the non-paretic ankle during walking not present in passive conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> may reduce the energy able to be added by the ankle joint during walking.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The damping component of impedance did not vary across stance phase, and was not significantly different between paretic and non-paretic limbs. This aligns with impedance studies in static conditions that showed consistent damping across limbs following chronic stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Inertia estimates were consistent across stance phase and between limbs, but both the paretic and non-paretic ankle inertia estimates were increased relative to ankle–foot inertia reported in literature (0.015 kg m<sup>2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Increased inertia estimates may indicate that the estimate represents the inertia of the foot and other coupled body segments or the inertia of the platform robot. Misalignment of the ankle and the robot’s centers of rotation could cause the perturbation to also effect displacements of local body segments and contribute to higher, more variable inertia estimates.</p>

                <title>Impedance comparison between chronic stroke and unimpaired participants</title>
                <p id="Par20">Data were collected from three unimpaired older adults walking at similar speeds to elucidate how age may affect unimpaired ankle impedance values during gait. The stiffness component of impedance varied in a similar manner throughout stance phase to previous results in young healthy adult walking at a faster speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Stiffness increased to a peak around 70% of stance, then decreased during late terminal stance. Although, the peak ankle stiffness of the older adult was reduced when compared to the young healthy adult. Paretic ankle stiffness estimates of chronic stroke participants were increased during loading response and early mid-stance when compared to the gait-speed-matched older adults, however did not significantly vary across stance phase, and therefore did not display the stereotypical increase in stiffness during mid-stance phase. Non-paretic ankle stiffness estimates of chronic stroke participants were also increased when compared gait-speed-matched older adult, and reached a higher peak magnitude prior to powered push-off.</p>
                <p id="Par21">The damping component of impedance of the paretic and non-paretic ankles were similar in magnitude to those of the young unimpaired adult prior to heel off, but did not increase throughout late terminal stance in preparation for toe off. Notably, gait-speed matched older adults displayed a similar temporal variation to individual with chronic stroke, but a significantly higher magnitude than both the chronic stroke participants and young healthy adult. This may indicated that overall ankle damping increases with age, and reduced damping in both limbs of the chronic stroke population is an impairment. Alternatively, it is possible that higher damping estimate are a product of the difference in experimental methods. The ankle angle data of age-range-matched older adults was collected using motion capture, while participants with chronic stroke had their ankle data recorded using an electrogoniometer (consistent with previous works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>).

                <title>Impedance relationship to muscle activation</title>
                <p id="Par22">While, our hypothesis was supported that paretic ankle stiffness would decrease compared to the non-paretic ankle during mid stance and early terminal stance phase, the relationship to muscle activity is unclear. There was no difference in normalized muscle activity of the TA or MG muscles between the paretic and non-paretic limbs. However, the TA muscle activity did differ from that of gait-speed-matched older adult and the young healthy adult (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The CCI was regressed against ankle stiffness and damping to further investigate the relationship between muscle activity and impedance. These results align with studies investigating ankle stiffness when in static postures, which showed stiffness increases with activation and co-activation of the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, this directly contrasts with the relationships found in the young healthy adult during walking. Stiffness in this population was significantly negatively correlated with co-contraction index; meaning higher ankle stiffness was associated with lower levels of co-contraction. Furthermore, although the relationship was not significant, stiffness of the non-paretic ankle also displayed negative trend. A negative relationship in less intuitive, however, it does support the findings of Whitmore et al<italic>.</italic> which showed that changes in EMG tended to directly oppose the changes in stiffness when position and torque were continuously varying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Specifically, during eccentric contraction, they found no appreciable change in plantarflexor EMG despite a large change in torque and stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Triceps surae muscles contract eccentrically when elastic energy is stored in preparation for push-off<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, therefore a reduction in stiffness may not necessarily correspond with a reduction in EMG activity.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Without a significant reduction in EMG, one possible explanation for differences in limb stiffness relates to postural changes during walking exhibited by individuals post-stroke. During mid and terminal stance phase, individuals with chronic stroke often have reduced supination and increased pronation of the ankle–foot complex. Pronation of the foot is associated with eccentric contraction, reduced ankle stiffness and increased range of motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Increased pronation and eccentric contraction may, in part, explain the reduction in stiffness seen during mid stance. It is difficult to make conclusions regarding how stroke has altered the relationship between muscle activity, torque, position, and stiffness during walking since knowledge of these relationships is limited for the unimpaired population. However, our results underscore the importance of investigating walking directly, rather than extrapolating results obtained from postural tasks.</p>

                  <p id="Par24">The difference in damping estimates between the paretic and non-paretic limbs significantly correlated with both measures of mobility (6MWT distance, and 10MWT self-selected speed), explaining 77% and 65% of the variance, respectively. However, damping asymmetry was not significantly correlated with 10MWT fast speed. The reduced correlation between ankle damping asymmetry and 10MWT fast speed when compared to the self-selected speed, might be explained by the redistribution of overall power contribution between joints at faster walking speeds. At slower walking speeds for a young unimpaired adult, the ankle contributes slightly more than the hip to positive power generation, while at faster walking speeds this relationship is switched<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Investigation of joint damping has been minimal, with most research focusing on joint stiffness. However, our results suggest that damping asymmetry may be a factor in reduced mobility of chronic stroke survivors. This result is contrary to previous work that found no significant correlation between passive ankle impedance and gait speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and highlights the importance of studying this property during dynamic tasks. Our results agree with Hsu et al. found that spatiotemporal gait asymmetry was primarily influenced by degree of spasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>—a clinical description of altered joint impedance. Previous work also found gait asymmetries are closely related to dynamic balance in individuals with chronic stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup><italic>.</italic></p>

                  <title>Non-significant correlations</title>
                  <p id="Par25">Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) did not correlate with the difference in stiffness or damping between the paretic and non-paretic limb during walking. These results were expected since the MAS is evaluated while the subjects is relaxed and with an open kinematic chain, whereas impedance measurements occurred while muscles are actively contracting during walking, with a closed kinematic chain. Our results align with previous impedance studies in postural conditions, which also did not find a significant correlation between stiffness and MAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> as well as a number of studies that have demonstrated that MAS do not relate to hyper reflexivity during walking in spastic gait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. This suggests that MAS may not be measuring impaired impedance of joints in a way that translates to descriptions of impairment during dynamic or functional tasks.</p>
                  <p id="Par26">Asymmetry of either impedance parameter (i.e. stiffness and damping) also did not relate to the Lower Extremity Fugl Meyer (LE-FM) motor score. The motor score evaluates movement, coordination, and reflex action about the hip, knee, and ankle. These results suggest that, while useful in assessment of overall sensorimotor impairment, the LE-FM is not sufficient to characterize changes in mechanical impedance specifically. Therefore, it is unlikely that these changes have been addressed in clinical rehabilitation. However, it is important to note that the difference in stiffness also did not relate to clinical measures of mobility (6MWT, 10MWT), therefore focusing on correcting impaired ankle joint damping may be more beneficial for improving overall mobility for individuals with chronic stroke.</p>

                <title>Implications for patient care</title>
                <p id="Par27">The re-acquisition of the ability to walk community distances at reasonable speed post stroke is of critical importance for stroke survivors given the impact of walking on functional independence and cardiovascular health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Currently, healthcare practitioners treating gait disorders in stroke survivors predominantly attend to the correction of sagittal plane swing phase errors with orthotic management or bracing. This emphasis is understandable given that excessive plantar flexion during mid to late swing phase is easily detected by patient and caregiver, and gives rise to variability in foot clearance which markedly increases risk of trips and falls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. However, the data we present suggest that stroke also changes the less easily detected mechanics of ankle-the foot complex during mid-stance and terminal stance phase of gait. These regions are especially important for energy storage and release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup><italic>,</italic> and impairment to mechanical impedance properties could hinder forward propulsion, reducing gait speed and endurance. Our results show that following stroke, overall ankle stiffness is increased, but temporal variation is lost. The damping component of impedance also lacks the stereotypical increase during terminal stance. Furthermore, asymmetry in ankle joint damping between the paretic and non-paretic limb influence walking distance and speed to a greater extent than a validated composite measure of lower limb sensory and motor function. These results suggest that optimal rehabilitation of hemi-paretic stroke patients may require an expansion of clinical efforts to include the modification of stance phase changes in ankle–foot stiffness and damping.</p>
                <p id="Par28">Most pharmacological interventions used to treat swing phase kinematics also serve to diminish stance phase ankle–foot stiffness. Stiffness during mid-late stance is related to foot supination in mid-late stance, which is mediated primarily by the posterior tibialis muscle. However, during swing phase, posterior tibialis spasticity also leads to plantar flexion and inversion which increases trip risk. Consequently, this muscle is commonly injected with neurotoxin by clinicians, a decision commonly driven by observation of gait and/or clinical assessment with MAS. While the application of neurotoxin would be expected to similarly improve stiffness impairment during loading response (early stance) of walking, the data presented suggest that neurotoxin to the posterior tibialis muscle would be expected to further diminish ankle–foot stiffness in mid-late stance phase; thus improvements in walking speed and distance would be unlikely. These results agree with Lizma et al<italic>.</italic>, who found no improvements in gait speed or distance despite reported improvements in active ankle dorsiflexion, gait quality, and reduced spasticity as determined by MAS in their review of trials using neurotoxin to treat ankle plantar flexor and invertor muscles (always including the posterior tibilias muscle)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Similarly, in their meta-analysis, Sun et al<italic>.</italic> reported neurotoxin-mediated improvements in LE-FM score but no improvement in gait speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Finally, it is unclear how pharmacological interventions affect ankle–foot damping, representing a major gap in knowledge given that our data suggests that damping impairment has significant impact on mobility.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Therefore, strategies to diminish swing phase plantar flexion and inversion post-stroke that do not reduce mid stance ankle–foot stiffness as well as strategies that address damping asymmetry are needed. Functional electrical stimulation is one such possibility. One of the few studies to show an increase in walking speed after neurotoxin therapy to the posterior tibilias muscle and plantar flexors combined neurotoxin with functional electrostimulation (FES) of the common peroneal nerve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Further research is required to elucidate if FES can address ankle stiffness and damping impairments. In addition to studying the relationship between FES and joint impedance, future lines of research might also focus on a means to reduce hemi-paresis induced muscle spasticity without the contractile paralyzing effects of neurotoxins. Hyaluronidase therapy, which diminishes high impedance-inducing build-up of the compound hyaluronan in paretic muscles, is one such possibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par30">Finally, this research informs clinicians that ankle–foot stiffness and damping during stance phase of gait cannot be accurately gauged at the bedside using the Modified Ashworth Scale. Furthermore, the MAS did not appear to influence walking speed or distance in our participants. Therefore, although clinical strategies aimed at decreasing spasticity as determined by the MAS post stroke may serve to improve positioning or comfort, these strategies may not be expected to impact gait speed or distance. At this point there is no known bedside strategy for measuring or estimating ankle–foot stiffness and damping during the stance phase of gait in the setting of chronic stroke, which represents a further knowledge gap to be addressed in future research.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par31">While this study provides first insight into ankle impedance in individuals with chronic stroke during walking, it assumes quasi–static second order dynamics during the analysis window surrounding each timing point (30%, 50%, 70%, 85% of stance phase). This is a simplification of actual ankle dynamics, which constantly vary throughout stance, however, this model was chosen for initial investigation of ankle impedance based on the previous success of this technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Additionally, impedance identification requires a perturbation to be applied to the joint, and therefore current technological limitations prevent the practical application of more sophisticated techniques during walking. While these assumptions proved successful in general for the population, a subset of trials in all individuals with chronic stroke did not reliably exhibit second order ankle dynamics. One possible explanation is that this methodology requires an isolated perturbation of the ankle joint during stance phase while the contralateral limb in in swing. Individuals with chronic stroke exhibit extremely heterogeneous gait patterns, sometimes exhibiting extended double support phase and excessive hip abduction, which would hinder joint isolation in some trials. It is also possible that the assumption of linear quasi-static behavior of the ankle is not maintained in the participants with more inconsistent gait mechanics. Future work should investigate the variability in joint dynamics of individuals post-stroke, and determine potential changes to the experimental methods that could account for this variability.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Despite efforts to control the ankle and platform robot’s center of rotation alignment, the location of heel contact on the platform varied across trials. Slight variations in each trial are expected using this methodology, especially when studying a population with gait inconsistencies. Previous studies quantified the sensitivity of stiffness estimates to misalignment, showing a 6% decrease in stiffness per cm misalignment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. The average intra-subject misalignment of rotation axes was 0.8 ± 4.9 cm for the paretic ankle, and 0.3 ± 3.0 cm for the non-paretic ankle. Therefore, this work predicts potential stiffness errors of 4.8 ± 29.4% and 1.8 ± 18% for the paretic and non-paretic ankles respectively.</p>
                <p id="Par33">For this initial investigation the chronic stroke population included was limited to nine individuals, all community ambulators, walking at a single gait speed. Even in this small subset of the population, impedance estimates were much more variable across participants than in unimpaired individuals. Therefore, extending the conclusions from this study on how impedance is altered following stroke to individuals with higher levels of impairment should be done with caution; altered ankle impedance post-stroke may differ with impairment level. It has also been shown that ankle impedance varies with gait speed in the young healthy adult population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which is likely the case for the stroke population as well. Furthermore, statistical comparisons to gait-speed-matched older adults without history of stroke could not be made due to low number of older adult participants. Lower participant numbers stem from the long and arduous data collection process. Due to the lengthy protocol this study only characterized four timing points spanning the stance phase of walking. Future work should include data collected from additional participants, a broader range of post-stroke impairments, and other key gait events such as initial contact. Finally, while the methodology used in this study does accurately estimate overall ankle impedance during walking, it does not differentiate between intrinsic and reflex contributions to impedance. However, it is unlikely that our analysis characterizes ankle impedance values associated with reflexes (shown to be increased in some passive studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>) since sustained reflexes are minimized when using transient perturbations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and the peak torque contribution from reflex activity occurs after a ~ 150 ms delay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, outside the 100 ms window of analysis used in this study.</p>

All participants were required to have no history of major ankle injury or Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment for ankle spasticity, as well as being at least 2 years post-stroke. Individuals unable to complete the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and those with a self-selected Ten Meter Walk Test (10MWT) speed less than 0.45 m/s were excluded. Three recruited participants were excluded: CVA02 was unable to complete the 6MWT without stopping, CVA03 had a self-selected walking speed as determined by the 10MWT below the required cut-off, and CVA12 opted not to complete the entire study. Additionally, three age-range matched adults were recruited (1 male, 2 female, age 57 ± 2 years, weight 62 ± 4.5 kg, termed “older adults” in this paper in order to distinguish from younger adults referenced from previous works. Approval for this study was granted by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board and the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, in accordance with all relevant guidelines.

                <p id="Par35">A mechatronic platform, subsequently referred to as the Perturberator Robot, was used to apply perturbations to the ankle and record data. The Perturberator was recessed into a 5.25 m walkway and was capable of eliciting rotational perturbations in the sagittal plane. An AC gear motor (model: AKM42H-ANC2C-00, Kollmorgen, Radford, VA) controlled by a commercial servodrive (model: AKD-B00606, Kollmorgen, Radford, VA) was used to drive the Perturberator to the desired position during perturbations. Finally, a multi-axis force platform (model: 9260AA3, Kistler Inc, Amherst, NY) was rigidly attached to the Perturberator Robot to measure ground reaction forces (GRF).

                  <p id="Par36">A number of standard clinical measures were conducted to obtain a clinical metric of impairment for each chronic stroke participant, and to ensure that all participants had sufficient speed and endurance to participate. Two clinical measures of mobility were performed: the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and the Ten Meter Walk Test (10MWT). The 6MWT assessed distance walked over six minutes as a submaximal measure of functional capacity in individuals post stroke. Walking speed and functional mobility over short distances was assessed using the 10MWT. Impairment level was assessed in participants meeting endurance and speed requirements using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Lower Extremity Fugl Meyer (LE-FM). The MAS measured spasticity and each item was scored from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (severe impairment), while the LE-FM evaluated sensorimotor impairment, and with each item scored from 0 (severe impairment) to 2 (no impairment). Total MAS and LE-FM scores pertaining to the ankle joint were used to analyze the relationship to ankle impedance. The Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spastic Reflexes (SCATS) was collected as an additional measure of impairments for participants, but was not included in impedance analysis. All metrics were performed by the same licensed physical therapist.</p>

                  <title>Data collection</title>
                  <p id="Par37">Data for participants with chronic stroke were collected at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, while age-range-matched older adults were collected at University of Michigan, therefore minor differences in protocol arise based on locational resources. All participants (9 chronic stroke, 3 older adults) walked across the walkway at a pace of 55–60 steps/min. To ensure step frequency consistency between trials, participants were asked to match the frequency of a metronome, and were given time to familiarize themselves with the task prior to data collection. Foot placement on the Perturberator Robot was monitored throughout the experiment, and the starting position of each participant was adjusted to ensure the ankle and Perturberator Robot’s centers of rotation aligned. Ankle angle was measured using electrogoniometers (ADInstruments, Inc. Sydney, AU) affixed to each ankle of chronic stroke participants, while ankle angle was measured using motion capture (model: Miqus M3, Qualisys AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) for older adult participants. GRFs during walking were measured using the force platform embedded in the Perturberator Robot. Electromyography (EMG) (Delsys, Natick, MA, USA) was collected from the tibialus anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), semitendinosus (ST), and rectus femoris (RF) muscles of each leg under study (paretic and non-paretic limbs of chronic stroke participants). For older adults, EMG data were collected from the TA, MG, and Soleus muscles of the dominant limb. Each electrode site was cleaned with alcohol to facilitate electrode adherence and conduction of EMG signals. Electrodes were placed on the muscle belly parallel to the muscle fibers. All data were collected using 16-bit data acquisition systems (model: USB-6218/USB 2553, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) sampled at 1–2 kHz. As participants walked across the Perturberator Robot, a perturbation was randomly triggered with 50% probability. The Perturberator detected initial contact when the GRF passed the 50 N threshold. During trials that contained a perturbation, a delay timer was set based on walking speed for each time point to ensure the perturbation occurred at the desired location in stance phase. Specifically, ramp-and-hold perturbations occurred at approximately 30%, 50%, 70% or 85% of stance phase for chronic stroke participants, and at 30%, 45%, 65%, 85% of stance for older adults. For chronic stroke participants, 100 perturbation trials were collected for each timing point, and 30 perturbation trials were collected for older adults at each timing point. Perturbations were 2° (0.035 rad) in magnitude; however, it is noted that due to increased ankle stiffness and/or motion of the mid-foot, a 2° perturbation of the robot may not translate to a full 2° perturbation of the ankle joint. Finally, to mitigate slippage and prevent falls throughout the experiment, individuals post-stroke wore a safety harness secured to an overhead gantry system and treaded hospital socks (Medichoice, Mechanicsville, VA, USA).</p>

Then a 200 ms moving average filter was applied to the rectified EMG. EMG data for each muscle were divided into steps and normalized to the average peak EMG across non-perturbed steps.

A co-contraction index (CCI) was then determined for muscles spanning the ankle each participant at each timing point (30%, 50%, 70%, 85% of stance) using this averaged EMG data.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

When the foot is flat on the ground during at the end of loading response (early stance), during mid-stance phase, and during terminal stance prior to heel off, the anterior–posterior distance from the COP at heel contact to the ankle frame was subtracted from COP data. During late terminal stance, as the heel rises, the mid-foot deforms and a more complex transformation is required.

                  <p id="Par43">Due to the heterogeneous nature of steps in the chronic stroke population, data were converted to a phase based representation of stance, such that key features of stance phase align across trials. For each limb (paretic, non-paretic and older adult), perturbation trials were separated from non-perturbation trials, then further segmented into the four perturbation timing points of interest (30%, 50%, 70% and 85% stance phase or 30%, 45%, 65% and 85%, respectively). For older adults, segmented data were bootstrapped in accordance with previously published methods for estimating impedance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> to provide an estimate of variability. The initial trial in each bootstrap was selected at random, and a probability algorithm selected additional trials such that temporally-similar trials were selected with higher probability until 60% of trials for a specific time point. This method was used to account for slight differences in timing of perturbations at each time point. Offset was removed such that both torque and angle begin with zero. Bootstrapped ankle angle and torque arising naturally during walking (non-perturbed trials) were subtracted from perturbation trials in order to isolate the perturbation response, then trimmed to 100 ms windows beginning at the onset of perturbation.</p>

Thus, previous methods were modified to address the heterogeneous nature of post-stroke kinematic and kinetic data.

For each perturbation trial, the perturbation was isolated by subtracting the average ankle angle and torque arising naturally during walking from the fifty non-perturbed trials that most resembled that perturbation trial.

Three repeated measures analysis of variances (ANOVA) were performed in which stiffness, damping and inertia were dependent variables. Timing point (30%, 50%, 70% and 85% of stance phase) and limb (paretic and non-paretic) were treated as fixed factors, and subject was treated as a random factor. The interaction between timing point and limb was examined. A significance level of α = 0.05 was set a priori; Bonferroni corrections were applied for multiple comparisons. Data from gait-speed matched older adults and young adults walking at a faster speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> were included for reference, but statistical comparisons with the stroke population were not conducted.</p>

ΔStiffness scores were calculated for each participant and linearly regressed on each clinical measure (6MWT, 10MWT, LEFM, MAS). For each limb, stiffness as a function of percent stance phase was determined using an interpolation. A ΔStiffness score was then defined as the average absolute difference in stiffness between the paretic and non-paretic limbs across the stance phase.

                  <p id="Par48">Impedance impairment post-stroke varied throughout stance phase such that in some portions of stance the paretic limb exhibited increased impedance, while in others stiffness and damping were reduced. The absolute change was selected to capture overall difference from the non-paretic limb. For comparisons that yielded a significant relationship between overall difference in an impedance parameter and a clinical metric, a more detailed analysis was conducted at each timing point separately. In these cases, the signed difference in stiffness between paretic and non-paretic limbs was linearly regressed on clinical measures.</p>
