                  <title>Study Design and Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial among adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory symptoms for &lt; 14 days. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive one unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (n = 487) or placebo (n = 473). The primary outcome was clinical status (disease severity) 14 days following study infusion measured with a seven-category ordinal scale ranging from discharged from the hospital with resumption of normal activities (lowest score) to death (highest score). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable ordinal regression model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) &lt; 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with convalescent plasma than with placebo. In secondary analyses, trial participants were stratified according to the presence of endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (“serostatus”) at randomization. The trial included 13 secondary efficacy outcomes, including 28-day mortality.</p>

                  <p>Among 974 randomized patients, 960 were included in the primary analysis. Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not differ between the convalescent plasma and placebo groups in the overall population (aOR, 1.04; one-seventh support interval [1/7 SI], 0.82-1.33), in patients without endogenous antibodies (aOR, 1.15; 1/7 SI, 0.74-1.80), or in patients with endogenous antibodies (aOR, 0.96; 1/7 SI, 0.72-1.30). None of the 13 secondary efficacy outcomes were different between groups. At 28 days, 89 of 482 (18.5%) patients in the convalescent plasma group and 80 of 465 (17.2%) patients in the placebo group had died (aOR, 1.04; 1/7 SI, 0.69-1.58).</p>

            <p id="p0040">The reasons why prior trials failed to show benefit for convalescent plasma among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are not conclusively known. If COVID-19 convalescent plasma is beneficial for some patients hospitalized with COVID-19, two potential explanations that may have contributed to null findings in prior trials include: (1) wide variability in the quality (neutralizing activity) of the convalescent plasma used; and (2) inclusion of patients who had already established their own immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Only convalescent plasma with neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies would be expected to potentially have efficacy. Most prior COVID-19 convalescent plasma trials used antibody-binding assays to select plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> However the presence of antibodies does not guarantee neutralizing activity,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and most trials did not confirm neutralizing activity of the transfused convalescent plasma.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Furthermore, although passive immunity therapies are most likely to be efficacious among patients without an endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, many patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have an endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 response by the time of hospital admission,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and many COVID-19 convalescent plasma trials did not evaluate for efficacy in a population restricted to those without endogenous antibodies.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>

<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Therefore, this trial, Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation (PassITON), was conducted to test the hypothesis that COVID-19 convalescent plasma with laboratory-confirmed anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity improves clinical outcomes when administered to adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and to provide separate efficacy estimates for patients who did and did not have endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to treatment.</p>

With initiation of the multicenter component of the trial, neutralization testing was added to the plasma selection process such that selected plasma units showed neutralizing function, defined as a half-maximal neutralization titer ≥ 50 (NT<sub>50</sub> ≥ 50) using a replication-competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Methods Section C</xref>).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>

                <p id="p0120">On June 1, 2021, a fourth interim analysis was completed, at which time 974 (97.4%) patients of the prespecified sample size of 1,000 patients had been enrolled. This interim analysis was called due to increasing COVID-19 vaccination rates in the United States. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended halting further enrollment in the trial based on a probability &gt; 0.999 that the trial would not demonstrate efficacy if it continued to the planned sample size (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Methods Section F</xref>).</p>

). In the seronegative population, 28-day mortality was not different between the convalescent plasma group (35 of 143 [24.5%]) and the placebo group (29 of 136 [21.3%]) (aOR, 1.12; 1/7 SI, 0.56-2.23). In the seropositive population, 28-day mortality was not different between the convalescent plasma group (52 of 330 [15.8%]) and the placebo group (50 of 319 [15.7%]) (aOR, 1.00; 1/7 SI, 0.58-1.72). No heterogeneity of treatment effect was identified for 28-day mortality (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">e-Figs 7-9</xref>).<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Survival and hospital discharge through 28 days after study infusion by treatment group assignment (COVID-19 convalescent plasma vs placebo) for the full trial population (N = 960), the seronegative population at baseline (serum anti-receptor binding domain [RBD] IgG concentration ≤ 3 World Health Organization EU/mL prior to study infusion; n = 283), and the seropositive population at baseline (serum anti-RBD IgG concentration &gt; 3 World Health Organization EU/mL prior to study infusion; n = 657). In each plot, the convalescent plasma group is represented by blue lines and the placebo group by red lines. The top set of lines are Kaplan-Meier survival plots. The bottom set of lines denote the proportion of participants alive and discharged from the hospital. Patient disposition is represented by the three locations within the plot area: dead, represented by the area above the survival lines; alive and still in the hospital, represented by the area between the survival and discharge lines; and discharged from the hospital alive, represented by the area under the discharge lines. The proportion in each disposition state is denoted by the relative height of the region for each day. On study day 1, the vast majority of participants were alive and in the hospital (middle region). Over time, the proportion of participants in the alive and discharged state (lower region) and dead state (upper region) increases, which gives rise to the “funnel” shape of the plot. Participants could move from either in-hospital or discharged states to the dead state. Patients were followed up via medical records and telephone follow-up until 28 days following study infusion. Patients lost to follow-up were included in the risk-set for the portion of days for which disposition was known. A patient was considered discharged from the hospital once discharged from the index hospitalization; re-hospitalizations were not considered in this analysis. In model-based estimates of treatment effect, there was no difference in time-to-death through 28 days between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group for the full trial population (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.20; one-seventh SI [1/7 SI], 0.88-1.64), the seronegative population (aHR, 1.19; 1/7 SI, 0.71-1.99), or the seropositive population (aHR: 1.17; 1/7 SI, 0.78-1.76). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in a model of time to hospital discharge through 28 days between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the full trial population (aHR, 1.00; 1/7 SI, 0.86-1.16), the seronegative population (aHR, 0.94; 1/7 SI, 0.71-1.25), or the seropositive population (aHR, 1.05; 1/7 SI, 0.88-1.26).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3_lrg"/></fig></p>

              <p id="p0165">In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States, treatment with COVID-19 convalescent plasma showed no signs of clinical efficacy. Point estimates for both the clinical status ordinal scale outcome and mortality all favored placebo over convalescent plasma for both the full population and the subgroup of patients seronegative for endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies prior to study infusion.</p>
              <p id="p0170">This trial included several strengths that add to the literature on COVID-19 convalescent plasma and address some of the critiques of prior convalescent plasma trials.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The trial design included a placebo group, which received a crystalloid solution rather than plasma without anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and blinded study procedures to optimize internal validity. Furthermore, convalescent plasma used in the trial was selected based on the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with neutralizing activity, whereas most prior trials used convalescent plasma selected based on binding antibody titers only without laboratory confirmation of neutralizing activity.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Laboratory confirmation of neutralizing activity is an important step if the goal is to ensure every convalescent plasma unit has neutralizing function because some convalescent plasma with high binding titers does not have neutralizing function.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Unlike some prior observational studies,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and similar to prior randomized trials,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> results of the current trial did not suggest that convalescent plasma with higher antibody concentrations (within the range of concentrations used in this trial) was more likely to be beneficial. Null results in this trial, including no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect by neutralization activity in the transfused plasma units, suggest that treatment even with the most carefully selected plasma with neutralizing function is unlikely to improve clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="p0175">This trial also characterized patients’ endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status prior to study infusion. Approximately one-third of the trial population had no endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline (&lt; 3.0 WHO EU/mL) and approximately three-quarters of the population had endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies below the concentration correlated with neutralizing function (&lt; 256 WHO EU/mL); treatment with convalescent plasma did not show any signs of clinical efficacy in populations limited to patients with no or low levels of endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This finding suggests that treatment with convalescent plasma is unlikely to be efficacious even with high-quality neutralizing convalescent plasma among patients with a limited endogenous immune response against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

              <p id="p0185">The current study had certain limitations. First, prior vaccination against COVID-19 was an exclusion for both plasma donation and trial participation. Trial results may not be directly generalizable to vaccinated populations. Second, the volume of convalescent plasma used in this trial was one unit (200-399 mL); some prior trials and clinical protocols used larger volumes of convalescent plasma. Third, the convalescent plasma used in this trial was mostly collected from donors in Tennessee, while recipients were geographically dispersed across the United States. Some have theorized that collecting convalescent plasma from people in geographic proximity to those who will receive it could increase efficacy.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Fourth, this trial started as a single-center trial before expanding to a multicenter national trial; participants enrolled in the single-center component of the trial were included in the overall analysis. Methods for selecting convalescent plasma units were optimized during the early, single-center trial period and then standardized for the multicenter component of the trial. During the single-center component of the trial, 50 participants (representing 10.3% of participants randomized to the convalescent plasma group) were treated with plasma units that did not exhibit neutralizing function above the threshold ultimately chosen to select plasma for the remainder of the trial. A post hoc sensitivity analysis that excluded these patients showed no substantive differences in trial results. Fifth, median duration of COVID-19 symptoms prior to randomization in this trial was 8 days. Although analyses evaluating for heterogeneity of treatment effect did not suggest that patients with shorter duration of symptoms benefited more from convalescent plasma than those with longer duration of symptoms, this trial did not rule out the possibility of benefit for patients treated shortly following symptom onset. Sixth, SARS-CoV-2 variants were not determined in this trial; enrollment occurred during periods of predominant circulation by the original wild-type virus and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant in the United States.</p>

              <p id="p0190">Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma did not lead to improvement in clinical status at day 14. These results do not support the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
