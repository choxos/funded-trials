                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Facility HIV self-testing (HIVST) within outpatient departments can increase HIV testing coverage by facilitating HIVST use in outpatient waiting spaces while clients wait for routine care. Facility HIVST allows for the majority of outpatients to test with minimal health care worker time requirements. However, barriers and facilitators to outpatients’ use of facility HIVST are still unknown.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">As part of a cluster randomized trial on facility HIVST in Malawi, we conducted in-depth interviews with 57 adult outpatients (<underline>&gt;</underline> 15 years) who were exposed to the HIVST intervention and collected observational journals that documented study staff observations from facility waiting spaces where HIVST was implemented. Translated and transcribed data were analyzed using constant comparison analysis in Atlas.ti.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Facility HIVST was convenient, fast, and provided autonomy to outpatients. The strategy also had novel facilitators for testing, such as increased motivation to test due to seeing others test, immediate support for HIVST use, and easy access to additional HIV services in the health facility. Barriers to facility HIVST included fear of judgment from others and unwanted status disclosure due to lack of privacy. Desired changes to the intervention included private, separate spaces for kit use and interpretation and increased opportunity for disclosure and post-test counseling.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">Facility HIVST was largely acceptable to outpatients in Malawi with novel facilitators that are unique to facility HIVST in OPD waiting spaces.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par6">In 2019, there were 20.7 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, more than 25% of adults in the region still do not know their serostatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Malawi, only 42% of the adult population tested for HIV within the past 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], with 35% of men having never tested for HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, there are an estimated 33,000 new HIV infections in Malawi per year requiring diagnosis and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Facility-based provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) remains the primary strategy for testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], although it continues to have limited reach in busy outpatient settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">HIV self-testing (HIVST) can improve PITC among outpatients in high-burden settings (i.e., facility HIVST) and studies have shown that HIVST is highly acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We previously conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) and found that facility HIVST can increase testing among adult outpatients by 200% compared to standard PITC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is cost-effective in routine settings by capitalizing on the existing health infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although there is insufficient data on barriers and facilitators for facility HIVST implementation, there is extensive literature on community HIVST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Known facilitators for community HIVST include increased privacy, perceived autonomy and confidentiality of test results, perceived convenience, and minimal time required to test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These benefits are believed to largely remove demand-side barriers to traditional testing strategies, including travel time and cost, fear of unwanted disclosure, and long clinic wait times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Reported barriers are few and include doubts or misconceptions about the accuracy of HIVST kits and individuals’ ability to use and interpret HIVST kits unsupervised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The above-mentioned barriers and facilitators may differ for facility HIVST since this strategy reduces the privacy as compared to community HIVST (testing at the facility is often done in public areas such as waiting spaces), but may also provide immediate linkage and prevention services. Given this gap in evidence, we analyzed qualitative data collected as part of a parent facility HIVST trial to examine adult perceptions of HIVST in outpatient departments, and understand what components of facility HIVST strategies are crucial for intervention scale-up.</p>

                <title>Design and setting</title>
                <p id="Par9">Our parent cluster-randomized trial aimed to assess the impact of facility HIVST among adults attending outpatient departments (OPD) in Malawi. Outpatient departments are the primary entry point to most service delivery strategies in Malawi and offer a range of services from acute care for injuries and general illness to treatment for sexually transmitted infections. The parent trial compared the impact of facility HIVST against standard PITC and optimized PITC, whereby additional training and job aids were given to health workers, and morning HIV testing was offered to all outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the study (a full description is published elsewhere) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 15 facilities were cluster randomized 1:1:1 to three arms: (1) standard PITC, (2) optimized PITC, and (3) facility HIVST whereby OraQuick ADVANCE HIV I/II self-testing kits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were distributed during adult outpatient services in waiting spaces. In this paper, we include data from the facility HIVST arm that was implemented in 5 randomly selected facilities including a district hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 1); rural hospital (n = 1), non-profit hospital (<italic>n</italic> = 1); and health center (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Eligibility criteria for participation in the parent study included: <underline>&gt;</underline> 15 years of age and having received outpatient services on the day of recruitment.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par10">Facility HIVST included three overarching components: (1) HIVST demonstration and distribution; (2) HIVST use and interpretation; and (3) post-test services and counseling (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A 10-min health talk about the importance of HIV testing and a 15-min demonstration on HIVST kits, followed by kit distribution, was conducted in outpatient waiting spaces. HIVST was offered one-on-one in order to create a true opt-out service; however, distribution was in open waiting spaces – private rooms were not used for demonstration and distribution activities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overarching components of the intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2021_12213_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par11">Outpatients took and used the kit in the OPD waiting space prior to receiving routine outpatient services. HIVST users were strongly encouraged to <italic>not</italic> look at their HIVST result in the public waiting space. For privacy in the waiting space, HIVST kits were stored in an opaque bag for processing. Private spaces (rooms or kiosks near the OPD) were provided for HIVST interpretation prior to receiving routine outpatient services. Trained study staff were available to provide assistance with HIVST use as needed. Finally, post-test counselling and referral to additional HIV services were available upon request – outpatients were not asked HIVST results by study staff. Outpatient HCWs were encouraged to ask about HIVST test results, but disclosure was not mandatory.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p id="Par12">For the parent trial, exit surveys were conducted with a 5885 sample of outpatients. In the HIVST arm, 2097 surveys were completed and provided the sampling frame for our current sub-study. Two forms of qualitative data are included in the current sub-study: in-depth interviews with outpatients (<italic>n</italic> = 57) and observation journals collected by research assistants who observed OPD waiting spaces in participating facilities (81 typed pages from 38 observation days).</p>
                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>In-depth interviews</title>
                  <p id="Par13">Participants in the parent trial were randomly selected for an in-depth interview using an electronic randomization tool. Eligibility criteria for the additional in-depth interviews included: 1) <underline>&gt;</underline> 15 years of age; 2) received outpatient services on the day of recruitment; 3) enrolled in the larger trial; and 4) exposed to the facility HIVST intervention (defined as heard of HIVST while at the health facility that same day). All respondents provided oral informed consent prior to data collection.

                  <p id="Par15">Observational journals were collected by research assistants during the parent intervention. Observational journals are a form of local ethnography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] whereby research assistants observed facility waiting spaces where HIVST kits were distributed and used. At the end of each day, research assistants wrote what they observed, recalling as much detail as possible about the content and context of client and client-provider interactions. Observational journals are well suited to capture practices within a health institution, documenting what people say and how they interact with others, which can be different from what they report in traditional research settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While journals cannot capture all events within one setting, they provide an important overview of common interactions and conversations within routine settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par16">Research assistants made observations and described the content and context of interactions within OPD waiting spaces over 38 days (resulting in over 81 typed pages of observational journals). Researchers were instructed to document interactions on the following topics: (1) distribution of HIVST; (2) conversations between clients regarding HIVST; (3) potential or observed unwanted disclosure, including others asking about one’s test result; and (4) discussed or observed concerns regarding facility HIVST. Two of the five facilities were excluded from analysis due to research staff shortages and incomplete data.</p>

(Female, HIVST User, Rural Hospital)</italic></p></disp-quote>Journals also recorded a handful of instances where outpatients were afraid that others would make educated guesses or assumptions about their HIV status based on body language or facial expressions after leaving spaces for interpretation of results. Limited available private space in clinics meant that most facilities relied on standing booths for private spaces to interpret HIVST results. While the booths themselves were private, located either in OPD waiting spaces against a wall so no one could see the interpretation space or outside the waiting space, others in the waiting space could see individuals walking to or from the interpretation booths, prompting onlookers to make assumptions about one’s HIV status. One journal reported:<disp-quote><p id="Par43"><italic>‘We [OPD clients] are chatting and smiling each other here because I know nothing about my status. But once I read my [HIVST result], my face will change [when I leave the booth]. I can even cry here...

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par55">Facility HIVST was highly acceptable to both female and male adult outpatients in Malawi. Facility HIVST retained some of the most important benefits of traditional HIVST identified throughout the literature – HIVST was still seen as easy to use, convenient, required minimal time, and provided confidential results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], although there were some concerns about privacy of distribution and use. We found that the group-style distribution of HIVST also resulted in additional facilitators to HIV testing usually not associated with HIVST, such as increased motivation to test due to seeing others test, being able to directly communicate with others about HIVST, and receiving immediate support from facility staff.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Many respondents in our study described being motivated by seeing other people test. The visible distribution of kits in waiting spaces helped to create a critical mass of outpatients testing, normalizing testing behavior in this particular setting. Similar arguments have been made for HIVST in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and other stigmatized services that benefit from opt-out strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, frequent and highly motivating health talks and HIVST demonstrations in OPD are likely required in order to create excitement for HIVST and achieve a high coverage.</p>
              <p id="Par57">While group distribution acted as a facilitator for many respondents, it also served as a barrier for others. For some, group distribution discouraged testing because they believed other outpatients would see them test and judge them, making assumptions about their sexual risk behavior and HIV status. Similar findings have been reported in other studies, noting that private testing areas are essential in order to avoid stigma associated with taking up HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A handful of respondents were also concerned that using HIVST in waiting spaces would lead to potential coercion or unwanted status disclosure to other outpatients. Private spaces for HIVST distribution and use would mitigate these concerns, however, infrastructure constraints remain a major concern for local health facilities and may not be addressed without extensive investment.</p>
              <p id="Par58">We found that nearly half of respondents reported talking with other outpatients about how to use HIVST and about HIV more broadly. Even with a HIVST demonstration, some outpatients were still unclear on exactly how to use the kit and found other outpatients helpful in guiding them through the process. Other HIVST interventions vary in levels of support provided, with some offering assisted HIVST use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and others, such as secondary distribution of HIVST, offering no additional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. HIVST interventions should maximize opportunities to support correct HIVST use to ensure optimal testing. Our study shows opportunities for support do not have to be exclusively from HCWs – other community members who have seen HIVST demonstrations may be able and willing to provide support.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Nearly all respondents believed they had little opportunity to disclose HIVST result to HCWs in OPD settings, largely because HCWs did not directly ask respondents about their results (disclosure was completely opt-in) and outpatients were not comfortable initiating the conversation. As a result, HCWs rarely offered post-test counseling, which was highly desired by respondents in the study, regardless of their HIVST result. Other studies find that disclosure is highest when individuals believe they will receive support from HCWs, and lowest when they expect blame and discrimination from HCWs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Future HIVST interventions should foster a welcoming environment where HCWs actively ask about HIVST results and provide a safe space for post-test counseling.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Even though very few respondents disclosed their HIVST result to a HCW at OPD, many perceived the ability to immediately self-initiate connection (link) to additional HIV services at that same health facility as a major benefit to facility HIVST. Our parent trial on facility HIVST found that 79% of those who tested HIV-positive with HIVST initiated ART within 3-months, but only 7% disclosed their HIV-positive status to a HCW in OPD department. The vast majority went directly to the ART department within that same facility to link themselves to HIV care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The fact that many HIVST users self-referred to the ART clinic for immediate treatment initiation may reflect a continued autonomy and ownership over one’s own health care that is promoted through self-testing. Further, situating HIVST strategies within OPD, which is on the same campus as ART services, may facilitate linkage as logistical barriers to initiation are already overcome, since individuals are already at the facility for acute or routine care. Other HIVST interventions within community settings report lower rates of linkage and ART initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Future HIVST interventions should consider additional strategies to further reduce gaps to linkage to HIV treatment services.</p>
              <p id="Par61">This study has several limitations that should be noted. Facility HIVST was implemented by high-level research assistants with secondary school education. In routine care, similar interventions would likely be implemented by lower-level HCWs with multiple responsibilities, therefore, routine implementation may not see the same benefits. Second, there is always risk of social desirability bias in reporting acceptability of an intervention; however, qualitative researchers were not involved in implementation of HIVST, potentially minimizing any social desirability bias. Third, observational journals are based on events and conversations observed by study staff and cannot capture all events – mundane events may be particularly missed if staff deem them unworthy of documentation. Additional limitations of observational journals are discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, the sample size of HIVST non-users is small, making it difficult to draw conclusions for this specific population. Additional research should be conducted with those in need of HIV testing but refuse HIVST.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par62">Facility HIVST in OPD waiting spaces was acceptable and feasible among adult outpatients in Malawi. Using waiting spaces for HIVST distribution and use, alongside private spaces for kit interpretation, facilitated HIV testing for most respondents. Strategies to promote privacy throughout the HIVST process, to improve disclosure of test results to HCWs, and to strengthen post-test counseling are important areas for future research.</p>
