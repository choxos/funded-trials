                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Men who have sex with men (MSM) are one of the most at-risk group for contracting HIV in the USA. However, the HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately. Latino MSM comprise 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between the ages of 13 and 29 years. The daily medication tenofovir/emtricitabine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing HIV acquisition.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Through extensive formative research, this study uses a pilot randomised controlled trial design and will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a patient navigation intervention designed to address multiple barriers to improve engagement in the PrEP continuum among 60 Latino MSM between the ages of 18 and 29 years. The patient navigation intervention will be compared with usual care plus written information to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods and the intervention’s potential in improving PrEP continuum behaviours. The results will be reviewed for preparation for a future full-scale efficacy trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Reducing the number of new HIV infections is one of the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and an objective of <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic>.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Men who have sex with men (MSM) are one of the most at-risk group for contracting HIV in the USA, comprising 67% of new diagnoses in 2016.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is estimated that 24.7% of sexually active MSM are at substantial risk for acquiring HIV.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately, with Latino MSM comprising 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between 13 and 29 years of age.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Recent modelling studies suggest that one out of four Latino MSM will be diagnosed with HIV within their lives, underscoring the vulnerability of Latino MSM to HIV infection.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a biomedical tool to reduce risk of HIV infection, has shown strong efficacy. When taken consistently, PrEP can reduce new incidence of HIV by up to 99%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Despite the promise of PrEP to transform HIV prevention, there remain significant barriers to PrEP use among those who would benefit most, including low awareness, low knowledge, medical mistrust, perceived high cost, lack of access, language barriers, low health literacy, cultural conceptions of masculinity and stigma.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–12</xref> In a 2016 study conducted among 600 MSM between the ages of 18 and 29 years in Southern California, Latino MSM reported the lowest levels of PrEP use at 6.6%, compared with 9.8% and 13.9% for black and white participants, respectively.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although Latino MSM reported the lowest use of PrEP, they also reported the greatest willingness to use PrEP compared with white and black MSM. This discrepancy in willingness versus PrEP utilisation among Latino MSM emphasises the need to intervene to address barriers among this population.</p>
              <p>There are a number of different steps that individuals must take to initiate, adhere to and persist in taking PrEP. Individuals must be aware of their HIV risk and eligibility for PrEP, be interested in taking PrEP, be linked to PrEP-related care, initiate PrEP-related care, be retained in PrEP-related care and maintain adherence to PrEP, with each step in this continuum of care associated with unique barriers.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> One approach that has been used to address multiple barriers to adhering to recommended healthcare is patient navigation (PN). Patient navigators work with the individual patient, the patient’s significant others, the healthcare system and community services to reduce delays and improve adherence in healthcare. PN has facilitated access to healthcare among other Latino populations,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> and peer PN may be an ideal intervention to aid in PrEP uptake among Latino MSM by assisting individuals in overcoming barriers to PrEP-related care. Thus, our research team has developed a peer PN intervention. To our knowledge, no known PN programmes for PrEP have been developed or pilot tested specifically for Latino MSM. This paper describes the design of a study to test a recently developed PN intervention to increase engagement in the PrEP continuum among Latino MSM.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>Using a randomised controlled trial design, a pilot test of the PN intervention will be conducted in collaboration with the Family Health Centers of San Diego (FHCSD), a federally qualified health centre.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Bilingual research assistants will recruit 60 young adult Latino MSM at-risk for HIV in San Diego County, California; this sample size is well within the bounds of recommendations for pilot trials.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> After a research assistant obtains informed consent, participants will complete baseline surveys and the research assistant will individually randomise each participant to one of two conditions: usual care plus written information (UC) or PN. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up, participants will be asked to complete surveys. Individuals randomised to PN will also be asked to participate in a key informant interview at 6 months. Participants’ electronic health records (EHRs) will be reviewed at 6-month follow-up to assess their engagement in the PrEP continuum. The study methods and PN intervention will be reviewed for feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary impact of the PN intervention in preparation for a future full-scale efficacy trial. In addition, the pilot test will evaluate preliminary impact on seven PrEP continuum-related primary outcomes (i.e., scheduled and attended PrEP consultation; PrEP prescription received; PrEP prescription filled; PrEP initiated; self-reported PrEP adherence; and PrEP follow-up medical appointment attended). Analyses will be performed under the intent-to-treat principle. Participants will be compensated with a $50 gift card to an online retailer at each of the three assessment time points (baseline, 3-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1 SP2 SP3">online supplemental appendices 1-3</xref> for informed consents and WHO Trial Registration Data Set).</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>As suggested by intervention mapping, a participatory planning group (PPG) of programme stakeholders guided the design of the PN intervention. The PPG includes a consultant and HIV expert, potential programme implementers, young Latino MSM and community members who interact with or deliver services to people who may benefit from the intervention. The PPG was instrumental in helping us develop the intervention materials and recruitment approaches. This group will continue to meet on an as-needed basis (with compensation for their time) and will assist with dissemination of research findings both in the community and in peer-reviewed publications and presentations.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>The pilot RCT will take place in San Diego County, California. In 2017, San Diego had an estimated population of 3,337,685 people,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> 33.9% of whom identified as Hispanic and 50.3% identified as male. Between 2012 and 2014, it was estimated that 3.9% of San Diego County’s population identified as a sexual minority.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study is being conducted in partnership with FHCSD, which is San Diego’s largest federally qualified health centre, providing care to more than 140,834 patients in 2018. FHCSD delivers comprehensive healthcare in 42 sites throughout San Diego County. Each site provides a wide range of healthcare services to sexual and gender minority patients. Although we are partnering with FHCSD on this study, participants are recruited throughout San Diego County and obtain healthcare in various health systems, centres and practices in the community.</p>

                <title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title>
                <p>The following criteria are required for study inclusion: (1) age 18–29 years; (2) identifies as male; (3) identifies as gay/bisexual or reports having sex with men in past 12 months; (4) identifies as Latino/Hispanic; (5) self-reports being HIV uninfected; (6) resides in San Diego County, California; (7) speaks English or Spanish; (8) is willing and able to provide informed consent; and (9) reports at least one HIV risk factor as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> MSM are at elevated risk for HIV if they report one of the following: (1) an HIV-positive sexual partner; (2) diagnosis of a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) within the past 12 months; (3) engaging in condomless anal sex with a non-monogamous partner in the past 12 months; (4) engaging in commercial sex work in the past 12 months; (5) injection of illicit drugs and sharing of injection equipment in the past 12 months; or (6) engaging in drug treatment for injection drug use in the past 12 months. Individuals will be excluded if they self-report being HIV positive. The intervention is designed to meet the needs of MSM who self-report their gender identity as male, but other gender identities are allowed in the study. If a potential participant indicates that their gender identity is not ‘male’ (e.g., transgender, non-binary and gender fluid), then the participant will be informed that the study was designed for cis-male MSM and will then be invited to determine whether they feel that they will benefit from the study based on their gender identity. Participants who previously were prescribed or are currently taking PrEP will be included in the study. Participants are not required to seek care at FHCSD to be included in the study.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Non-probability (convenience) sampling will be used to recruit participants within the greater San Diego area via a variety of methods, including through FHCSD outreach and HIV/STI testing programmes, a Spanish language Latino MSM support group, gay-friendly events, such as Pride, and flyering local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community centres, gay-identified/friendly coffee shops, gyms and bars. We will also use online recruitment methods, including targeted ads through Facebook and Instagram and the use of geolocation social networking mobile applications tailored to sexual minority men (eg, Grindr, Scruff and Jack’d). Potential participants recruited using flyering or targeted ads will be requested to contact study personnel via email or telephone. A bilingual member of the study team will contact each potential participant via telephone to explain the study and screen for inclusion. The research assistants will be native Spanish speakers who are bilingual in English and Spanish; they will have some university education and research experience. If a potential participant screens positively for the study, an in-person baseline visit will be scheduled, in which the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed in further detail. Reasons for non-participation of potential participants will be documented.</p>

                <title>PN intervention</title>
                <p>Based on extensive formative research and using intervention mapping,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the study team developed, pretested and produced the PN intervention materials. The produced PN intervention includes an introductory module, five educational modules (HIV prevention, PrEP introduction, PrEP efficacy, PrEP side effects and PrEP adherence) and a module focused on decision support. Patient education is facilitated using infographics, palm cards and a decision support tool. The educational modules are designed to be delivered as needed in addition to personalised strategies to improve access and decrease barriers to PrEP initiation and adherence. The intervention also consists of barrier reduction strategies to assist individuals with implementing HIV prevention, including the use of PrEP. Two part-time Spanish–English bilingual peer lay navigators hired by FHCSD will provide the PN intervention during the study. Navigators were hired based on their familiarity, as well as cultural and linguistic competence, with the intended audience, young Latino MSM. The study team will train the patient navigators using training manuals developed in formative research and via the Patient Navigation Research Program training approach.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
                <p>Following patient randomisation, the research coordinator will notify the patient navigators regarding the patient’s assignment to PN. A patient navigator will contact the participant to schedule the first in-person meeting at a time and location of the participant’s convenience. The navigators will provide services to patients using PN intervention manuals and materials the team has developed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for examples of PN services provided at each level of PrEP continuum). Services will generally focus on: (1) overcoming community, health system, interpersonal and individual barriers to accessing PrEP-related healthcare; (2) increasing each patient’s knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy for initiating and adhering to PrEP; (3) improving communication between the patient and healthcare team through appointment scheduling and reminders; and (4) sexual risk reduction counselling. PNs do not meet participants at their homes but at any safe location to conduct the intervention (e.g., private rooms in a library, clinic or community outreach centre). Meeting locations are coordinated between the participants and the PNs. PNs communicate with participants via text, phone call and videoconferencing based on the participant’s preference.</p>

                <p>Measures were chosen following a literature review of existing validated instruments and psychometrically validated instruments were chosen when possible. However, as PrEP was only recently recommended for the prevention of HIV, there are few validated surveys measuring constructs related to PrEP. For these constructs, the team created new measures, adapting from existing scales when possible. Surveys not available in Spanish were translated using a dual panel approach.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref></p>

                <p>At baseline and 3-month follow-up, all participants will be asked if they have obtained a prescription for PrEP. Those who indicate that they have been prescribed PrEP and have taken at least one pill will be asked to track their PrEP adherence via a MEMS device.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A MEMS device is a standard prescription bottle that includes a larger lid containing a MEMS monitoring cap. During the baseline or at a 3-month follow-up visit, the research coordinator will give participants a MEMS device with instructions for its use. Participants will be instructed to place all PrEP pills into a MEMS container so when a pill is removed, the device will record date and time of removal of the medication dose using a small microcircuit. A medication ‘event’ is removal of bottle closure, followed by replacement of closure. A study staff member will collect MEMS devices from participants in-person at the 3-month and/or 6-month follow-up and connect them to a MEMS Reader, which transfers data to a secured server via a secured web platform. Timing adherence will be calculated as percentage of time each participant took PrEP as prescribed by determining number of doses of PrEP taken at 24-hour intervals for a once daily PrEP regimen and dividing it by number of days adherence was monitored with MEMS.</p>

                <p>All quantitative data will be summarised descriptively to determine aspects of the PN intervention that worked well and potential areas of improvement of the PN intervention. Our biostatistician will be blinded to intervention assignment for participants and will conduct statistical analyses using SAS V.9.4.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Univariate statistics will be conducted for outcomes measured at baseline and 6-month follow-up to describe sample characteristics between the two groups (UC vs PN). Attrition in the two groups will be compared. Characteristics of individuals with missing values and individuals with no missing values will be studied. Multiple imputation technique will be implemented and sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess if missing data is at random. Assumptions of statistical tests will be evaluated. For assessing preliminary impact, the primary outcomes are seven behaviours associated with the PrEP care continuum (i.e., appointment scheduled for PrEP consultation; appointment attended for PrEP consultation; PrEP prescription received; PrEP prescription filled; PrEP initiated; self-reported PrEP adherence over the past 7 days; and PrEP follow-up medical appointment attended).</p>
                <p>To test the preliminary impact of the intervention, a series of logistic regression models will be conducted, with each of the six binary PrEP continuum primary outcome variables set as a criterion: (1) appointment scheduled for PrEP consultation; (2) appointment attended for PrEP consultation; (3) PrEP prescription received; (4) PrEP prescription filled; (5) PrEP initiated; and (6) PrEP follow-up medical appointment attended. In addition, we hypothesise that receipt of the PN intervention will be associated with increased self-reported PrEP adherence over the past 7 days (also a primary outcome variable). To test the preliminary impact on the two measures of self-reported PrEP adherence, we will conduct two linear regression analyses with intervention group assignment entered as the independent variable and each measure of PrEP adherence entered as the dependent variable. Potential demographic variables (e.g., age) will be assessed for inclusion in the models as well. Finally, linear mixed models will be conducted to examine changes in: (1) barriers to PrEP-related care; (2) PrEP knowledge, (3) PrEP efficacy beliefs; (4) medication beliefs; (5) PrEP attitudes; and (6) medication self-efficacy. Linear mixed models allow us to account for the dependence of the repeated measures. Different covariance structures will be implemented, and the information criterion such as AIC or BIC will be used for model selection. We hypothesise that participants randomised to PN will have greater engagement in PrEP continuum behaviours compared with participants randomised to UC. Since data analyses are exploratory, and there is not adequate statistical power to evaluate efficacy of the PN intervention, these tests can only provide information regarding data trends and effect sizes. If the study and PN intervention methods are found to be feasible and acceptable, a larger study with adequate statistical power will be conducted to appropriately evaluate the efficacy of the PN intervention.</p>

              <p>Young adult Latino MSM are disproportionately at risk for HIV infection.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> PrEP has the potential to yield substantial benefits in reducing HIV incidence among vulnerable populations, yet Latino MSM are one of the least likely at-risk groups to use PrEP.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 37</xref> The study described in this paper has the potential to begin to address this ethnic health disparity by pilot testing a peer PN intervention specifically adapted for young adult Latino MSM. Study findings will indicate if, and what types of, revisions should be made to the PN intervention. Potential study limitations include the lack of generalisability to other populations at risk for HIV, the lack of data collection from other community stakeholders, the need for potential participants to be proactive to participate in the study, the lack of concealment of randomisation block size and the potential for loss to follow-up. Results from this pilot trial will inform the design of a subsequent large-scale RCT that will be designed to fully test the efficacy of the PN intervention in impacting key gaps in the PrEP continuum, including adherence to PrEP after initiation and long-term retention in PrEP-related care. If subsequently found to be efficacious, this culturally tailored PN PrEP intervention has the potential to be scaled-up throughout federally qualified health centres across the country, which may decrease ethnic disparities seen in HIV.</p>
