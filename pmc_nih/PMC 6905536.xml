                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Because tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) leads to significantly lower plasma tenofovir concentrations than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and is a stronger substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) than TDF, TAF could lead to decreased central nervous system (CNS) tenofovir exposure than TDF. We aimed to determine if switching from TDF to TAF increases the risk of neuronal injury, by quantifying plasma levels of neurofilament light protein (NfL), a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in HIV CNS infection.</p>

                  <p>Plasma NfL concentration was measured at baseline, week 24, and week 84 in stored plasma samples from 416 participants (272 switching to elvitegravir (E)/cobicistat (C)/emtricitabine (F)/TAF and 144 continuing E/C/F/TDF) enrolled in the randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority Gilead GS-US-292-0109 trial.</p>

                  <p>While plasma NfL levels in both groups were within the normal range, we found a small but significant decrease in the E/C/F/TAF arm after 84 weeks from a geometric mean of 9.3 to 8.8 pg/mL (5.4% decline, 95% CI 2.0–8.4, p = 0.002). This change was significantly different (p = 0.001) from that of the E/C/F/TDF arm, in which plasma NfL concentration changed from 9.7 pg/mL at baseline to 10.2 pg/mL at week 84 (5.8% increase, 95% CI -0.8–12.9, p = 0.085). This increase is in line with what could be expected in normal ageing. Plasma NfL concentrations significantly correlated with age. No correlation was found between plasma NfL and serum creatinine.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We found no biomarker evidence of CNS injury when switching from TDF to TAF. It is unclear whether the small decrease in plasma NfL found after switch to TAF is of any clinical relevance, particularly with plasma NfL levels in both arms remaining within the limits found in HIV-negative controls. These results indicate that switching from TDF to TAF appears safe with regard to neuronal injury.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>HIV-1 enters the central nervous system (CNS) shortly after transmission, initiating a chronic infection in brain macrophages and microglia accompanied by intrathecal immune activation [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. If left untreated this may eventuate in neuronal damage [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) inhibits CNS HIV replication and decreases the intrathecal immune activation substantially, although not to fully normal levels [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Neurofilament light protein (NfL) is a major structural protein of axons that is highly expressed in the cytoplasm of large myelinated axons [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. NfL can be quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood, and increased levels are detected in both of these fluids in a variety of different neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, CSF NfL has been shown to be a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While highest levels of CSF NfL are found in patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and opportunistic CNS infections, increased CSF NfL concentrations can also be detected in HIV-infected individuals with axonal injury without overt neuro-symptomatic disease, mainly in those with low CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. ART significantly reduces CSF NfL concentrations to the normal range, though to levels slightly higher than those of HIV-negative controls matched to lifestyle factors [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>NfL concentrations in plasma are 50 to 100 times lower than in CSF, but a recently developed ultra-sensitive method has made it possible to quantify NfL also in plasma [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and plasma NfL concentrations strongly correlates with those of CSF [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) has been one of the most widely-used combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for many years. TDF is a prodrug that is converted to tenofovir in blood and subsequently to the active form, tenofovir diphosphate (DP), intracellularly. High plasma levels of tenofovir are required to reach sufficient intracellular levels of tenofovir DP. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is a more recently registered prodrug that is taken up intracellularly without conversion, mainly in lymphocytes and macrophages, and thereafter metabolized to its active form. This leads to significantly lower plasma tenofovir levels and higher intracellular levels [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and also to a lower risk of renal and bone toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Concerns have been raised regarding potentially reduced CNS exposure of tenofovir, when administered as TAF compared to TDF. Both are substrates for the transport protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which means that they are subject for active blood-brain barrier efflux. TDF, however, is rapidly converted to tenofovir in the systemic circulation and relatively high tenofovir concentrations are reached in the CSF. Tenofovir is not a substrate of P-gp [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. On the contrary, tenofovir concentrations are low in both plasma and CSF during TAF treatment [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>The Gilead GS-US-292-0109 was a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label study in which HIV-1-infected adults on a regimen containing TDF were included. All participants were virologically suppressed and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50 mL/min or higher. They had been on their regimen containing TDF/FTC along with either elvitegravir/cobicistat (E/C), efavirenz, cobicistat-boosted atazanavir, or ritonavir-boosted atazanavir for at least 96 weeks. Participants were randomized 2:1 to switch to the single tablet regimen E/C/F/TAF or to continue their TDF-containing regimen. Switching to E/C/F/TAF was shown to be non-inferior regarding virological suppression and had a beneficial effect on proximal renal tubular function and bone mineral density [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the present study, we included only the subgroup of participants in the GS-US-292-0109 trial who were on E/C/F/TDF at baseline. Thus, the only difference between the arms was whether they continued with TDF or switched to TAF, the rest of their combination stayed stable with E/C/F. Because of the potential low CNS tenofovir exposure with TAF-treatment, our aim was to investigate whether switching to TAF was associated with increased neuronal injury compared to continuing with TDF, as measured by plasma levels of NfL.</p>

                <p>From the GS-US-292-0109 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01815736) we retrospectively included HIV-1-infected adults (≥ 18 years) on treatment with E/C/F/TDF at baseline who either continued E/C/F/TDF or switched to E/C/F/TAF. Patients with remaining stored plasma samples from baseline, week 24, and week 84 were included. While the randomized phase of the study continued up to 96 weeks, availability of stored plasma at week 96 was restricted. We therefore chose week 84 for long-term follow-up.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by the U.S. FDA and by Institutional Review Boards at all study sites. All participants signed written informed consent.</p>

              <p>At baseline, there was no significant difference in plasma NfL concentrations between the two arms. From baseline to week 84 there was a small but statistically significant decrease in plasma NfL in the E/C/F/TAF arm from 9.3 to 8.8 pg/mL (5.4% decline, 95% CI 2.0–8.4, p = 0.002). The change was significantly different (p = 0.001) from the E/C/F/TDF arm, in which plasma NfL concentration changed from 9.7 to 10.2 pg/mL (5.8% increase, 95% CI -0.8–12.9, p = 0.085). This increase is in line with plasma NfL changes by normal ageing. Based on data from HIV-negative controls (18), plasma NfL could be expected to increase with 5.3% in 84 weeks. There were no significant changes in plasma NfL from baseline to week 24 in any of the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226276.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Plasma NfL was significantly correlated with age (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001 at baseline) but not with gender or ethnicity.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our hypothesis prior to initiation of the study was that switching from TDF to TAF could pose a risk of neuronal injury due to decreased CNS exposure of tenofovir, leading to a measurable increase in plasma NfL concentrations. Unexpectedly, we found the opposite: a small, but statistically significant, decrease in plasma NfL in the group receiving TAF 84 weeks after the switch. CSF tenofovir concentrations are six times lower when administered as TAF compared to TDF [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but since CSF concentrations do not correlate with intracellular concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the levels in macrophages and microglia were most likely high enough to have sufficient antiretroviral effect and prevent an increase in HIV-related CNS injury.</p>
              <p>The mechanisms behind the reduction in plasma NfL 84 weeks after changing from TDF to TAF are unclear. One possible explanation could be the increased intracellular concentrations of tenofovir DP in macrophages and possibly microglia with TAF as compared to TDF, which may contribute to reduced neuronal injury through better virological suppression [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. There is, however, no evidence of insufficient inhibition of CNS viral replication in patients on ART and suppressed plasma and CSF viral load, and treatment intensification does not decrease CNS viral replication or immune activation [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>A second possible explanation could be that high plasma tenofovir concentrations associated with TDF might be more toxic to neurons than the lower concentrations from TAF treatment, and that this could increase plasma NfL levels. To our knowledge, however, there are no data regarding potential harmful effects of TDF on either CNS or peripheral neurons. TDF was not associated with neurotoxicity in a study investigating the toxicity of different antiretrovirals on rat brain cell cultures [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], nor has it been associated with a high rate of neuropathy. In addition, plasma NfL concentrations did not increase significantly during the 84-week long study period in the TDF arm, suggesting, at least, no progressive neuronal injury.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that there are correlations between cognitive decline and renal impairment, but there are no studies on renal impairment and NfL levels [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. TAF is associated with less tubular side effects compared to TDF, especially when administered together with ritonavir or cobicistat as in this study. As a third possibility for the reduction of plasma NfL that we considered was that the improved tubular function with TAF might increase clearance of NfL or substances harmful to neurons. There was, however, no association between creatinine and NfL at baseline or follow up, speaking against increased elimination of NfL due to improved renal function in patients switching to TAF. It is unclear whether the small decrease in plasma NfL found after switch to TAF is of any clinical relevance, particularly with plasma NfL levels in both arms remaining within the limits found in HIV-negative controls.</p>
              <p>Major strengths with this study are the large number of participants, the longitudinal design with randomization, and long follow-up. One important weakness is that we did not have a HIV-negative control group. The normal range of plasma NfL has not been fully determined, but the levels we found are in the same range as has been found in healthy controls in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0226276.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0226276.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Another weakness is that no CSF samples were available making it impossible to analyse if changes in NfL were associated with changes in CNS immune activation or other CSF biomarkers that might have elucidated underlying mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we cannot exclude a potential informative censoring and consequent attrition bias with differences between the included 416 patients and the 43 who did not meet the inclusion criteria, even if they had similar demographics at baseline.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>In summary, we found that plasma NfL decreased significantly 84 weeks after switching from E/C/F/TDF to E/C/F/TAF. The clinical significance of, and the mechanisms behind, this decrease within the normal range, are unclear. Nonetheless, switching from TDF to TAF appears safe with regard to neuronal injury.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Authors report on a surrogate maker, a neurofilament protein, in the plasma to report on neurotoxicity induced by HIV replication. They compare neurotoxicity under tenofovir treatment with toxicity under TAF treatment. Analysis is well done but conclusions should be downplayed due to the lack of a negative control group, different sizes in the groups affecting the significance level , lack of measurement in CSF or orthogonal measurement of HIV replication versus drug induced neurotoxicity. The conclusion that switching to TAF does not increase neurotoxicity compared to tenofovir treatment, using this indirect method, can be made but the discussion and conclusions on the so-called significant decrease in the filament level is not substantiated. It seems that plasma levels were normal and remain normal. Conclusions should be rewritten and re-discussed. Do authors plan to use other methods to investigate HIV replication in the brain in more detail ?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This a post-hoc analysis of the Gilead GS-US-292-0109 trial restricted to people who were on E/C/F/TDF. This has been done so that the only difference between the arms would be using TAF instead of TDF after switching with the rest of the drugs in the regimen being identical. Thus, a cleaner dataset in which any difference in markers after switching could be attributed to TAF vs. TDF. Because, people originally enrolled in the trial were at time zero randomized either to stay on TDF or switch to TAF, exchangeability is also retained in this subset of data which was included for analysis. The aim was to investigate whether switching to TAF was associated with increased neuronal injury compared to remaining on TDF. The manuscript is clearly written but there are few main points that need to be addressed:</p>
              <p>1. Although groups were exchangeable at baseline, out of the 459 who were on E/C/F/TDF at baseline, only 414 had week 84 samples/values so there is potential attrition bias in this analysis. It is crucial to address this issue in more details than what was done by the authors in the present form:</p>
              <p>i) Table 1 should show all potential common causes of treatment allocation and risk of neuronal injury. Ideally such a table should be identical to that shown in the parental paper published in Lancet Infectious Diseases [Lancet Infect Dis. 2016 Jan;16(1):43-52]. This is to show that attrition did not create imbalances in important potential confounders.</p>
              <p>ii) If imbalances in important confounders are detected, multivariable analysis should be conducted to control for these. Ideally, this analysis should be performed using marginal methods evaluating the effect of treatment after averaging out the effect of the covariates. This is because authors are interested in the causal effect of switching to TAF if there was no attrition bias. Specifically, marginal weighted linear regressions models should be employed.</p>
              <p>iii) Attrition bias should be clearly reported in the Figures by adding a footonote with the number of people contributing measurements at the 24 and 84 week time points.</p>
              <p>iv) The issue of potential informative censoring and consequent attrition bias (as people who are retained in TAF up to week 84 are likely to be those who have less injury) needs also to be discussed as a limitation.</p>
              <p>v) Authors should explain why numbers in Table and in the text are inconsistent (416 total vs 414 in the text and abstract, 144 in the TDF arm vs. 142 in the text)</p>
              <p>vi) Authors should also discuss power and potential issues related to the chosen target population in the trial. Indeed, contrary to what shown in the parental paper, there was no improvement in renal function in the TAF arm in this subset. This shades doubt also on the comparison of the risk of neuronal injury.</p>
              <p>vii) Clinical relevance of the small difference found is rightly questioned in the abstract. A discussion of this point should be included also in the main text.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The hipothesis of your study is interesting and your conclusion supported the idea that TAF was a drugs with lower toxicity than TDF.</p>
              <p>Some little revision are however due before publish your paper</p>
              <p>In tab 1 you present data registered at baseline. Could be better to show in tab any difference within the two group also regarding age creatinine and nfl showing the p value.</p>
              <p>It is possible that the different number of patients on TAF anf TDF (2:1) could modify the statistical significance of your results: really the difference between Nfl or creatinine could be modified by study designe and patients distribution into the the two arms. Please discuss about any possible bias linked to this aspect.</p>
              <p>At the same time the value of creatinine could be not perfectly associated to the real filtration capacity of every patient. A GFR calculation could give us a more exact estimation of renal function.</p>
              <p>Finally the figures showed a different trend of Nfl concentrations at 24 and 84 weeks, mainly in TDF group. Could you speculate about this different bifasic dynamic?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: This is a well-thought through and well-written paper, on an interesting and clinically relevant hypothesis.</p>
              <p>1. Line 35: for 10.3 to 9.6 pg/mL: are these the median values? or mean? Need to state. The values presented here are different from the values presented in the main text Results section(9.3 to 8.8 pg/mL): was one set of values: median, and one set of values: mean?</p>
              <p>Line 37: Once again the reported change in plasma NfL in the abstract (11.1 to 11.7pg/mL) is different from what is reported in the main test results (9.7 to 10.2pg/mL). When you say 'at follow up', do you mean week 84?</p>
              <p>2. Line 36: Does the p&lt;0.01 value relate to the comparison of the percentage change in both arms? If so, you should state that; this sentence is very confusing to read. Also worth stating the median/mean percentage change in both arms at week 84, to put that p-value into context.</p>
              <p>3. Line 114: How many times were each sample analysed? Were the samples analysed in duplicate/triplicate?</p>
              <p>4. Line 135: Table 1 does not show the p-values for statistically significant differences in age and gender, so the reference to Table 1 should be shifted to the sentence before. Referencing Table 1 here implies you are demonstrating p-values for differences in age and gender in Table 1.</p>
              <p>Line 142: What is the p-value for difference in plasma NfL between the 2 arms at baseline? Since you describe the p-values, you should put it in Table 1.</p>
              <p>5: Line 148: What other factors did you look at for associations with plasma NfL? Other factors related to eGFR perhaps: gender, ethnicity, weight?</p>
              <p>6: Line 219: to also add the lack of age-related reference values for plasma NfL- unlike CSF NFL which has age-related reference values, and thus may be a more reliable/ interpretable biomarker.</p>
              <p>7: The lack of concurrent CSF sample needs to be acknowledged in the discussion, given that plasma NfL using Simoa is still novel, and interpretation is more difficult for the reasons mentioned above</p>
              <p>8: I agree with the final conclusions drawn from this paper.</p>
