We investigated this regimen in patients with resectable clinical stage III or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma (NCT02519322). Patients received two neoadjuvant doses (nivolumab 480‚Äâmg and relatlimab 160‚Äâmg intravenously every 4 weeks) followed by surgery, and then ten doses of adjuvant combination therapy. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The combination resulted in 57% pCR rate and 70% overall pathologic response rate among 30 patients treated. The radiographic response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 was 57%. No grade 3‚Äì4 immune-related adverse events were observed in the neoadjuvant setting. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free survival rate was 100% and 92% for patients with any pathologic response, compared to 88% and 55% for patients who did not have a pathologic response (<italic>P</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005). Increased immune cell infiltration at baseline, and decrease in M2 macrophages during treatment, were associated with pathologic response. Our results indicate that neoadjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab induces a high pCR rate. Safety during neoadjuvant therapy is favourable compared to other combination immunotherapy regimens. These data, in combination with the results of the RELATIVITY-047 trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, provide further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of this new immunotherapy regimen.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Patients with locoregionally advanced, resectable melanoma have a high risk of relapse and death from melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Specifically, patients with clinically detected nodal disease have a risk of melanoma-specific mortality that could be as high as 75%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although current adjuvant therapy decreases the risk of recurrence by about 50% (BRAF-targeted therapy hazard ratio (HR) 0.49, single agent PD-1 HR approximately 0.54)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, there has yet to be confirmation of the impact on overall survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In an attempt to intensify therapy beyond single agent anti-PD-1, the Checkmate-915 trial was designed to investigate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab in the adjuvant setting improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to nivolumab alone. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab did not improve RFS (HR 0.92) and it significantly increased toxicity (grade 3‚Äì4 adverse events (AEs) 43%, compared to 23% for single agent anti-PD-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, indicating that intensification of adjuvant therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab in the adjuvant setting is not the optimal approach for improving recurrence outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Neoadjuvant therapy offers several advantages over upfront surgery and adjuvant therapy, including potential for improvement in clinical outcomes and understanding molecular and immunological mechanisms of treatment response and resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Additionally, neoadjuvant immunotherapy has demonstrated ability in preclinical models and in human samples to increase expansion of antigen-specific T cells due to the presence of tumour at the time of treatment compared to the expansion seen when the same immunotherapy is administered in the adjuvant setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The neoadjuvant setting also offers the opportunity to intensify therapy with combinations for a short pre-operative course, allowing for a direct estimate of therapeutic efficacy and the ability to inform adjuvant therapy decisions.</p>
              <p id="Par5">One potential limitation of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is delay in curative-intent surgery if grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) occur during treatment. For example, neoadjuvant administration of 2‚Äì3 doses of ipilimumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup>‚Äâ+‚Äânivolumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> was associated with 73‚Äì90% grade 3/4 toxicities, which led to surgical delays in approximately 27% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The OpACIN-NEO trial compared two doses of neoadjuvant therapy with different dosing strategies of ipilimumab and nivolumab. This study demonstrated that ipilimumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> with nivolumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> showed an at least equivalent pCR rate (57%) to the ipilimumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1‚Äâ</sup>+‚Äânivolumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> regimen (47%), but with a lower (20% versus 40%) incidence of grade 3/4 toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These data highlight the goal of identifying new regimens that enhance pathologic responses and reduce risk of recurrence with improved toxicity profiles.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) regulates an inhibitory immune checkpoint limiting T cell activity and is a marker for T cell exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Relatlimab is a human IgG4 LAG-3-blocking monoclonal antibody that restores the effector function of exhausted T cells and has been investigated in both checkpoint inhibitor-na√Øve (NCT03470922)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and refractory metastatic melanoma (NCT01968109)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the randomized phase 2/3 RELATIVITY-047 study, the combination of relatlimab with nivolumab in patients with treatment-na√Øve unresectable stage III or stage IV metastatic melanoma demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to single agent nivolumab (HR 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64‚Äì0.94)). Moreover, the combination was well tolerated with 21.1% of patients experiencing grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Given its efficacy and favourable toxicity profile, this combination therapy received US Food and Drug Administration approval for use in patients with metastatic melanoma on 18 March 2022.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Our group previously published our experience of a randomized, investigator-initiated clinical trial of either single agent nivolumab (240‚Äâmg intravenously every 2 weeks up to four doses) or nivolumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> with ipilimumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâ‚Äâg<sup>‚àí1</sup> (intravenously every 3 weeks up to three doses) in the neoadjuvant setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In this trial, we concluded that although neoadjuvant single agent nivolumab was safe (8% grade 3/4 toxicities), its efficacy was modest (25% pCR rate). Although the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab was effective with a 45% pCR rate, the toxicity was prohibitively high with 73% grade 3/4 toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Given these data and the early closure of the study due to suboptimal performance of both treatment arms, our team sought to evaluate new immunotherapy combinations with the intention of preserving pathologic response while minimizing toxicities. We opened a new arm to this existing prospective clinical trial to determine pCR rate, safety and efficacy of the relatlimab and nivolumab combination in patients with resectable clinical stage III or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma (Clinicaltrial.gov number NCT02519322) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Here we report the clinical results and immune profiling of this neoadjuvant therapy combination.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Study design.</title><p>Eligible patients receive two doses of relatlimab 160‚Äâmg with nivolumab 480‚Äâmg intravenously every 4 weeks (Q4W) in the neoadjuvant setting and then have repeat imaging for calculation of RECIST response. Surgery takes place at week 9 for evaluation of pathologic response. Patients receive up to ten doses of relatlimab 160‚Äâmg and nivolumab 480‚Äâmg every 4 weeks in the adjuvant setting and are followed for 2 years for evidence of recurrence. Blood and tumour are collected during screening, at weeks 3, 5 and at time of surgery at week 9. Blood is collected every 12 weeks (Q12W) in the adjuvant setting.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par17">In patients with resectable clinical stage III or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma, neoadjuvant relatlimab with nivolumab resulted in high pCR rate (57%; 95% CI, 37‚Äì75%) and improvement in the 2-year RFS rate in patients who achieved any pathologic response compared to those without a pathologic response (<italic>P</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005). The lower limit CI (37%) exceeded the minimum target of 30% in the study design. This regimen was tolerated well in the neoadjuvant setting, with 26% grade 3 toxicities noted with continued dosing in the adjuvant setting. In patients with pathologic response, increased immune cell infiltration was identified at baseline and decreased M2 macrophages were demonstrated over the course of neoadjuvant therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par18">The first two randomized arms of this trial evaluated both single agent nivolumab and the combination of ipilimumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> and nivolumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup>. Twenty-seven per cent of patients treated with ipilimumab 3‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> and nivolumab 1‚Äâmg‚Äâkg<sup>‚àí1</sup> required surgical delays of 1‚Äì10 weeks due to need for steroids and prolonged steroid taper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. With no grade 3/4 IRAEs observed in the neoadjuvant setting and no confirmed toxicity-related surgical delays, the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab now provides complementary information and demonstrates a highly effective regimen with manageable toxicities in the neoadjuvant setting.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Although there were no grade 3/4 IRAEs in the neoadjuvant setting, 26% grade 3/4 toxicities were experienced in the adjuvant setting. The most common IRAE observed was secondary adrenal insufficiency. As 33% of patients discontinued therapy before the planned full year of treatment, due to toxicity, it raises questions of whether continued dosing in the adjuvant setting is necessary following pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy. Additionally, none of the patients who stopped therapy early due to toxicity have experienced a recurrence event. There is not clear consensus on the need for the adjuvant phase of therapy within neoadjuvant trials, with completed or ongoing trials including complete omission of any adjuvant therapy, use of adjuvanttherapy only in poor responders or adjuvant therapy to complete 1 year of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, Additionally, the use of adjuvant therapy can certainly affect the RFS and can cloud the interpretation of neoadjuvant therapy data. Understanding the contribution of adjuvant immunotherapy following immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting to clinical benefit remains an active area of research interest.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The historic dogma in neoadjuvant chemotherapy emphasized pCR as the critical end point correlating with the most durable clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This was similarly appreciated in the International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC) pooled analysis of neoadjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitor use in patients with clinical stage III melanoma, showing that achieving a pCR, but not a pPR, correlated with improved RFS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although the pCR end point may still be appropriate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy, our data provide further evidence that in the context of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in melanoma, any pathologic response (less than 50% viable tumour) is associated with favourable long-term clinical outcomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Similar patterns of improved clinical responses with any pathologic response are being appreciated in neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials across solid tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Although baseline LAG-3 and PD-1 levels in tumour samples did not correlate with response, we observed increased frequencies of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the posttreatment tumour specimens of patients with favourable treatment response. These findings are concordant with previous studies in which responses to anti-PD-1 were associated with higher CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we observed a reduction in M2-like macrophages with treatment only in the patients that achieved a pathologic response, possibly serving as a target to further improve responsiveness to this regimen, and/or to further evaluate in other studies of nivolumab plus relatlimab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Analysis of longitudinal peripheral blood specimens by flow cytometry revealed higher frequency of EOMES<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in posttreatment samples of responding patients, suggesting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing EOMES could contribute to tumour regression. This supports a potentially critical role of EOMES for antitumour activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These data indicate that a higher frequency of total immune cell infiltration, as well as increased specific effector CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, with a concomitant decrease in suppressive myeloid cells in the tumour microenvironment, correlate with clinical response to this regimen in the neoadjuvant setting. It should be noted that the number of usable samples in the NR patients was low, which limits comparative correlative analyses in this study.</p>
              <p id="Par22">We acknowledge that the study is limited by its small sample size and that these results are preliminary, based on findings at two academic research institutions. However, the cohort evaluated in this study (<italic>n</italic>‚Äâ=‚Äâ30) is largely similar to the individual arms in the OpACIN-NEO study and to other single-arm neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. With a median follow-up of 24 months, we also acknowledge that additional follow-up is needed to fully assess clinical impact and the durability of responses. However, this initial data is encouraging, and the pooled analyses of melanoma neoadjuvant trials support the importance of pathologic response rates as an early predictor of durable benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Similarly, additional translational studies beyond the scope of this manuscript are planned, including RNA sequencing for broad assessment of additional immune signatures and populations that have been implicated in immunotherapy resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In summary, neoadjuvant relatlimab and nivolumab is a highly active regimen that achieves a 70% pathologic response rate with a favourable safety profile in patients with high-risk, resectable clinical stage III or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma. These data are complementary to the RELATIVITY-047 study in patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma, and together further support the promise of this new combination immunotherapy regimen in this disease.</p>

PBMC and tumour specimens destined for CyTOF analysis were stained for viability with 5‚ÄâŒºmol‚Äâl<sup>‚àí1</sup> cisplatin (Fluidigm, now Standard Biotools) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then washed three times. All specimens were resuspended in AB serum with 10% (vol/vol) dimethyl sulfoxide for storage in liquid nitrogen until downstream assays were performed.</p>

Single-cell suspensions were assayed with 41 antibodies, plus Ir DNA-intercalator and cisplatin. Antibodies were either purchased preconjugated from Fluidigm or purchased purified and conjugated in-house using MaxPar X8 Polymer kits (Fluidigm, now Standard Biotools). Briefly, samples were thawed and stained with cell surface antibodies in PBS containing 5% goat serum and 1% BSA for 30‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. Samples were then washed in PBS containing 1% BSA, fixed and permeabilized according to the instructions of the manufacturers using the FoxP3 staining buffer set (eBioscience), before being incubated with intracellular antibodies in permeabilization buffer for 30‚Äâmin at 4‚Äâ¬∞C. Samples were washed and incubated in Ir intercalator (Fluidigm, now Standard Biotools) and stored at 4‚Äâ¬∞C until acquisition, generally within 12‚Äâh. Immediately before acquisition, samples were washed and resuspended in water containing EQ 4 element beads (Fluidigm, now Standard Biotools).

Data were then exported as FCS files for downstream analysis and arcsinh transformed using a coefficient of 5 [x_transformed = arcsinh(x/5)]. To visualize the high-dimensional data in two dimensions, the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding dimension reduction algorithm was applied, using all channels besides those used to manually gate the population of interest (for example, CD45 or CD3).
