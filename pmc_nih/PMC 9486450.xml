                <sec id="ab-zoi220910-1">
                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Does the practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM) reduce stress among health care workers (HCWs)?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi220910-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>This randomized clinical trial of 80 HCWs showed that TM practice over 3 months reduced psychological distress scores (primary outcome) on the Global Severity Index by 5.6 points, but this decrease was not significantly different from the reduction of 3.8 points observed in the control group. The practice of TM reduced burnout scores (a secondary outcome) by 5.4 points, representing a statistically significant reduction compared with usual treatment.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi220910-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>This study found that TM practice did not significantly decrease acute distress compared with usual treatment; however, TM significantly reduced chronic stress, particularly burnout, suggesting that TM could be an effective strategy to prevent or mitigate chronic stress, and potentially burnout, among HCWs.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Health care workers (HCWs) have been experiencing substantial stress and burnout, and evidence-based mitigation strategies are needed. Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a mantra meditation practice with potential efficacy in reducing stress.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>

                  <title>Design, Setting, and Participants</title>
                  <p>This single-center open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted among HCWs at an academic medical center from November 19, 2020, to August 31, 2021. Inclusion criteria comprised a score of 6 points or greater on the Subjective Units of Distress Scale and an increase of 5% or greater in baseline heart rate or an increase of 33% or greater in galvanic skin response after exposure to a stressful script. Exclusion criteria included the use of antipsychotic or β blocker medications, current suicidal ideation, or previous TM training. Of 213 HCWs who participated in prescreening, 95 attended in-person visits, resulting in 80 eligible participants who were randomized to receive a TM intervention (TM group) or usual treatment (control group).</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>The TM group practiced TM for 20 minutes twice daily over a 3-month period. The control group received usual treatment, which consisted of access to wellness resources.</p>

                  <title>Main Outcomes and Measures</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome was change in acute psychological distress measured by the Global Severity Index. Secondary outcomes included changes in burnout (measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory), insomnia (measured by the Insomnia Severity Index), and anxiety (measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Among 80 participants, 66 (82.5%) were women, with a mean (SD) age of 40 (11) years. One participant (1.3%) was American Indian or Alaska Native, 5 (6.3%) were Asian, 12 (15.0%) were Black, 59 (73.8%) were White, and 3 (3.8%) were of unknown or unreported race; 4 participants (5.0%) were Hispanic, and 76 (95.0%) were non-Hispanic. A total of 41 participants were randomized to the TM group, and 39 were randomized to the control group. Participants in the TM group did not show a statistically significant decrease in psychological distress on the Global Severity Index compared with those in the control group (−5.6 points vs −3.8 points; between-group difference, −1.8 points; 95% CI, −4.2 to 0.6 points; P = .13). Compared with the control group, the TM group had significantly greater reductions in the secondary end points of emotional exhaustion (Maslach Burnout Inventory subscore: −8.0 points vs −2.6 points; between-group difference, −5.4 points; 95% CI, −9.2 to −1.6 points; P = .006), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Scale score: −4.1 points vs −1.9 points; between-group difference, −2.2 points; 95% CI, −4.4 to 0 points; P = .05), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score: −3.1 points vs −0.9 points; between-group difference, −2.2 points; 95% CI, −3.8 to −0.5; P = .01) at 3 months.

              <p>Health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing substantial stress and burnout, with recently reported burnout rates of 60% to 70%.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The World Health Organization defines burnout as an occupational phenomenon resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Burnout is characterized by 3 dimensions: feelings of exhaustion, increased mental distance from the job or negativism, and reduced professional efficacy.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The serious consequences of burnout, such as rapid turnover, limited patient access and care, and increased health expenditure, can adversely affect HCWs, health care organizations, and patients.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> As a result, the Joint Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services have called for prioritization of health care workforce resilience.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, organizational burnout mitigation strategies have a limited evidence base with regard to approaches and strategies.</p>

              <p>Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a meditation practice in which individuals silently recite a single mantra (a sound that lacks meaning) without concentration or contemplation.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Studies of TM practitioners have revealed patterns of increased parasympathetic response leading to attenuation of the stress response.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Proposed mechanisms underlying the restful alertness achieved with TM include increased α coherence on electroencephalography<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and increased blood flow to the prefrontal cortex on functional magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of TM for the reduction of stress and burnout among teachers<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and emergency department clinicians.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The practice of TM has been found to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in veterans,<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> which might be particularly relevant because recent reports of HCW burnout suggest a similarity to the experiences of combat veterans.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We hypothesized that HCWs who practiced TM would demonstrate significantly reduced symptoms of acute psychological distress within 3 months, as measured by the Global Severity Index (GSI) score of the 18-item Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). Secondary outcomes included changes in burnout, resilience, insomnia, depression, and anxiety levels.</p>

There were 3 follow-up sessions with the TM teacher over the intervention period (a total of 8 sessions). Protocol fidelity was ensured by the delivery of instructions by a single TM teacher for most participants and by further supervision of the protocol by a senior TM teacher. The control group had access to wellness resources, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, journaling workshops, stress and resilience training, and access to fitness and nutrition consultations, offered by the Duke University Health System.</p>

                <p>The BSI-18<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> was used to assess psychological distress over the past 7 days. This inventory is designed primarily as a highly sensitive screen for psychiatric disorders and secondarily as an instrument to measure treatment outcomes. It evaluates symptoms based on responses to 18 items in 3 categories: somatization (6 items), depression (6 items), and anxiety (6 items). Each item response is assigned a value of 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all the time), with scores for each subscale ranging from 0 to 24 points. The total score, GSI, is calculated by adding the 3 subscale sums (range, 0-72 points) and summarizes the respondent’s overall level of psychological distress, with higher scores indicating higher distress (scores of ≥63 points are considered indicative of high distress level).</p>
                <p>The MBI<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> was used to measure participant burnout. This 22-item inventory measures emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items), and personal accomplishment (8 items). Respondents indicate how often they experienced each statement on a 7-point scale ranging from never to every day. Higher scores indicate higher ratings of that factor. The criterion for burnout is the presence of emotional exhaustion subscores of 27 points or higher, depersonalization subscores of 13 points or higher, and personal accomplishment subscores of 33 points or lower. For emotional exhaustion, ratings are categorized as low (0-16 points), moderate (17-26 points), or high (≥27 points). For depersonalization, ratings are categorized as low (0-6 points), moderate (7-12 points), or high (≥13 points). For personal accomplishment, ratings are categorized as low (≤31 points), moderate (32-38 points), or high (≥39 points).</p>

                <p>Of 279 participants who completed prescreening questionnaires, 66 were not eligible for participation based on inclusion and exclusion criteria (<xref rid="zoi220910f1" ref-type="fig">Figure</xref>; eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI220910-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Among 213 eligible participants, 95 attended the in-person screening after providing informed consent. One participant was excluded due to the use of antipsychotic or β blocker medications, 2 were excluded due to current suicidal ideation (based on C-SSRS results), 7 scored less than 6 points on the SUDS, and 5 did not have either a 5% or greater increase in heart rate or a 33% or greater increase in galvanic skin response after exposure to a stressful script. Due to an error in the online survey app, a large number of participants (12 in the TM group and 20 in the control group) missed the time frame to complete the 1-month follow-up survey, leading to a high number of missing responses.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial did not find a significant reduction in the primary outcome of acute psychological distress among HCWs practicing TM over a 3-month period compared with those receiving usual treatment. However, participants in the TM group experienced significant reductions in chronic stress, particularly emotional exhaustion of burnout (a secondary end point), compared with those in the control group. Our findings on burnout are supported by a recent study reporting decreases in burnout among emergency medicine clinicians practicing TM<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as well as studies reporting reductions in burnout in other vulnerable professions, such as teaching and nursing.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Our findings were comparable with those reported in studies of other interventions, such as coaching<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> or psychological techniques to improve focus on positive emotions,<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> but our study had lower longitudinal attrition (2.5%), higher adherence (92.7% in the TM group), and a notable lack of adverse events compared with those studies. We found significant decreases in insomnia, anxiety, and emotional exhaustion levels (secondary end points) in the TM group compared with the control group. However, the improvement patterns in depression symptoms, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment between the TM group vs the control group did not reach statistical significance.</p>
              <p>There could be several reasons for the absence of significant improvement in our primary end point of acute psychological distress despite the observed reduction in burnout. This finding may represent a floor effect (which occurs when a large percentage of respondents score near the lower limit on a questionnaire). At baseline, the cohort had low GSI scores (median [IQR], 9 [4-15] points) and thus may not have been able to further reduce symptoms in a 3-month period. Only 3 participants in the TM group and 6 participants in the control group had a high standard GSI score (≥63 points) at baseline,<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and these small numbers were inadequate for statistical analysis. Given that the cohort had high levels of burnout at baseline but low acute distress scores, prioritized strategies for mitigation of chronic stress rather than acute distress may be needed for HCWs. It is also possible that the use of a different psychological instrument may be warranted to evaluate acute stress among HCWs. Although the GSI was developed as a highly sensitive screening measure for acute psychological distress and as an outcome measure for change in stress levels among individuals recovering from cancer,<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> it is not reliable in practice for the longitudinal identification of psychological distress across populations.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Thus, the GSI may be an inadequate instrument for measuring stress levels among HCWs. Our results showed a significant effect of TM practice on the MBI emotional exhaustion subscale, which has been reported by other studies that used the MBI.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our study had a higher number of female participants, which is consistent with recent reports of disproportionately high burnout in the female workforce<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220910r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> and greater willingness to take action against burnout among women.<sup><xref rid="zoi220910r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This finding highlights the need to address underlying factors and develop organizational mitigation strategies. The cost of interventions such as TM could be prohibitive for individual HCWs. Thus, organizations and payers may consider offering processes and subsidies to HCWs who choose to address their burnout with neurobehavioral tools. Future studies might recruit more participants to ensure they have the necessary power to detect significant changes in numerical scales, and they could measure serum markers of stress, such as inflammatory cytokines and cortisol levels.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this randomized clinical trial is one of the largest to assess the practice of TM for stress reduction among HCWs. We used validated scales and objective measures of distress, such as galvanic skin response and increased heart rate. We recruited a variety of HCWs (not only physicians), giving the findings’ greater generalizability, and conducted 3 months of longitudinal follow-up with low attrition rates.</p>
                <p>This study also has limitations. The study cohort was small and possibly comprised a highly motivated group, and the study lacked long-term assessments beyond 3 months. In a larger cohort, TM practice may yield statistically significant differences from usual treatment, even for acute psychologic distress. The control group received access to wellness resources rather than an active intervention. Our study was also limited in terms of knowledge of objective intervention adherence and quality. The initial 5-day TM instruction was relatively intense, and abbreviated training or flexible schedules may enhance participation among HCWs.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial found that TM practice may not significantly reduce acute psychological distress among HCWs compared with usual treatment. However, TM may significantly alleviate burnout, anxiety, and insomnia among HCWs. The findings also revealed high stress levels among HCWs, especially women, who compose more than 50% of the health care workforce. It is important that investigators and organizations use interdisciplinary multidimensional approaches that incorporate personal and organizationally led strategies. The practice of TM, which is both feasible and safe, could be considered as 1 strategy to prevent or mitigate chronic stress and burnout.</p>
