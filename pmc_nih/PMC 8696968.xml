              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Sexual and gender minority adolescents (SGMA; i.e., youth who identify as something other than heterosexual and those with a gender identity that does not align with their assigned sex at birth) endure numerous behavioral health symptoms and disparities when compared to their heterosexual, cisgender peers. These disparities include higher rates of internalizing psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and externalizing behaviors such as substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and suicide attempt and completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">Minority stress theory explains these mental health disparities by suggesting that discrimination, violence, and victimization drives experiences of chronic minority stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The long-term nature of these stress experiences place SGMA, aged 12–25 years, at higher risk of mental health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Evidence for this relationship between minority stress and behavioral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] is clear, and displayed through numerous cross-sectional studies, including experiences of violent victimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], homophobic bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and family rejection in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Similarly, studies have identified sexual minority-specific victimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and stress experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as mediating the relationships between sexual identity status and depression, PTSD, and suicidality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These studies come together to provide robust evidence that improving youths’ ability to cope with minority stress is an important piece to improving mental health outcomes among SGMA, and that direct interventions are a means to fill this gap.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Despite a significant need to be addressed among SGMA, it has been noted that there are “no determinative studies, such as randomized control trials, of the efficacy and effectiveness of school based interventions [for SGMA]” (p.1767) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and the one U.S. based intervention with substantial quasi-experimental (the Family Acceptance Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]) relies heavily, on family participation. The challenge here is that many SGMA report not disclosing their sexual or gender identity to their family for fear of rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and those who do disclose their identity, often report a lack of family support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Another set of interventions developed in Canada, including Affirmative Supportive Safe and Empowering Talk and an affirmative behavioral coping skills group intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], as well as a Western Canadian media-based intervention to reduce bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] have also found support, but their efficacy has yet to be established through randomized control designs in the literature. Thus, interventions that have a strong theoretical foundation, follow the National Institutes of Health’s gold-standard phase model of intervention development and testing, and rely solely on individual choice without family involvement are an essential but missing part of psychoeducational work needed to help SGMA cope with minority stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To address this gap in the literature, we developed a novel program, Proud &amp; Empowered (P&amp;E), to be delivered in school or community-based settings.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Development of Proud &amp; Empowered</title>
                <p id="Par21">The P&amp;E intervention was named through a democratic vote by youth at LGBT centers after multiple rounds of development, implementation, and revision that followed the NIH Intervention Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The 10-session small group intervention was supported by studies from 2012 to early 2020, most notably the development of a comprehensive minority stress measure for adolescents, the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although more detailed information can be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the SMASI emerged from a multiphase mixed-methods study including key informant interviews and focus groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; life history calendar interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] with 52 racially, ethnically, and gender diverse SGMA aged 14–17; a modified Delphi process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] with an advisory panel of six experts in SGMA, minority stress theory, and psychometric development; and a rigorous validation process with adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 346), including factor analytic and item response theory approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The final SMASI measure found 10 conceptual domains: social marginalization, family rejection, internalized homonegativity, identity management, homonegative climate, intersectionality, negative disclosure experiences, religion, negative expectancies, and homonegative communication.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Considering the correlation between high stress in each domain and poorer health, we posited that ameliorating these stressors for SGMA would improve their health outcomes. Thus, the SMASI domains formed the basis for P&amp;E’s 10 intervention sessions. Through an iterative process, consensus was reached that the intervention should include content on (a) stress and coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; (b) disclosure decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; (c) family; (d) school-related stress and resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; (e) peers and friendship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]; (f) safety in relationships; (g) spirituality, faith, and religion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; (h) race, ethnicity, and social justice; (i) the LGBT community and history; and (j) intersections of health, substance use, HIV, and the medical system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These aligned closely with the 10 SMASI domains and were agreed to by our research team, LGBT youth center staff, and the group of youth who participated in focus groups.</p>
                <p id="Par23">As intervention content was built, we also focused on understanding what strategies may be useful in coping for SGMA. Relying on the most commonly cited model of coping presented by Compas and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], the study team identified both voluntary and involuntary physiological and emotional responses that may be related to SGMA minority stress, as well as engagement and disengagement strategies and coping resources with relevance to population health. In sum, we identified 16 population-specific coping resources that would further inform the intervention: for example, learning about the LGBTQ community, accessing factual historical information, or finding a supportive adult (ally). More detailed information on these novel coping resources is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Finally, the intervention was pilot tested and further refined through a formative process with SGMA input, also published in a paper on the complete development process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par24">In sum, the final P&amp;E intervention is a 10-session small group program for SGMA, with each session lasting approximately 45 min (one class period). A facilitator manual guides the curriculum; is used to monitor fidelity; and includes goals, learning objectives, activities, and a list of materials used for each session. Sessions rely on a mix of psychoeducation, didactic discussion, and interactive (e.g., role-play) activities. Following the previously described studies, the present article reports on a randomized controlled trial conducted at four public schools on the west coast of the United States to examine the efficacy of the P&amp;E program. We hypothesized that youth who participated in P&amp;E would (a) report significantly fewer minority stress experiences postintervention than those in the control group and (b) report significantly improved behavioral health symptomology (i.e., depression, PTSD, anxiety, and suicidality) compared to youth in the control group. We also examined whether participation in P&amp;E moderated the relationship between minority stress and behavioral health symptoms to assess whether participation may improve youths’ ability to cope with minority stressors when they arise, because eliminating them is unfeasible.</p>

                <p id="Par25">The randomized controlled trial was approved by the lead author’s institutional review board and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov. No major deviations occurred in the submitted protocol, and data collection for the intervention ended before COVID-19 resulted in school closures. The study was conducted with four schools in fall 2019 that collectively make up a unified school district in Southern California. The four schools’ range in size from 902 to 1,971 students each, have a combined enrollment of 5,706, and represent diverse racial and ethnic (e.g., 60% identify as Hispanic or Latinx and 16% as Black or African American) and income (e.g., 26% of families earn between $15,000 and $49,000 per year and 11% earn less than $15,000 per year) groups. All four schools had an active gender and sexuality alliance (GSA), but identified no other programming. The schools were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control condition. Youth in the intervention condition participated in the 10-week P&amp;E program during one class period per week, whereas youth in the control condition attended school as usual during the same time period. Youth in both conditions completed measures at pretest and posttest, and measures were administered during the same week to both study conditions (pretest was one week prior to the first scheduled intervention session and posttest was 1 week after the last intervention session). We intended to complete a subsequent post-test measure, but restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic prevented this from occurring. Measures included demographic characteristics, our hypothesized mechanisms of change (i.e., minority stress), and mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidality). Participants received a $20 gift card for completing the measures at pretest and a $25 gift card at posttest.</p>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] After each session, the facilitator and the liaison (co-facilitator) rated the objectives, content, and activities on fidelity, appropriateness, and participant receptiveness using an adherence checklist. Based on the core dimensions of the cultural adaptation model, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] liaisons were asked to identify cognitive (comprehension), affective (cultural conflicts or motivation issues), developmental, and any other problems (e.g., environmental) with activities and rate fidelity to each session element (concepts, objectives, activities, instructions).</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par27">Youth could participate in the P&amp;E study if they (a) were students at the high school; (b) spoke English; (c) self-identified as LGBT or other non-heterosexual or cisgender identity; and (d) were willing and able to provide verbal assent. To identify potential participants, the study coordinator and school counselors made verbal presentations, distributed fliers, and had direct and confidential meetings to recruit youth to the study. Because LGBT youth represent a sensitive population and human subjects’ protection is complex (i.e., parents may not know their sexual or gender identity), we requested and received a waiver of parental consent by the institutional review board at the study team’s institution. Thus, potential youth participants received a detailed information sheet outlining the study goals, objectives, benefits, and possible risks and provided verbal assent or consent to participate (if they were 18 years old or turned 18 during the study).</p>
                <p id="Par28">Both school facilitators and student participants were informed that their school would be randomly selected to serve as either an intervention or control site. The district was recruited at the superintendent level, staff members at all schools were trained, students were administered pretests, and then schools were randomly assigned. We followed this process to help reduce the potential for bias in procedures.</p>

Each school had up to two full-time staff members who received a 1-day training on the P&amp;E curriculum overseen by the principal investigator and facilitated by the project coordinator. Most staff members were school counselors (<italic>n</italic> = 5), but also included teachers (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and other trained staff members. The training covered topics including: (a) minority stress among adolescents, (b) adolescent development and gender and sexual identity formation, (c) the NIH prevention principles, (d) P&amp;E curriculum implementation, (e) fidelity monitoring processes, and (f) program outcomes and the research plan. Using previously established best practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], facilitators learned their roles in the project, identifying skills and concepts for each activity throughout the program. Facilitators received a $1,000 honorarium for their time in the training and participation throughout the school year.</p>

Therefore, participants in the control condition did not participate in any unique activities; rather, they completed the surveys on the same timeline, and with the same incentive procedures, as the intervention group.</p>

              <p id="Par47">Analyses were further conducted to examine whether the intervention group moderated the association between minority stress and mental health symptoms. Minority stress had a statistically significant interaction with PTSD (<italic>b</italic> = -1.29, <italic>p</italic> = .032); for those in the intervention group, higher levels of minority stress were associated with lower levels of PTSD (<italic>b</italic> = -0.48, <italic>p</italic> = .234), and for those in the control group, higher levels of minority stress were associated with higher levels of PTSD (<italic>b</italic> = 0.81, <italic>p</italic> = .063). This significant interaction suggests that the relationship between minority stress and PTSD differed between groups. Results also demonstrated a significant moderation effect of the intervention between minority stress and depression (<italic>b</italic> = -0.79, <italic>p</italic> = .023). Higher levels of minority stress were associated with lower levels of depression for those in the intervention condition (<italic>b</italic> = -0.36, <italic>p</italic> = .131), whereas higher levels of minority stress were associated with higher levels of depression for those in the control condition (<italic>b</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = .093). The intervention also significantly moderated the relationship between minority stress and suicidality (<italic>b</italic> = -0.14, <italic>p</italic> = .012); higher levels of minority stress were associated with lower levels of suicidality for the intervention condition (<italic>b</italic> = -0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .069), and higher levels of minority stress were associated with higher levels of suicidality for the control condition (<italic>b</italic> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = .087). Each of these findings show the intervention reduced the strength of the relationship between higher levels of minority stress and PTSD, depression, and suicidality when compared to the control condition.

              <p id="Par49">This randomized controlled trial demonstrated evidence for the preliminary effectiveness of the P&amp;E prevention intervention. Because SGMA experience numerous mental health disparities when compared to their heterosexual peers, implementing interventions like P&amp;E may be crucial to promoting mental wellness and coping among these youth, who often manifest these experiences of minority stress as mental health symptomology throughout their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">Supporting our first hypothesis, we found evidence that participation in the P&amp;E intervention reduced minority stress among intervention participants. Even with a sample of fewer than 50 youth across intervention and control conditions, we found statistically significant decreases in minority stress experiences among youth in the intervention group, whereas experiences of minority stress increased among those in the control condition. This suggests the intervention is successful in decreasing minority stress through reframing the understanding and approach of stressors in the control of participants. However, further research is needed with larger samples, because it was difficult to see changes in subscales of our minority stress measure, given sampling and power challenges.</p>
              <p id="Par51">As we also expected based on literature linking minority stress experiences with mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], we found evidence suggesting that P&amp;E reduces negative mental health symptoms (Hypothesis 2). Those in the intervention group reported decreased symptoms of anxiety and no change in depression symptoms, as compared to those in the control group, who saw no change in anxiety and an increase in depression symptoms. These findings suggest protective effects of the intervention for mental health symptoms among LGBT students. The knowledge youth gained through the stress-based psychoeducation aspect of P&amp;E broadened their understanding of how minority stress plays a role in the symptoms they experience. This understanding may promote mindful identification and coping with symptoms of stress and anxiety, as found in other studies with adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Furthermore, youth gained peer support through group sharing of common experiences, which has been shown to be related to positive mental health and well-being among SGMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par52">Finally, we found preliminary evidence that P&amp;E moderated the relationship between minority stress experiences and mental health symptoms. Analyses identified significant interactions between minority stress experiences and the intervention condition, suggesting that youth in the intervention group were less likely than those in the control group to report elevated PTSD, depression, and suicidality in the face of minority stress experiences. Although we designed P&amp;E to address many types of proximal experiences of minority stress (e.g., internalized homonegativity, identity management), we recognize that a small group intervention can only go so far to address distal stressors such as homonegative school climates and peer and family rejection. Given that these stressors would be difficult (or impossible) to eliminate with an individual-based intervention, they are likely to be experienced regardless of intervention participation. Thus, we were pleased to see that P&amp;E appears to provide participants with improved coping skills that may help them in the face of these distal stress experiences. Our findings provide evidence that the intervention moderated the relationship between minority stress and mental health symptoms. That is, even in cases where the intervention may not reduce certain aspects of minority stress, it nevertheless provided youth with tools to cope with those experiences and help prevent subsequent exposure.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Our study is not without limitations. First, we recruited a relatively small sample size in a limited number of schools in one geographic area of the United States. Thus, although some of our findings trended toward significance, we could not detect changes in several of our hypothesized outcome measures, conduct subgroup tests of difference to examine differential impacts (e.g., by race, ethnicity, gender identity), nor look at how school-level structural factors may affect student outcomes. This is a critical challenge of the present study and a subsequent study, with a larger sampling frame, is needed to further understand the relationship between program participation, minority-related stress and behavioral health symptomology. Additionally, recruitment of hard-to-reach youth proved to be successful in this study; nonetheless, we recognize that some youth who are not out to their peers may have been reluctant to participate, and that we may find differing rates of participation in more rural or underserved areas of the United States. Future studies of P&amp;E should be conducted with larger samples to determine its effectiveness in more geographically diverse areas.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par54">Despite limitations, this study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of P&amp;E. The significant findings, despite the relatively small sample size, suggest that the intervention holds promise for reducing experiences of minority stress and mental health symptoms and provides youth with ways to cope with experiences of minority stress. Various reports have identified SGMA as at risk of developing chronic psychopathology and implementing preventive interventions such as P&amp;E early may be crucial for preventing significant health disparities from developing in the first place.</p>
