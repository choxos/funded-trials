                <p>This study evaluated the reasons for not taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) among
women of reproductive age who are disengaged from HIV care (have missed pharmacy pickups
and physician visits), with the goal of identifying strategies for reengagement in HIV
care. Participants were cisgender women (n = 162), 18 to 49 years of age, and who
completed sociodemographic, medical history, reasons why they were not taking ART, mental
health, motivation, and self-efficacy assessments. Latent class analysis was used for
analysis. Women who reported avoidance-based coping (avoid thinking about HIV) had higher
depression (<italic>U</italic> = 608.5, <italic>z</italic> = −2.7, <italic>P</italic> =
.007), lower motivation (<italic>U</italic> = 601, <italic>z</italic> = −2.8,
<italic>P</italic> = .006), and lower self-efficacy (<italic>U</italic> = 644.5,
<italic>z</italic> = −2.4, <italic>P</italic> = .017) than those not using this
maladaptive strategy. As women living with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of
poor health outcomes, interventions focused on the management of depression may improve
HIV outcomes and prevent HIV transmission.</p>

                <p>Reproductive-age women living with HIV are highly vulnerable to poor HIV outcomes and
depression, which is associated with nonadherence to treatment and poor engagement in HIV
care. In a previous study of men living with HIV, avoidance-based coping (avoiding
thinking about having HIV) was linked with depression, low self-efficacy, and reduced odds
of serostatus disclosure.</p>

                <p>This study examined reasons for nonadherence to treatment, including avoidance-based
coping, among reproductive-age women in Argentina who were disengaged from HIV care.
Nonadherent women who reported avoidance-based coping as a reason for nonadherence had
lower motivation, lower self-efficacy, and higher depression than nonadherent women who
did not report avoidance-based coping.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There are almost 40 million people living with HIV worldwide,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and it is estimated that over half of them are women. AIDS-related illnesses are the
leading cause of death among women of reproductive age (defined as 15-49 years of age by the
World Health Organization [WHO])<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> globally, and women have higher rates of adverse events and discontinuation of
commonly prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although rates of engagement in care and
viral suppression are higher among women of reproductive age during pregnancy,
reproductive-age women living with HIV who are not pregnant are highly vulnerable to poor
HIV outcomes and ART side effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr5-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Despite the importance of controlling HIV among women of reproductive potential,
women in this age-group are underrepresented in HIV research, due to issues such as limited
child care services, lack of home support, pregnancy, and difficulty with multidrug management.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Finally, as women living with HIV are most likely to have condom-less sex, strategies
to improve retention in care and adherence to ART among women of reproductive potential are
essential to reduce sexual and perinatal transmission of HIV.</p>
              <p>In Argentina, as in other Latin American countries, although HIV prevalence among women is
lower than among men, it is estimated that there are about 40,000 women of reproductive age
living with HIV. Argentina has met significant milestones in its response to HIV with the
goal of achieving the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS/WHO 90-90-90 objectives.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Access to ART is the highest in Latin America and an adapted test-and-treat approach
has been utilized since 2015. Although ART prescription rates among people diagnosed with
HIV are almost 90% and similar between men and women, rates of viral suppression are

              <p>Mental health conditions, particularly depression, are common among women with HIV, and
depression has been associated with poor engagement in HIV care and nonadherence to ART.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Depression in women has also been associated with HIV serostatus nondisclosure to new

avoid dealing with HIV-related stressors. Among men, coping with HIV infection by avoidance
has been found to mediate the relationship between depression and self-efficacy (one’s
belief in one’s own ability to complete tasks and reach goals) and is associated with a
decreased likelihood of HIV status disclosure.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> As such, avoidance-based coping may also be a pathway by which depression is

              <p>This study examined reasons for nonadherence to prescribed ART among reproductive-age women
in Argentina who were disengaged from HIV care with the goal of identifying strategies for
reengagement. Reengagement in care in this group is essential for prevention of sexual and
perinatal transmission of HIV. Based on previous research in the United States,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> it was hypothesized that avoidance-based coping would be related to increased
depressive symptoms, as well as decreased motivation and self-efficacy, and would be an
underlying reason for ART nonadherence. It was anticipated that findings from this study
could inform psychosocial interventions for reproductive-age women living with HIV to
enhance engagement in HIV care in settings where rates of viral suppression were low,
thereby reducing the likelihood of sexual and perinatal transmission of HIV.</p>

              <p>Data for this cross-sectional study were collected at baseline from Conexiones y Opciones
Positivas en la Argentina 2 (COPA2), a cluster randomized clinical trial of
physician-delivered motivational interviewing to improve retention in care and treatment
adherence among challenging patients living with HIV in Argentina<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> ID: NCT02846350). Before study procedures, approval was
obtained from the institutional review board of University of Miami (20160313) in the United
States and Argentine study sites (Fundacion Huesped FH-22). All patients provided written
informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.</p>
              <p>Participants were recruited from 7 outpatient settings (4 public hospital-based clinics and
3 private clinics) providing HIV care in 4 Argentine urban centers (Buenos Aires, Neuquén,
Rosario, and Cordoba). All but one site that also serves as a maternity center (Rosario) had
patient populations that were more than 50% male. The COPA2 inclusion criteria included: (1)
18 years old or older, (2) diagnosed with HIV for at least 6 months, (3) HIV viral load of
more than 500 copies/mL in the previous 3 months following at least 6 months of receiving
prescription for ART, and (4) disengaged from HIV care based on information collected from
medical and pharmacy records (defined as 3 missed pharmacy pickups in the last 6 months
<italic>or</italic> had not attended a physician visit in more than 12 months). Potential
candidates were identified by study recruiters from clinic records and invited to return to
the clinic to enroll in the study. Candidates provided signed informed consent at
enrollment. Consent included approval for medical record abstraction and review of pharmacy
records. The COPA2 study enrolled both men and women living with HIV; the current study
presents data obtained from cisgender women of reproductive age (18-49 years old) enrolled
in the study (n = 162) and presents baseline data prior to receiving any study-related
intervention.</p>
              <p>Demographic and psychosocial data were collected using an audio computer-assisted

reproductive age in Argentina and may be associated with low adherence due to toxicity

than 12 months and the number of times since ART initiation that the participant stopped

                  <p>A total of 162 women were included in the subsequent analyses. Women were an average of
35.3 (median = 37; standard deviation [SD] = 8.4) years old and had been living with HIV
for 11.9 (median = 11.0; SD = 6.6) years. The majority reported being
single/divorced/widowed (n = 101; 62.3%); however, the majority reported not living
alone (n = 152; 93.8%). About half of the women reported having at least completed high
school (n = 95; 58.6%), were not currently employed (n = 92; 56.8%), and did not have
private health insurance (n = 108; 66.7%). Regarding route of HIV acquisition,
participants reported sex (with cisgender men or transgender women) as the most common
route of HIV infection (n = 92; 56.8%), followed by “don’t know” (<italic>n</italic> =
30; 18.5%), mother-to-child transmission (n = 18; 11.1%), blood transfusion (n = 7;
4.3%), intravenous drug use (n = 3; 1.9%), other (n = 2; 1.2%), or sex with a woman (n =
1; 0.6%). A total of 7 participants (4.3%) reported becoming infected with HIV through
sex with a partner of an unspecified gender, and 2 responses to this question (1.2%)
were missing. One third of the women (n = 53; 32.7%) had a history of an AIDS-associated
event, and women had a mean treatment history of 2.7 ART regimens (median = 2; SD =
1.9). The average log viral load was 4.4 (median = 4.4; SD = 0.9), and less than half of
those participating (n = 74; 45.7%) had been virally suppressed (viral load &lt; 200)
the last time they were on treatment. The mean CD4 count was 328.2 (median = 274; SD =
265.21). Women reported they were prescribed a mean of 3.2 pills per day (median = 3; SD
= 1.7), and under one quarter had been prescribed either EFV (n = 35; 21.6%) and/or
LPV/r (n = 44; 27.2%) in the last regimen.</p>

              <p>This study evaluated nonadherence to prescribed ART among women of reproductive age in
Argentina who were disengaged from HIV care and found that avoidance-based coping (not
wanting to think about HIV) was the most frequent reason for not taking prescribed ART.
Women utilizing avoidance-based coping had more depressive symptoms, lower motivation, and
lower self-efficacy than those not using this maladaptive strategy.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> As such, this constellation of factors (depression, motivation, and self-efficacy)
appears to act as a driver of nonadherence to ART and likely contribute to disengagement
from HIV care, poor HIV outcomes, and sexual and vertical transmission of HIV.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Results from this study complement the understanding of previous research on the
contribution of depression to poor HIV and health outcomes for women of reproductive age
living with HIV and for infants of mothers living with HIV worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="bibr29-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr30-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> This study is however unique as it the first to utilize cluster analysis to clearly
define that avoidance, low self-efficacy, and low motivation are critical drivers likely
influenced by depression among women. The use of this novel statistical analysis allows to
better understand the impact of exposure to multiple risks, so interventions can be targeted
to subgroups that will benefit most, such as in this case, women with avoidance-based
coping. Interestingly, our results using this approach indicate that when there is
avoidance-based coping, depressive symptomatology negatively impacts ART uptake, even when
depressive symptoms are low. However, isolation of the differences between those engaging or
not engaging in avoidance-based coping clearly differentiated factors associated with the
strategy of avoidance. Avoidance, while enabling the individual time to process a stressor,
becomes a liability when it prevents resolution of the problem. Results highlight the
importance of the integration of routine assessment and treatment of depression in HIV care<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> before the patient comes to rely on avoidance as a coping strategy. Therefore,
targeting avoidance-based coping, likely with acceptance- and commitment-based therapies,
may help promote reengagement in care and may, in turn, help prevent the sexual and
perinatal transmission of HIV in this group of women.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Further research is needed to explore the mechanism behind avoidance-based coping and
depression, and how these factors together may impact motivation and self-efficacy, which
have been shown to be important for adherence and reengagement in care.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Interventions to improve HIV health outcomes among women living with HIV in Argentina and
other regions have primarily focused on provision of ART in clinical settings and have
neglected comprehensive reproductive and mental health treatment. Women represent over 50%
of the population living with HIV worldwide and face unique challenges and barriers to HIV care.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Clearly, strategies for improving retention in care and ART adherence are essential
to achieve the goal of controlling the HIV epidemic, and there is a need to understand
barriers to care among the vulnerable population of women of reproductive age.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-2325958219883250" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Despite the importance of our findings and the need to address depressive symptoms in this
population, this study had several limitations. The primary limitation was the small sample
size and the use of a cross-sectional analysis. In addition, the study relied on
self-report, and though using a valid and reliable measure of depressive symptoms (the BDI),
a depression diagnostic tool was not used. Additionally, some information related to HIV
history (number of times they did not see a physician for more than 12 months and number of
times they stopped taking ART for more than 3 months) was sometimes unavailable in the
medical record and in those cases was self-reported, which may be subject to recall
bias.</p>
              <p>This study highlights the importance of integrating mental health care into HIV care for
women facing difficulties in coping with HIV, with the aim of increasing motivation and
self-efficacy and reducing depression, to optimize the benefits of ART. As women living with
HIV experience a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes and mental illness,
gender-specific interventions focused on the treatment of depression could be the gateway to
improving HIV outcomes and preventing HIV transmission.</p>
