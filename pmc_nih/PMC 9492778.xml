                <p id="Par1">The endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 is a central player in the molecular mechanisms leading to degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN), a long-standing target for drug development. As p38Î± is a Rab5 activator, we hypothesized that inhibition of this kinase holds potential as an approach to treat diseases associated with BFCN loss. Herein, we report that neflamapimod (oral small molecule p38Î± inhibitor) reduces Rab5 activity, reverses endosomal pathology, and restores the numbers and morphology of BFCNs in a mouse model that develops BFCN degeneration. We also report on the results of an exploratory (hypothesis-generating) phase 2a randomized double-blind 16-week placebo-controlled clinical trial (Clinical trial registration: NCT04001517/EudraCT #2019-001566-15) of neflamapimod in mild-to-moderate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease in which BFCN degeneration is an important driver of disease expression. A total of 91 participants, all receiving background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, were randomized 1:1 between neflamapimod 40âmg or matching placebo capsules (taken orally twice-daily if weight &lt;80âkg or thrice-daily if weight &gt;80âkg). Neflamapimod does not show an effect in the clinical study on the primary endpoint, a cognitive-test battery. On two secondary endpoints, a measure of functional mobility and a dementia rating-scale, improvements were seen that are consistent with an effect on BFCN function. Neflamapimod treatment is well-tolerated with no study drug associated treatment discontinuations. The combined preclinical and clinical observations inform on the validity of the Rab5-based pathogenic model of cholinergic degeneration and provide a foundation for confirmatory (hypothesis-testing) clinical evaluation of neflamapimod in DLB.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Degeneration of the basal forebrain, the primary source of cholinergic innervation in the brain, occurs in aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related cognitive disorders, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, where basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) dysfunction leading to degeneration is considered to be an important driver of disease expression and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In addition, BFCN degeneration has been proposed to be a major driver of the neurodegenerative process elsewhere, including in the hippocampus in Alzheimerâs disease (AD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Importantly, recent studies have also demonstrated that BFCN loss underpins the gait dysfunction in Parkinsonâs disease (PD), suggesting that therapeutically targeting the cholinergic system could also address certain motor aspects of neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Recent evidence also indicates that correcting the functional deficit in the cholinergic system, thus amplifying physiologic release of acetylcholine, is likely to be more effective than the conventional approach of compensating for BFCN dysfunction by delaying clearance of released acetylcholine with cholinesterase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">A critical pathogenic event in development of BFCN dysfunction and degeneration is impaired nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling, depriving cholinergic neurons of the neurotrophic support necessary for proper functioning and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. NGF signaling is transduced by endocytosis and retrograde trafficking of a maturing Rab5-âsignaling endosomeâ containing the NGF receptor, TrkA, to initiate a transcriptional program. Cholinergic neurons, with long axonal projections throughout the cortex, are particularly vulnerable to disruption of this retrograde signaling process from distant synaptic connections back to the cell body. From a pathogenic mechanistic standpoint, the protein Rab5, a GTPase and master signaling molecule regulating endocytosis and endosome function, is implicated in development of impaired NGF signaling. Both Rab5 hyper-activation and lowered endosome recycling rates impair NGF signaling, partly due to enlargement of endosomes, which slows their retrograde transport and trophic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, leading to cholinergic atrophy in Down syndrome (DS) mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These DS models essentially recapitulate adult-onset basal forebrain cholinergic neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Further, Rab5 hyperactivation in vivo in Rab5 overexpressing transgenic mice causes BFCN degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These findings establish Rab5 as a therapeutic target for BFCN dysfunction. Moreover, results from animal studies indicate that the neurodegeneration of BFCNs is reversible, as the BFCNs do not die with age and disease; rather, they lose cholinergic phenotype and functional properties, and this loss can be reversed by direct NGF infusion to the basal forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Thus, pharmacologically restoring NGF signaling, by targeting Rab5, has the potential to reverse disease progression by increasing numbers of functional cholinergic neurons.</p>
              <p id="Par5">As the alpha isoform of p38Î± kinase is a major Rab5 regulator and activator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and has been implicated in the regulation of retrograde axonal transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that p38Î± inhibition would be a pharmacological approach to treating diseases associated with BFCN dysfunction. Accordingly, we evaluated a specific p38Î± kinase inhibitor, neflamapimod (NFMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, preclinically in a transgenic DS mouse model (Ts2 mouse)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> that demonstrates BFCN degeneration, as well as clinically in a placebo-controlled phase 2a study in patients with DLB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the primary objective of which was to evaluate the effects of neflamapimod on the cognitive domains impacted by the disease. When the clinical study was initiated, neflamapimod had been evaluated in phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, in phase 2a studies in rheumatoid arthritis and AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and in a then-ongoing 24-week 161-participant placebo-controlled phase 2 study in AD (since completed and reported, see Discussion)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Herein we report on evidence of translation of the scientific understanding of mechanisms of cholinergic degeneration to effects on BFCNs both preclinically and clinically, with neflamapimod treatment (1) reversing pathological disease progression in the basal forebrain in the preclinical study in Ts2 mice; and (2) leading to outcomes consistent with a pharmacological effect on the basal forebrain cholinergic system in the clinical study of DLB.</p>

                <title>Neflamapimod treatment of Ts2 mice reverses endosomal pathology and restores number of cholinergic neurons</title>
                <p id="Par6">Ts2 mice, a DS mouse model that develops adult-onset Rab5+ endosomal pathology and cholinergic degeneration in the basal forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and control 2âN (wildtype) mice were treated at approximately six months of age with either neflamapimod (3âmg/kg body weight) or vehicle (1% Pluronic F108), twice daily (BID) by oral gavage, for 28 days. The number and size of Rab5-GTP-positive endosomes, determined by ImageJ analysis, were greater in Ts2 than in wildtype mice while, with neflamapimod treatment, both parameters were normalized to values seen in the 2âN mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Similarly, the intensity ratio of Rab5-GTP (activated form of Rab5) to total Rab5 was significantly higher in vehicle-treated Ts2 than in 2âN mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), was reduced to normal levels with neflamapimod treatment in Ts2 mice, and was not altered in 2âN mice. These results suggest that neflamapimod impacts aberrant, but not physiological, Rab5 activation. In Ts2 mice, basal forebrain neurodegeneration is well established by 6 to 7 months of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and the number of medial septal choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChATâ+â) neurons (i.e., cholinergic neurons) continues to decline as the mice age (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Neflamapimod-treated Ts2 mice had significantly higher numbers of ChAT+ neurons at the end of the four-week treatment period than did vehicle-treated Ts2 mice (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.0037), exhibiting numbers comparable to those in the 2âN mice (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). Notably, in vehicle-treated Ts2 mice, ChAT+ neurons had an abnormal morphology, with neurite swelling (yellow arrows) or atrophy (orange arrow), perikaryal atrophy (red arrows), and below normal ChAT immunoreactivity (green arrows) (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>), while neflamapimod treatment appeared to normalize their morphology (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g, h</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Normalized Rab5+ endosome number/size and restored cholinergic neuronal numbers in Ts2 mice treated with neflamapimod (NFMD).</title><p><bold>a</bold> Representative images of medial septal nucleus (MSN) regions from vehicle-treated wildtype (2âN, <italic>n</italic>â=â4), vehicle-treated Ts2 (<italic>n</italic>â=â4) and NFMD-treated Ts2 (Ts2-NFMD) mice, labeled with Rab5-GTP (red) and Rab5a (green) antibodies; arrows point to the Rab5-positive neurons, which are shown enlarged in the lower panel (scale bar, 15âÎ¼m). <bold>b</bold> The numbers, sizes and areas of Rab5-GTP-positive endosomes determined by Image J analysis [<italic>n</italic>â=â4 mice per group; for number: F(3,12)â=â7.789, R squareâ=â0.661; for 2âN vs Ts2 <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0202, 95% CIâ=ââ1.880, â0.151; for Ts2 vs Ts2-NFMD <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0097, 95% CIâ=â0.273, 2.002; for size: F(3,12)â=â6.939, R squareâ=â0.634, for 2âN vs Ts2 <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0036, 95% CIâ=ââ1.329, â0.269; for area: F(3,12)â=â13.19, R squareâ=â0.767; for 2âN vs Ts2 <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0009; 95% CIâ=ââ3.766, â1.079; for Ts2 vs Ts2-NFMD <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0030, 95% CIâ=â0.7325, 3.419]. <bold>c</bold> The ratio of Rab5-GTP to total Rab5 intensities determined with Image J [<italic>n</italic>â=â4 mice per group; F(3,12)â=â13.23, R squareâ=â0.768; for 2âN vs Ts2 <italic>p</italic>â=â0.001, 95% CIâ=ââ0.537, â0.073; for Ts2 vs Ts2-NFMD <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0002, 95% CIâ=â0.254, 0.719]. <bold>d</bold> The number of stereologically counted ChAT+ neurons in the MSN region of 2âN (<italic>n</italic>â=â27) and Ts2 (<italic>n</italic>â=â28) mice was graphed versus age of mice in months (Linear regression Fâ=â10.16, R squareâ=â0.281, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0037, 95% CIâ=ââ0.259, â0.056 for Ts2; Fâ=â0.548, R squareâ=â0.0215, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.466, 95% CIâ=â-infinity, â3.98)Â for 2N. <bold>e</bold> Representative images of diaminobenzidine (DAB)-stained ChAT+ neurons in the MSN region of 2âN and Ts2 mice treated with either vehicle or NFMD (scale bar, 100âÎ¼m). <bold>f</bold> Quantification of DAB-stained ChAT+ neurons in the MSN region; <italic>n</italic>â=â10 (2âN), <italic>n</italic>â=â11 (2N-NFMD), <italic>n</italic>â=â14 (Ts2) and <italic>n</italic>â=â11 (Ts2-NFMD) mice (F(3, 43)â=â11.10, R squareâ=â0.436, for 2âN <italic>vs</italic> Ts2, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0001, 95% CIâ=â0.588, 1.712; for Ts2 vs Ts2-NFMD <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0037, 95% CIâ=ââ1.331, â207). <bold>g</bold>, <bold>h</bold> Abnormal morphology of ChAT+ neurons was consistently and reproducibly seen in the MSN of Ts2 mice, with swelling (yellow arrows), perikaryal atrophy (red arrows) and below normal ChAT immunoreactivity intensity (green arrows) in the representative images (scale bar,10âÎ¼m).

Behavioral evaluations considered dependent on basal forebrain cholinergic function, novel object recognition (NOR) and open field tests, were examined in a separate cohort of animals. Because of limited availability of Ts2 mice at the time, no vehicle-administered animals could be included in these evaluations. Instead, the behavioral tests were performed both pre- and post- four weeks dosing with neflamapimod and, in addition, 2âN mice were included for comparison. For both the NOR and open field tests, there was a significant difference between 2âN and Ts2 mice at pretreatment that was not apparent at the end of neflamapimod treatment (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d, e</xref>).

                <title>Effect of neflamapimod on the primary outcome measure in an exploratory phase 2a clinical study in DLB</title>
                <p id="Par10">The AscenD-LB study (NCT04001517) was a 91-patient, 16-week, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2a clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate probable DLB [dementia, with at least one core clinical feature of DLB and demonstrated abnormality in dopamine uptake by DaTscanâ¢ (Ioflupane I123 SPECT), consistent with 2017 consensus clinical criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; see also Methods] and receiving cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (&gt;3 months, stable dose &gt;6 weeks). The main objective of this phase 2a study was to evaluate the effects of neflamapimod on the cognitive domains that are impacted in DLB. Accordingly, the primary outcome measure was a study-specific six-test neuropsychological test battery (NTB) that assessed attention (Identification, Detection tests), executive function (Category Fluency, Letter Fluency, One Back accuracy), and visual learning (One Card Learning). Secondary objectives included evaluation of neflamapimod effects on a dementia rating scale, episodic memory, motor function, and neuropsychiatric outcomes. As there was not a pre-specified hypothesis for treatment effect relative to placebo, no formal sample size calculations were performed but, based on prior experience with use of similar cognitive test battery in a prior DLB clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, 40 participants per arm was considered sufficient to provide a first assessment of the ability of neflamapimod to improve cognitive function in patients with DLB.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Patients were randomized 1:1 to either neflamapimod 40âmg capsules or matching placebo and then, based on body weight, assigned to either a twice-daily (BID) [weight &lt;80âkg; 40âmg BID neflamapimod or placebo BID] or thrice-daily (TID) [weightââ¥â80âkg; 40âmg TID neflamapimod or placebo TID] regimen (see Consort Flow Diagram, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This dosing regimen was utilized because, based on available preclinical and clinical data at the time the study was initiated, the target for therapeutic efficacy was a 12âh plasma drug exposure of 100ângâÃâh/mL; and the pharmacokinetic data available at this time predicted that 40âmg BID would achieve that target, but only in patients weighing less than 80âkg (thus requiring 40âmg TID in the higher weight range). In addition, prior clinical data suggested that there was an effect of weight on clearance and that a dose of 40âmg TID in patients weighing &lt;80âkg would exceed a limit imposed at the time by a regulatory agency to provide a ten-fold safety margin to the no-adverse-effect-level in long-term animal toxicity studies.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>CONSORT flow diagram for the AscenD-LB Phase 2a clinical trial.</title><p>CONSORT 2010 Statement flow diagram showing participant flow through each stage of the AscenD-LB phase 2a randomized controlled trial from randomization through to follow-up and data analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2022_32944_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e1090"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par12">All efficacy endpoints were analyzed as change from baseline using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), with baseline as a covariate, over the entire course of the study (i.e., all time points were included in the analysis). Consistent with the objective of evaluating treatment effects relative to placebo, rather than testing hypotheses that treatment was superior to placebo, differences between neflamapimod and placebo, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), from the MMRM analysis are reported. Also reported are <italic>p</italic>-values for the protocol-specified analyses, though not for the purposes of significance (i.e., hypothesis) testing, rather for the purposes of evaluating the strength of evidence for a treatment effect.

                <p id="Par15">The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scale, designed to assess both cognition and function, scores six domains (memory, orientation, judgment &amp; problem solving, community affairs, home &amp; hobbies, and personal care) on a 0â3 scale (total range 0â18, higher scores indicating worse dementia). The CDR-SB was performed at baseline, week 8, and week 16. Comparing all neflamapimod with all placebo, there was improvement with neflamapimod treatment (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.023, drug-placebo differenceâ=ââ0.45, 95%CI:â0.83,â0.06, <italic>d</italic>â=â0.31).</p>

              <p id="Par21">Consistent with our overarching hypothesis, Ts2 (DS) mice with established basal forebrain pathology, when treated with the p38Î± inhibitor neflamapimod, showed decreased Rab5 activation, reversal of Rab5+ endosomal pathology, and, most important, restoration of the number and morphology of cholinergic neurons in the medial septal region of the basal forebrain. As with NGF studies, we interpret the increased cholinergic neuron numbers as restoration of the cholinergic phenotype in neurons that have, otherwise, continued to survive, rather than as a neuro-regenerative effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Supporting that interpretation, p38 MAPK has been implicated in cholinergic differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, inflammation, in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, reversibly reduced ChAT expression in the basal forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Though not a main aim of the Ts2 mouse study, behavioral assessments did indicate a functional impact of increasing the number of cholinergic neurons, with neflamapimod treatment restoring performance to wildtype levels in behavioral tests linked to cholinergic function, the open field and NOR tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In contrast, neflamapimod treatment had only minor effects on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, where the cholinergic system may not be the major determinant of the outcome, as defects in hippocampal function in the DS mouse model may be independent of cholinergic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> and represent fixed structural deficits, including frank neuronal loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Our functional results may also be evaluated in the context of published studies with neflamapimod in rat models, where behavioral outcomes are more readily assessed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. First, neflamapimod reversed deficits in Morris water maze performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, attributed to basal forebrain dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, in aged rats. Second, neflamapimod improved functional recovery after a transient-ischemia induced stroke in rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, with basal forebrain cholinergic function regarded as rate-limiting for the recovery process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Together with these previously reported findings, the effects of neflamapimod in Ts2 mice provide preclinical proof-of-concept for p38Î± inhibition to reverse BFCN dysfunction.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The preclinical mechanistic findings were consistent with our original hypothesis that p38Î± inhibition is an approach to decrease Rab5 activation and reverse the block in endosomal trafficking and signaling. Specifically, neflamapimod treatment decreased Rab5-GTP levels, a marker of Rab5 activation, and reversed the Rab5+endosomal pathology that is a direct histopathological marker of the block in endosomal trafficking underlying the defect in NGF signaling in Ts2 mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In separate experiments, restoration of cholinergic neuron numbers was observed following neflamapimod treatment in Rab5-overexpressing transgenic mice, which otherwise develop basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>; this further supported the activity of neflamapimod on Rab5-mediated cholinergic neuron loss. The beneficial effects were associated with p38Î± inhibition, because neflamapimod treatment normalized levels of activated, i.e., phosphorylated p38Î± (in addition to being activated by upstream kinases, p38Î± auto-activates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>) and lowered levels of its downstream substrates MK2 and MNK1. Furthermore, neflamapimod treatment decreased BACE1 protein levels, consistent with reports that neuronal p38Î± knockout in APP/PS1 (âAlzheimerâsâ) transgenic mice led to decreased BACE1 protein levels, through increased autophagy-lysosome mediated degradation of the BACE1 protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Moreover, in a recent study, p38Î± activity decreased BACE1 levels in synaptic terminals by increasing retrograde axonal transport of BACE1 to lysosomes for degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Thus, the finding that neflamapimod decreases BACE1 protein levels in Ts2 mice provides further evidence that the drug improves retrograde axonal transport of endosomes, the fundamental pathophysiologic defect being targeted with our therapeutic approach. Finally, the reduction in Î²CTF levels, resulting from decreased BACE1 protein levels, is also a likely contributor to the effects on cholinergic degeneration and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">With a mechanistic foundation provided by the animal studies, the results of the clinical study in DLB, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by substantial basal forebrain cholinergic loss provides an opportunity to understand whether the preclinical results with respect to BFCN function could be translated to the clinic. While there was no apparent treatment effect on the primary outcome measure, an NTB designed to evaluate effects on the cognitive deficits most prominent in DLB, when interpreted in the context of the recent advances in the understanding of the network connections and function of the basal forebrain cholinergic system as well mechanistic insights from the preclinical study, a number of the findings in the neflamapimod clinical study reflect outcomes that would be predicted for a drug acting pharmacologically against BFCN dysfunction. For example, the tests within the NTB most responsive to treatment with neflamapimod measure visual attention, while in a recent report mapping changes in cholinergic networks in DLB using PET imaging with an acetylcholinesterase transporter ligand, functional networks related to alertness and visual attention were most prominently disrupted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In addition basal forebrain pathology (volume by MRI) has been linked to attention and attentional deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. The results in the TUG test, showing gait improvement relative to placebo, may be particularly relevant with regard to a potential effect on the cholinergic system because recent clinical translational publications have connected basal forebrain pathology (assessed as NBM atrophy by MRI) to gait impairment in PD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. That is, gait dysfunction is a clinical correlate and potentially clinical biomarker of basal forebrain pathology. In addition, in a recent study in patients with DLB or PD undergoing deep brain stimulation of the NBM, a prominent functional network from the NBM to the supplemental motor cortex was defined and proposed to be involved in volitional control of movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, the various translational studies in the literature suggest that the apparent treatment effects on the TUG test may be providing direct support for activity of neflamapimod against pathologic BFCN dysfunction, akin to its effects on BFCN pathology in the preclinical study; evidence that is independent of effects on cognition. Moreover, as cholinesterase inhibitors can improve cognition but generally provide no benefit to motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, one hypothesis for the relative lack of effects on the cognitive endpoints (relative to that seen in the TUG) is that the cholinesterase inhibitors had provided much of the cognitive benefit possible in the study, which limited the ability to demonstrate a cognitive effect, but did not impact the ability to demonstrate motor function effects on the TUG test. The same theoretical argument would apply the CDR-SB, which also has the ability to demonstrate motor function effects through the functional domains (e.g., personal care). Consistent with that notion, the most prominent treatment effect relative to placebo within the individual domains of the CDR-SB was on the personal care domain (Suppl. Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Otherwise, as basal forebrain pathology (volume of Nucleus basalis of Meynert by MRI) is strongly linked to the dementia (i.e., cognitive dysfunction) in DLB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, in this context, and not necessarily in other dementias, treatment effects on the basal forebrain would be expected to be reflected in the CDR-SB.</p>
              <p id="Par24">To further explore the translational science, plasma levels of a biomarker for the presence of AD co-pathology (tau phosphorylated at position 181, ptau181)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> were measured in baseline samples and the results evaluated by the presence or absence of AD co-pathology (i.e., plasma ptau181 &lt; or â¥â2.2âpg/mL). This analysis tested the concept that the most pure evaluation of a drug acting on BFCN function would be to assess treatment effects in patients with DLB in whom BFCN pathology is predominant over AD pathology, which is represented by patients who do not have AD co-pathology (patients with DLB, otherwise, consistently have basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>). Indeed, in those patients within the current study who do not exhibit AD co-pathology (i.e., those with baseline plasma ptau181â&lt;â2.2âng/mL) the magnitude of the treatment effect was particularly high and greater than in patients with mixed DLB-AD pathology (Suppl. Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). These findings provide additional support both for a pharmacological effect on the basal forebrain and for that effect being by neflamapimod, as there would be no reason for treatment effects due to chance to segregate by the presence or absence of AD co-pathology.</p>
              <p id="Par25">All this being said, there are no established plasma, cerebrospinal or neuroimaging-based biomarkers of BFCN pathology and/or function. In addition, p38 MAPK has a wide number of functions in the CNS and is implicated in the pathogenicity of neurodegenerative processes outside of cholinergic degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Therefore, our results do not exclude neflamapimod having pharmacological activity on other neuronal or cell types (e.g., microglia) and biological effects other than those on endolysosomal dysfunction (e.g., on neuroinflammation), which may contribute to its clinical activity. Indeed, p38 MAPK is traditionally considered to be a target for reducing inflammation in the CNS, through reducing cytokine production from microglia and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. However, in neurons, where p38Î± expression is low in the healthy state, its expression is increased under conditions of cellular stress and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>; indeed in the Ts2 mouse model, phospho-p38Î± levels are higher than that in wild-type mice. And, more recent studies in animal disease models with the gene for the alpha isoform (MAPK14) knocked out specifically in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, or using specific p38Î± inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, argue that neuronal p38Î± is also a relevant therapeutic target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Further, as discussed below, the plasma drug concentrations achieved in the current clinical study are lower than that affecting cytokine production but consistent with that required for a neuronal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">While, at the start of the clinical study, 40âmg BID administered to lower-weight patients and 40âmg TID administered to higher-weight patients were anticipated to lead to similar results, exploratory analyses of the 40âmg TID recipients separately showed greater treatment effects relative to placebo, including improvement relative to placebo on the NTB and Attention Composites, compared to those seen in the analysis that included the 40âmg BID recipients. Although these results with twenty 40âmg TID participants require confirmation in a larger clinical study, the differential in treatment outcomes with 40âmg BID vs. 40âmg TID is consistent with the current understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship of neflamapimod. In terms of pharmacokinetics, prior assumptions regarding a weight effect were proven false in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the AD study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and the plasma drug levels with 40âmg BID were 30% lower than originally expected in the current study, despite the weight-dependent dosing regimen (i.e. TID in â¥80âkg and BID in &lt;80âkg participants). Moreover, pharmacokinetic modeling indicates that the combined effect of a 50% increase in daily dose levels and the more frequent dosing frequency lead to a two-fold higher plasma trough drug concentration (C<sub>trough</sub>) with 40âmg TID (median C<sub>trough</sub>â=â6âng/mL), compared with 40âmg BID (3âng/mL). Of note, C<sub>trough</sub> was the pharmacokinetic parameter that best correlated to clinical efficacy in the AD trial, with evidence of a threshold effect for efficacy. Specifically, while 40âmg BID (only dose level evaluated in the AD trial) did not demonstrate clinical efficacy, there was evidence for clinical efficacy in the â¼25% of neflamapimod participants in which 40âmg BID achieved a C<sub>trough</sub>â&gt;â4âng/mL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Finally, the average plasma drug concentration achieved with 40âmg TID was equivalent to the EC<sub>50</sub> for pharmacological activity in cellular systems (other than for anti-inflammatory effects, for which the EC<sub>50</sub> is two-fold higher)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, â¼10âng/mL, and the estimated plasma drug exposure and C<sub>trough</sub> with 40âmg TID are similar to those achieved in preclinical pharmacology studies in the rat, the species in which there is sufficient pharmacokinetic information to make a comparison to human pharmacokinetics.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In the clinical study, no improvement was seen on the cognitive endpoint most dependent on normal hippocampal function, the ISLT, which measures episodic memory, including at the 40âmg TID dose level. This contrasts with the apparent effects of 40âmg TID on the Attention Composite and on the NTB composite, where the cognitive domains assessed are considered to be more closely associated with the cholinergic system. The findings are consistent with cholinesterase inhibitors in AD showing pro-cognitive effects on attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> while showing minimal to no discernible effects on recall outcome measures that are similar to the ISLT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">As the great majority of individuals with DS develop early onset AD (EOAD) and there is increased APP expression in both human DS and in the DS mouse, the Ts2 mouse model is regarded as a model for EOAD. While our clinical trial was conducted in patients with DLB, EOAD, and DLB both have major pathology in the basal forebrain cholinergic system and similar cortical atrophy patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Î±-synuclein, the protein constituent of Lewy bodies, impairs retrograde axonal transport and BDNF signaling, in association with Rab5 and Rab7 accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, and reducing endogenous Î±-synuclein in an APP transgenic mouse decreases Rab5 protein levels and prevents degeneration of cholinergic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Conversely, in mouse models of DLB, amyloid beta (AÎ²) plaques promote seeding and spreading of Î±-synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> and immunotherapy against AÎ² and Î±-synuclein were additive against cholinergic fiber loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. This literature, combined with our findings, suggests that, though the initiating factors may be different in EAOD and DLB, there is a common pathogenic process to cholinergic degeneration involving Rab5.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In conclusion, the preclinical and clinical results are consistent with neflamapimod being pharmacologically active against BFCN dysfunction, providing a foundation for hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) clinical evaluation of neflamapimod in diseases, such as DLB, with clinically consequential pathology in the basal forebrain. Beyond implications specific to neflamapimod, our findings inform on the impaired NGF-signaling based pathogenic model of cholinergic degeneration and the Ts2 DS mouse as a translational platform for target validation, for drug discovery and development, and for obtaining preclinical proof-of-concept support for therapeutic approaches to treating basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction and degeneration associated with a range of neurologic disorders.</p>

                <p id="Par42">Study EIP19-NFD-501 was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, proof-of-principle study of neflamapimod 40âmg or matching placebo conducted at 24 centers, 22 in the US and 2 in the Netherlands (see Acknowledgements for list of investigators). The first participant was enrolled on 30 September 2019 and the last visit occurred on 14 July 2020. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Applicable local/central ethics committee or IRB approvals were obtained. All participants provided written informed consent and were not compensated. IRB/Ethics approvals provided by Copernicus Group IRB (CGIRB, Cary, NC), Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB, Puyallup, WA), Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (Rochester MN), Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (New York, NY), Cleveland Clinic IRB (Cleveland, OH), and Foundation Beoordeling Ethiek Biomedisch Onderzoek (BEBO, Assen, the Netherlands). The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT04001517 on 28 June, 2019 and in the EU Clinical Trials Register on 26 June, 2019 with EudraCT Number of 2019-001566-15.

The conduct of the study and preparation of the manuscript are in accordance with ICJME guidelines.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Participants included men and women aged â¥55 years with probable DLB, consistent with current consensus criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, specifically at least one core clinical feature (fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, REM sleep disorder, and/or parkinsonism) and a positive DaTscanâ¢<sup>T</sup>â<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; an MMSE score of 15â28, inclusive; and who were receiving cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (having received such therapy for greater than 3 months and on a stable dose for at least 6 weeks at the time of randomization) during Screening were eligible. Per the protocol, if the participant had a negative DaTscanâ¢, but had a historical PSG-verified RBD, the participant qualified (six participants qualified on this basis). In addition, if a patient qualified on the basis of a positive DaTscanâ¢ and only one core clinical feature, that core clinical feature could not be parkinsonism. Determination of whether the participant met eligibility criteria, including whether at least one core clinical feature was present, was made by the site principal investigator.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Following completion of informed consent procedures, participants entered the Screening phase of the study. One to two Screening visits were planned, during which safety screening measures were undertaken, practice cognitive tests were performed, and the required diagnosis and cognitive impairment was confirmed. All screening assessments were to be conducted within 21 days of Day 1 (first dose of study drug), with the extension to 35 days allowed if a DaTscanâ¢ was required to determine study eligibility.</p>
                <p id="Par45">After eligibility was confirmed and before the first dose of study drug, participants were randomized via an interactive web-based response system provided by Suvoda LLC, Conshohocken PA, USA, which automatically generated the random code. The neflamapimod: placebo randomization ratio was 1:1 and stratified by International Shopping List Test Total Recall score at Baseline (&lt;21 vs. â¥21), i.e., by whether patients have an episodic memory defect at baseline or not. The randomization block size was 6 within each strata.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Neflamapimod and placebo capsules were identical in appearance. Capsules were in blister strips and packaged into kits containing two weeks supply. Each kit was labeled with a unique identifier assigned by the vendor and the specific kit(s) to be administered to a participant at a given visit was allocated by the interactive web-based response system. Patients, caregivers, investigators, outcome assessors and all other personnel involved in the conduct of the clinical trial were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Participants s followed the BID regimen if weighing &lt;80âkg or the TID regimen if weighing â¥80âkg. Doses were taken within 30âmin following a meal or snack (i.e., morning, mid-day (TID only), and evening meals) at least 3âh apart and at approximately the same times each day throughout the study. Dosing started on Day 1, following completion of all Baseline procedures. During the treatment period, subjects attended study center visits on Days 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112. Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, some of these visits were permitted to be held remotely due to local restrictions to travel and in-clinic visits.</p>
                <p id="Par48">As this was an exploratory trial and there was no prior experience with neflamapimod in patients with DLB upon which to base assumptions of treatment effect, no formal sample size calculation was performed. However, based on prior experience with NTB in clinical studies, 40 subjects per treatment arm was thought to provide a reasonably robust first assessment of whether neflamapimod improves cognitive function in patients with DLB. Accordingly, the study protocol specified that a total of approximately 80 subjects were planned to be enrolled, of whom 40 were planned to receive neflamapimod and 40 were planned to receive placebo.</p>

                <p id="Par51">Secondary objectives included to (1) evaluate effects on cognition and function, as assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB); (2) evaluate effects on motor function, as assessed by the Timed Up and Go test; (3) evaluate effects on episodic memory, as assessed by the International Shopping List Test (ISLT); (4) evaluate the effects on general cognition, as assessed by the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE); and (5) evaluate effects on select domains of the 10-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10), including depression (dysphoria), anxiety, hallucinations, and agitation/aggression. At study start, quantitative EEG was included as an additional endpoint but results are not reported due to the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on collection of this measure. With the closure of EEG laboratories to elective evaluations, only approximately one-third of patients were able to have both baseline and week 16 EEG recordings.</p>

                <title>Clinical study statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par52">Except for the cognitive tests within the Cogstate Battery (four within NTB, and the ISLT) all data were captured by Worldwide Clinical Trials via an electronic data capture (EDC) and, after all queries were resolved and database was locked, SAS datasets were provided to Anoixis corporation for statistical analysis. The data from the Cogstate tests were processed at Cogstate and provided directly to the study statistician at Anoixis Corporation (Natick, MA, USA). S-PLUS (Version 8.2), R (Version 3.6.3 or higher) or SAS (Version 9.3 or higher) were utilized for the statistical analysis. The Efficacy Population used for efficacy analyses, consistent with the intent-to-treat (ITT) principles included all participants who have a baseline and at least one on-study assessment of the efficacy parameter (i.e., modified intent-to-treat population, mITT).</p>
                <p id="Par53">Due to the various scales among different tests in the NTB and the need to have equal weights for deriving composite score metrics performance on each, the tests were standardized relative to baseline data from all randomized subjects (i.e., the individual test core was converted to a z-score by subtracting the study sample mean at baseline from the score and dividing by the standard deviation (SD) of the study sample baseline). The NTB composite z-score was calculated as the average of the z-scores from the component of the six individual tests in the composite. For the purposes of facilitating further understanding of the drug effects on the cholinergic system, an exploratory Attention Composite endpoint, made up of the two tests in NTB that evaluate information processing speed, the Identification and Detection tests, was calculated and evaluated.</p>
                <p id="Par54">As pre-specified in the protocol, the analyses of all efficacy endpoints (primary, secondary, and exploratory) used a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis method, without imputation of missing values, with change from baseline as the dependent variable, and with a fixed effect on treatment extended to baseline composite score and study visit as covariates. There was a fixed effect on treatment that was extended to baseline composite score and study visit. The interaction term (i.e., scheduled visit by treatment) was considered. Per the protocol, as there was no stated hypothesis for treatment effect, no p-values are provided and instead differences from placebo from the MMRM analysis, with 95% confidence intervals, are reported. In addition, Cohenâs d effect size for each outcome measure was calculated and is reported.</p>

              <p>The Ts2 mouse study was conceived of by R.A.N. and designed by Y.J. with input from R.A.N., J.J.A. and U.A.G. Y.J. supervised by R.A.N., organized and led the conduct of the preclinical study, and conducted the majority of the collection and analysis of the data from that study. P.H.S., S.D., S.M., D.-S.Y., M.P., and J.P. conducted clinical aspects (animal husbandry, drug administration, etc.) of the Ts2 mouse study. PHS also conducted the behavioral studies, J.P. performed the western blot analysis of brain tissue, and CB and JFS conducted the immunocytochemistry and ChAT+ neuronal analysis. S.S. and B.S.B. conducted and analyzed the LTP studies. A.P. collected the Rab5-GTP images and provided scientific input to various aspects of the Ts2 mouse study. The clinical study was conceived of by J.J.A. and designed by J.J.A., P.S., N.D.P., and J.E.H.; with input from P.M. and K.B. The NTB was designed by J.E.H. and P.M. constructed the statistical approach to analyzing the NTB composite (i.e. construct of z-scores). J.J.A. was the sponsor lead for the clinical study, and the study was conducted under the clinical project leadership of A.G. and K.B. S.N.G. and A.W.L. were clinical investigators in the study and lead investigators in the US and Netherlands, respectively. The plasma ptau181 evaluations were conducted in the laboratory of CET. H.-M.C. conducted all the statistical analyses of the clinical study data. The manuscript was largely drafted by Y.J. and J.J.A., under the supervision and leadership of R.A.N. and it was finalized by J.J.A. with substantial input from R.A.N., U.A.G., S.N.G., and P.M. The clinical sections of the manuscript were also reviewed by N.P., A.W.F., and P.S.</p>
