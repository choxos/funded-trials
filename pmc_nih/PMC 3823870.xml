              <abstract>
                <p>Despite the success of vaccines against some microbial pathogens, their utility in the prevention and treatment of cancer has thus far been limited. We have previously demonstrated that vaccination with dendritic cells activated with the TLR-4 ligand LPS and IFN-γ promotes an antigen-specific anti-tumor response that prevents tumor recurrence. To evaluate this mechanistically, we here studied the effects of this TLR-activated DC on regulatory T cell activity. Dendritic cells activated with LPS and IFN- γ negated the effects of regulatory T cells on responder cell proliferation. Restoration of responder cell proliferation was noted when TLR-activated dendritic cells were separated from both regulators and responders by a semi-permeable membrane. The effect is therefore mediated by a soluble factor but was independent of both IL-6 and IL-12. Furthermore, the soluble mediator appeared to act at least in part on the regulators themselves rather than responder cells exclusively. Because recent studies have demonstrated conversion of T regulatory cells into IL-17-producing effectors, we further questioned whether the TLR-activated dendritic cell would induce cytokine production and effector function in our system. We found that regulators produced a substantial amount of IFN- γ in the presence of TLR-activated dendritic cells but not immature dendritic cells. IFN-γ production was associated with upregulation of the Th1 transcriptional regulator T-bet, and a significant fraction of IFN-γ-producing regulators coexpressed T-bet and FoxP3. While the effects of the LPS-activated dendritic cell on responder cell proliferation were IL-12 independent, upregulation of T-bet was inhibited by a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody. Collectively, these and prior data suggest that varying innate immune signals may direct the phenotype of the immune response in part by inhibiting suppressor T cells and promoting differentiation of these regulators into particular subsets of effectors.</p>

              <p>Dendritic cells act as surveyors highly active in antigen uptake, processing, and presentation, and they are chiefly responsible for the sensitization of naïve T cells <xref rid="pone.0074698-Hart1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-Steinman1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently, the role of the dendritic cell in the initiation of the immune response has been magnified through the discovery of pattern recognition receptors <xref rid="pone.0074698-Palm1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Iwasaki1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is now clear that presenting cells bear receptors (including Toll-like receptors [TLR]) that recognize generalized molecular patterns shared by various classes of microorganisms. Signaling through Toll-like receptors activates the immune response through multiple mechanisms; Toll ligands not only activate presenting cells, but also inhibit regulatory cells that otherwise suppress the adaptive response. Most notably, signaling through Toll-like receptors TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-8, and TLR-9 has been shown to reverse suppression by immunoregulatory CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (referred to here as T<sub>regs</sub>) <xref rid="pone.0074698-Porrett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-Urry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p>A proposed breakthrough for anti-tumor vaccines was the utilization of tumor antigen-bearing dendritic cells. Given their central role in initiating immunity, administration of dendritic cells bearing tumor peptides carries the potential to generate a vigorous tumor-specific immune response. Dendritic cells have been used as immunotherapeutics in multiple clinical trials with varying success, and ideal strategies for activating, targeting, and delivering these cells are not yet fully elucidated <xref rid="pone.0074698-Koski1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p>We have previously detailed our clinical results using a TLR-4-activated dendritic cell vaccine to engender an antigen-specific immune response and prevent recurrence of HER-2/<italic>neu</italic>-positive ductal carcinoma in situ <xref rid="pone.0074698-Czerniecki1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Given that Toll signals have been shown to inhibit T<sub>reg</sub> function, we hypothesized that the clinical efficacy of this vaccine may derive in part from its effects on regulatory T cells. Here, we demonstrate that the TLR-activated dendritic cell vaccine not only inhibits T<sub>reg</sub> effects on responder cells but also converts the regulators themselves into IFN-γ-producing effectors. Both effects occur via soluble mediators, but distinct signals appear to govern T<sub>reg</sub> inactivation versus conversion into Th1-like effectors. While the capacity of TLR signaling to inhibit T<sub>reg</sub> function has been shown, conversion into Th1-like cells has not been demonstrated clearly. Elucidating the mechanism of this Toll-activated dendritic cell vaccine raises new perspectives regarding how T<sub>regs</sub> are integrated into global immunity and illustrates a property potentially desirable in the development of future immunotherapies.</p>

                <p>To test this hypothesis, we compared the capacity of human CD4+CD25+ T cells to inhibit the proliferation of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes to TCR stimulation (anti-CD3) in the presence of immature dendritic cells (iDC) versus DC1 dendritic cells. 1.25×10<sup>5</sup> sorted CD4+CD25+ T cells were combined with 2.5×10<sup>5</sup> CFSE-labeled unfractionated lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8 positive) and 1×10<sup>5</sup> immature dendritic cells. We found that the proliferative response of both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells at day 5 was inhibited in the presence versus the absence of T<sub>regs</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g001">Figure 1A&amp;B</xref>). Proliferation of sorted CD4+CD25− T cells was similarly inhibited excluding the possibility that this result was purely an artifact of using unfractionated responders (data not shown). By contrast, inclusion of DC1 dendritic cells matured using IFN-γ and LPS restored the proliferation of both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells despite the presence of regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g001">Figure 1C&amp;D</xref>). Responder proliferation in the presence of T<sub>regs</sub> and DC1 dendritic cells was similar to that in the absence of the regulatory population. To quantify these differences, we capitalized on the successive halving of fluorescence intensity characteristic of CFSE to calculate the number of mitoses per 10<sup>4</sup> cells as has been done elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0074698-Lyons1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Porrett2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

                <p>We next attempted to characterize the mechanism by which the DC1 vaccine inhibits T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression. First we assessed whether the vaccine inhibits T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression by inducing apoptosis in the regulatory T cell complement. The abundance of evidence collectively suggests that T<sub>reg</sub> sensitivity to apoptosis is defined in part by the surrounding microenvironment including both TCR signals and cytokines present <xref rid="pone.0074698-Yolcu1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. These environmental factors are admittedly simplified in this <italic>in vitro</italic> system. However, the ability to distinguish T<sub>regs</sub> from other cell populations in this assay allows us to more clearly evaluate whether T<sub>reg</sub> apoptosis is significantly increased in the presence of the DC1 vaccine.</p>
                <p>To test whether DC1 dendritic cells induce cell death to neutralize T<sub>regs</sub>, we co-cultured sorted CD4+CD25+ T cells with immature versus DC1 dendritic cells and compared the expression of the apoptotic markers Annexin-V and 7-AAD after 24 hours. We chose 24 hours as our time point with the presumption that proliferative differences noted at day 5 would result from apoptotic events occurring far earlier. After 24 hours of culture, we found that the expression of both Annexin-V and 7-AAD was similar amongst T<sub>regs</sub> co-cultured with either dendritic cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>; <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.2 for the Annexin<sup>+</sup>/7-AAD<sup>+</sup> and Annexin<sup>−</sup>/7AAD<sup>−</sup> groups).

                <p>Having established that the effect of DC1 cells on T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression is likely not due to apoptosis, we next questioned whether this effect was cell-contact dependent or mediated by soluble factors. To do so, we again co-cultured CFSE-labeled effector cells with unlabeled CD4+CD25+ T cells in the presence of immature dendritic cells. This time we added alternate dendritic cell populations separated by a semi-permeable Transwell® membrane. When an additional complement of immature dendritic cells was added to the Transwell® membrane, there was no effect on suppression in the presence of iDC. However, when the DC1 population was added to the Transwell® membrane, we observed a break in T<sub>reg</sub> mediated suppression that was similar to that seen when T<sub>regs</sub> were co-cultured directly with DC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To control for the possibility that DC1 dendritic cells themselves migrated through the Transwell® to break suppression, we co-cultured regulatory T cells and CFSE-labeled effectors in the absence of dendritic cells but added DC1 cells separated by the membrane. Very little proliferation was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Quantitatively, the proliferative response noted when DC1 cells were added to the Transwell membrane differed significantly from that seen in the presence of iDC alone and approached that observed when DC1 were added directly to the coculture. In fact, there was no significant difference in proliferation when DC1 were added to the Transwell® versus directly to the co-culture. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.037 for iDC alone versus iDC with DC1 in Transwell®; <italic>P</italic> = 0.15 for DC1 alone versus iDC with DC1 in Transwell®).

                <p>In our view, the two most likely soluble mediators for the break in suppression are IL-12 and IL-6. The DC1 population secretes a large amount of IL-12 which is principally involved in Th1 immunity <xref rid="pone.0074698-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, while IL-6 has previously been shown to be central to LPS-mediated T<sub>reg</sub> inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0074698-Pasare1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. We therefore tested whether neutralization of IL-6 or IL-12 would restore the inhibitory effects of T<sub>regs</sub> in the presence of DC1 dendritic cells. We found that the proliferation of effectors in the presence of T<sub>regs</sub> and DC1 dendritic cells was minimally affected by inclusion of neutralizing antibodies to IL-12 and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g003">Figures 3E, 3F</xref>). Taken together with the Transwell® experiments, these data suggest that a soluble factor other than IL-6 and IL-12 mediates the break in suppression effected by DC1 cells.</p>

                <p>We first cultured sorted CD4+CD25+ T cells or CFSE-labeled effector cells in equal parts culture medium and medium transferred from DC1 dendritic cell cultures.

We found that pre-treating responders with DC1 media had no effect on T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

                <p>Recent studies in several experimental models have shown that dendritic cells of various phenotypes are capable of converting regulatory T cells into antigen-specific autoimmune effectors <xref rid="pone.0074698-Radhakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Baban1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Mechanistically, this typically involves downregulation of the transcriptional regulator FoxP3 and upregulation of effector cytokines. Most consistently noted is conversion of T<sub>regs</sub> into IL-17-producing effector cells that likely mediate Th17 immunity <xref rid="pone.0074698-Radhakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-Beriou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We thus questioned whether the break in suppression noted here reflects simple deactivation of regulatory T cells or their conversion into effectors. Given that DC1 dendritic cells exhibit robust production of IL-12 and are strong inducers of Th1 immunity, we hypothesized that they would more likely secrete IFN-γ than IL-17.</p>
                <p>To test our hypothesis, we co-cultured T<sub>regs</sub> or CD4+CD25− effectors with immature versus DC1 dendritic cells at the typical 1.25∶1 ratio and measured cytokine production using ELISA. We found that both T<sub>regs</sub> and effectors co-cultured with immature dendritic cells made essentially no IFN-γ. However, both populations made detectable amounts of IFN-γ when co-cultured with DC1 dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To validate that the cytokine measured was produced by the T cells and not the dendritic cell complement, we harvested cells following co-culture and evaluated the intracellular production of IFN-γ. We found that a significant fraction of CD4+ T cells were IFN-γ-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, a much smaller number of CD11c-positive dendritic cells were cytokine-positive (data not shown).

                <p>A fair percentage of the sorted CD4+CD25+ population is FoxP3-negative (approximately 20%). It is therefore plausible that the FoxP3+ cells to which suppression is best ascribed are simply deactivated here and that cytokine production instead comes predominantly from this FoxP3-negative cohort. To exclude this possibility, we cocultured CD4+CD25+ T<sub>regs</sub> with immature versus DC1 dendritic cells and simultaneously evaluated intracellular expression of both FoxP3 and IFN-γ. We found that a considerable fraction of regulators cocultured with DC1 dendritic cells coexpressed both FoxP3 and IFN-γ.

                <p>These data show that production of IFN-γ by CD4+CD25+ T cells co-cultured with DC1 is correlated with upregulation of T-bet especially amongst FoxP3-positive cells. These data also further discount the possibility that cytokines detected by ELISA are generated by expanding FoxP3 negative CD4+CD25+ T cells. In our view, the fact that the majority of T-bet-positive cells are also FoxP3-positive suggests that regulatory T cells are converted into cytokine-producing effectors; less likely but not completely excluded is that FoxP3 negative cells both upregulate FoxP3 and become unilaterally responsible for the cytokine detected. That T<sub>regs</sub> transitioning to effectors at least transiently express multiple transcriptional regulators has been reported in conversion to Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0074698-Beriou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Because IL-12 is critical to Th1 differentiation and subsequent production of IFN-γ, we questioned whether the conversion of regulators to IFN-γ-producing cells noted here was IL-12 dependent. Although we have shown that DC1 dendritic cells negate the effects of T<sub>regs</sub> on responder cell proliferation in IL-12-independent fashion, it is feasible that different signals govern conversion to effectors. We therefore co-cultured T<sub>regs</sub> with DC1 dendritic cells in the presence of a neutralizing anti-IL-12 antibody and evaluated expression of FoxP3 and T-bet. In contrast to our prior observation, we found that the neutralizing antibody did inhibit T-bet upregulation which was reduced in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). There was no significant difference in T-bet upregulation when the neutralizing antibody was included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074698-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.21 for iDC versus DC1/anti-IL-12)</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have previously detailed our clinical results employing a monocyte-derived, LPS-activated, HER-2/<italic>neu</italic>-expressing dendritic cell immunotherapeutic agent against HER-2/<italic>neu</italic>-positive ductal carcinoma in situ <xref rid="pone.0074698-Czerniecki1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Prior studies have demonstrated that signals through a variety of Toll-like receptors including TLR-4 are capable of inhibiting regulatory T cells. Thus, we here hypothesized that our dendritic cell vaccine engenders a potent immune response in part by deactivating regulatory T cells.</p>
              <p>We first demonstrated that CD4+CD25+ T cells inhibit effector T cell proliferation in the presence of immature dendritic cells. We then illustrated a break in T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression in the presence of the DC1 vaccine, as CFSE-positive effectors exhibit robust proliferation despite the presence of the regulatory complement. This effect occurred across a semi-permeable membrane and thus was cell contact-independent. The use of CFSE and more specifically the labeling of effector cells alone is a central aspect of this experimental model. Proliferation assays used to demonstrate suppression in many other studies suffer from their reliance on tritiated thymidine. Numerous reports demonstrate that regulatory T cells are not completely anergic and in fact have significant proliferative potential especially in the context of inflammatory signals <xref rid="pone.0074698-Brinster1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Klein1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Assays based on tritiated thymidine cannot account for regulatory cell proliferation making the data difficult to interpret. Our CFSE-based assay tracks proliferation specifically amongst effector cells and directly compares their proliferation in the presence/absence of T<sub>regs</sub> and varying dendritic cell populations. In doing so, it eliminates the possibility that proliferation by CD4+CD25+ regulators promotes misinterpretation of results.</p>
              <p>A number of recent studies have demonstrated that a variety of Toll-like receptors including TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-8, and TLR-9 can abrogate T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression <xref rid="pone.0074698-Porrett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>-<xref rid="pone.0074698-Urry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Perhaps of most relevance to our own study is that of Pasare and Medzhitov <xref rid="pone.0074698-Pasare1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These authors demonstrated that dendritic cells activated with LPS secrete soluble factor(s) that release effector cells from suppression by CD4+CD25+ T cells. IL-6 was required for this effect but appeared to act synergistically with one or more other cytokines. Our results are largely compatible with these findings but extend them in a number of respects. First, our study was conducted using human cell populations including a dendritic cell currently in use in immunotherapy. This translates the prior findings directly to the clinical venue. Secondly, while these authors added LPS directly to dendritic cells to induce their effect, our study shows that dendritic cells activated with LPS then transferred to co-cultures containing T<sub>regs</sub> and effectors remain capable of breaking suppression. This finding indicates an enduring effect on the APC and suggests prolonged secretion of a soluble mediator(s) capable of inhibiting regulators. Further, the suggestion that LPS breaks T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated suppression by acting on the suppressor population or effectors directly is excluded here. Rather, it is the LPS-activated dendritic cell that mediates the effects. Third, our study demonstrates an effect which is IL-6 and IL-12-independent but appears mediated by a soluble factor. It is plausible that this factor synergizes with IL-6 in the aforementioned study. Lastly, our data indicate that the T<sub>reg</sub> population here is not only temporarily deactivated, but may also contribute to developing immunity through conversion into T-bet-positive, IFN-γ-secreting effectors.</p>
              <p>The latter finding in concert with those of other groups suggests a new paradigm for the integration of regulatory T cells into the immune milieu. T<sub>regs</sub> are currently viewed as principal mediators of peripheral tolerance that control inflammatory immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. How a productive immune response is initiated despite the presence and activity of these cells is not entirely certain. Studies demonstrating T<sub>reg</sub> inhibition in the context of inflammation suggests one model—that inflammatory signals encountered in the setting of pathogenic insult deactivate regulators to initiate immunity. Of note in this regard is our finding that a TLR-activated dendritic cell restores proliferation of responder cells despite the presence of T<sub>regs</sub>. Recent studies illustrating conversion of T<sub>regs</sub> into antigen-specific Th17 cells extend this model by suggesting that T<sub>regs</sub> may play an active role in the immune response rather than simply bystanding <xref rid="pone.0074698-Radhakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Our data support this postulate as well. However, in our model, the Toll-activated dendritic cell predominantly secretes IFN-γ and thus better reflects a Th1 cell. Interestingly, this finding unlike the effect noted on the proliferative response was IL-12-dependent. Collectively, these data raise several possibilities regarding the function of regulatory T cells in the developing immune response. First is that distinct signals direct cessation of T<sub>reg</sub> activity versus conversion into cytokine-producing effectors. It is plausible that signals present during the initiation of the immune response determine its magnitude in part by deciding whether T<sub>regs</sub> bystand passively or contribute as cytokine-producing effectors. Second is that T<sub>regs</sub> may be converted into various subsets of antigen-specific effectors (Th1, Th2, Th17) depending on the type of immune response mandated. On a molecular basis, this may occur through the upregulation of lineage-specific transcription factors (e.g. T-bet), and cells may at least transiently express high levels of factors that direct both the regulatory and the effector phenotype. These cells would then act synergistically with similarly differentiated, liberated FoxP3-negative cells to maximize immunity. That IFN-γ-secreting T<sub>regs</sub> may still remain in a regulatory role dampening Th1 responses through direct contact and/or inhibitory cytokines has also been observed <xref rid="pone.0074698-Koenecke1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0074698-Cope1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>; this could still occur while proliferative responses are nonetheless licensed. Regardless, how T<sub>reg</sub> function is restored to temper the immune response upon pathogen eradication remains a mystery. Previous studies have shown that T<sub>regs</sub> activated to produce IL-17 may retain suppressive capacity if removed from the inflammatory environment <xref rid="pone.0074698-Beriou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Our results also carry import regarding the design of tumor immunotherapy vaccines. Regulatory T cells have proven problematic in attempts to induce tumor immunity since the 1980s <xref rid="pone.0074698-North1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Given the potential significance of T<sub>regs</sub> in immunotherapy, several recent protocols combine anti-tumor vaccines with agents that deplete T<sub>regs</sub>. These combined approaches often exhibit greater benefit than either agent alone <xref rid="pone.0074698-Delluc1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-Dannull1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, maximizing vaccine efficacy may require subversion of regulatory processes. Notably, several recent studies have shown that a variety of vaccination strategies increase the frequency and/or potency of regulatory T cells <xref rid="pone.0074698-Eggermont1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0074698-LaCelle1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Perhaps most notably, dendritic cells matured using a conventional cytokine cocktail were found to expand FoxP3<sup>high</sup> cells that appear to have suppressor function <xref rid="pone.0074698-Banerjee1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This may compromise the development and endurance of tumor immunity. By contrast, the DC1 dendritic cell vaccine is ideal in that it appears to inhibit rather than activate T cell-mediated suppression and may carry the added benefit of converting these cells into tumor-reactive effectors. In our model, T<sub>reg</sub> inhibition in the presence of the DC1 vaccine was not observed in the presence of dendritic cells matured using a conventional protocol. Although there has been no direct comparison of the DC1 vaccine to dendritic cells matured using conventional protocols, the effects on T<sub>reg</sub> function demonstrated here may render it more effective and may account in part for the findings noted in the clinical venue.</p>
