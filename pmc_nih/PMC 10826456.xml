                <p id="P1">Enzyme replacement therapy with weekly infused intravenous (IV) idursulfase is effective in treating somatic symptoms of mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II; Hunter syndrome). A formulation of idursulfase for intrathecal administration (idursulfase-IT) is under investigation for the treatment of neuronopathic MPS II. Here, we report 36-month data from the open-label extension (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02412787" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02412787</ext-link>) of a phase 2/3, randomized, controlled study (HGT-HIT-094; <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02055118" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02055118</ext-link>) that assessed the safety and efficacy of monthly idursulfase-IT 10 mg in addition to weekly IV idursulfase on cognitive function in children older than 3 years with MPS II and mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. Participants were also enrolled in this extension from a linked non-randomized sub-study of children younger than 3 years at the start of idursulfase-IT therapy. The extension safety population comprised 56 patients who received idursulfase-IT 10 mg once a month (or age-adjusted dose for sub-study patients) plus IV idursulfase (0.5 mg/kg) once a week. Idursulfase-IT was generally well tolerated over the cumulative treatment period of up to 36 months. Overall, 78.6% of patients had a least one adverse event (AE) related to idursulfase-IT; most treatment-emergent AEs were mild in severity. Of serious AEs (reported by 76.8% patients), none were considered related to idursulfase-IT treatment. There were no deaths or discontinuations owing to AEs. Secondary efficacy analyses (in patients younger than 6 years at phase 2/3 study baseline; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 40) indicated a trend for improved Differential Ability Scale-II (DAS-II) General Conceptual Ability (GCA) scores in the early idursulfase-IT versus delayed idursulfase-IT group (treatment difference over 36 months from phase 2/3 study baseline: least-squares mean, 6.8 [90% confidence interval: −2.1, 15.8; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.2064]). Post hoc analyses of DAS-II GCA scores by genotype revealed a clinically meaningful treatment effect in patients younger than 6 years with missense variants of the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (<italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic>) (least-squares mean [standard error] treatment difference over 36 months, 12.3 [7.24]). These long-term data further suggest the benefits of idursulfase-IT in the treatment of neurocognitive dysfunction in some patients with MPS II. After many years of extensive review and regulatory discussions, the data were found to be insufficient to meet the evidentiary standard to support regulatory filings.</p>

              <p id="P2">Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II; Hunter syndrome; OMIM 309900) is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by deletion or pathogenic variants of the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene (<italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic>) [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The subsequent deficient enzymatic activity leads to accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in numerous tissues and organs. MPS II is chronic, progressive, and life-limiting [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All patients with MPS II are affected by somatic symptoms, which might include hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal facies, joint stiffness, skeletal deformity, cardiac disease, lung disease, communicating hydrocephalus, and hearing loss [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Approximately two-thirds of patients have the neuronopathic form of the disease and experience cognitive impairment in addition to somatic symptoms [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Evidence suggests that patients with cognitive impairment have a nearly fivefold higher risk of death than those without [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P3">There is considerable heterogeneity among patients in the trajectory of neuronopathic MPS II: a typical profile might show a plateauing of cognitive development around the age of 3 years, followed by a deterioration from approximately 5 years of age [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Evidence suggests that the cognitive developmental course in patients with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> genotypes differs from that in those with other null-type variants such as deletions or nonsense variants [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P4">Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with intravenous (IV) idursulfase (Elaprase<sup>®</sup>, Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., Lexington, MA, USA) is the standard of care for the treatment of the somatic symptoms of MPS II. In clinical trials and registry studies, IV infusions of idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg once a week were associated with significant benefits, including improvements in a composite endpoint incorporating measures of physical function and respiratory function and improved survival [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, IV idursulfase does not cross the blood–brain barrier at therapeutic levels and has not been reported to affect cognitive decline in patients with neuronopathic disease [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on preclinical evidence showing that intrathecally administered idursulfase can penetrate into brain tissue [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a formulation of idursulfase for intrathecal (IT) administration (idursulfase-IT) has been investigated for the treatment of neuronopathic MPS II.</p>
              <p id="P5">A phase 2/3 randomized, controlled study (HGT-HIT-094; <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02055118" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02055118</ext-link>) assessed the efficacy of idursulfase-IT 10 mg once a month in addition to IV idursulfase once a week on cognitive function in children with MPS II and early cognitive impairment over 52 weeks [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the primary endpoint (change from baseline in the Differential Ability Scale-II [DAS-II] General Conceptual Ability [GCA] score at week 52) was not met, potential cognitive benefits of idursulfase-IT were indicated at week 52 in a prespecified analysis of patients who started treatment when they were younger than 6 years (least-squares mean [standard error] change from baseline in DAS-II GCA score at week 52 for idursulfase-IT vs no idursulfase-IT: −3.7 [2.9] vs −7.3 [4.2]). It is important to note that a decline in DAS-II GCA score over the course of the study does not necessarily imply a decline in cognitive function and instead may indicate a stabilization or an improvement in abilities. In addition, post hoc analyses revealed a clinically meaningful effect of idursulfase-IT on cognitive function at week 52 in patients younger than 6 years at baseline and with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants (least-squares mean treatment difference, 16.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 28.9; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0174). Idursulfase-IT was well tolerated over the 52 weeks.</p>
              <p id="P6">Patients who completed the phase 2/3 trial as well as patients younger than 3 years from a linked open-label non-randomized sub-study of idursulfase-IT were enrolled in an ongoing open-label extension study (SHP609–302; <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02412787" ext-link-type="uri">NCT02412787</ext-link>), which is investigating the long-term safety and efficacy of monthly idursulfase-IT in addition to weekly IV idursulfase. Here, we present data on the safety and efficacy of idursulfase-IT in neuronopathic MPS II from this extension study for a total of up to 36 months of treatment.</p>

                <title>Overview of analyses</title>
                <p id="P7">We present an interim analysis after 24 months of treatment in the extension study, combined with the initial 12 months of idursulfase-IT or placebo during the randomized phase 2/3 study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P8">The primary objective of this extension study was to evaluate the long-term safety of idursulfase-IT, with secondary analyses of efficacy by descriptive statistics. However, following discussion of data from the phase 2/3 study with the US Food and Drug Administration, it was decided that there was rationale for statistical analysis of efficacy data in the extension study beyond the planned summary description. Thus, an integrated summary of effectiveness was conducted to evaluate efficacy data over 36 months in the phase 2/3 study and extension combined, focusing on patients who were younger than 6 years at the phase 2/3 study baseline.</p>
                <p id="P9">In the primary safety analyses reported here, baseline refers to the phase 2/3 study baseline for patients initially randomized to idursulfase-IT. For those randomized to placebo in the phase 2/3 study (and who subsequently received idursulfase-IT in the extension phase), baseline refers to the closest available assessment before the initial intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD) implantation date, which took place at the start of the extension study. For secondary analyses of efficacy in the integrated summary of effectiveness, baseline refers simply to the phase 2/3 study baseline.</p>
                <p id="P10">Following the identification in the phase 2/3 study of a subgroup of patients with a clinically relevant treatment response (those younger than 6 years at baseline with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants), a post hoc analysis was conducted on the data from the extension study to assess the efficacy endpoints for patients younger than 6 years at baseline by <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> genotype (missense vs non-missense) [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>

                <p id="P11">Participants in the primary HGT-HIT-094 phase 2/3 study who completed assessments at week 52 and provided informed consent were eligible for inclusion in the extension phase. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the initial phase 2/3 study are detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In brief, patients enrolled into the phase 2/3 study were boys aged between 3 and 18 years with a documented diagnosis of MPS II and evidence of MPS II-related cognitive impairment (based on age-dependent DAS-II GCA scores) [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All patients enrolled in the primary study were required to have received and tolerated a minimum of 4 months of treatment with IV idursulfase in the period immediately before screening [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Patients with an opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure upon lumbar puncture of at least 30.0 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or a functioning CSF shunt device were excluded. Children who participated in a non-randomized sub-study of HGT-HIT-094 for patients younger than 3 years at baseline, all of whom received idursulfase-IT, were also eligible for inclusion in this extension study.</p>
                <p id="P12">The first patient was enrolled into the extension study on April 14, 2015; patients were enrolled from 22 study sites in seven countries.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="P13">The primary phase 2/3 study was a 52-week, randomized controlled trial in which eligible patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive idursulfase-IT 10 mg once a month (i.e. every 28 days) or no idursulfase-IT, in addition to IV idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg once a week as standard of care. IV idursulfase was administered at least 48 h after idursulfase-IT. The design of the primary study is described in more detail separately [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The sub-study was a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, 52-week study in which all patients received treatment with idursulfase-IT (dose adjusted based on reference brain weight by age).</p>
                <p id="P14">In this ongoing, non-randomized extension study, all patients receive idursulfase-IT 10 mg once a month (i.e. every 28 days), except those aged &gt;8 to 30 months at dosing, who receive idursulfase-IT 7.5 mg instead. All patients continue to receive weekly IV idursulfase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The extension study protocol permits same-day administration of IV idursulfase and idursulfase-IT.</p>
                <p id="P15">During the primary and extension studies, idursulfase-IT was administered via the SOPH-A-PORT<sup>®</sup> Mini S, Implantable Access Port, Spinal, Mini Unattached, with Guidewire (SOPH-A-PORT Mini S; Sophysa SA, Orsay, France) IDDD [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If the intrathecal space was inaccessible via the IDDD or there were other mechanical complications with the device, the study drug was delivered via lumbar puncture.</p>
                <p id="P16">The study was approved by the relevant institutional review boards/institutional ethics committees and was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. For all patients, written informed consent was obtained from the parent(s) or legally authorized guardian(s); assent from the patient was also acquired, if applicable.</p>

                <p id="P17">In the extension study, treatment groups were defined according to the randomized treatment assignment in the phase 2/3 study: the early idursulfase-IT group comprised patients who received idursulfase-IT in the phase 2/3 trial, whereas the delayed idursulfase-IT group comprised those who did not receive idursulfase-IT before the extension. The extension study is ongoing.</p>
                <p id="P18">Two interim analyses were planned (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The first was scheduled for month 25, at which point the early idursulfase-IT group and the delayed idursulfase-IT group had received idursulfase-IT treatment for 24 months and 12 months, respectively, or had discontinued. The second was scheduled for month 37, at which point the early idursulfase-IT group and the delayed idursulfase-IT group had received idursulfase-IT treatment for 36 months and 24 months, respectively, or had discontinued (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Each group had a period of 1 month allocated to surgical IDDD implantation and recovery before the initiation of idursulfase-IT. Based on the duration of observations from the start of the primary study, the extension baseline and two interim analyses are hereafter referred to as the month 12, month 24, and month 36 analyses, respectively.</p>

                <p id="P20">An important secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in DAS-II GCA scores (early years battery). Other secondary efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline in DAS-II standard cluster and composite scores (early years battery), and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II (VABS-II) Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC) and domain standard scores. Exploratory efficacy endpoints were ordered categorical outcomes (three categories: above-average, average, or below-average cognitive development) for DAS-II GCA scores (early years battery).</p>
                <p id="P21">Pharmacodynamic endpoints included changes from baseline in total GAGs and heparan sulfate (HS) levels in the CSF, samples of which were collected via the IDDD or lumbar puncture.

                <p id="P22">All descriptive summary analyses of safety and efficacy data were based on the safety population, defined as all patients in the extension study who underwent IDDD implantation surgery and/or received at least one dose (full or partial) of study drug. This included patients younger than 3 years at baseline who were enrolled in the sub-study; these patients were included in the early idursulfase-IT group. Patients in the sub-study did not have baseline DAS-II GCA scores and, therefore, were not included in the efficacy analysis (the data from the sub-study will be reported separately). Efficacy data are reported for patients younger than 6 years at phase 2/3 study baseline and for the subgroup of patients younger than 6 years at phase 2/3 study baseline with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants (post hoc analysis).</p>
                <p id="P23">To assess treatment exposure, a percentage was calculated by IDDD and lumbar puncture separately for each patient, from which the mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined.</p>

                  <p id="P25">The efficacy analysis compared change from baseline in DAS-II GCA scores in the early idursulfase-IT group with that in the delayed idursulfase-IT group using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The model included fixed categorical effects for treatment, visit week, treatment by visit week interaction, and baseline DAS-II GCA classification factor (either ≤70 or &gt; 70). Weeks 16 and 40 of the extension for the delayed idursulfase-IT group were not included in the MMRM analysis owing to the lack of matching visits in the early idursulfase-IT group. Changes from baseline in DAS-II standard cluster and composite scores and VABS-II ABC scores were also evaluated with MMRM analysis. An exploratory, ordered, categorical analysis was conducted for DAS-II GCA scores at the month 12, month 24, and month 36 analyses (prespecified at month 24 only) for cognitive development categories of above average, average, or below average. A rate-of-change (weighted slope) analysis was also performed on DAS-II GCA and VABS-II ABC scores to explore the treatment effect over 36 months (further details on the weighted analysis methodology can be found in the primary study paper [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]).</p>

At the month 36 analysis, 54 patients were participating in the extension study; two patients (early idursulfase-IT group) discontinued owing to withdrawal of consent. The efficacy analysis population (patients younger than 6 years at phase 2/3 study baseline) included 40 patients (early idursulfase-IT, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 28; delayed idursulfase-IT, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12).

                <p id="P31">Long-term treatment with idursulfase-IT for up to 36 months was generally well tolerated, consistent with the findings of the phase 2/3 study. Approximately three-quarters of patients (78.6%) reported AEs related to idursulfase-IT (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); overall, most treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were mild in severity. In the early idursulfase-IT group, the most common TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to idursulfase-IT were vomiting (58.5% of patients), headache (34.1%), and pyrexia (29.3%); in the delayed idursulfase-IT group, these were increased CSF white blood cell count (26.7%), decreased body temperature, headache, vomiting, increased systolic blood pressure, and increased diastolic blood pressure (20.0% each). Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported by 80.5% of patients in the early idursulfase-IT group and 66.7% of patients in the delayed idursulfase-IT group; none of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to idursulfase-IT. No deaths or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. There were no apparent safety concerns with same-day administration of idursulfase-IT and IV idursulfase.</p>
                <p id="P32">Most patients who received idursulfase-IT reported at least one IDDD-related event (91.1%; <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>): 23 patients (41.1%) had a total of 29 IDDD failures and 18 patients (32.1%) had a total of 18 IDDD malfunctions. The most common reason for failure or malfunction was inability to aspirate CSF before dose administration (reported by 30 patients [53.6%]; 68 events involving 40 IDDDs). Of those who received at least one dose of idursulfase-IT via IDDD (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31), 26 patients reported a total of 236 TEAEs that were deemed by the investigator as being associated with the treatment administration process. Of the 25 patients who received at least one idursulfase-IT dose via lumbar puncture, 13 reported 114 TEAEs that were deemed by the investigator as being associated with the administration process.</p>
                <p id="P33">Aside from those noted above, no clinically significant changes from baseline in CSF laboratory values (chemistries, cell counts, and I2S concentration) or clinical laboratory values (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) or ECG values were observed during the study up to the month 36 analysis.</p>
                <p id="P34">Most patients had positive serum anti-idursulfase antibody results at phase 2/3 study baseline (67.9%). Of the 18 patients who did not, nine developed first detectable serum anti-idursulfase antibodies during the extension (these were transient in five patients). Nearly half of patients (46.4%) had positive serum NAb results at phase 2/3 study baseline, and 69.6% had positive serum NAb results at post-baseline time points. All patients either already had positive CSF anti-idursulfase antibody results at baseline (44.6%) or remained negative for CSF anti-idursulfase antibodies throughout the study. Three patients (5.4%) had positive CSF NAb status at baseline, compared with 14 (25%) at post-baseline time points.</p>

The difference (90% CI) between the early and delayed idursulfase-IT groups (6.8 [−2.1, 15.8], <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.2064) was similar to that reported at the end of the phase 2/3 trial [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in which the reduction from baseline was numerically smaller in the idursulfase-IT group than in the no idursulfase-IT group (for the current analyses defined as the early idursulfase-IT and delayed idursulfase-IT groups, respectively). Exploratory weighted rate-of-change analysis of change from baseline in DAS-II GCA scores at month 36 also favored early idursulfase-IT treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

Reductions from baseline in HS levels were reported at months 24 and 36 (mean [SD]) with early idursulfase-IT (−22.4% [54.9] and −14.8 [36.3], respectively) and with delayed idursulfase-IT (−38.6% [22.8] and −32.6 [22.4], respectively); however, the data were more variable than those for CSF total GAG levels with evidence of a gradual reversal towards baseline levels.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P42">This interim analysis of data from the open-label extension study has demonstrated that idursulfase-IT 10 mg once a month, in addition to IV idursulfase 0.5 mg/kg once a week, was generally well tolerated during treatment periods of up to 36 months. The performance of the IDDD was acceptable, with some patients requiring additional surgical management; patients could also receive idursulfase-IT via lumbar puncture. The rates of AEs and other safety findings were consistent with those reported in the primary phase 2/3 study.</p>
              <p id="P43">Efficacy analyses were conducted in patients younger than 6 years at phase 2/3 study baseline; in that study, there was a more pronounced treatment response with idursulfase-IT in this subgroup than in the overall population. In this extension study, cognitive function (assessed by DAS-II GCA scores) continued to decrease from baseline in both the early idursulfase-IT and the delayed idursulfase-IT treatment groups over 36 months. However, the (non-significant) difference in DAS-II GCA scores in favor of idursulfase-IT observed at the end of the phase 2/3 trial after 1 year of treatment was maintained throughout the 36-month extension period for the early idursulfase-IT versus the delayed idursulfase-IT treatment groups. Furthermore, the post hoc subgroup of patients younger than 6 years at baseline and with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants, in which there was a significant and clinically meaningful treatment effect of idursulfase-IT versus no idursulfase-IT on cognitive function in the phase 2/3 study, also demonstrated a sustained difference in DAS-II GCA scores between the early idursulfase-IT and delayed idursulfase-IT treatment groups during the extension. In pharmacodynamic analyses, the reductions in CSF total GAG levels observed in response to initiation of idursulfase-IT in the phase 2/3 study were sustained throughout the extension phase, whereas the trend for partial reversal of initial reductions of CSF HS levels continued with ongoing treatment. This unexplained drop in CSF HS levels may have been dose-related and might help to explain why the cognitive results are not more pronounced.</p>
              <p id="P44">These data, along with those from the primary study [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], support the benefits of early initiation of ERT in patients with MPS II; further evidence for this approach includes preclinical and clinical evidence with IV idursulfase and real-world outcomes data, plus case reports of siblings facilitating comparisons of early versus delayed treatment [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on the understanding of the natural history of MPS II, it might be expected that most patients aged from 3 to 6 years may have reached a plateau of cognitive development without yet experiencing appreciable loss of developmental milestones and skills already acquired [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is an important window of therapeutic opportunity for patients with neuronopathic MPS II; notably, it has been proposed that treatment should ideally be initiated before a child reaches the plateau in cognitive development [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it is important to note that more than half of the patients included in the efficacy analysis (and, therefore, under 6 years of age) had baseline DAS-II GCA scores of no more than 70. Variations between patients with neuronopathic MPS II for the ages at which these milestones are reached create a challenging setting in which to demonstrate therapeutic benefits in clinical trials. It is important to acknowledge the real-world challenges in ensuring that treatment for MPS II is started early enough. In the absence of a family history to raise suspicion of MPS II, newborn screening is likely to be the only means of achieving a diagnosis and treatment initiation sufficiently early to optimize therapeutic benefit. Furthermore, the need for early treatment emphasizes the importance of being able to predict MPS II phenotype to identify those patients likely to benefit from idursulfase-IT treatment.</p>
              <p id="P45">Stabilization of the DAS-II GCA score is equivalent to normal development and does not just indicate retention of cognitive ability. Some decline in DAS-II GCA scores can still be consistent with improvement or acquisition of new cognitive skills. A decline in GCA scores does not necessarily mean that the individual has lost skills. In the phase 2/3 trial, investigators’ and families’ impressions were that, during the study time frame, the patients did not lose skills but typically gained skills at a less than normal rate [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the fact that changes from baseline in DAS-II GCA scores in the early idursulfase-IT group were numerically smaller than in the delayed idursulfase-IT group may suggest a benefit of earlier treatment initiation. Similarly, the observed reduction in proportions of patients with average or above-average cognitive development between months 12 and 24 in the categorical analysis may be explained by development continuing at a slightly slower pace in children with MPS II than in typically developing children. If one presumes that the damage to brain development precedes symptom expression, it might be difficult to keep up the rapid pace of early development.</p>
              <p id="P46">A post hoc analysis showed that the clinically meaningful treatment effect observed in patients younger than 6 years with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants in the phase 2/3 study was maintained over at least 36 months in the extension study. For those with other genotypes, changes from baseline were generally unaffected by the initial randomization group during the phase 2/3 study and extension; however, as discussed in the primary paper [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], there were individual exceptions to this. Missense is the most common <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variant type in MPS II, and a significant proportion of patients with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants (up to 79%) have neuronopathic disease [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There is a plausible rationale for enhanced response to idursulfase-IT in patients with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> genotypes. As discussed in the primary study publication [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a possible explanation could be that the presence of residual endogenous I2S in patients with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants may reduce the likelihood of developing anti-idursulfase antibodies compared with patients with other pathogenic variants that cause deficient activity of I2S [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The presence of anti-idursulfase NAbs has been associated with a reduced treatment benefit [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Also, administration of idursulfase-IT may supplement the residual enzyme activity in these patients, providing a sufficient level of enzyme to reduce lysosomal accumulation of GAGs [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P47">This study had a number of limitations. All patients in this open-label extension phase were receiving idursulfase-IT, and treatment groups were differentiated only by the duration of treatment by virtue of randomized assignment in the original study. In the efficacy analysis population, the mean between-groups change from baseline in DAS-II GCA scores did not reach statistical significance in the MMRM analysis at month 36. The more notable differences between treatment groups in the subset of patients with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants need to be interpreted with caution, because they were post hoc analyses not specified in the original protocol. The original phase 2/3 study was subject to strict inclusion criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the data to other patients with neuronopathic MPS II. Furthermore, there is limited potential to place the current findings in context owing to the scarcity of natural history data available on neuronopathic MPS II. The dose selected for this study was based on dose–response data from a phase 1 study; however, given the results of this study, it would be of interest to explore the effects on clinical outcomes of higher doses and/or a more frequent dosing interval.</p>
              <p id="P48">These limitations notwithstanding, these interim findings were consistent with the results from the phase 2/3 study, thus strengthening and extending the previous conclusions.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="P49">In patients with neuronopathic MPS II, long-term idursulfase-IT was generally well tolerated; the safety and tolerability profile over 36 months of treatment is consistent with that reported in the 52-week phase 2/3 trial [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The smaller decline in DAS-II GCA scores from baseline with idursulfase-IT versus no idursulfase-IT observed after 52 weeks [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was maintained throughout the extension study once all patients were receiving idursulfase-IT. Post hoc analyses of DAS-II GCA scores by genotype revealed that the significant and clinically meaningful treatment effect on DAS-II GCA scores in patients younger than 6 years with missense <italic toggle="yes">IDS</italic> variants, observed in the phase 2/3 study, was also maintained over 36 months. After many years of extensive review and regulatory discussions, the data were found to be insufficient to meet the evidentiary standard to support regulatory filings. Idursulfase-IT will continue to be made available to patients who are currently enrolled in the ongoing open-label extension studies until another approved treatment is available to address the cognitive symptoms.</p>
