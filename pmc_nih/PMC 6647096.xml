                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Guadecitabine is a novel DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor with improved pharmacokinetics and clinical activity in a subset of patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML), but identification of this subset remains difficult.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">To search for biomarkers of response, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation, mutations of 54 genes, and expression of a panel of 7 genes in pre-treatment samples from 128 patients treated at therapeutic doses in a phase I/II study.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Response rate to guadecitabine was 17% (2 complete remission (CR), 3 CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or CR with incomplete platelets recovery (CRp)) in the phase I component and 23% (14 CR, 9 CRi/CRp) in phase II. There were no strong mutation or methylation predictors of response. Gene expression clustering defined a subset of patients (~â20%) that had (i) high DNMT3B and low CDKN2B, CTCF, and CDA expression; (ii) enrichment for KRAS/NRAS mutations; (iii) frequent CpG island hypermethylation; (iv) low long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) hypomethylation after treatment; and (v) resistance to guadecitabine in both phase I (response rate 0% vs. 33%, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.07) and phase II components of the study (response rate 5% vs. 30%, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.02). Multivariate analysis identified peripheral blood (PB) blasts and hemoglobin as predictors of response and cytogenetics, gene expression, RAS mutations, and hemoglobin as predictors of survival.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">A subset of patients (~â20%) with r/r AML is unlikely to benefit from guadecitabine as a single agent. In the remaining 80%, guadecitabine is a viable option with a median survival of 8âmonths and a 2-year survival rate of 21%.</p>

              <p id="Par28">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly lethal hematopoietic malignancy characterized by poor long-term survival and relatively few somatic mutations compared to other cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Interestingly, the most commonly mutated genes in AML are enriched for epigenetic regulators such as DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, DNA methylation in AML has been shown to harbor disruptions compared to normal blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and various epigenetic signatures have been associated with differential chemotherapy response and prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At present, there are two hypomethylating agents (HMAs)âazacitidine and decitabineâwhich have been FDA approved for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and are recommended for AML in patients who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">Current HMAs are considered low-intensity therapy in AML and function by blocking the activity of DNMT1, which in turn cannot copy DNA methylation across cell divisions. Although some improvements in remission and overall survival (OS) have been observed in MDS and AML, durable responses are rare, and one potential limitation is the low plasma half-life of these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To address this issue, guadecitabine (formerly known as SGI-110) was developed to be resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase (CDA) with a gradual release of active metabolite decitabine thereby exposing malignant cells to the active drug for longer. Guadecitabine is currently in several phase III clinical trials for AML and MDS after having shown promising phase I/II results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">Although HMAs such as guadecitabine induce remissions in AML, there are no validated biomarkers that can be used to select patients for therapy. This is especially relevant in relapsed AML, where the response rates are relatively low. In this study, we examined blood and/or bone marrow samples from relapsed/refractory AML (r/r AML) patients enrolled in phase I/II trials of guadecitabine for their DNA methylation status at baseline and following treatment, for baseline genetic mutations in a panel of 54 genes commonly mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, and for expression of a selected gene panel. Our data suggest that specific gene expression, DNA methylation, and mutational signatures may be associated with OS and therapy resistance in guadecitabine-treated patients.</p>

                <p id="Par31">The phase I/II trials of guadecitabine were conducted under one study protocol and is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01261312). The patientsâ eligibility criteria in the phase I and the phase II stage were previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The patients evaluated in this report are those with r/r AML who were treated in the phase I stage on the 5Ã daily (â¥â30âmg/m<sup>2</sup>) or 3Ã weekly schedule (â¥â60âmg/m<sup>2</sup>) at therapeutic doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and all those treated in phase II (60 and 90âmg/m<sup>2</sup> both in a 5-day schedule and 60âmg/m<sup>2</sup> in a 10-day schedule) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] provided they had pre-treatment blood and/or bone marrow available for molecular analyses (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> Table S1). Responses were evaluated by the IWG criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients were considered responders if they had a composite complete response (CRc) including complete response (CR), CRp (CR with incomplete platelets recovery), or CRi (CR with incomplete blood count recovery). There were no statistically significant differences in the response rate or survival between the different doses/schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>

                <title>Baseline gene expression analysis</title>
                <p id="Par32">Whole-blood RNA was isolated and purified with the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and QIAcube automated sample preparation system (Qiagen) by Covance Central Laboratory Services (Indianapolis, IN, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Any contaminated DNA from RNA preparations was removed with TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) before cDNA synthesis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The quantitative expression of a panel of genes (CDA, CDKN2B (P15), CDKN1A (P21), DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)) at baseline was performed by TaqManÂ® probe-based gene expression analysis by Applied Biosystems (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> Table S2). These were selected because they are known epigenetic regulators (DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and CTCF), epigenetically regulated genes (P21 and P15), or determinant of decitabine levels (CDA). Human GAPDH was used as a normalization control in qPCR reactions. All qPCR reactions were run in triplicate and the values averaged. Negative controls where the reverse transcriptase enzyme was omitted were included in parallel to exclude the possibility of genomic DNA contamination. Relative target gene expression was represented by dCT (target gene)â=âCt (GAPDH)âââCt (target gene). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of baseline gene expression in the patients was performed by ArrayTrack (the National Center for Toxicological Research) using the Ward method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

                <title>DNA methylation profiling</title>
                <p id="Par33">Pre-treated whole-blood genomic DNA was purified with the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) and QIAcube automated sample preparation system (Qiagen) by Covance Central Laboratory Services. To analyze the genome-wide methylation profile, we used Digital Restriction Enzyme Analysis of Methylation (DREAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Briefly, DREAM methylation analysis is a quantitative mapping of DNA methylation with high resolution on a genome-wide scale without bisulfite conversion. The method is based on sequential cuts of genomic DNA with a pair of neoschizomer endonucleases recognizing the same restriction site (CCCGGG) containing a CpG dinucleotide. The first enzyme, <italic>Sma</italic>I, cuts only at the unmethylated CpG sites and leaves blunt ends. The second enzyme, <italic>Xma</italic>I, is not blocked by methylation and leaves a short 5â² overhang. The enzymes thus generate distinct methylation-specific signatures at the ends of restriction DNA fragments. These are deciphered by next-generation sequencing. Methylation level at individual CpG sites is calculated as the ratio of sequencing reads with the methylated signature to the total number of reads mapping to the site. Using the DREAM method, we analyzed pre-treatment DNA methylation profiles of the r/r AML patients (<italic>n</italic>â=â116) from the phase I and II trials. Paired-end sequencing of 40 bases was performed on HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) instrument at the Genomic Core Facility of Fox Chase Cancer Center (Philadelphia, PA, USA). These sequence data have been submitted to the GEO database under accession number GSE112838. We mapped the sequences to the human genome (hg19) and calculated the methylation at target sites as the fraction of reads with methylated signature. We included in the methylation analysis 17,793 CpG sites covered with at least 20 sequencing reads in at least 75% of samples. We imputed missing values (1.8% of total) by predictive mean matching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] using the mice package in R suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Ward.D) and heatmap were performed by the pheatmap R package. CpG site permutations were used to detect differentially methylated sites associated with response to guadecitabine. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen) for analyzing enriched canonical pathways of 121 genes with differentially methylated genes with CR and (separately) CRc in 116 patients. LINE-1 methylation dynamics were available on these patients from previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>

                <title>AML mutational profiles</title>
                <p id="Par34">Pre-treatment blood or bone marrow-derived DNA was available for analysis from a total of 122 patients with AML enrolled on guadecitabine phase I/II trials. We performed mutation analysis by targeted high-throughput sequencing using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina). The panel covers 54 genes commonly mutated in hematologic malignancies. FLT3-ITD was difficult to detect using this panel; we also detected this mutation by PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis (LabPMM, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing library preparation was performed according to the manufacturerâs instruction. Paired-end sequencing of 2âÃâ150 bases was performed on the HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina), and reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19). Initial variants were called using the BaseSpace TrueSeq Amplicon app and BaseSpace Variant Studio 2.2 (Illumina). In addition, variants were required to have a minimum of 100 reads and a sequence quality score of at least 50. A minimum allelic fraction of 5% was set to identify somatic variants. Finally, we filtered the variants for presence in the COSMIC database (v78) with a hematopoietic malignancy association and absence from dbSNP (common variants) with a normal population frequency of &gt;â1%.</p>

                <p id="Par35">Fisherâs exact test was used to compare the differences in the CRc or CR rates. Unpaired <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA was used to compare the age, white blood cell (WBC) count, peripheral blood (PB) blast, and bone marrow (BM) blasts at screening in different (2 or 3) groups. We derived the maximum LINE-1 demethylation for patients during the first cycle of guadecitabine treatment. The mean maximum LINE-1 demethylation was compared between the groups using the Mann-Whitney test. Overall survival (OS) was measured as the time from the date of the first treatment to death (failure) or alive at last follow-up (censored). OS curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the groups using a log-rank test. To build a multivariate model of response to guadecitabine or OS by baseline expression, we derived a <italic>z</italic>-score of gene expression based on 4 genes (z4), obtained by zCDAâ+âzP15â+âzCTCFâââzDNMT3B formula (based on gene expression clustering). Binary logistic regression and the Cox regression model were used for the univariate and the multivariate analysis, respectively, for 116 patients with mutational status and gene expression data to determine clinically meaningful differences in the achievement of CR, CRc, and OS. All <italic>p</italic> values are two-sided, and &lt;â0.05 was considered significant. All the above statistical procedures were performed with GraphPad Prism (version 5.04) and SAS/STAT software (version 9.4).</p>

                <title>Correlations between mutation status and response</title>
                <p id="Par39">We next queried for mutation status in a panel of 54 genes using the TruSight myeloid sequencing panel which analyzes a total of 338 exons (or 568 amplicons) by targeted deep sequencing. We successfully obtained data on a median aligned read of 94% (range 48â98%) in 122 patients (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The median number of reads/amplicons was 9125 (range 3646 to 25,050). Overall, the median mutation number was 1 per case (range 0 to 5). We compared the mutation frequencies for the 54 genes in the 122 r/r AML patients with those reported for treatment-naÃ¯ve AML (tn-AML) in the TCGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and found significant differences at ASXL1, FLT3 (-ITD), DNMT3A, and NPM1 gene by the Bonferroni correction (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0026 to be significant after the Bonferroni adjustment of a major 19 genes comparison) (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S7). None of the genes showed significant correlations between mutations and CRc (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Figure S1). When we analyzed the correlations with CR, none of the genes showed a significant correlation either (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). No gene showed synthetic lethality as evidenced by a high response rate among cases with mutations, though there were minor non-significant trends for TET2 (CR rate of 2/10 (20%) in cases with mutations vs. 13/112 (12%) in cases without, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.35) and TP53 (CR rate of 2/9 (22%) in cases with mutations vs. 13/113 (12%) in cases without, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.31). Multiple genes were mutated at a higher frequency in those patients who did not respond (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), though none reached statistical significance. These included KRAS, NRAS, IDH1, IDH2, and multiple others. As previously reported, KRAS and NRAS mutations were mutually exclusive, and there was a strong trend for RAS mutations (N or K) to be associated with resistance to guadecitabine (CR cases were seen in 0/22 (0%) patients with RAS mutations compared to 15/100 (15%) patients without RAS mutations, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.07). The presence of RAS mutations was associated with a more aggressive clinical phenotype and more methylated (CIMP-like and intermediate) clusters (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and a significantly worse survival (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, median survival 129.5âdays with RAS mutation vs. 233âdays without RAS mutation, log-rank test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0004). IDH1/2 mutations also were associated with a trend for resistance to guadecitabine (CRs were seen in 0/23 (0%) patients with IDH1/2 mutations compared to 15/99 (15%) patients without IDH1/2 mutations, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.07).

                <title>A gene expression predictor of resistance to guadecitabine</title>
                <p id="Par40">We next examined the expression of a panel of 7 genes as potential predictors of response to guadecitabine. We used the patients on the phase I trial for discovery and the patients on the phase II trial for validation. In the 27 patients on the phase I trial, there were clear trends for correlations between expression and response (not shown), but most striking was evidence of co-regulation of these genes and an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis uncovered two groups of patients (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Cluster R (resistant) was mainly characterized by low expression of DNMT1 and P15 and high expression of both DNMT3A and DNMT3B. Most strikingly, cluster R patients were resistant to guadecitabine, with CRc seen in 0/9 (0%) patients compared to 5/18 (28%) patients for cluster S (sensitive) (<italic>p</italic>â=â0.14). Clinically, patients in cluster R had evidence of more aggressive AML with higher WBC, BM blasts, and PB blast counts (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Table S8). Based on this discovery cohort, we analyzed the same panel of genes in the 95 patients on the phase II trial and used hierarchical cluster analysis (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S9). As seen in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, a very similar dichotomy was observed in the validation cohort with a cluster of patients (cluster R) having high levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B and low levels of DNMT1 and P15. These patients also showed resistance to guadecitabine (CRc seen in 1/21 (5%) patients compared to 22/74 (30%) patients for cluster S, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.02), thus confirming the initial data of the patients on the phase I trial. Patients in cluster R had worse survival after guadecitabine treatment (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S9, median survival 154âdays in R cluster vs. 248âdays in S cluster, log-rank test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0006, and 2-year survival rate 0/21 (0%) in R cluster vs. 18/74 (24%) in S cluster, Fisherâs exact test <italic>p</italic>â=â0.01). Hierarchical cluster analysis of all 122 patients in a combined phase I and II cohorts (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) refined the clusters; 27 patients (17%) were in cluster R and had strikingly lower CR or CRc rates (CRc seen in 0/27 (0%) patients compared to 28/95 (29%) patients for cluster S, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0005). Patients in cluster R had higher WBC, BM blasts, and PB blast counts (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

We next used <italic>z</italic>-scores to derive quantitative surrogates for the gene expression clusters. A 4 gene <italic>z</italic>-score classifier (z4-score derived by zCDAâ+âzP15â+âzCTCFÂ âÂ zDNMT3B) discriminated well between clusters R and S and was also powerful at predicting CR or CRc.

                <title>An integrated analysis of resistance to guadecitabine</title>
                <p id="Par41">Of all the molecular studies described earlier, gene expression of a panel of 7 genes and the presence of RAS mutations were the most promising predictive markers, with both being associated with resistance to guadecitabine. As shown in TablesÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, these two molecular events were associated. Patients in the gene expression âresistanceâ cluster were characterized by a more aggressive clinical course (higher WBC, BM blasts, and PB blast counts) and had a higher incidence of RAS mutations. Interestingly, DNA methylation clusters showing CIMP-like and intermediate patterns were also enriched in the resistance cluster (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0001) while cytogenetics showed no differences. As expected, z4-scores of gene expression were dramatically different between clusters R and S (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and they were inversely correlated with WBC count (<italic>r</italic>â=âââ0.24), PB blast count (<italic>r</italic>â=âââ0.86), and BM blast count (<italic>r</italic>â=âââ0.62). Patients with RAS mutations had a lower z4-score (ââ0.99 in case of RAS mutations vs. 1.39 in case of RAS wild type, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0001) but no significant differences in cytogenetics risk.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Towards an integrated model, we started with univariate logistic regression models for response (either CRc or CR). PB blasts, BM blasts, z4-score, and hemoglobin count were all significant, both CR and CRc at <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.01 (AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Figure S4 and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Figure S5). In a multivariate model, hemoglobin level and PB blasts were significant predictors of CRc while hemoglobin level and z4-score were significant predictors of CR. The logistic regression model for CR could not be fitted for resistance clusters, IDH, or RAS mutation because there were no CR cases that were positive. We next examined survival. In a univariate Cox regression model, PB blasts, z4-score, BM blasts, RAS mutation, cytogenetic risk, and cluster of resistance were all significant at <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.01 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and AdditionalÂ fileÂ <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Figure S6). In a multivariate Cox analysis, cytogenetic risk and the presence of RAS mutation were significant predictors of worse survival, while a higher z4-score and hemoglobin counts were significant predictors of longer survival (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Univariate and multivariate COX regression to study survival after guadecitabine. <bold>a</bold>Â In univariate COX regression analyses, significant factors in univariate analyses were PB blasts (HRâ=â1.01, 95% CI 1.01â1.02, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0001), z4-score (HRâ=â0.85, 95% CI 0.78â0.91, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.0001), BM blasts (HRâ=â1.02, 95% CI 1.01â1.02, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0002), RAS mutation (HRâ=â2.53, 95% CI 1.45â3.92, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0004), cytogenetic risk (HRâ=â2.18, 95% CI 1.41â3.17, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0004), cluster R (HRâ=â2.03, 95% CI 1.26â3.17, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.003), hemoglobin value (HRâ=â0.86, 95% CI 0.75â0.99, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.03), IDH2 mutation (HRâ=â0.47, 95% CI 0.23â0.98, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.044), and mutated gene number (HRâ=â1.20, 95% CI 1.00â1.43, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.048). <bold>b</bold>Â In a multivariate analysis by backward regression, cytogenetic risk (HRâ=â2.25, 95% CI 1.46â3.48, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0003), z4-score (HRâ=â0.89, 95% CI 0.81â0.97, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.01), the presence of RAS mutation (HRâ=â2.12, 95% CI 1.19â3.76, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.01), and hemoglobin value (HRâ=â0.86, 95% CI 0.74â0.99, <italic>p</italic>â=â0.04) were significant predictors of survival</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13148_2019_704_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par44">Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a novel hypomethylating dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine that is resistant to degradation by cytidine deaminase and results in prolonged in vivo exposure to its active moiety decitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This differential pharmacokinetic profile offers the potential of improved biological and clinical activity and safety over currently available first-generation drugs such as azacitidine and decitabine. To develop genomic predictors of response to guadecitabine for r/r AML patients, we investigated hematopoietic cell samples from the patients enrolled in phase I/II trials of guadecitabine for their DNA methylation status, major genetic mutations, and a panel of gene expression at baseline. Our data suggested that there were no strong genetic, epigenetic, or gene expression predictors of CR or CRc to guadecitabine in r/r AML. From a DNA methylation perspective, the most enriched pathway of differentially methylated genes in responders to guadecitabine was the eicosanoid signaling pathway, possibly implying a role for inflammation and immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] in these responses. However, this study suffers from potential overfitting effects and the data need to be validated in different population cohorts. The lack of correlation between global patterns of baseline DNA methylation and response is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and reflects the multifactorial nature of sensitivity to DNMT inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">From a genetic change perspective, the only genes with strong trends for (inverse) correlation with response were RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and IDH2. The data on IDH2 were surprising given that these patients have a strong hypermethylation phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; it is possible that the lack of TET function in these cases compromises the ability to stably demethylate and respond to HMAs. Interestingly, in a trial of an IDH2 inhibitor for r/r AML patients with IDH2 mutations, patients with NRAS mutations also had a worse prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The lack of an effect of TP53 mutations on response is different than what was observed with decitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and could reflect the fact that the population of patients treated here had relapsed/refractory disease. Of note, other studies have not found a correlation between TP53 mutations and response to HMAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Interestingly, the best molecular predictor of OS included gene expression of DNMT3B and CTCF which are well-known epigenetic regulators. CTCF is a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein that functions as transcriptional repressor or activator, as an insulator that can block the ability of enhancers to activate promoters, and as a three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization. CTCF binding is determined by DNA sequence, methylation, and nucleosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. DNMT3B and DNMT3A are responsible for establishing de novo DNA methylation patterns. DNMT3B and DNMT1 levels had opposite effects on the outcome after guadecitabine. From our validation analysis in the tn-AML cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we confirmed high expression of DNMT3B was associated with worse OS. Similar observations of worse clinical outcomes with high expression of DNMT3B were reported in de novo AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], pediatric AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and older adult patients with cytogenetically normal AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; this observation needs to be confirmed in genome-wide studies. In a mouse study, Dnmt3b, but not Dnmt3a, is upregulated following Dnmt1 deletion, and Dnmt3b is required for the survival of intestinal epithelium-specific Dnmt1-mutant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In established HMA-resistant cell lines from a human monocytic leukemia cell line (MOLM-13), protein levels of DNMT3B were found upregulated compared to parental cell line and mRNA expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in HMA-resistant cell lines decreased compared to parental cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In MDS-derived cell lines, the protein expressions of DNMT1 and DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, tend to decrease in the presence of HMAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally, cancer cell lines harboring DNMT3B gene amplification are less sensitive to the decrease in cell viability caused by HMAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Taken together, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B have different sensitivity to HMAs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3A, rather than DNMT3B, are the major targets of HMAs. And upregulation of DNMT3B could be a signature of resistance to HMAs. This baseline gene expression signature would be reflecting higher heterogeneity of HMA-resistant AML cells.</p>
              <p id="Par46">An integrated analysis identified a group of patients showing clear resistance to guadecitabine. They had a baseline expression signature of high-level expression of DNMT3B and low-level expression of P15, CTCF, and CDA; enrichment for KRAS or NRAS mutations; and a high degree of CpG island methylation. Clinically, these patients had higher bone marrow and peripheral blast counts, and interestingly, they had a significantly lower LINE-1 hypomethylation induction. Multivariate analysis also identified higher hemoglobin levels as a predictor of response and longer survival. It was reported that a hemoglobin value of at least 10âg/dL was associated with longer OS in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes treated with decitabine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is apparent therefore that the most aggressive relapsed/refractory AMLs are relatively refractory to single-agent guadecitabine, possibly because the pace of disease evolution overwhelms the ability of a slow-acting approach such as HMAs. If these patients could be identified prospectively, they may benefit from alternate approaches such as cytotoxic therapy, HMAs in combination with other therapies, or possibly a higher dose of HMAs. Indeed, it was reported that high-dose cytarabine treatment improves the responses in AML patients with RAS mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Also, the phase III study of guadecitabine in r/r AML patients is using the 10-day regimen for up to 2âcycles with an allowance starting the second cycle earlier than 4âweeks in an attempt to provide a more myelosuppressive regimen upfront.</p>

              <p id="Par47">We identified a subset of patients (~â20% based on gene expression) with relapsed or refractory AML who are unlikely to show CR or CRc after a single-agent guadecitabine therapy. In the remaining 80% of patients without this poor prognosis signature, guadecitabine is an excellent option in r/r AML with a median survival of ~â8âmonths and a 2-year survival rate of 21%. In the future, gene expression analysis and RAS mutation measurements may help in the development of effective personalized treatment strategies for patients with r/r AML.</p>
