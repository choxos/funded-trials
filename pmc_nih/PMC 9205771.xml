                <p id="Par1">HIV-1 therapy with single or dual broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown viral escape, indicating that at least a triple bNAb therapy may be needed for robust suppression of viremia. We performed a two-part study consisting of a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled first-in-human trial of the HIV-1 V2-glycan-specific antibody PGDM1400 alone or in combination with the V3-glycan-specific antibody PGT121 in 24 adults without HIV in part 1, as well as a multi-center, open-label trial of the combination of PGDM1400, PGT121 and the CD4-binding-site antibody VRC07-523LS in five viremic adults living with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in part 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03205917">NCT03205917</ext-link>). The primary endpoints were safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics for both parts and antiviral activity among viremic adults living with HIV and not on ART for part 2 of the study. The secondary endpoints were changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and development of HIV-1 sequence variations associated with PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS resistance in part 2. Intravenously administered PGDM1400 was safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and when given in combination with PGT121 and VRC07-523LS. A single intravenous infusion of 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of each of the three antibodies reduced plasma HIV RNA levels in viremic individuals by a maximum mean of 2.04 log<sub>10</sub> copies per ml; however, viral rebound occurred in all participants within a median of 20 days after nadir. Rebound viruses demonstrated partial to complete resistance to PGDM1400 and PGT121 in vitro, whereas susceptibility to VRC07-523LS was preserved. Viral rebound occurred despite mean VRC07-523LS serum concentrations of 93 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>. The trial met the pre-specified endpoints. Our data suggest that future bNAb combinations likely need to achieve broad antiviral activity, while also maintaining high serum concentrations, to mediate viral control.</p>

              <p id="Par3">HIV-1-specific bNAbs targeting multiple epitope regions of the HIV-1 envelope trimer (Env) have demonstrated the ability to robustly reduce plasma viremia in people living with HIV not on ART as well as to modestly delay viral rebound in individuals during an analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Rapid selection of neutralization-resistant viral variants resulting in therapeutic failure has been observed in all referenced studies, and it has become evident that bNAb monotherapy is insufficient for viral control due to the frequent presence of pre-existing escape mutations in the substantially diverse within-host HIV quasispecies. Combination of two bNAbs with complementary epitope specificities—the CD4-binding-site (CD4bs) antibody 3BNC117 and the V3-glycan antibody 10-1074—were able to suppress viral rebound in a subset of individuals for an extended period during ATI; in contrast, viral breakthrough was observed in individuals in the presence of baseline escape or when one of the antibodies fell below the therapeutic threshold, resulting in functional monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">It has, therefore, been postulated that three bNAbs targeting different epitope regions would be necessary to overcome viral variants with potentially pre-existent escape mutations and provide sufficient control of the virus to prevent development of novel resistance. Complementary viral coverage resulting in extended breadth and potency has been modeled for multiple bNAb combinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and the combination of the CD4bs antibody VRC07-523LS, the V3-glycan antibody PGT121 and the V2-apex antibody PGDM1400 has been identified to neutralize 99% of a panel of 374 cross-clade HIV-1 strains, of which 82% would be neutralized with at least two active antibodies (with 80% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>80</sub>) of &lt;10 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, it is important to remember that such panels reflect single variants and not the complexity of within-host diversity found in natural infection.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Although both VRC07-523LS and PGT121 have demonstrated robust antiviral activity in viremic people living with HIV, PGDM1400 has not been evaluated in humans thus far. This antibody was originally identified in donor 84 of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) Protocol G cohort and is exceptionally broad and potent, covering 83% of a panel of 106 cross-clade pseudoviruses at a median 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 0.003 µg ml<sup>−1</sup>, being ten- to 100-fold more potent than CD4bs antibodies such as VRC01 and 3BNC117 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). Indeed, PGDM1400 provided highly potent antiviral activity in non-human primate simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) SF162P3 challenge studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PGDM1400 when given intravenously, alone or in combination with PGT121 and VRC07-523LS, in adults without HIV and determined the antiviral activity of all three bNAbs in viremic adults living with HIV not on ART.</p>

                <p id="Par6">To determine whether the triple combination of PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS is safe and active against HIV in humans, we initiated a two-part phase 1 study. Part 1 was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled study to evaluate three intravenous doses of PGDM1400 alone or in combination with PGT121 (3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per antibody, respectively) in adults without HIV. Each participant in part 1 received either PGDM1400 or placebo (group 1, <italic>n</italic> = 12) or PGDM1400+PGT121 or placebo (group 2, <italic>n</italic> = 12), randomized at a ratio of 3:1 each (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Part 2 of the study was a multi-center, open-label trial of a single intravenous administration of 20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> each of PGDM1400, PGT121 and VRC07-523LS (group 3A, <italic>n</italic> = 4) or a single infusion of 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of PGDM1400+PGT121 (group 3B, <italic>n</italic> = 1) in viremic adults living with HIV not on ART (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

                <p id="Par11">Viral escape from PGDM1400 for participants 693–1969, 693–7312 and 693–7989 was mediated by the loss of the potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) at residue 160, which is a key Env glycan contact for V2 apex bNAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and is strongly associated with susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Each participant showed different patterns for losing this glycan site through mutations at either residue 160 and/or 162 (for example, N160D for participant 693–7312; N160S and T162A for participant 693–1969), and multiple resistance mutations were also found within individual participants (693–1969 and 693–7989). For participant 693–2215, both baseline and rebound viruses were resistant to PGDM1400, likely explained by the presence of glycine at the Env site 166, instead of the more common arginine at this site. G-166 is a known resistance-associated mutation for PGDM1400 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>) at a critical bNAb contact site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. For participant 693–7989, two rebound viruses that were resistant to PGDM1400 did not show any canonical resistance mutations, such as those identified as signatures in Bricault et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and from previous mutagenesis studies compiled on the Los Alamos HIV Databse CATNAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index">https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These two viruses did have a V120I mutation, which could be a candidate mutation for resistance based on its structural proximity to PGDM1400-like bNAb contact sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par12">The escape from PGT121 occurred for all participants predominantly due to the loss of the PNGS at 332, which is a key contact glycan for V3 glycan bNAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and a requisite for susceptibility to such bNAbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This occurred by different routes across participants, either gaining PNGS at 334 (participants 693–2215 and 693–1969) or not (participants 693–7312 and 693–7989). In the latter two participants, 2–3 different resistance mutations per participant were found in the rebound viruses. Two rebound viruses in participant 693–7989 escaped PGT121 not by losing N332 glycan but, instead, by the D325N mutation, which is also a resistance signature for PGT121 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>) and was found in clinical escape from monotherapy with PGT121 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>) and with 10–1074 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>). For two rebound viruses from participant 693–7989 (A7.1 and A11.1), none of the V3 loop resistance mutations was found; however, they did have mutations that shifted a hypervariable V1 PNGS two sites toward the N-terminus relative to other viruses from this participant, and V1 loop glycans have been shown to affect V3 glycan bNAb sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

For participant 693–2215, all rebound viruses gained a glycan at site 234, and all but two rebound viruses gained a glycan in hypervariable V5 loop. Both of these glycan gain mutations have been shown to be associated with neutralization resistance to VRC07-523LS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We also detected a role for recombination in selecting for VRC07-523LS-resistant mutations in participant 693–2215 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Overall, our recombination analyses detected recombinant Envs in participants 693–1969 and 693–2215 as well as among the baseline sequences from participant 693–2290, who was subsequently lost to follow-up (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Although we could not detect any recombinants in other patients, this is likely due to the limited sampling of patient viral diversity rather than absence of recombination. In participant 693–2215, we found evidence that the resistance-conferring glycan at 234, found in all rebound viruses, as well as the glycan in the hypervariable V5 loop, were favored by recombination: four out of four and three out of four recombination events, respectively, from parental strains discordant at these sites carried forward the resistant-conferring mutations in the recombinant daughter Env (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The same kind of analysis was not possible for the other two participants because 693–1969 had no known VRC07-523LS resistance mutations in the rebound population, and 693–2290 was lost to follow-up before viral rebound.</p>
                <p id="Par16">To further understand why viral rebound occurs without developing substantial VRC07-523LS neutralization resistance, we analyzed VRC07-523LS serum ID<sub>80</sub> titers for the baseline and rebound viruses. Two non-exclusive mechanisms could allow viral escape: (1) evolution of viral resistance to VRC07-523LS neutralization and (2) decay of VRC07-523LS concentrations to sub-therapeutic levels. Serum ID<sub>80</sub> titers capture both of these mechanisms as they are based on both VRC07-523LS serum concentrations and the neutralization sensitivity of viruses (as described in the <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). For each participant in our study, ID<sub>80</sub> titers of VRC07-523LS at the time of viral rebound were significantly lower than those at day 7 after bNAb administration, regardless of whether VRC07-523LS neutralization resistance (increased IC<sub>80</sub> values) developed or not (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The median rebound serum ID<sub>80</sub> titers were also similar across participants (51–118). This result suggests that viral escape from VRC07-523LS occurs below a common threshold of serum neutralizing activity against contemporaneous viruses, which can be reached by either viruses developing neutralization resistance (participant 693–2215) or decay of bNAb concentrations (participant 693–7989), or by a combination of both (participant 693–1969). Although the low number of participants precluded robust statistical analyses, these data still suggest that maintaining ID<sub>80</sub> titers above the threshold of ~1,000 could improve viral control.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Comparison to other clinical studies testing CD4bs bNAbs in a post hoc analysis showed that similar mechanisms of viral escape are at play. During both 3BNC117 monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or dual therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and during VRC01 monotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, viral rebound in viremic individuals was observed at similar serum ID<sub>80</sub> titer ranges for the respective bNAb, as compared to VRC07-523LS in this study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Furthermore, rebound viruses demonstrated a similar pattern of in vitro IC<sub>80</sub> value changes to 3BNC117 and VRC01 (that is, unchanged susceptibility or increased resistance), as was observed for VRC07-523LS in this study (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7b,c</xref>), including six study participants who showed no significant change in 3BNC117 IC<sub>80</sub> values between baseline and rebound viruses (four from dual therapy and two from monotherapy studies). Despite some minor differences, the IC<sub>80</sub> values for rebound viruses across these previous studies were fairly similar to VRC07-523LS in this study. Together, these results suggest that, unlike the development of complete neutralization resistance against V2 apex and V3 glycan-targeted bNAbs by individual mutations at the target epitope, viral escape from CD4bs bNAbs involves a combination of the evolution of partial CD4bs bNAb escape as well as the decay of serum bNAb concentrations.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Indeed, serum bNAb combination ID<sub>80</sub> titers for rebound viruses for the triple bNAb combination studied here were not significantly different than the dual bNAb therapy used in a previous study by Bar-On et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; and although the triple combination rebound ID<sub>80</sub> titers in our study were ~5-fold lower than the dual combination in Bar-On et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, they tended to be higher than in the single bNAb studies (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7d,e</xref>). In this post hoc analysis, we noticed a trend between longer times to rebound when having at least two bNAbs with geometric mean IC<sub>80</sub> &lt; 0.3 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> for baseline viruses when combining our data and the Bar-On et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> study (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Applying the IC<sub>80</sub> &lt; 0.3 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> threshold to a panel of 374 cross-clade pseudoviruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, as previously reported, we found that using three bNAbs improved the neutralization coverage as compared to a dual bNAb cocktail; however, still less than 50% of viruses would be neutralized by two active bNAbs in this triple bNAb combination (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8b–d</xref>). These data emphasize the critical need to further extend bNAb breadth, either by adding additional antibodies into bNAb combinations, for enhanced potency and coverage, or by further engineering multi-specific monoclonals to achieve this goal.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par19">In this study, we established the safety and tolerability of the PGDM1400 antibody when administered intravenously, alone or in combination with the bNAbs PGT121 and VRC07-523LS in participants with and without HIV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a triple antibody combination in humans for the treatment of HIV-1. PGDM1400 is one of three V2-targeting antibodies that are being developed, along with CAP256-VRC26.25 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>) and its half-life-optimized version CAP256V2LS. This bNAb class, although with limited breadth against clade B viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, has superior potency compared to other bNAb classes and is, therefore, a promising component of bNAb combinations. Indeed, PGDM1400 is also being explored in combination with VRC07-523LS and PGT121 or 10-1074 in participants without HIV in the ongoing HVTN130 study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03928821">NCT03928821</ext-link>) with the goal to develop passive immunization strategies for HIV prevention.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Unfortunately, despite the extensive breadth of this bNAb combination, viral rebound in the presence of selected resistance mutations against PGDM1400 and PGT121 occurred rapidly in the studied participants. This might be explained, in part, by the potentially increased prevalence of PGDM1400 and PGT121 escape mutations in circulating viruses, as we previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, escape from PGDM1400 and PGT121 might more readily develop compared to the escape from CD4bs antibodies, as the critical variable loop glycans that are targeted by both antibodies are prone to deletion and modification. This also implies that such different barriers to resistance for individual bNAbs or bNAb classes might need to be considered when selecting antibodies for treatment regimens. The most durable control was seen for participant 693–1969 who had highly sensitive baseline viruses to all three bNAbs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and who demonstrated lower than baseline HIV RNA levels through the end of the study. Nevertheless, although bNAb administration potentially resulted in a more rapid initial viral decline than what has historically been reported during ART initiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the overall therapeutic efficacy of the bNAbs in the setting of active plasma viremia did not reach the level of virological suppression of current ART regimens, specifically those that include integrase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, given the variable neutralization profiles of bNAbs against global viruses, the ability to neutralize most viruses with three active bNAbs would likely require combinations of at least four bNAbs targeting different epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This could potentially be achieved by engineered multi-valent antibodies such as the tri-specific antibody SAR441236 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>) that combines the CD4bs specificity of VRC01-LS, PGDM1400 and the gp41 MPER binding of 10E8v4-variant, which is currently under clinical evaluation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03705169">NCT03705169</ext-link>). Viral replication and breakthrough viremia during treatment with VRC07-523LS, and CD4bs bNAbs in general, can occur despite substantial bNAb concentrations in serum and/or relatively low-level increase in neutralization resistance. Although the apparent lack of complete escape from VRC07-523LS neutralization in the presence of serum bNAb levels might suggest that such escape could be difficult for viruses to achieve, it also does not seem to be required to sustain robust plasma viremia. By maintaining higher levels of the bNAb, such as the suggested ID<sub>80</sub> titers above the threshold of ~1,000, enhanced and perhaps longer-term control of viremia might be achieved; however, this would need to be confirmed in future clinical studies. Furthermore, another defining factor for the efficacy of bNAb combinations might be the pre-treatment level of viral replication. In our study, bNAbs were administered to viremic participants with up to ~160,000 HIV RNA copies per ml at the time of infusion. The antiviral activity and the ability to control virus more robustly might be enhanced in individuals with low-level viremia and/or low-level viral replication. Indeed, this was reported for macaques where PGT121 administration led to long-term SHIV control in animals with low baseline viral loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and we also previously observed that PGT121 suppressed viral replication for extended periods in a subset of participants with low baseline HIV RNA levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This, therefore, suggests, that although daily ART, and likely future long-acting antiretrovirals (ARVs), reliably suppress HIV in viremic individuals, the triple bNAb combination reported here might still perform well in individuals with low levels of replicating/reactivating virus—that is, what is seen during ATI, as reported by Mendoza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> with a double bNAb combination. Indeed, such a strategy, testing a triple bNAb combination during ATI, is currently underway in an ongoing study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03721510">NCT03721510</ext-link>). Furthermore, in contrast to ARV medicines that must be continued indefinitely, bNAbs might have a significant advantage. Given their ability to target and mediate elimination of infected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and to harness host immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, a potential effect on reducing the size of the latent reservoir during bNAb therapy has been suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Furthermore, combination bNAb therapy will likely be necessary for HIV prevention strategies, to provide broad coverage against the diversity of globally circulating viral strains. As recently reported in the Antibody-Mediated Prevention (AMP) study, the single bNAb VRC01 did not prevent overall HIV acquisition more effectively than placebo but was effective in preventing infection against VRC01-sensitive HIV isolates, suggesting that bNAb prophylaxis can be effective if the viral coverage is broad enough<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Here as well, further optimization of bNAbs and bNAb regimens is necessary, and their role for prevention strategies, specifically with long-acting ARVs as a promising alternative, will need to be determined. Thus, combinations of ARVs and bNAbs, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the single agents, are under active exploration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03739996">NCT03739996</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par22">The present study has several limitations. The sample size for part 2 is small, with only three individuals available for complete virological analysis after triple bNAb therapy. The participants were not pre-screened for pre-existing bNAb resistance and/or selected based on viral susceptibility. Furthermore, participants, including participant 693–1969 who demonstrated the strongest virological response, were not tested for plasma ARV drug levels to confirm ART naivety.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In summary, the results presented here will help to advance understanding of the capabilities, the limitations and the future role of bNAb combinations in HIV prevention and care. PGDM1400 could be included in future bNAb cocktails for passive immunization strategies, either for prevention or for therapeutic approaches given its complementary epitope specificity. Our data contribute to efforts to define a threshold bNAb(s) titer(s) that is required for viral control and that will inform dosing requirements and/or bNAb half-life engineering strategies for future monoclonal therapeutics.</p>

                <p id="Par27">In part 1, eligible participants were enrolled first into the lowest dose subgroup of PGDM1400 alone (group 1A), and enrollment into the lowest PGDM1400 and PGT121 combination dose subgroup (group 2A) occurred only after the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) reviewed the safety data through day 14 after administration of PGDM1400 alone and approved dose escalation. This staggered dose escalation was continued for each dose group. Participants in each subgroup were identified by a unique study identification number. Participants were randomized according to the randomization schedule prepared by the statisticians at the Data Coordinating Center (DCC, Emmes Company) before the start of the study. Participants were automatically assigned a specific allocation number as they were enrolled into the data entry system. An unblinding list (Pharmacy List) was provided to the unblinded site pharmacist by the DCC. Study staff (investigator and clinical personnel monitoring the safety and laboratory assay results) and participants were blinded with respect to the allocation of the IP. A site pharmacist was unblinded for the purposes of preparing the IP. Blinded participants were informed about their assignment (product or placebo) at study completion, once the data were locked. As the bNAbs and placebo (saline) looked identical in the infusion bag, no masking was required. In part 1, the four participants in each dose level subgroup (3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> or 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) in group 1 and (3 + 3 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, 10 + 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> or 30 + 30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) in group 2 were randomized at a ratio of three antibody recipients to one placebo recipient, respectively (total of nine antibody recipients and three placebo recipients per group). At each dose level in part 1, IP administration was separated by at least 24 hours for each of the first three participants. Randomization in part 1 ensured that at least two participants received active product and were observed for at least 24 hours before administration to additional participants. IP administration was also separated by at least 24 hours for each of the first three participants in part 2, group 3A, who received the triple bNAb combination.</p>

                <p id="Par40">The primary endpoints for safety and tolerability were as follows: (1) proportion of participants with moderate or greater reactogenicity (for example, solicited AEs) for 3 days after intravenous infusion of PGDM1400 alone, a combination of PGDM1400 and PGT121 bNAbs and a combination of PGDM1400 and PGT121 and VRC07-523LS; (2) proportion of participants with moderate or greater and/or PGDM1400- and PGT121- and VRC07-523LS bNAb-related unsolicited AEs, including safety laboratory (biochemical and hematological) parameters after intravenous infusion of PGDM1400 and/or PGT121 and/or VRC07-523LS for the first 56 days after administration of the IP; and (3) proportion of participants with PGDM1400- and/or PGT121- and/or VRC07-523LS-related SAEs throughout the study period. The primary endpoints, for pharmacokinetics, were elimination <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, clearance (CL/F), volume of distribution (Vz/F), area under the concentration decay curve (AUC) and effect of HIV RNA levels on PGDM1400 and/or PGT121 and/or VRC07-523LS disposition (elimination <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>), CL/F, Vz/F and total exposure. The primary endpoint for antiviral activity among viremic participants with HIV was the change in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels from baseline (mean of pre-entry and entry values). The secondary endpoints were change in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell count and frequency compared to baseline as measured by single-platform flow cytometry and development of HIV-1 sequence variations in epitopes known to result in reduced PGDM1400 and/or PGT121 and/or VRC07-523LS neutralization susceptibility. The primary endpoints for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics were changed in Protocol Version 4.0 to include the VRC07-523LS monoclonal antibody for the subgroup 3A (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref> for a summary of all protocol changes).</p>

                <title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par41">(1) The sample size for safety and tolerability analysis was 30–66 participants according to the dose-escalation design used to characterize the safety profile of one intravenous infusion of PGDM1400 monoclonal antibody ± PGT121 monoclonal antibody, at one of three dose levels. For life-threatening AEs related to active product: if none of the nine (maximum 18) participants in either group 1 or group 2 who receive the active product experience such reactions, then the exact 95% upper confidence bound for the rate of these AEs in the population is 33.6% (or 18.5% if <italic>n</italic> = 18). This was an exploratory proof-of-concept trial; the analysis was descriptive; and no formal null hypothesis was tested. The frequency of moderate or greater reactogenicity events was determined and compared among groups. The frequency of SAEs judged possibly, probably or related to the IP was determined. All AEs were analyzed and grouped by seriousness, severity and relationship to the IP (as judged by the investigators). An interim safety analysis of group data was carried out after each dose escalation according to the study schema without unblinding the study to investigators or participants. At the end of the study, a full analysis was prepared. Missing data were excluded from the statistical analysis. (2) The sample size for pharmacokinetic analysis was three per dose subgroup, sufficient for the planned analyses based on previous experience with PGT121 pharmacokinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The data were fit to standard two-compartment population models using the Stochastic Approximation Expectation–Maximization (SAEM) estimation method in Monolix (version 2019R1, Lixoft SAS, 2019). Population (non-linear mixed effects) pharmacokinetic (popPK) models were fit separately by analyte and HIV infection status. Fixed effects were used to model the population-level pharmacokinetic parameters, and random effects were used to model the individual-level variability. The AUC was estimated by calculating the integral of the predicted concentration–time curve from the first infusion time to infinity. Additionally, peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was computed as the maximum observed concentration. Summary descriptive results of pharmacokinetic parameters, including AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and CL/F results, were reported by bNAb and dose cohort. For each analyte, a Spearman correlation test was conducted to test for correlation among elimination <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, CL/F, Vz/F and dose- and weight-adjusted AUC with log<sub>10</sub> VL at baseline (null hypothesis: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0; α = 0.05) using mid-ranks for tied scores and the approximate distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Correlation between pharmacokinetic and reported safety and pharmacodynamic outcomes were also explored parameters to examine exposure–effect relationships. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> was used to assess the concordance between the log<sub>10</sub> concentrations from the binding and neutralizing antibody assays. (3) The sample size for virologic analysis was 6–18 participants across groups 3A and 3B. No placebo participants were enrolled in part 2 as per study design. For each participant, VL difference-from-baseline was defined as the difference in day 7 log<sub>10</sub> plasma HIV-1 RNA levels from baseline (mean, on log<sub>10</sub> scale, of screening and day 0 levels). Based on a simulation study, power to reject the null hypothesis was 80% when the responder group has a difference-from-baseline VL drop of approximately 1.8 logs for a nominal α level of 0.05. As the study under-enrolled for group 3, the virologic outcome was not formally analyzed.</p>

Dashes indicate amino acids were the sequences match the reference. Mutations at the glycans are shown in red if they confer resistance and blue if they confer sensitivity. The top triplet shows the only recombinant found at the first time point where no resistant mutations were detected. In the remaining triplets, recombination preferentially selects the resistant mutation 4 out of 4 times for the glycan at position 234, and 3 out of 4 times at the site of the V5 glycan.</p>

Similar to Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">methods</xref> for ID80 calculation details. A one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to calculate statistical significance of differences between baseline and rebound titers for each patient, and p-values are shown on the top of the panel. All participants except 9341, 2C1 and 2E1, showed significantly lower serum ID80 titers at rebound as compared to baseline. (<bold>b</bold>) CD4bs bNAb IC80 values (µg/ml) as tested in vitro against baseline and rebound viruses from each participant across the studies. Similar to (A). Most participants showed significant difference (p &lt; 0.05 using one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test), with the exception of participants 693-7989, 91C22, 91C34, 91C35, 9342, 2C1 and 2E1 for whom no significant differences were found (p &gt; 0.05). (<bold>c</bold>) Summary of in vitro IC80 values (µg/ml) of rebound viruses per study. Each point shows the per-participant median CD4bs bNAb IC80 value (µg/ml) for rebound viruses from each study. The only significant difference using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was found to be between 3BNC117 + 10-1074 and VRC01 studies (p = 0.0134), and a trend when comparing this study to VRC01 (p = 0.0719); all other comparisons resulted in p &gt; 0.17 (p-values not shown). (<bold>d</bold>) Same approach as (A) but using bNAb combination serum ID80 titers (see <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">methods</xref> for combination ID80 titer calculation details). All participants showed significantly lower ID80 titers (that is due to higher resistance) for rebound viruses as compared to baseline viruses (p &lt; 0.05 using one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). (<bold>e</bold>) Same approach (C) but summarizing the combination serum ID80 titers at rebound across studies. For 3BNC117 and VRC01 groups, single bNAb rebound ID80 titers are shown. The only significant difference was observed between the 3BNC117 + 10-1074 and VRC01 studies, with the former having significantly higher rebound ID80 titers than the latter (p = 0.0353 using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test). All other comparisons were not significant (p &gt; 0.23; p-values not shown).</p>

These data suggest that longer times to rebound were found for those participants whose baseline IC80 &lt; 0.3 µg/ml for at least 2 bNAbs in the therapeutic combination. (<bold>b</bold>) IC80 values for individual and combination bNAbs. Data are shown as heatmaps with viruses on the rows. Viral subtypes and individual bNAb and bNAb combination IC80 values are shown as columns. Color coding of subtypes and IC80 values is shown on the bottom right. Viruses are ordered according to the number of bNAbs with IC80 &lt; 0.3 µg/ml, with most number of bNAbs active on top and least on the bottom, and according to neutralization sensitivity to each bNAb. The ordering of viruses between the left and the right panels is different. The single bNAb neutralization data for these non-tier-1 374 viruses was obtained from CATNAP, as previously described6, combination IC80 values were predicted using Bliss-Hill model assuming each bNAb at equal concentrations. Combination IC80 values are the sum of concentrations of each bNAb in the combination for predicted 80% neutralization of a given virus.

For dual coverage a virus is considered only if it is neutralized by 2 or 3 bNAbs at individual bNAb IC80 &lt; 0.3 µg/ml, based on the suggested trend of this metric associated with longer time of viral control from panel (A).
