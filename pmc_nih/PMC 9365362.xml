                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Of 20 enrolled patients, 19 received the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, which was found to be safe and feasible. Four patients demonstrated tumor response on MRI, one with complete regression and still alive after 8 years. Most serious adverse events were attributed to increased intracranial pressure caused by either an inflammatory reaction responding to steroid treatment or viral meningitis being transient and self-limiting. Often viral DNA concentrations in CSF increased over time, peaking after 2 to 4 weeks and remaining up to 3 months. Concomitantly Th1- and Th2-associated cytokine levels and numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> T and natural killer cells increased. Posttreatment tumor specimens revealed increased numbers of macrophages and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. No evidence of viral shedding in excreta was observed.</p>

              <p>In this phase I trial, we demonstrate the safety of prolonged infusion by convection enhanced delivery of the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) and peritumoral regions. Despite the potential effects of immunotherapeutic approaches in GBM, including immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic vaccines, limitations affecting treatment efficacy are apparent. Our study results show promising clinical responses and indications for an antitumor immune response, providing a base for future testing of (combinatorial) Delta24-RGD treatment in GBM. This trial was the first to assess the local and locoregional responses upon infusion of an oncolytic virus into the tumor and surrounding brain by sequential sampling of brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytokine and chemokine analysis in CSF suggested that IFNŒ≥ and TNFŒ± levels may represent a potential biomarker for response in future oncolytic viral trials. Biomarker assays may ultimately aid in the identification of responding patients and improve the response rate to oncolytic viral therapy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite aggressive multimodal therapy the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal, with a median survival of 12 to 15 months and almost always a fatal outcome (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The need for novel treatments of GBM has led to the development and evaluation of several virus-based therapeutic strategies, among which oncolytic viruses (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this clinical study we tested Delta24-RGD (DNX-2401) in patients with recurrent GBM. This oncolytic adenovirus harbors a 24 base pair deletion in the viral E1A genomic region, which renders the adenovirus unable to replicate in normal cells, but capable of replicating in cells with disrupted Rb pathway (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3, 4</xref>). The p16/Rb pathway is inactivated in more than 90% of gliomas, making this pathway an excellent target for designing tumor-specific replication-competent viruses (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5‚Äì9</xref>). In addition, a RGD-4C peptide is inserted in the fiber knob, altering the primary attachment from the Coxsackie Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) to Œ±vŒ≤5 and Œ±vŒ≤3 integrin receptors, improving the infection efficiency of glioma cells (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>). The oncolytic potency of Delta24-RGD has been confirmed in several preclinical studies (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12‚Äì15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Apart from direct oncolysis, studies in syngeneic mouse glioma models demonstrated that local Delta24-RGD treatment induced T-cell-mediated antitumor responses and established a protective immune memory (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16, 17</xref>). This immune-mediated antitumor activity was abolished upon co-treatment with the immune suppressive agent dexamethasone or by depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, resulting in complete loss of survival benefit (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16, 18</xref>). More recently, we showed that local Delta24-RGD therapy promotes a prolonged shift in tumor macrophage phenotype from the protumoral M2 toward pro-inflammatory M1 in human GBM, contributing to a tumor-detrimental microenvironment (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Combination treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti‚ÄìPD-1 improved the efficacy of Delta24-RGD treatment in two syngeneic mouse models for GBM (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Together, these studies underscore the important role of the immune system in Delta24-RGD therapy of GBM.</p>
              <p>A recently published phase I clinical trial with a ‚Äúwindow of opportunity‚Äù component testing local injection of Delta24-RGD into the tumor of patients with recurrent GBM showed evidence of viral replication in tumor cells and activation of antitumor immune responses in posttreatment specimens. These biological effects translated into complete and durable antitumor responses in several patients. No toxic side effects were observed and 15% of the antitumor responses were long-lasting, suggesting that activation of the immune system is an important mechanism of this agent (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p>
              <p>In view of the recognized heterogeneity and the diffuse spread of GBM, we applied convection enhanced delivery (CED) for local administration. With this method of prolonged micro-infusion, a large volume of distribution can be achieved (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Herewith, different subclonal tumor populations may be infected by the virus, as well as infiltrating tumor cells in the surrounding brain.</p>
              <p>In this clinical study, we enrolled 20 patients with recurrent GBM in a dose escalation set-up, administering Delta24-RGD by CED to larger areas of tumor and tumor-infiltrated brain with the purpose of evaluating the safety and tolerability of Delta24-RGD. A unique aspect of the study was that serial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained before, during, and for prolonged periods after virus infusion, which enabled analysis of reactive changes in blood and CSF composition. Microdialysis of tumor tissue enabled measurement of interstitial, extracellular fluid composition before and during virus infusion. Urine, saliva, and fecal sampling enabled us to assess potential viral shedding after virus administration to the brain.</p>

                  <title>Study drug</title>
                  <p>Delta24-RGD is a conditionally replication-competent adenovirus, containing a 24 base pair deletion (bases 923‚Äì946) in the E1A gene and an integrin-binding motif (RGD-4C) insertion in the H1 loop of the fiber. The production of the virus was commissioned and supplied by the Biological Resources Branch (BRB), Development Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment &amp; Diagnostics (DCTD) at the National Cancer Institute-Frederick (NIH), and manufactured by The National Vector Production Laboratory at Baylor college of Medicine in Houston.</p>
                  <p>The drug was supplied in a sterile, pyrogen-free solution at a concentration as specified on the Certificate of Analysis diluted in 20 mmol/L Tris, 25 mmol/L NaCl, 2.5% (w/v) glycerol as stabilizer and pH 8.0. Delta24-RGD was provided in sterile single use vials, containing 0.25 mL fill volume each, with a titer of 2 √ó 10<sup>11</sup> vp/mL (6 √ó 10<sup>9</sup> pfu/mL). Just prior to administration, the virus was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl and 0.2% human serum albumin and divided into syringes of which the number corresponded with the number of CED-infusion catheters to be used. Virus stability and compatibility with the catheter-tubing system was assessed in advance.</p>

                  <title>Treatment plan</title>
                  <p>Patients not amenable for surgical resection underwent needle biopsy, placement of CED catheters, a ventricular catheter with subcutaneous reservoir for CSF sampling and a microdialysis probe in a single surgical procedure. Four temporary CED catheters were inserted, of which two in the enhancing tumor core and two in the tumor-infiltrated surrounding brain. The temporary microdialysis probe (cut-off 100,000 Da; M Dialysis AB), enabling continuous sampling of brain interstitial fluid (BIF), was inserted in the tumorcore. Patients with an indication for tumor debulking first underwent resection in a separate procedure at least 1 week before study treatment.</p>
                  <p>Before virus infusion, the position of catheters was evaluated by CT scanning. Convective properties and function of catheters were assessed by 4 to 6 hours test infusion (flow rate of 0.2 to 0.3 mL/h) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent followed by MR scanning. Catheters not showing convective spread of gadolinium were not used for virus infusion.</p>
                  <p>Virus was infused over a time period of 44 to 66.7 hours with a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 mL/h, depending on number of catheters used. Hereafter CED catheters and the microdialysis probe were removed. Patients remained in isolated care during virus infusion and until daily testing for virus shedding was negative for minimally 3 consecutive days after ending of Delta24-RGD infusion, provided that surgical wounds were without signs of CSF leakage after removal of the catheters and dialysis probe.</p>

If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) occurred in the first three patients, subsequent patients were entered in the next dose level (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the event of a DLT, three additional patients were enrolled at the same dose level. DLT was defined as any Delta24-RGD related ‚â•grade 3 organ system toxicity, or grade 4 hematology or grade 4 nonorgan system metabolic/laboratory toxicity. The MTD was defined as one dose level below the dose causing DLT in ‚â•33.3% of the patients with a minimum of 6 treated patients treated at that dose level. An extension cohort of 6 patients was planned to be treated at the MTD.</p>

                <p>Patient 9 (dose level 3, 1 √ó 10<sup>9</sup> vp) was readmitted with a CTC grade 4 confusion and signs of delirium 4 weeks after virus infusion. Although this event was possibly related to virus treatment, he recovered after haloperidol and antibiotic treatment because of a suspected urinary tract infection.</p>
                <p>Patient 10 (dose level 4, 1 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp) was hospitalized 2 weeks after virus treatment because of a first generalized seizure, CTC grade 3. Seizures resolved after starting anti-epileptic medication and correction of a hyponatremia and hypopotassemia. The event was possibly related to virus infusion, but more likely related to the GBM itself in combination with hyponatremia.</p>
                <p>Patient 13 (dose level 5, 3 √ó10<sup>10</sup> vp) was readmitted 4 weeks after virus treatment with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and increased peritumoral edema on CT scan, CTC grade 3. Administration of dexamethasone provided rapid improvement.</p>
                <p>Patient 14 experienced neurologic deterioration after surgery for needle biopsy and catheter placement. His preoperative KPS score of 70 dropped to 50 resulting in failure to meet the inclusion criteria. This grade 3 SAE was related to study related surgery and not to the virus itself.</p>
                <p>Patient 15, treated at dose level 5 (3 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp), was readmitted with mild fever, nausea, and vomiting, CTC grade 3, hydrocephalus, and CSF leakage from the surgical head wound 2 weeks after virus infusion. After bacterial meningitis was ruled out, the patient was diagnosed with viral meningitis and subsequent mild hydrocephalus, which was supported by the finding of a high Delta24-RGD titer in CSF. Spontaneous recovery occurred after 2 weeks.</p>
                <p>Patient 16 experienced a wound dehiscence, CTC grade 3, related to other study procedure.</p>
                <p>Patient 17 (dose level 4, 1 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp) was readmitted 2 weeks after virus infusion with an increase of preexisting mild hemiparesis, headache, nausea, and vomiting, CTC grade 3. A CT scan showed increased edema around the tumor and mid-line shift, after dexamethasone and mannitol therapy symptoms disappeared. This patient also experienced a wound dehiscence, CTC grade 3.</p>
                <p>Patient 20 (dose level 4, 1 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp) was readmitted 1 week after virus treatment with dysphasia and mild fever, CTC grade 3, both disappeared spontaneously. A CT scan did not reveal new findings and an EEG showed possible postictal changes. Because of previous epilepsy-related speech disorders, it was concluded that this event was caused by an epileptic seizure, possibly related to virus infusion.</p>
                <p>Four patients developed dysregulation of the CSF circulation. This resulted in re-closure of a CSF-leaking head wound (patient 15), placement of a CSF shunt (patients 6 and 12), and head bandage for a subcutaneous CSF collection with ventricular enlargement on CT scan (patient 10). Two of these patients and an additional other patient (patient 17) had signs of viral meningitis consisting of headache, neck pain, and nausea, occurring between week 2 and 4, which were all self-limiting. Although a clear relation between occurrence of these symptoms, CSF circulation disturbances, and viral CSF titers is lacking, virus delivery through CED catheters in the tumor and the surrounding brain may have led to spreading of viral particles, not only in tissue but also in the CSF, causing symptoms of viral meningitis.</p>
                <p>MTD as a result from toxicity was not reached in this study. Because of CSF leakage from a head wound 2 weeks after treatment at dose level 5 (3 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp) in patient 15, dose escalation was evaluated by the Dutch environmental safety authority and DSMB upon which it was recommended to stop dose escalation, not because of toxicity but to avoid a possible risk of virus shedding. Therefore, patients in the dose expansion cohort were subsequently treated at dose level 4 (1 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp).</p>

At 24 to 48 hours after start of infusion, CSF viral DNA titers were low or undetectable in 15 patients and high in patients 8, 12, and 13. Hereafter, most patients show a substantial increase of CSF viral titers with a peak at 2 weeks post-infusion. In patients 1, 3, 7, and 16, titers remained low or undetectable up to 4 weeks after viral infusion. Interestingly, in three of the six available 12-week CSF samples, viral DNA was still present. No correlation could be found between administered viral dose, the level of or fold increase of virus particles in CSF over time and tumor response. However, in 4 of 7 patients surviving more than 6 months, the amount of viral DNA increased over time up to 4 weeks after treatment (patients 2, 10, 15, and 20), with the best responding patient 15 having a steep increase.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study we have shown for the first time that prolonged infusion by CED technique of the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD, in recurrent GBM as well as in the surrounding brain, is safe. Study-related SAEs that occurred caused symptoms mostly related to increased intracranial pressure caused by inflammation-related edema or viral meningitis, however these signs and symptoms were all temporary. Two of 19 treated patients showed long-term survival, of whom one is still alive, free of tumor 8 years without any other treatment. In CSF and tumor of specific patients, including the long-term surviving patient, virus remained present over a long time period, up to 12 weeks, the number of immune cells and levels of modulatory cytokines and chemokines were increased, suggesting that an antitumor immune response can be elicited.</p>
              <p>Several trials have shown that local delivery of replicating oncolytic viruses into malignant glioma is feasible and safe (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26‚Äì30</xref>), and recent studies demonstrated impressive durable responses in a significant proportion of patients (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 31, 32</xref>). Lang and colleagues tested Delta24-RGD in 37 patients with recurrent GBM (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Five of 25 patients (20%) receiving a single intratumoral injection survived more than 3 years. Furthermore, analysis of resected treated tumor revealed presence of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> and T-bet<sup>+</sup> cells 2 weeks after Delta24-RGD treatment, suggesting an immunogenic antitumor response. Treatment of 61 patients with recurrent GBM with the polio-virus derived PVS-RIPO achieved a similar therapeutic effect of 21% long-term survivors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Treatment of 45 patients with the retrovirus derived TOCA-511 virus in a phase II trial led to an OS of 13.6 months (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Although the phase III study with TOCA-511 was negative (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we do believe that oncolytic viral therapy holds strong therapeutic potential, based on the relatively large number of responders in early-phase trials.</p>
              <p>In the current trial, we observed viral meningitis as treatment related toxicity in 3 patients, which is most likely related to the mode of delivery using CED. At the time of this study, dedicated CED catheters designed for backflow reduction, were not available yet. The use of these suboptimal CED catheters in this trial may have contributed to shedding of virus into the CSF, causing viral meningitis. Although we cannot outweigh the benefits or risks of use of CED for delivering adenovirus to tumor and surrounding brain, the finding that virus remains present in the CSF for a long period of time, is new. This may be caused by continuous production of viral progeny in the infected tumor cells, the viral spill in the CSF due to inadequate CED catheters or a combination.</p>
              <p>In this dose-escalating study with six dose levels, the MTD was not reached. A wound healing problem occurred in a patient treated at dose level 5 (3 √ó 10<sup>10</sup> vp), with subsequent CSF leakage, 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Due to the risk of viral shedding as observed by the national environmental safety authority, the DSMB recommended to continue the study at dose level 4. Risk of environmental shedding of the virus through excreta was found to be nearly nil.</p>
              <p>Although median OS is within the expected range for patients with recurrent GBM, 2 of 19 treated patients showed long-term survival, with one complete responder being still alive. Although these results may not seem impressive, it must be recognized that in this trial patients were heavily pretreated and in far stage of disease. The majority of patients in this study, 14 of 19, were treated at second or even third recurrence. Furthermore, during the conduct of this trial, it could not be discerned whether symptoms as headache and nausea were caused by viral meningitis, tumor growth, or an inflammatory reaction causing edema. MR and CT imaging were not helpful in discriminating between these different etiologies of increased intracranial pressure. These symptoms were treated with steroids, in retrospect this treatment may have hampered the desired antitumor immune response. A striking observation was that long-term surviving patient 15, whose neurologic deterioration that was accompanied by signs of increased intracranial pressure was initially treated with high-dose dexamethasone, improved dramatically after withdrawal of steroids. These support the notion that steroid use should be avoided in oncolytic viral therapies.</p>
              <p>This clinical trial was also the first to assess the local and loco-regional responses upon infusion of an oncolytic virus into the tumor and surrounding brain by sequential sampling of BIF and CSF. PCR analysis in 12 of 17 evaluable CSF samples showed presence of viral DNA at 4 weeks after treatment, in 5 patients these levels were increased compared with measurements at earlier time points. At 12 weeks, 4 patients still had viral DNA present in CSF, of which 2 were increased compared with the 4-week measurement. These findings are in support of the anticipated biological effect of virus replication in tumor cells, which may continue for a longer period of time than previously anticipated. Not only reactive immune cell activation but also preexisting antiviral antibodies may limit the efficacy of virus-based therapies due to rapid elimination of the virus or viral vector (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34, 35</xref>). However, therapy-enhancing effects of preexisting antibodies have also been reported (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36, 37</xref>). In the Delta24-RGD-treated patients, the levels of preexisting anti-adenovirus antibodies did not correlate with level and duration of viral DNA in the CSF. Interestingly, the best responding patient had the highest pre- and posttreatment antibody titers.</p>
              <p>Also, the Th1-associated cytokines IFNŒ≥ and TNFŒ±, rose in CSF of a large subset of patients and peaked between 2 and 4 weeks after treatment. This peak coincided with significant increases in CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets and CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells. These findings were in line with the analysis of post-mortem tumor tissue of patient 7 and re-resected tumor of patient 11 showing large numbers of immune cell infiltrates. Re-resected tumor obtained 26 months after treatment from patient 16, revealed the long-term nature of this local inflammatory response to viral treatment, which was also accompanied by a macrophage phenotypic shift from a more tumor-supportive M2 phenotype toward a more tumor detrimental M1 phenotype as we described previously (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Importantly, presence of high levels of IFNŒ≥ in the CSF was associated with high numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the CSF. In this small patient series, segregation of the overall survival graph into patients with high versus low CSF IFNŒ≥ levels, suggests a survival benefit of high IFNŒ≥ levels. CSF IFNŒ≥ and TNFŒ± levels may therefore represent a potential biomarker for response in future oncolytic virus trials.</p>
              <p>BIF analysis showed high levels of acute-phase cytokines and chemokines already prior to virus infusion, presumably resulting from tissue damage during surgery for biopsy and catheter placement. Such effects have been reported previously and were described to resolve within approximately 6 hours (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). However, a more prolonged increase in cytokines and in particular chemokines was noted in a subset of our patients, often returning to baseline values after 44 hours. This may indicate that these increases measured beyond 6 hours are related to the virus infusion. Because we were unable to sample BIF after the time point of 44 hours prolonged kinetics could not be assessed.</p>
              <p>Further research is required to validate whether local cytokine levels represent biomarkers for response and whether such responses can be modelled <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic>. Such biomarker assays may ultimately aid in the identification of responding patients and improve the response rate to oncolytic viral therapy.</p>
