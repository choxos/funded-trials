The tegumentary <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 antigen was selected based on its unique recognition by cytophilic antibodies in putatively immune individuals living in areas of ongoing <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> transmission in Brazil, and preclinical studies in which vaccination with <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 protected mice following infection challenge.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A randomized, observer-blind, controlled, Phase 1b clinical trial was conducted in 60 healthy adults living in a region of Brazil with ongoing <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> transmission. In each cohort of 20 participants, 16 were randomized to receive one of two formulations of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 vaccine (adjuvanted with Alhydrogel only, or with Alhydrogel plus the Toll-like receptor-4 agonist, AP 10–701), and 4 to receive Euvax B hepatitis B vaccine. Successively higher doses of antigen (10 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg) were administered in a dose-escalation fashion, with progression to the next dose cohort being dependent upon evaluation of 7-day safety data after all participants in the preceding cohort had received their first dose of vaccine. Each participant received 3 intramuscular injections of study product at intervals of 2 months and was followed for 12 months after the third vaccination. IgG and IgG subclass antibody responses to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 were measured by qualified indirect ELISAs at pre- and post-vaccination time points through the final study visit.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel administered with or without AP 10-701 was well-tolerated in this population. The most common solicited adverse events were mild injection site tenderness and pain, and mild headache. No vaccine-related serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest were observed. Groups administered <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 had higher post-vaccination levels of antigen-specific IgG antibody. A significant dose-response relationship was seen in those administered <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701. Peak anti-<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 IgG levels were observed approximately 2 weeks following the third dose, regardless of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 formulation. IgG levels fell to low levels by Day 478 in all groups except the 100 μg with AP 10–701 group, in which 57% of subjects (4 of 7) still had IgG levels that were ≥4-fold higher than baseline. IgG subclass levels mirrored those of total IgG, with IgG1 being the predominant subclass response.</p>

                <p>Infection caused by <italic toggle="yes">Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is a major neglected tropical disease with significant associated morbidity. New tools, such as vaccines, are needed due to the inadequacy of current control strategies. Tetraspanin-2 of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2) is one of the lead vaccine candidates for hepatic/intestinal schistosomiasis. Antibodies induced by this vaccine are postulated to interfere with the development of the tegument of adult <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> worms, thereby impairing their development and survival. We conducted a Phase 1 trial of recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 adjuvanted with Alhydrogel in 60 healthy adults living in Brazil. Each participant received three vaccinations every 2 months by intramuscular injection of the vaccine administered with or without an aqueous solution of the Toll-like receptor-4 agonist, Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (AP 10–701). <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel was well tolerated in schistosomiasis-exposed adults; no vaccine-related severe or serious adverse events were observed. Antigen-specific IgG antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent fashion with increasing levels observed after each vaccination. The addition of AP 10–701 to the vaccine resulted in significantly higher antibody responses. Based on these results, the vaccine has been advanced into a Phase 2 clinical trial in an endemic region of Africa.</p>

              <p>Approximately 240 million people in 54 countries are infected with <italic toggle="yes">Schistosoma</italic> blood flukes, with up to 700 million people at risk of infection [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although acute infection can cause significant morbidity and even death due to Katayama fever, the greater global burden of disease due to this parasite results from chronic infection that can lead to life-threatening complications such as portal hypertension associated with <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> or bladder obstruction, kidney failure, and bladder cancer associated with <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">haematobium</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis caused by <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> accounts for approximately one-third of schistosomiasis cases and almost half of deaths worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> is the only schistosome species endemic in the Americas, with the largest number of infections in this region occurring in Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Currently, the control of schistosomiasis relies on mass drug administration of praziquantel primarily to school-age children 5 to 15 years of age, who tend to have the highest intensity of infection and disease burden. However, control programs based on mass chemotherapy are complicated by rapid and frequent re-infection following treatment. These programs are difficult and expensive to maintain, as has been highlighted by the interruption of many of these programs during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, significant morbidity can occur if regular periodic treatments are interrupted [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, reduced responsiveness to repeated treatment with praziquantel suggests potential emerging drug resistance, a concern given the lack of alternative therapies [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Alternative tools such as an effective anti-schistosomal vaccine are therefore needed to adequately control, and ultimately eliminate, the burden of disease caused by this parasitic infection.</p>
              <p>Several anti-schistosomal vaccines are currently in preclinical or clinical development [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Recombinant <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> Tetraspanin-2 (<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2) formulated on Alhydrogel, an aluminum hydroxide salt adjuvant, is being developed to prevent heavy infections with <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic>, given that morbidity is related to infection intensity [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Schistosomes express a family of integral transmembrane proteins that locate to the epithelial syncytium forming the body wall, or tegument, of several stages of the schistosome life cycle, and are considered essential to the formation, maintenance, and turnover of the transient outer surface of this helminth [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Evidence for this comes from <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> RNA interference experiments in which schistosomula were exposed to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-tsp-2 double-stranded RNA, resulting in significant reductions in <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-tsp-1 transcription levels and significantly thinner and more vacuolated tegument with a morphology consistent with a failure of tegumentary invaginations to close. The most compelling data come from field studies conducted in the same region as the Phase 1b trial reported herein, which demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 was uniquely recognized by cytophilic IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies from putatively resistant individuals at levels significantly higher than age-, sex-, and exposure-matched chronically infected controls [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, preclinical testing showed that vaccination with this antigen protected mice in a challenge model of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> infection [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

It was shown to be safe and well-tolerated, and it induced significant antigen-specific serum IgG responses [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, since safety or immunogenicity results may differ between naïve and previously exposed and/or infected individuals, a Phase 1b dose-escalation trial was conducted in a region of Brazil where <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> is endemic, as described herein. Potential study participants were screened for the presence of IgE antibodies to recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 prior to enrollment, given the experience with the <italic toggle="yes">Necator americanus</italic> Ancylostoma Secreted Protein-2 (<italic toggle="yes">Na</italic>-ASP-2) hookworm vaccine, in which previously infected individuals who had IgE antibodies to the vaccine antigen developed generalized urticaria upon vaccination [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>The primary and secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel administered with or without AP 10–701 to healthy Brazilian adults residing in an area of ongoing <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> transmission compared to the comparator hepatitis B vaccine.

                <p>Reactogenicity was measured from the time of each study vaccination (study days 1, 57, 113) through 7 days after each study vaccination by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactogenicity events. Solicited symptoms included erythema, induration/swelling, pain, and tenderness as injection site reactions; and fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, malaise, and fatigue as systemic reactions.</p>
                <p>Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded from the time of each vaccination through 28 days after each study product administration. New-onset chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), including AEs of special interest (AESI), and serious AEs (SAEs) were recorded from the time of the first study vaccination (day 1) through the final study visit. Active surveillance for AESIs of autoimmune (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune thyroiditis) and inflammatory (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., inflammatory bowel disease) etiology was conducted throughout this clinical trial due to the use of the novel AP 10–701 adjuvant [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
                <p>Participants were observed in the study clinic for at least 60 minutes after vaccination to assess immediate reactogenicity. They were subsequently assessed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after each vaccination, and then at regular intervals until 12 months after the third injection. AEs were assigned severity of mild (easily tolerated), moderate (interfered with activities of daily living), or severe (prevented activities of daily living); causality in relation to study product was determined based on investigator judgement. Injection site swelling and erythema were assessed as small (25 to 50 mm in diameter), medium (51 to 100 mm), or large (&gt;100 mm); whereas oral temperature was graded as mild (38.0°C to 38.4°C), moderate (38.5°C to 38.9°C), or severe (≥39.0°C).</p>
                <p>Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed on the day of vaccination and 7 days later to measure alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, and complete blood count (CBC) including hemoglobin (Hgb), platelets, and white blood cells (WBC).

                <p>Cat. No.: 250203. Lot Number:2012283). In brief, 96-well plates were prepared with either 1 μg/mL recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 (drug substance) diluted in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.5 μg/mL purified human IgE serially diluted in 1X PBS to generate a standard calibration curve (SCC), or 0.125 μg/mL IgE as a positive control. Plates were incubated overnight at 2–8°C and then washed with PBST20 to remove any unbound IgE or <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2. All wells were then blocked with PBS and 5% Tween 20 with 5% bovine serum albumin (Blocking buffer, or BB). Serum samples were also diluted in 5% BB before being added to test plates in duplicate at a 1:25 dilution. Plates were sealed and then incubated overnight at 2–8°C. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary IgE antibody was then added to the plates at a 1:1000 dilution in 5% BB and plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (18–25°C). Plates were then washed and streptavidin-HRP added to all wells at a 1:1000 dilution in 5% BB and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes protected from direct light. Plates were washed a final time before being developed with <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (Sigma Aldrich). After 30 minutes, the reaction was stopped by adding H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (Ricca). Plates were then immediately read at an Optical Density of 492nm (OD<sub>492nm</sub>) using a SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). OD<sub>492nm</sub> values were collected using SOFTmax GXP PRO version 4 with the arithmetic mean of duplicate ODs of the purified human IgE heterologously interpolated onto 4-parameter logistic (4-PL) models of the purified IgE to derive the Arbitrary Units (AU) of anti-<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 IgE.</p>

A standard reference serum (SRS) for the assay was made by pooling sera collected from 5 high IgG responders to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 who participated in the phase 1a study of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel in healthy adults [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In brief, 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc Polysorb) were coated with 5 μg/mL of recombinant <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 and kept overnight at 2–8°C. Plates were then washed and blocked with a buffer (BB) consisting of PBS and Tween 20 with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (Fitzgerald). After decanting the BB off the plates, test sera were added in duplicate at a 1:4000 dilution. Plates were sealed and kept at 2–8°C overnight, and on the following day they were decanted and washed again. HRP-conjugated secondary mouse anti-human IgG (Clone JDC-10 [Southern Biotech]) was added at a 1:2500 dilution (ThermoFisher). Plates were covered and maintained at room temperature for 2 hours, followed by a wash and development using OPD (Sigma Aldrich) and read after 30 minutes at OD<sub>492nm</sub> following the addition of 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> using a SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). OD<sub>492</sub> readings were collected using SOFTmax GXP PRO version 4, with the arithmetic mean of duplicates of test sera homologously interpolated onto the 4-PL model of the human SRS to derive the AUs of anti-<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 IgG.</p>
                <p>IgG subclass antibodies specific to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 were similarly measured in serum using qualified indirect ELISAs using heterologous interpolation to derive AUs of IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Myeloma-derived purified human IgG1, IgG3, or IgG4 (catalog numbers: 16-090707-1M, 16-16-0909707-3, 16-16-090707-4M, respectively [Southern Biotech]) were adsorbed directly to 96-well Nunc Maxisorb microtiter plates (Cat No: 439454) in doubling dilutions to derive a SCC for each IgG subclass. Test sera were added at the following dilutions to each plate as described above IgG1 (1:50), IgG3 (1:50), and IgG4 (1:25). Plates were covered and incubated overnight at 2–8°C. On the following day the plates were washed, and a HRP-conjugated secondary mouse anti-human IgG1 (Clone HP6070), IgG3 (Clone HP6050), or IgG4 (HP6025) were added to the plates at 1:1000.

For these participants, specimens collected after the missed vaccine dose were excluded from the immunogenicity analyses. All comparisons between <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel groups and the comparator vaccine group included pooled Euvax B recipients from all 3 cohorts.</p>
                <p>IgG and 3 IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4) antibodies to the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 protein were measured on each day of vaccination, 14 days post-vaccination, and approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the final dose of study product. Statistical summaries of IgG and IgG subclass levels, including mean and standard deviation; geometric mean and 95% CIs; and median, minimum, and maximum, were calculated for each vaccine group and time point.</p>
                <p>The R<sup>2</sup> for the 4-PL SCCs of SRS generated in SOFTmax GXP PRO should be above 0.6 to meet the specification of an acceptable relationship (dose response) between the dilutions and the ODs for the 4-PL log regression model.

Fold-rise distributions were depicted graphically via box plots by vaccine group and time point. A seroresponse was defined as a ≥4-fold rise over baseline. Fold-rise values were summarized by geometric mean by vaccine group and time point, as were proportions of seroresponders. Proportions of seroresponders on study day 127 were compared between controls (comparator vaccine) and each vaccine dose level group using Fisher’s exact test. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test was performed on log-transformed day 127 IgG antibody levels to compare responses between individuals who were negative for schistosomiasis at screening and those who were positive, including baseline IgG level, <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 dose level, and AP 10–701 coadministration status as covariates.</p>
                <p>A post-hoc Cochran Armitage test of trend was performed to investigate a possible dose-response relationship in the proportion of total IgG seroresponders among participants receiving <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel without AP 10–701 on study day 127.

                <p>Forty-eight participants experienced 96 non-serious unsolicited AEs, most of which were mild in severity. Three out of 60 participants (5%) experienced at least 1 unsolicited AE of mild or moderate severity that was assessed as being related to study vaccine by the study investigators. These 3 participants experienced 7 (5 mild, 2 moderate) vaccine-related unsolicited AEs. Of these, 1 (moderate pruritus at the injection site) occurred after the third injection in a participant who received 100μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel without AP 10–701, whereas the remaining 6 (2 episodes of mild injection site pruritus, 1 episode of moderate injection site pruritus, 1 episode of mild injection site hematoma, 1 episode of mild injection site papular rash, and 1 episode of mild abdominal pain) occurred in 2 participants in the comparator vaccine group. There were no vaccine-related severe unsolicited AEs.</p>
                <p>In the pooled group of participants who received 1 of the 3 dose concentrations of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with or without AP 10–701, the most common unsolicited AEs were infections (24/48, 50%) and gastrointestinal disorders (10/48, 21%). Upper respiratory tract infections accounted for most (17/24, 71%) of the infections, whereas abdominal pain, toothache, and dyspepsia were the most common gastrointestinal AEs. In this group, 19 of 48 (40%) participants experienced moderate unsolicited AEs, compared to 2 of 12 (17%) in the comparator group.</p>

In contrast, the proportions of participants with ≥4-fold increases in IgG antibodies after vaccination (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>., seroresponders) were high in the 30 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 group and were highest in the 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 group (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0011236.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>), with these responses peaking on study day 127, 2 weeks after the third dose of vaccine. At this time point, 4/8 (50%) of 30 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 recipients and 6/7 (86%) of 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 recipients were seroresponders, respectively. Proportions of seroresponders fell in all groups for the remainder of the study until day 478 except in the 100 μg plus AP 10–701 group, in which 57% of participants (4 of 7) continued to have IgG levels that were ≥4-fold higher than baseline.</p>
                  <p>There were significantly more (86%) antigen-specific IgG responders in the 100 μg with AP 10–701 group than in the comparator vaccine (8%) group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.002) at study day 127 (<bold><xref rid="pntd.0011236.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref></bold>). However, proportions of responders in the other vaccine groups were not significantly different from the comparator group. Nevertheless, the results suggest a dose-response relationship for <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel when administered with AP 10–701. At study day 127, seroresponse frequencies were 13%, 29%, and 25%, respectively, for the 10 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel without AP 10–701 groups. For the groups given 10 μg, 30 μg, and 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701, the frequencies of responders were 33%, 50%, and 86%, respectively. Cochran Armitage tests for linear trend with increasing dose of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 yielded <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values of 0.339 for the non-AP 10–701 groups and 0.001 for the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel plus AP 10–701 groups, including the comparator vaccine group in each test at a dose level of zero.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The results of this Phase 1b, observer-blind, randomized, dose-escalation clinical trial of a candidate recombinant protein vaccine against <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> are summarized herein. When administered to healthy young adults who reside in an area of Brazil with active <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> transmission, the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel schistosomiasis vaccine was found to be safe and well tolerated. Mild injection site tenderness and pain, as well as mild headache, were the most common solicited reactions. Solicited injection site and systemic reactions were short-lived, lasting only a median of 2.5 and &lt;1 days, respectively. Injection site tenderness and pain were reported significantly more frequently among participants receiving <italic toggle="yes">Sm-</italic>TSP-2/Alhydrogel with or without AP 10–701 than participants vaccinated with the comparator hepatitis B vaccine, whereas rates of systemic symptoms were similar between groups. The frequencies of clinical laboratory events judged to be associated with vaccination were low, and these events were mild, transient, and clinically insignificant.</p>
              <p>The safety results of the current study conducted in healthy adults resident in a region endemic for <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> are similar to those of the first-in-humans Phase 1a trial of this vaccine conducted in schistosomiasis-naïve adults in Houston, Texas [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, of note, the finding of a possible trend for the occurrence of mild fever among recipients of <italic toggle="yes">Sm-</italic>TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 (referred to as GLA-AF in the previous study) was not observed in the study conducted in Brazil.</p>
              <p>Baseline pre-vaccinations levels of IgG to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 were detected in several participants across vaccine groups, which is likely secondary to previous infection or exposure to the parasite [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These baseline IgG levels to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 are consistent with previous studies in the same region of Brazil, where chronically infected individuals had low levels of IgG to this antigen compared to putatively resistant individuals, an observation suggesting that natural infection does not induce the robust antibody responses to this transmembrane protein that we hypothesize are required for protection. Encouragingly, the presence of pre-existing antibody responses to the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 antigen did not appear to interfere with the humoral response to vaccination, since significant fold-increases in IgG were observed particularly in those vaccinated with 30 or 100 μg of antigen, to a degree equivalent to or exceeding that previously reported in schistosomiasis-naïve individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> is the only schistosome species that infects humans in South America, background immune responses to other schistosome species would not be expected to impact the assessment or interpretation of vaccine immunogenicity as might be the case in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where infection with species other than <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> might modify the immune response to vaccination.</p>
              <p>Formulation- and dose-dependent increases in IgG antibodies against the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 vaccine antigen with adjuvant were observed. The highest GMLs of anti-<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 IgG were seen in participants who received 30 μg or 100 μg of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel when co-administered with the AP 10–701 adjuvant. Although significant differences in the GML of IgG between groups vaccinated with <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with or without AP 10–701 were not observed, groups given <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 had higher GMLs of antigen-specific IgG antibody compared to those who received <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel without AP 10–701, suggesting a positive adjuvant effect of this TLR-4 agonist.</p>
              <p>Across dose concentrations and formulations, the highest antigen-specific IgG responses were generally noted at study day 127, 2 weeks following receipt of the third dose of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel. Similarly, there were significantly more antigen-specific IgG seroresponders in the 100 μg with AP 10–701 group than in the comparator group at this time point. Although the proportions of seroresponders in the other vaccine groups were not significantly different from the comparator group, the results are suggestive of a dose-response relationship for <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel when administered with AP 10–701, in that the proportion of responders was higher when <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel was administered with AP 10–701 at each of the 3 <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 dose levels tested.</p>
              <p>Although levels of antibody declined in the lower dose groups in the 12 months following vaccinations, it is encouraging to note that in the 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 group, IgG levels remained significantly above baseline until the end of the study. Given the putative antibody-mediated mechanism of this vaccine, sustained levels of antibody are presumed to be important for long-term efficacy. Future studies may be needed to explore if additional booster doses will elicit higher IgG levels that may be required to maintain protection.</p>
              <p>Based partly on the immunogenicity and safety results of this trial, 100 μg <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel with AP 10–701 is the dose and formulation currently being tested in a Phase 2 proof-of-efficacy trial in Ugandan adults. In this study, volunteers with detectable eggs of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> on microscopic examination of a fecal sample are treated with praziquantel before being vaccinated with the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 vaccine or an active comparator. The primary endpoint will be the rate of re-infection over an 18-month period of follow-up.</p>
              <p>Vaccines targeting other helminths such as hookworm have triggered IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions when tested in individuals who had previously been exposed to the pathogen [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Encouraging for the continued development of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel, only 1 of 126 volunteers who were screened for IgE antibodies to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 during eligibility assessment for the current study tested positive using a qualified indirect ELISA, and even this individual had an antigen-specific IgE level only slightly above the limit of detection. Furthermore, no vaccine-related hypersensitivity reactions were observed after any of the vaccinations in the clinical trial reported here.</p>
              <p>In the first clinical trial of <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel conducted in a population with endemic <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> infection, several lines of evidence converge to justify advancing this recombinant version of the extracellular loop of the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 tegumentary transmembrane protein as a vaccine candidate. First, <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 was found to be as safe and well tolerated as it was when administered in a first-in-humans Phase 1a trial to naïve individuals in the USA, a finding that is especially important given previous experience in the same area of Brazil where vaccinations with the hookworm excretory/secretory protein <italic toggle="yes">Na</italic>-ASP-2, which is similarly accessible (and not a ‘hidden’ antigen) to the host as <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2, resulted in immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. Second, in both the USA and Brazil Phase 1 studies, <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel elicited robust IgG responses in a dose-dependent manner and consisting primarily of IgG1, which mirrors the predominant humoral immune response to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 observed in putatively resistant individuals resident in the same <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> endemic area of Brazil as the trial reported herein [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Third, although IgG to <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 was observed at baseline in several individuals in the current study, an observation reported in only 1 individual in the Phase 1a study in the United States, significant increases in IgG were seen in this population, indicating that low levels of pre-existing antibodies do not interfere with vaccine-induced responses.</p>
              <p>Although <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 targets just one of the two most prevalent schistosome species, it is possible that this antigen may also induce cross-reactive antibodies or other immune responses to other schistosome species, particularly <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">haematobium</italic>. Although no empiric cross-reactivity studies have been conducted to date, the amino acid sequence similarities between the <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">haematobium</italic> tetraspanins, including <italic toggle="yes">Sh</italic>-TSP-2, and their <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> homologs ranges from 71–93% when entire open reading frames are compared and 70–84% when only the large extracellular loop regions are considered [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that IgG antibodies induced by the <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2/Alhydrogel vaccine will cross-react with <italic toggle="yes">Sh</italic>-TSP-2 and potentially protect against this schistosome species.</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 is one of several ubiquitous integral tetraspanin membrane proteins, and antibodies targeting it are hypothesized to disrupt the epithelial syncytium that forms the schistosome tegument, a dynamic outer layer maintained and organized by abundant proteins such as <italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2. The abundant levels of the IgG subclasses induced by the recombinant protein in this Phase 1b trial are encouraging for this vaccine due to their critical role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which is the proposed mechanism for disrupting the schistosome tegument [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the functionality of the anti-<italic toggle="yes">Sm</italic>-TSP-2 antibodies induced in participants in this study was not assessed, the immunogenicity and safety results of the Phase 1b trial reported in this manuscript are nevertheless encouraging. Larger studies need to be conducted in populations with high levels of exposure to <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">mansoni</italic> and other <italic toggle="yes">Schistosoma</italic> species to assess the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing infection and to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity in children, who will be the principal target of a licensed vaccine for schistosomiasis [<xref rid="pntd.0011236.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

                <bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is a very well written manuscript that describes the successful completion of Phase 1b trial of the Sm-TSP-2 vaccine against schistosomiasis. First, I will like to congratulate the authors for validating the safety of the vaccines using a randomized, observer-blind, controlled phase 1b clinical trial in 60 healthy adults living in a region of Brazil with ongoing S. mansoni transmission, as well as showing that the two adjuvanted Sm-TSP-2 vaccines (+alum or +alum/AP 10-701) are minimally reactogenic, and importantly both elicited significant IgG and IgG subclass responses against the vaccine antigen after the third dose (in particular when 100 ug of the antigen was used). The outcomes of this study have led to the initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial of this vaccine in an endemic region of Uganda.</p>
              <p>I have few minor recommendations that might enhance the value of this study. </p>
              <p>Although the authors have clearly described the experimental details of the clinical trial and its outcomes (safety and immunogenicity), I recommend that the authors share some of their immunogenicity data more plainly, which may help other researchers who are considering conducting clinical trials to evaluate their own vaccine studies. Specifically, and for example, how does 4-fold increase in arbitrary units (AU) (using 1:4000 dilution of sera) translates to actual ELISA ODs; seroresponse was defined as &gt;4-fold rise over baseline. </p>
              <p>If I understand it correctly, analysis of all the Standard Reference Serum (SRS) control testing (Figure S1) implies that a 10-100 AU range is associated with OD range of 0.5-3.5, while 1:4000 dilution of the SRS is about an OD of 0.5. As the antigenicity outcomes were presented only as AU (Figs 4 and 6) and fold change (Fig. 5) it is very hard to recognize the actual levels (OD at 1:4000) of the IgG and/or IgG1 and IgG3 responses that were elicited, which have made the 100ug adjuvanted vaccines more potent than the 10 or 30 ug doses (Figure 4; Table 2); what are for example the ODs of 16.2 fold AU (day 293) vs AU of 25 (day 127) of the Am-TSP-2 + alum/AP 10-701 vaccine vs. the other groups and vs. the baseline of 4-fold AU? Adding such pertinent supporting information where appropriate could enhance the value of the comparative immunogenicity studies across the 6 experimental vaccine groups. </p>
              <p>I also wonder whether presenting the data in the various groups separately (like in figure S2) instead a congregated format of the 7 groups (Figure 4 and Figure 6) might be more informative and show more clearly the kinetics in each group’s participants and their associated error bars. As presented, there is too much indistinguishable data in each graph.</p>
              <p>Second, the vaccine antigen was selected “based on its unique recognition by cytophilic antibodies in putatively immune individuals living in areas of ongoing S. mansoni transmission in Brazil, and preclinical studies in which vaccination with Sm-TSP-2 protected mice following infection”. </p>
              <p>I wonder if a functional assay was developed that can correlate directly and specifically the increased immunogenicity with the functionality of the anti-Sm-TSP-2 IgG and cytophilic antibodies elicited by the best vaccine formulation. If there is such an assay, was it done, and if not, a discussion pointing to such an experimental gap should be considered. In reference 14, it was shown that the putatively immune individuals have significant elevated mean IgG1 and IgG3 responses (1:100, ELISA) against TSP-2 of OD ~1.5 and 1, respectively, in comparison to the chronically infected individuals. What are the optimal titers of induced TSP-2 cytophilic antibodies that can be associated indirectly with protection?</p>
              <p>Stating simply in the discussion that the vaccine elicited IgG responses “consisting primarily of IgG1, which parallels the unique and presumably protective humoral immune response to Sm-TSP-2 observed in putatively resistant individuals resident in the same S. mansoni endemic area of Brazil” is insufficient as it is not based on direct functional evidence and therefore might be somewhat misleading that the desired protective humoral responses having a critical role in ADCC were actually elicited. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, it is not clear which formulation and dose(s) was selected for the Phase 2 clinical trial; Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogelor or the Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel + AP 10-701, and what readout are being expected. Such statements might be instructive.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Diemert and co-authors report a well conducted Phase Ib study of Sm-TSP-2.</p>
              <p>The following are some considerations for improving the manuscript:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Para 3 from line 103. The key data describing the recognition of Sm-TSP by putatively immune humans is not referenced (line 117). Reference 14 does not match the mouse challenge model.</p>
              <p>Methods.</p>
              <p>It appears that Ag-specific IgE was only tested for at enrolment. I would be curious if Ag-specific IgE was generated by the vaccine.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Baseline parasitolgical investigation. As the authors highlight, the TSP experience with pre-sensitization has been an issue of interest. A more comprehensive reporting of the baseline parasitologic findings would be appropriate (beyond kato katz for Sm and Ag-specific IgE). A more comprehensive parasitologic evaluation is described in the methods. Was baseline schisto serology done on study subjects? Any baseline parasitologic data should be presented (even if in supplement)</p>
              <p>Line 392 “renal dilatation” is not something I don’t recognize. Suggest omit and just state “rigid ureterorenal lithotripsy”</p>
              <p>Clinical Lab AEs (from line 457): Actual lab values should be given in text (or in supplement)</p>
              <p>Table 2: </p>
              <p>This does not display the key data well. Graphical presentation of key findings would be better. I recognize that 63 scatterplots would be excessive (!) but 7 serial scatterplots of actual Ab level would show the data better. Raw data should be presented in supplement, or a data sharing statement included.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Do the authors predict cross-reactive responses to Sh TSP?</p>
              <p>Do the authors have any data from animal experiments or seroepidemiologic data to infer what a likely “protective” Ab titer would be?</p>
              <p>The authors imply that one of the formulations is going into Phase II. Which is it and what is the rationale for this decision?</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Diemert,</p>
              <p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "A Randomized, Controlled Phase 1b Trial of the Sm-TSP-2 Vaccine for Intestinal Schistosomiasis in Healthy Brazilian Adults Living in an Endemic Area," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases.</p>
              <p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p>
              <p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Editorial, Viewpoint, Symposium, Review, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p>
              <p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript will be published online unless you opted out of this process. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. </p>
              <p>Best regards,</p>
              <p>Shaden Kamhawi</p>
