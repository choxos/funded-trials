                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Many cancer survivors experience cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI).
We conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial of 2 types of yoga practice
and evaluated their effects on participants’ objective cognitive
function.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section2-15347354221089221">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Sedentary breast or ovarian cancer survivors were randomized to practice
either restorative yoga (with more meditative practice and minimal physical
exertion) or vigorous yoga (with considerable physical exertion and minimal
meditative practice) in 60-minute supervised sessions 3 times a week for
12 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of home practice. We used the NIH Toolbox
Cognition Domain to evaluate participants at baseline, week 12, and week
24.</p>

                <sec id="section3-15347354221089221">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>We enrolled 35 participants. For women in the restorative yoga group, overall
cognitive function was statistically significantly improved at weeks 12 and
24 compared to baseline (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .03 and 0.004; Cohen’s
<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> = 0.3 and 0.5). Fluid cognitive function also
significantly improved at weeks 12 and 24 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02 and
0.0007; Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> = 0.3 and 0.6), whereas improvements in
crystallized cognition were not significant. For women in the vigorous yoga
group, significant improvement was only seen in tasks of crystallized
cognition at week 24 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .03; Cohen’s
<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> = 0.5). Between-group comparisons showed that at week 24,
women in the restorative yoga group had significantly higher scores on fluid
cognition tasks.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Patients who participated in yoga practice demonstrated improvement in
objective cognitive function over time. Restorative yoga may be more
effective in improving fluid cognitive function at week 24 when compared to
vigorous yoga. These promising findings should be confirmed in definitive
studies.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a common concern for patients during
and after cancer treatment. Up to 35% of patients experience CRCI after completing
cancer treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr4-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The mechanisms are not fully
understood and optimal management is an area of active research.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Previous studies have evaluated self-reported cognitive impairment and
observed gray matter density changes in bilateral frontal, temporal, and cerebellar
regions in patients after cancer treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> So far, cognitive rehabilitation is the most studied treatment for CRCI and
showed improvement in cognitive measure and has been used in clinical care.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, the studies were limited by heterogeneity in study design,
intervention, and outcome measures. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy itself is
limited by availability of a therapist, time commitment, and lack of insurance
coverage. More studies to explore therapeutic interventions that are cost effective,
can be self-administered, and can lead to objective improvement of cognitive
functions are needed.</p>
              <p>Yoga practice has been investigated as an intervention for cancer patients during
treatment for quality of life and other self-report measures.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Yoga combines physical activity with breathing and relaxation exercises to
improve both physical and mental fitness. Interventions that have been associated
with cognitive improvement across different cognitive impaired disease states
including CRCI, aging, and early stages of cognitive degenerative diseases mostly
involve aerobic exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> However, aerobic exercise requires motivated patients and discipline in
complying with a regular exercise regimen. We are interested in whether yoga, with
its physical and contemplative practices, can help sedentary patients who do not
exercise regularly.</p>
              <p>Previous yoga studies evaluated self-reported cognition complaints with the majority
focusing on subjective patient-reported outcomes and very few focusing on objective
cognitive function.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="bibr10-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr11-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr12-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr13-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Cognition has 4 domains:
information processing speed, executive function, attention, and
memory/concentration. In this study we used NIH Toolbox Cognition Domain testing to
measure objective cognitive function. General cognitive function can be subdivided
into fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Fluid intelligence is the ability to process new information and solve novel
problems in real time. It is correlated with skills such as comprehension, problem
solving, and learning.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Fluid cognition usually peaks early in life around age 20 then slowly
declines. Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use knowledge that was
previously acquired through education and experience. It experiences less
age-related decline.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study we compared “restorative yoga,” which emphasizes the contemplative and
relaxation components of yoga practice, with a vinyasa-based “vigorous yoga,” which
emphasizes constant fluid movement in synch with breathing. Here we report data from
a pilot randomized control trial that evaluated the effect of 2 types of yoga
practice on cognitive function in sedentary breast and ovarian cancer survivors.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We recruited study participants at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK)
through mailed recruitment letters or direct referral from breast and ovarian cancer
clinics. The MSK Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the clinical trial
protocol and informed consent form (IRB #14-059). We obtained written informed
consent from all individual participants included in the study. The primary end
point of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and safety of a supervised
vigorous yoga practice in previously sedentary cancer patients. The results of the
feasibility data have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Briefly, our inclusion criteria were: woman age 18 or older; history of stage 0 to
III breast cancer or stage I to III ovarian cancer; all antitumor therapies,
excluding hormonal therapy, have been completed at least 60 days prior to
enrollment; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 to 1
within 90 days of enrollment; and sedentary: &lt;90 minutes/week of
moderate-intensity and &lt;30 minutes/month of any high-intensity activity in the
past 2 months.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Our exclusion criteria were: evidence of active malignant disease; breast
implant; significant cardiopulmonary disease, severe arthritis, glaucoma, or any
other medical conditions that make yoga practice unsafe; regular use of beta
blockers or calcium channel blockers; use of any medication that would interfere
with the study’s initial blood tests within 7 days of the initial study blood test;
and unlikely to be compliant with the study intervention.</p>
              <p>We randomized enrolled patients to either restorative or vigorous yoga practice
groups and they attended a 60-minute class 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The Clinical
Research Database (CRDB) at MSK conducted randomization in randomly permuted blocks.
Assignment concealment was achieved by the CRDB computer system. Randomization was
stratified by history of breast or ovarian cancer. The restorative yoga practice
incorporated a combination of supine, prone, and seated resting postures with a
closing 5-minute relaxation.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The vigorous yoga practice included a warm-up, a repeated quadruped posture
sequence with arm and core strengthening, strengthening standing postures with an
emphasis on breathing, inversion positions, stretching, and then a 5-minute
centering and closing relaxation.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Participants in the vigorous yoga group wore heart rate monitors. Their heart
rates were monitored in real time, and the yoga teacher instructed participants to
repeat postures to increase the heart rate to 60% to 70% of each person’s individual
maximal heart rate. After 12 weeks of in-person sessions, participants continued
practicing the hour-long regimen at home 3 times a week for an additional
12 weeks.</p>
              <p>We administered the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Domain<sup><xref rid="bibr19-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> at baseline, week 12 after the in-person yoga practice intervention had
finished, and week 24 after the home yoga practice period finished. The NIH Toolbox
Cognitive Scoring uses various tasks to evaluate fluid cognitive domains including
Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention (executive functioning and attention),
Dimensional Change Card Sort (executive functioning), Picture Sequence Memory
(memory), List Sorting (working memory), and Pattern Comparison (processing speed)
tests. There are 2 tasks that measure “crystallized intelligence” or accumulated
experiential knowledge, single-word reading, and picture vocabulary. It has
acceptable test-retest reliability with fluid cognitive domains concordance
correlation coefficients (CCC) = 0.73 and crystallized cognitive domains CCC = 0.85.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> It has good validity with median correlations of 0.88 for crystallized
cognitive domains and 0.70 for fluid cognitive domains.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The sample size was 20 patients per treatment arm, which was determined by
convenience rather than statistical power give that this is a pilot study. NIH
Toolbox Cognitive Scores were analyzed using STATA statistical software. The NIH
Toolbox Cognitive Scores prior to these analyses were adjusted for factors such as
education to yield a fully-adjusted standard score. Cognition scores were analyzed
using an ANCOVA model to detect significant differences between cognitive scores
accounting for covariance of other variables such as baseline outcome and cancer
types.</p>

              <p>We enrolled 42 subjects and randomized them equally to either group. Of the 21
subjects assigned to either group, 20 in the restorative yoga group and 15 in the
vigorous yoga group started the intervention and were included in the analysis cohorts.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> After reassessment immediately before starting the interventions, 7 subjects

              <p>CRCI is a major concern for many breast cancer survivors. They complain of decline in
their ability to concentrate, form new memories, and execute problem solving, all
functions of fluid cognition. Even though cognitive rehabilitation has been used and
studied as a treatment for CRCI and shown some efficacy,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> additional interventions are still needed. In this small trial, we found that
consistent practice of restorative yoga by female cancer survivors led to a
significant increase (a 13-percentile increase—from below average to above average)
in tasks assessing fluid cognitive function when compared to baseline. This fluid
cognitive score improvement suggests that the relaxation, breathing, and stretching
practices supported by the restorative yoga practice may have potential to improve
cognitive function in areas such as problem solving and memory. However, it is
difficult to draw this conclusion because there is no usual care group to use as a
comparison to tease out regression to the mean effect; additional research with an
appropriate control arm is needed. Importantly, both interventions were safe.</p>
              <p>For women in the restorative yoga group, fluid cognitive function also significantly
improved at weeks 12 and 24 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02 and .0007; Cohen’s
<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> = 0.3 and 0.6), whereas improvements in crystallized
cognition were not significant. To put the effect sizes in clinical context, fluid
cognition in the restorative yoga group improved significantly from the 42nd
percentile (score of 97) to the 55th percentile (score of 102) after 24 weeks,
indicating that those participants moved up 10 percentiles among the general
population.</p>
              <p>For women in the vigorous yoga group, significant improvement was only seen in tasks
of crystallized cognition at week 24 (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .03, Cohen’s
<italic toggle="yes">D</italic> = 0.5). This means that in the vigorous yoga group, fluid
cognition improved from the 37th percentile to the 42nd percentile (score from 95 to
97), but it was not statistically significant.</p>
              <p>For crystalized cognition, the restorative yoga group changed from the 97th
percentile to the 98th percentile (score from 129 to 130), whereas the vigorous yoga
group changed from the 98th percentile to the 99th percentile (score from 130 to
134). There may be a “ceiling effect” because the baseline crystalized cognition
scores of this study population are already so high. From the patients’ perspective,
impaired fluid cognition (ability to process and act on new information and task) is
what bothered them the most. This is reflected in the relatively low fluid cognition
score among this group of highly intelligent women (crystalized cognition score in
the high 90th percentile of the general population). Therefore a 10-percentile
improvement would be appreciated by these cancer survivors.</p>
              <p>We also found that it was easier for sedentary cancer survivor to adhere to regular
practice of restorative yoga than to the more physically demanding vigorous yoga.
One hundred percent of the women in the restorative yoga group completed the 12-week
period of supervised practice, with 85% completing more than two thirds of these sessions.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Eighty-five percent completed the 12-week home practice. The corresponding
numbers for the vigorous yoga group were 87%, 73%, and 77%. Therefore, for sedentary
female cancer survivors, restorative yoga is an intervention that is easier to
adhere to, while also leading to improvement in fluid cognitive ability. On the
other hand, it is also possible that restorative yoga focuses more on mindfulness,
which has been shown to improve cognitive function, whereas vigorous yoga focuses
more on the mechanistic aspects of yoga with less effect on cognition.</p>
              <p>The main limitation of this study is its small sample size and not limited to
participants with certain degree of cognitive dysfunction. It was designed as a
pilot study to support a hypothesis. It was also limited by a young patient
population, with average ages in the 50s in both groups. The second limitation is
that most subjects in the study were breast cancer survivors. When expanded to
sedentary patients with other cancer types, the results will likely vary. In
addition, due to study design, as both groups received active interventions, it is
difficult to discern the placebo effect. Also, the study lacked a usual care control
arm, which makes it difficult to evaluate how much cognitive improvement was due to
natural changes over time. Also, our study did not employ a mixed-methods design,
which prevented us from including findings from different methodological
perspectives. Further studies should include such outcome measurements. On the other
hand, for this population, which had been highly functional cognitively, decline in
fluid cognitive function was impactful and created emotional distress. Patients
would very much welcome an increase in their fluid cognitive function. However,
there are significant ceiling effects for crystal intelligence, making it very
difficult to discern clinical significance in its improvement. Lastly, because the
primary end point of this trial is not CRCI but feasibility and safety, the
eligibility of this trial is not limited to patients with certain CRCI deficits.
Moreover, per the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force’s recommendation,
ideal CRCI research should be a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with
cognitive assessments at baseline and at long-term follow-up.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-15347354221089221" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given that CRCI is a prevalent problem with no definitive treatment currently
available, our data indicate that a restorative yoga practice is a feasible and
practical intervention worthy of further adequately-powered, larger studies. Such
studies will generate more definitive data on the practice of restorative yoga to
improve cognitive function in breast and ovarian cancer survivors with
cancer-related cognitive impairment.</p>
