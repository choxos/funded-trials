                  <title>Background and objectives</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Delivery of nutrients directly to the small intestine, either via enteral feeding tube or by gastric bypass surgery, is associated with increased levels of appetite-suppressing and glucoregulatory hormones, including GLP-1, and reduced appetite. Achieving these changes non-invasively using formulated foods may be of therapeutic benefit in individuals with obesity and related comorbidities. The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effect of a single dose of a novel delayed-release nutrient (DRN) on glucose, GLP-1, c-peptide, insulin, and appetite in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">We formulated an all-natural, generally recognized as safe (‘GRAS”) DRN and conducted a randomized prospective crossover trial. Nineteen adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes underwent paired 3-h meal tolerance tests (MTT) in randomized order 1–4 weeks apart. Subjects ingested a single dose of DRN and the same nutrients as unformulated powders (UN).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">For DRN compared with UN, the maximal concentration (Cmax) was significantly lower for glucose, c-peptide, and insulin, and the time of maximal concentration (Tmax) was significantly delayed. While Tmax for GLP-1 was also significantly delayed following DRN compared with UN (45 min later; <italic>p</italic> = 0.26), Cmax did not differ significantly. GLP-1 rose significantly during the last 90 min of the 3-h MTT (β<sub>1</sub> = 0.16 pg/mL/min, <italic>p</italic> = 0.025), while following UN it decreased (β<sub>1</sub> = −0.21 pg/mL/min, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0026) (<italic>p</italic> difference = 0.0003). There were minimal differences in seven measures of appetite and adverse symptoms between DRN and UN.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">We conclude that nutrient can be formulated using all-natural ingredients to induce a delayed rise in GLP-1. Further testing is needed to determine the amount and site of nutrient release, when maximum GLP-1 levels occur, and if modification of the formulation specifications and dose are associated with appetite and glucose control.</p>

              <p id="Par5">Increased distal nutrient delivery is now considered to initiate multiple gut-based neurohormonal pathways, including intestinal L-cell activation, that mediate the metabolic benefit of gastric bypass surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This proposed key proximal mechanism is corroborated by numerous studies demonstrating that delivery of nutrient directly to the intestine via enteral feeding tube can acutely and significantly increase GLP-1 as well as other appetite-suppressing gut hormone levels, and increase satiety while reducing net caloric intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We hypothesized that a formulation designed to release nutrient rapidly in the small intestine would simulate the appearance of nutrient in the small intestine, which occurs after gastric bypass surgery, and with nutrient administration by post-pyloric enteral feeding tube, and thereby increase GLP-1 release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. We propose that such a nutrient formulation could be ingested before, or even in place of, a regular meal to reduce appetite and caloric intake and improve glucose control.</p>
              <p id="Par7">As pharmaceutical materials used for delayed-release coatings of drugs and dietary supplements have limits on the amount that can be safely ingested, we investigated using natural polymeric carbohydrate coating materials. These coatings have the added benefit of meeting consumer preference for non-pharmaceutical therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Currently, there are few reports of all-natural formulated nutrients for appetite and glucose control, and no commercially available products with demonstrated clinical efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par8">The aim of this pilot clinical trial was to evaluate in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, the effects of ingestion of a single dose of a novel delayed-release nutrient formulation on circulating levels of GLP-1 and appetite compared with ingestion of the same amount of unformulated nutrient. We also evaluated the effects of this intervention on adverse symptoms and on levels of C-peptide, insulin, and glucose.</p>

                <title>Rationale for delayed-release nutrient specifications</title>
                <p id="Par9">The specifications for the delayed-release nutrient formulation were derived from multiple enteral feeding tube studies demonstrating that satiety and appetite regulating hormones are increased and total caloric intake is decreased through a variety of macronutrients delivered at different rates and sites in the small intestine, as summarized in a recent review by Alleleyn et al. (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The primary outcomes were maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of total GLP-1. Secondary outcomes were Cmax and AUC levels of C-peptide, insulin, glucose, and the satiety and adverse effect scores on MTTs. Cmax is the average of each subject’s maximum level of GLP-1 following DRN and UN. Cmin and Tmin were reported for hunger and desire, since they decreased from baseline. In order to determine sample size we used data from two sources to derive mean changes in GLP-1 and the SD of the paired difference: (1) data from our group evaluating paired comparisons of three-hour enteral versus oral mixed meal tolerance tests in obese adults with type 2 diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and (2) data comparing pre-post gastric bypass in non-diabetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These data yielded a projected effect size of 0.68 (mean GLP-1 paired difference, divided by SD of difference); a sample of 20 participants was required to detect this effect with 80% power and testing at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. The data were captured in a custom-designed REDCap database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

Exploratory analysis of slopes was performed by fitting linear regression models for the first and last 90-min periods for each subject. The resulting slopes were compared using random effects mixed models with interaction between period and time to compare paired differences between the first and the last 90 min within each treatment and between DRN and UN within each 90-min segment.

              <p id="Par33">Our overall aim is to formulate a nutrient that induces appetite and glucose control of therapeutic value via activation of a variety of neurohormonal intestinal pathways, including increased release of GLP-1 due to rapid release of nutrient in the upper small intestine. The formulation we developed met our particle size and in vitro pH and temporal release specifications. However, the effects on appetite and gut hormones were not similar to those seen following enteral feeding tube studies for uncertain reasons. There was, however, a delayed rise in GLP-1 with formulated nutrient, with levels still rising at the end of the 3-h study window.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Studies using an enteral feed tube to administer different doses of nutrient to the intestine support our strategy of using delayed-release nutrient to induce appetite and glucose control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. We previously demonstrated that 250 kcals of mixed nutrient delivered directly to the upper small intestine by feeding tube rapidly induces a rise in GLP-1 and satiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To administer a similar amount of nutrient in an orally ingested formulated version without concern for toxicity we used a GRAS coating. By contrast Ma et al. administered two doses of lauric acid with a far lower caloric load (22.5 kcal) coated in methacrylic acid—methyl methacrylate copolymer, a non-GRAS coating (Eudragit L100; Evonik Industries AG, Darmstadt, Germany) at two sequential meals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The authors demonstrated that GLP-1 was higher and glucose lower after the second dose of coated nutrient compared with placebo. Effects on appetite were not reported. The dose of coating material used by Ma et al. was at the upper approved limit for daily intake, which could limit long-term use.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In the recent publication by Alleleyn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, all-natural particles of similar size and nutrient composition to those used in the current study but with a modified whey coating were formulated with the goal of increasing nutrient delivery to the distal ileum in order to activate the ileal brake. A small but significant increase in satiety and decrease in hunger was seen by 15 min after ingestion compared with a control nutrient and similarly there was a there was a small reduction in caloric intake of a subsequent ad libitum meal.</p>
              <p id="Par36">In the current study, unformulated nutrient showed the expected significant rise in glucose and hormones over the first hour and then fall to baseline by the end of the 3-h study. By contrast, maximal levels following the delayed-release nutrient occurred later, and were lower, except for GLP-1, which continued to rise at 3 h. Furthermore, measures of hormones, with delayed-release nutrient for glucose and appetite were lower than those seen following delivery of a similar caloric load to the upper intestine by enteral feeding tube and gastric bypass <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Given that we did not directly measure when, where, and how much nutrient was released we do not know why appetite and hormonal changes differed from those hypothesized based on in vitro testing. We propose several possible reasons for our findings.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Firstly, the 3-h meal tolerance test might have been too short to allow for maximum nutrient release and effect on GLP-1, appetite, and other outcome measures. The GRAS nutrient formulation used in the clinical study had in vitro dissolution characteristics suggesting that the majority of the nutrient load would be released in vivo in the small intestine within 3 h of ingestion. However, non-sucrose nutrient release from the particles may not have occurred at the rate observed in the in vitro dissolution testing, which measured only sucrose release. Morphological changes may have occurred in the formulated nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract that altered the coating, or core nutrient release. For example, swelling of ethyl cellulose may have prevented pH-dependent alginate pore formation and nutrient release.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Secondly, gastric emptying may have been slower than expected. We hypothesized that the 2-mm particles would pass through the stomach at the rate of plain water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The particles may, however, have sedimented in the stomach of the semi-recumbent subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It is also possible that as nutrient, gastric acid, and quinine from the tonic water were released into the intestine, they slowed gastric emptying delaying intestinal delivery of the full caloric load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This slowing of nutrient delivery is not present when nutrient is administered by enteral feeding tube or following gastric bypass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Some formulated nutrient may have passed through unabsorbed to the large intestine. In this case symptoms such as bloating, or diarrhea may have occurred. However, no such symptoms were reported by the subjects.</p>
              <p id="Par41">A limitation of this study is that the site, length, and rate of nutrient exposure, that determine hormonal and appetite effect of nutrient, were not assessed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In vitro gastrointestinal simulation testing is not readily available, is poorly standardized, and correlation with human testing weak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. All methods have several drawbacks including radiation exposure, limited temporal resolution, and failure to distinguish between various gastrointestinal segments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Labeling the active ingredient with drugs or radioisotopes is not permitted at food (GMP) manufacturing facilities. We did not add coating markers of gut transit and absorption after production as there was no evidence that the marker would transit the intestine with the nutrient particles. Lactulose as used in hydrogen breath testing may accelerate small bowel transit. Furthermore, marker coatings might alter nutrient release from the particles and could also be hazardous to the research team and subjects. Iterative in vitro formulation modification and in vivo testing was considered to be the most pragmatic developmental strategy. An ad libitum meal is a feasible means of assessing any effect on total caloric intake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The tonic water used to ingest the nutrients contains quinine may have altered gut hormone release and appetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, as the same solution was used with both meals differences between the groups are unlikely to be due to the quinine.</p>
              <p id="Par43">We assume that several macronutrients stimulated GLP-1 release, and that both nutrient and GLP-1 stimulated c-peptide release. This might explain why peak insulinemia with UN corresponds to a blood glucose peak rather than follows it as might be expected following glucose administration. While GLP-1 levels rise late in the study following DRN administration this is not associated with a rise in insulin. This may be because threshold levels of GLP-1, nutrient and glycemia needed to stimulate insulin release were not achieved.</p>
              <p id="Par44">With respect to limitations of the statistical analysis, the large number of statistical comparisons could be considered a limitation in interpretation of results. However, where there was a significant difference between modes, the <italic>p</italic>-values tended to be very small, so testing at a smaller significance level, e.g., <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 or even 0.005 would only affect three results: Glucose AUC, GLP-1 Tmax, and GLP-1 final-initial would no longer be significant.</p>
              <p id="Par45">This work provides additional information regarding the use of formulated nutrient for appetite and glucose control. The formulation we evaluated was comprised of ingredients that are widely consumed. The dietary fiber coating may provide health benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The findings of this study may be generalizable to other obese adults with type 2 diabetes. It is possible that the study subjects who had type 2 diabetes could have had altered gastrointestinal motility that could have affected findings and that would not be expected to be present in obese adults without diabetes.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Numerous areas in the field of targeted enteral nutrient require further study. Testing this formulation for a longer period and with multiple doses in ambulatory subjects would provide a more complete picture of the GLP-1 profile and effects on appetite. The formulation may be modified to provide a higher caloric load and different nutrient cores and coatings. Future studies will adjust the experimental design to focus on outcome measures for either appetite and caloric intake, or glycemic control, rather than both.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par47">This study explores the use of formulated nutrient to control appetite and dysglycemia. It adds to the limited published research by presenting data on the use of a novel delayed-release natural coating to deliver nutrient directly to the intestine in obese adults with type 2 diabetes. Findings demonstrate that GLP-1 release can be delayed with this strategy, but further work is needed to develop an optimal formulation that achieves the desired effects on gut hormones and appetite. We have identified several areas for further research including options for modifying the nutrient formula, and the development of more widely available and feasible methods of assessing gastrointestinal transit and nutrient absorption in humans.</p>
