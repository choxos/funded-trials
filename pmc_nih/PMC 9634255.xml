              <abstract>
                <p>Coronavac is a widely used SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine, but its long-term immune response assessment is still lacking. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses, including T cell activation markers, antigen-specific cytokine production and antibody response following vaccination in 53 adult and elderly individuals participating in a phase 3 clinical trial. Activated follicular helper T (Tfh), non-Tfh and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in almost all subjects early after the first vaccine dose. Activated memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were predominantly of central and effector memory T cell phenotypes and were sustained for at least 6 months. We also detected a balanced Th1-, Th2- and Th17/Th22-type cytokine production that was associated with response over time, together with particular cytokine profile linked to poor responses in older vaccinees. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels peaked 14 days after the second dose and were mostly stable over one year. CoronaVac was able to induce a potent and durable antiviral antigen-specific cellular response and the cytokine profiles related to the response over time and impacted by the senescence were defined.</p>

              <p>Protective and long-lasting immune responses induced by viral infections and vaccines are usually formed by a combination of humoral and cellular immunity. The presence of both SARS-CoV-2-specific cells and circulating antibodies after infection or vaccination are the most likely candidates to serve as correlates of protection against COVID-19 and disease severity. High frequency of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients who recovered from COVID-19, as well as the presence of memory T cells in the convalescent phase have been extensively described in the literature and are suggested to play a key role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 initial infection, protecting from re-infection and disease progression (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>CoronaVac, a whole SARS-CoV-2-inactivated vaccine administered to over 2 billion people (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), has an excellent safety profile and is effective against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and is highly protective against moderate and severe COVID-19 in clinical trials performed in Brazil (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and other countries (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Previous studies showed that two doses can elicit neutralizing antibodies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and described short-term cellular responses following vaccination (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The PROFISCOV phase 3 clinical trial of CoronaVac vaccine in Brazil started on July 21, 2020 and enrolled 12,396 highly-exposed healthcare professionals who received the two-dose vaccine or placebo (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A sub-cohort of adult and elderly individuals was selected for a prospective study to describe the vaccine-induced cellular and humoral immune responses in the peripheral blood, including the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses, T cell-related cytokine and chemokine profiles, and plasma binding antibody levels up to one year after vaccination.</p>

                <title>PROFISCOV phase 3 clinical trial</title>
                <p>To assess the safety and efficacy of the CoronaVac vaccine in Brazil, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 multicenter clinical trial was performed in healthy healthcare professionals on the frontline of COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was approved by the Brazilian National Research Ethics Council (CONEP), CAAE 34634620.1.1001.0068, the Brazilian National Regulatory Agency (ANVISA), CE 47/2020, and was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov platform (NCT04456595). The full protocol of the clinical trial has been published previously by Palacios et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). All participants provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>CoronaVac (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China) is an inactivated vaccine derived from the CN02 strain of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero cells. Production methods and its full composition has been published by Gao et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The placebo group received aluminum hydroxide adjuvant with no virus. Vaccine and placebo were provided in a ready-to-use syringe and administered intramuscularly following the two-dose schedule of 0 and 14 days (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
                <p>12,396 initial participants were recruited in the Brazilian phase 3 clinical trial, with ages ranging from 18 to over 60. From those, 653 were included in the São Paulo site. The first 120 had blood collection and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation for a long-term follow-up and long-term assessment of their cellular and humoral responses.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p>After the breaking of the participants’ blinding code, the 120 first individuals (60 vaccinees and 60 placebos) were filtered based on vaccination status, age and specimen availability to compose the cohort used to assess cellular and humoral response after immunization with CoronaVac. The final cohort was primarily composed of 29 vaccinees and 4 placebos ranging from 18 to 59 years, and 24 vaccinees and 4 placebos with ages over 60 years (with a total of 53 vaccinees). Seven vaccinated volunteers were excluded from further analysis due to lack of follow-up or positive COVID-19 diagnosis right after the first vaccine dose. Placebos were only evaluated before vaccination and there were no infections reported in this group at this time point.</p>
                <p>Blood samples were collected before vaccination (0d), 14 days after the first dose (14d, collected just before the second dose) and in several other time points counted as days after the first vaccine dose (30d, 60d, 90d, 120d, 180d, 360d).</p>
                <p>In order to quantify the response magnitude achieved after vaccination, 17 SARS-CoV-2 infected, age-paired individuals were selected as positive controls (eight non-vaccinated, hospitalized patients due to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and nine non-vaccinated individuals with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization). Blood samples from these hospitalized patients were part of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody investigation research project approved by CONEP, CAAE 34634620.1.1001.0068, and the non-hospitalized patients were infected placebos from the CoronaVac clinical trial. Non-hospitalized patients were only included in some assays due to the lack of PBMC samples. The demographics data of the included individuals are described in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. In each figure representing results the number of analyzed individuals and the respective time points are described in the legends.</p>

                <p>Evaluation of cellular parameters through activation-induced markers (AIM) assay included assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses using virus-specific peptide megapools (MP) developed by Grifoni and colleagues (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), designed to overlap the Wuhan/WH04/2020 SARS-CoV-2 ORFeome. To surpass sensitivity limitations of cytokine-based assays, the AIM assay of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was performed, which defines antigen specificity based on positive regulation of surface markers induced by T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, instead of cytokine production. For this purpose, PBMCs from vaccinees and placebos were stimulated with MPs comprehending different portions of SARS-CoV-2, in order to quantify and determine the subsets of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated after the vaccine.</p>
                <p>PBMCs were thawed at 37°C and diluted in RPMI 1640 media (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) supplemented with 5% human serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, MA, USA), 1 mM penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, MA, USA), 10 mM HEPES solution (Gibco, MA, USA), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, MA, USA) and 55 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, MA, USA) (hereafter referred as HR5). Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min, resuspended in HR5 containing 50 U/mL benzonase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 to remove DNA/RNA aggregates. After incubation, cells were counted, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min and seeded at a density of 1,5x10<sup>6</sup> cells per well, in U-bottom 96-well plates.</p>
                <p>Cells were incubated with 0,5 μg/mL anti-CD40 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, NRW, Germany) for 15 min at 37°C and 5% CO2 and then stimulated for 24h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the presence of specific MPs (1 μg/mL), phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) (10 μL/mL) as a positive control or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) (0,1%) as a negative control, all diluted in HR5. MPs were developed and kindly donated by Dr. Alessandro Sette’s laboratory (Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research; La Jolla Institute for Immunology, USA) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and comprehend SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes specified as CD4-R (remaining non-Spike protein), CD4-S (Spike protein) and CD8-A and CD8-B (viral epitopes compatible with HLA-A and HLA-B, respectively).</p>
                <p>After a 24-hours MPs incubation, plates were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 2 min and the supernatant was collected in a new plate and kept at -80°C freezer for further analysis. Cell pellets were resuspended, transferred to V-bottom 96-well plates and washed with MACS buffer (5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline 1X (PBS, LGC Biotecnologia, SP, Brazil)) twice, then stained with specific antibodies mix containing characterization and activation markers (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Table S1</bold></xref>) for 20 min, at 4°C in the dark (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).

                <p>The quality control from samples acquired in the flow cytometer was performed by the analysis of the Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) and compensation adjustments through beads. Acquisition was performed with the BD FACSDiva™ Software v6.0 and FlowJo™ v10.8 was used for data analysis (both from BD Biosciences, CA, USA). T cell response values after viral peptide stimulus were obtained from the subtraction of the peptide-stimulated conditions from the DMSO condition. To generate data of total CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, separate responses for CD4-R and CD4-S and a sum of both were performed, as well for CD8-A and CD8-B.</p>

                <p>To assess the cellular and humoral responses after immunization with CoronaVac, the initial consecutive 120 volunteers enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04456595) were selected based on vaccination status, age and specimen availability. The final cohort was primarily composed of 29 vaccinees and 4 placebos ranging from 18 to 59 years, and 24 vaccinees and 4 placebos over 60 years old (totalizing 53 vaccinees and 8 placebos). Seven vaccinated volunteers were excluded from further analysis due to lack of follow-up or positive COVID-19 diagnosis right after the first vaccine dose. Plasma and PBMC samples were obtained before vaccination (0d), 14 days after the first dose (14d, collected just before the second dose) and at other time points after the first vaccine dose (30d, 60d, 90d, 120d, 180d, 360d). Placebos were only evaluated before vaccination and there were no infections reported in this group during the follow-up.</p>
                <p>In order to quantify the response magnitude achieved after vaccination, 17 SARS-CoV-2 infected, age-paired individuals were selected as positive controls (eight hospitalized patients due to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and nine outpatients with mild disease). Blood samples from the hospitalized patients are part of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody investigation research project approved by local and national institutional review board (CAAE 34634620.1.1001.0068). The blood specimens from non-hospitalized patients were obtained from SARS-CoV-2 infected placebos enrolled in CoronaVac clinical trial and were collected after infection. Non-hospitalized patients were only included in the assessment of humoral response due to the lack of PBMC samples.

                <title>CoronaVac shifts cytokine and chemokine pattern throughout time</title>
                <p>Next, 35 cytokines and chemokines released in cell culture supernatant in response to Spike and non-Spike CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells designed MPs were measured to characterize its profiles at early and later post-vaccination time points, stratified by the vaccine recipient’s age. To analyze the relation between age, time after vaccination and immune response, a pairwise Spearman rank correlation test was performed between all parameters, with unsupervised clustering (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S1</bold></xref>.) and separated by time post-vaccination and age (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S2</bold></xref>). The cytokine pattern changed throughout time; a greater range of cytokines and chemokines were cross-correlated by their upturn in expression after the second dose, which was maintained until the last time point (90 to 180 days) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S2</bold></xref>). Older vaccinees took longer to form a positive correlated cytokine and chemokine response, while adults had an escalation response after only one vaccine dose. Elderly individuals needed at least two doses, even though, by day 180, the response profiles were similar between both age stratified groups.</p>
                <p>Data from the cytokine and chemokine measurements were summarized in a correlation plot crossing age and visit (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). Interestingly, 7 out of 35 cytokines (TNF-β, IL-5, IP-10, TARC, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-22) were positively correlated with time lapsed post-vaccination (Fig 4B-H). From those, all except IL-22 and TARC were in the same cluster, and IL-2 and TNF-β had the strongest correlations coefficients (r = 0.3815 and r = 0.3500, respectively) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 4B, G</bold></xref>). IL-22 and TARC were further away from the other cytokines because they had a lower statistically significant p-value (r = 0.2148, p = 0.0020 and r = 0.1549, p = 0.0270, respectively) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 4E, H</bold></xref>). Four out of the 35 cytokines (IL-7, TNF-β, MCP-4 and IFN-γ) were negatively correlated with age (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 4I–N</bold></xref>); VEGF-A was the only one with a significant positive correlation with age (r = 0.2005, p = 0.0040) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4K</bold></xref>). We also plotted the IL-2 correlation due to its interestingly strongest positive correlation with time point, which is seen to be the opposite when correlated with age (r = -0.1625, p = 0.0202) (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4N</bold></xref>).</p>

                <p>Although cytokines and chemokines secreted in supernatants from activated cells in response to Spike and non-Spike MPs stimulation cannot be directly associated with specific cell populations, they may indicate functionality and polarization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific cell response (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S3</bold></xref>). Adult vaccinees showed a consistent presence of IL-2, IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF, indicative of a Th1 profile, as well as a more established expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Modest Th17-polarized response was also detected, with a distinctive IL-17 and IL-27 positively correlation with specific T cell subtypes, whereas IL-22 is consistently and positively correlated with all T cell populations analyzed.</p>
                <p>When stratifying by age group and throughout time there is a shift between cytokine expression and T cell population. The elderly vaccinees presented the same patterns but with modest correlation. Interestingly, VEGF-A, an angiogenic factor, changed from a negative correlation to a non-correlation status after the first dose in adults, yet had a strong negative correlation at the same time point in elderly vaccinees. Older individuals also achieved a positive correlation between IL-21 and Tfh cells after 180 days from the first dose, shifting from a strong negative correlation at baseline. Additionally, after 6 months of the two CoronaVac doses, adults continue to have SARS-CoV-2 specific memory and activated effector T cells, whilst elderly vaccinees have a diminished expression of Tfh CD40L<sup>+</sup> cells, agreeing to what is seen in the literature (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

                <p>As long-lasting SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells were detected in the AIM assay, the next goal was to assess the levels of circulating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins in adult and elderly vaccinees, up to one year after the first vaccine dose. Analysis of both groups taken together showed a significant increase in the anti-Wuhan/WH04/2020-SARS-CoV-2 (wt-SARS-CoV-2) IgG titers 14 days after the first vaccine shot for Spike and RBD proteins but not for the N antigen. Two weeks after the two-dose vaccination scheme (i.e., 28 days after first vaccine dose) IgG levels against wt-SARS-CoV-2 N, Spike and RBD proteins were significantly higher compared to baseline levels (p &lt;0.0001, <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 5A–C</bold></xref>). Through one year follow-up SARS-CoV-2 N-specific IgG titers were relatively stable from 28 to 90 days after first vaccine shot, going gradually down in the next 6 months until one year after vaccination (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>). Wuhan/WH04/2020-SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-specific IgG titers peaked from 28 to 42 days at similar levels found in non-hospitalized infected individuals (46 days median after symptoms onset, IQR 34-65) (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 5B, C</bold></xref>). Between 90 and 270 days S- and RBD-specific IgG levels showed a slight decay, reaching stability point from 270 to 365 days after first vaccine dose at significantly higher levels compared to baseline (p &lt;0.0001) and the placebo group (p &lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 5B, C</bold></xref>). The same IgG response profile was found when analyzing antibodies against S and RBD proteins of Alpha, Beta and Gamma VOCs (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 5E–G</bold></xref>). IgG response peaked at 28 days after first vaccine dose, and even though it subsequently presented a slight decrease, antibody levels remained significantly higher after one year of vaccination compared to baseline (median value &gt;10<sup>2</sup> AU/mL, and p &lt;0,0001 for all strains, <xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>Figure S4</bold></xref>). It should be noted that the method used to calculate anti-Spike, anti-RBD and anti-N IgG titers against Wuhan/WH04/2020 and VOCs is based on an unique standard curve for each variant peptide target, and they cannot be directly compared.

              <p>COVID-19 vaccines that elicit protective immune responses are essential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and mitigate the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune response to CoronaVac by measuring the T cell activation kinetics after re-stimulation with wt SARS-CoV-2 peptides, the cytokine and chemokine profile of the T cell culture supernatant and the IgG-specific levels against the Wuhan/WH04/2020 strain and VOCs antigens. The results add understanding on how this vaccine builds and maintains the immune response against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
              <p>Multiple lines of evidence support the critical roles of T cells in mounting immune responses to COVID-19. It is well-known that T cells can engage several antigen epitopes providing a broader protection against the virus (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, which have been recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells of exposed donors (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), allowed the detection of specific T cell responses even in individuals without detectable antibody responses, thereby providing evidence for T cell immunity upon vaccination. In line with previously published data showing stronger SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response compared to CD8<sup>+</sup> response in individuals recovering from COVID-19 infection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and after mRNA vaccination (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), a significant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response triggered by Spike and non-Spike SARS-CoV-2 peptides was detected in peripheral blood cells of a subset of adults and elderly subjects vaccinated with CoronaVac. The data shown here indicates that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell may target different SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and suggest that the presence of additional SARS-CoV-2 antigens, such as M and N, in future vaccine formulations would enable it to better mimic the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response seen in naturally infected patients.</p>
              <p>Although a modest enhancement of activated (CD69<sup>+</sup> CD137<sup>+</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was seen following vaccination, no significant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were detected in our study, corroborating with recent findings of Coronavac vaccinees in Chile by Bueno et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It does not directly support other studies assessing cellular response induced by other COVID-19 vaccines (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), however the frequencies of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were still found to be relatively low (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Of note, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are undetectable in approximately 30% of convalescent COVID-19 cases, even when testing the full SARS-CoV-2 ORFeome of epitopes (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nevertheless, it is not possible to assert that those cases have no important CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 infection, since they might have CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses triggered by untested epitopes. Alternatively, it has been also speculated that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are undetectable in the peripheral blood as they are mostly antigen-specific tissue-resident memory T cells, residing in the lung or upper respiratory tract tissues (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>A panel of relevant cytokines and chemokines was also measured in cell supernatant after SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation to better characterize the immune response induced by the vaccine. Although it is not possible to ensure that the molecules were produced by specific T cells, they may be indicative of the functionality and polarization of the vaccine-induced response. Besides IFN-γ and IL-2, various other cytokines were also positively correlated with time post-vaccination and specific effector T cell populations, leading us to assume that the two-dose CoronaVac regimen is able to stimulate a balanced response between Th1 (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF, IP-10), Th2 (IL-5, IL-10, TARC) and Th17/Th22 (IL-22) responses, complementing the activated specific cellular response of Tfh, non-Tfh and memory cells, which is, likewise, positively correlated with time post-vaccination, as also seen after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Particularly, IFN-γ and IL-2 production, mostly known to characterize a Th1 profile, were associated with a better outcome for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and their increase was seen after the two-dose regimen of several approved COVID-19 vaccines (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Although IP-10 has been associated with impaired cell response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, this association usually comes with other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), which had no significant correlation with time post-vaccination in our cohort.</p>
              <p>Considering the age difference between groups, a less intense immune response was seen amid the two groups, and known inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-α/β, MIP-β and IFN-γ were negatively correlated with increasing age, possibly related to immune senescence, but not with a chronic exacerbated inflammatory state often seen in elderly individuals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In fact, older individuals mounted a similar response after receiving the two CoronaVac doses, only with a few weeks of delay when compared with younger adults. The only cytokine positively correlated with age was the angiogenesis factor VEGF-A, but its age-related increase is not always related to a non-healthy state (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), as some studies hypothesize that it could be also beneficial to the process of aging (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Regarding the cellular response, a significant percentage of the circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells detected after two doses of CoronaVac exhibited a Tfh phenotype, similar to those observed following mRNA vaccination (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and infection (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Tfh cells are CD4+ lymphocytes specialized in regulating the adaptive immune response in germinal centers by enabling the selection of specific high affinity B cells and modulating affinity maturation in infection and vaccination (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Therefore, Tfh cells are crucial for establishing durable humoral immunity, by helping structuring antibodies generation. Mudd and colleagues (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) demonstrated a significant correlation between the size of the germinal center B cell population in lymph nodes and the total Tfh cell population frequency following mRNA vaccination. Using a Spike immunodominant epitope, the authors showed an increase of specific Tfh in the blood of vaccinated individuals, peaking 28 days after the first dose. Interestingly, in our study we observed that not only circulating Tfh cells, but also the antibodies titers against Wuhan/WH04/2020-SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD antigens peaked between 28 and 42 days after CoronaVac first dose. Despite this, significant levels of IL-21, a cytokine involved in Tfh differentiation (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) were not detected in cell supernatant at these timepoints. One explanation for this may be that the cell supernatant was collected 24h after stimulation, and there is the possibility that the peak concentration of IL-21 was missed. Nevertheless, a positive correlation between IL-21 concentration and Tfh cells was seen in the elderly group, going from a negative correlation at baseline to a positive correlation with SARS-CoV-2-specific Tfh cells (including the Tfh cells expressing CD40L) 180 days post-vaccination. As this cytokine is known to differentiate Tfh cells (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), this could be an indication that this population is being recruited to stimulate B cells and generate antibody response.</p>
              <p>As circulating antibodies levels against Wuhan/WH04/2020 and VOCs strains reached its highest on day 28 after first dose, we showed that bAbs against Wuhan/WH04/2020 Spike and RBD proteins had at least one year durability, a profile also seen post-infection, but not with such longevity (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and had also a similar median range as identified in our non-hospitalized cohort with 46 days post-symptoms onset. Although antibodies against the N protein showed a relevant decrease after 6 months, not seen in infected individuals (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), about half of the individuals remained above the median levels until 1 year after first vaccine dose. To our knowledge this is the first study to provide such a long-lasting bAbs response for vaccinated individuals. A similar kinetics was observed for the bAbs against all Spike and RBD VOCs (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) proteins levels when its decreasing stopped at 9 months and remained stable still above the basal IgG level throughout 1 year after first dose, different from the diminishing tendency seen in another study for the IgG levels against Beta, Gamma and Delta Spike targets in non-hospitalized individuals after 4 months of COVID-19 diagnose (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>Stratifying the age groups, we noticed that elderly vaccinees delayed to reach significant bAbs levels for wt and VOCs, kept at lower levels compared to those seen in younger adults and dropped at earlier time points, possibly being associated with the diminished frequency and response of naive circulating B and T cells in elderly individuals (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), and in accordance with previous studies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p>
              <p>In addition to help B cell and antibody responses, eliciting broad and long-lasting antiviral immunity requires the enrollment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the generation of effective T cell memory (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) essential for protection against future infections. SARS-CoV-2 memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in almost all subjects after receiving the two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, as well as seen in a cohort of mostly non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In contrast to the memory subset proportion (TCM followed by TEM subset along the 6 months) seen here after CoronaVac vaccination and also after mRNA vaccination (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), COVID-19 infected individuals showed an inverse proportion, being TEM the most frequent for 6 months, out passed by the TCM subset after this timeframe (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These data suggest that vaccination with CoronaVac elicits an early sustained memory immunity compared to infection, since TEM cells are associated with a more immediate defense.</p>
              <p>This study has some limitations including the relatively small sample size that was restrained by IRB and resource restrictions for additional blood volume drawn at the time of the study concept. Despite the small number of participants, we were able to consistently assess the immune response in post-vaccination timepoints with very few samples missing in later follow-up visits due to COVID-19 diagnosis or limited cell availability. This work was produced with a cohort that was not exposed to Delta and Omicron variants at the time of vaccination and the period following it (2020 – 2021), so it was not possible to evaluate the CoronaVac immune response against these VOCs, which now have outnumbered most cases worldwide. These limitations should be addressed in future studies, with large cohorts.</p>
              <p>In summary, the results shown herein provide evidence that CoronaVac is capable to induce a long-term antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response, to induce an effector cytokines pattern with reduced inflammation in older people and lead to high-titer antibody responses against Wuhan/WH04/2020 SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs strains in adults and elderly individuals and also highlight the importance of the two-dose regimen to establish a robust cellular and humoral response.</p>
