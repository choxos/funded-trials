                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="P3">Pretreatment identification of pathological extranodal extension (ENE) would guide therapy de-escalation strategies for in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma but is diagnostically challenging. ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group E3311 was a multicentre trial wherein patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated surgically and assigned to a pathological risk-based adjuvant strategy of observation, radiation, or concurrent chemoradiation. Despite protocol exclusion of patients with overt radiographic ENE, more than 30% had pathological ENE and required postoperative chemoradiation. We aimed to evaluate a CT-based deep learning algorithm for prediction of ENE in E3311, a diagnostically challenging cohort wherein algorithm use would be impactful in guiding decision-making.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P4">For this retrospective evaluation of deep learning algorithm performance, we obtained pretreatment CTs and corresponding surgical pathology reports from the multicentre, randomised de-escalation trial E3311. All enrolled patients on E3311 required pretreatment and diagnostic head and neck imaging; patients with radiographically overt ENE were excluded per study protocol. The lymph node with largest short-axis diameter and up to two additional nodes were segmented on each scan and annotated for ENE per pathology reports. Deep learning algorithm performance for ENE prediction was compared with four board-certified head and neck radiologists. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p id="P5">From 178 collected scans, 313 nodes were annotated: 71 (23%) with ENE in general, 39 (13%) with ENE larger than 1 mm ENE. The deep learning algorithm AUC for ENE classification was 0Â·86 (95% CI 0Â·82â€“0Â·90), outperforming all readers (p&lt;0Â·0001 for each). Among radiologists, there was high variability in specificity (43â€“86%) and sensitivity (45â€“96%) with poor inter-reader agreement (Îº 0Â·32). Matching the algorithm specificity to that of the reader with highest AUC (R2, false positive rate 22%) yielded improved sensitivity to 75% (+ 13%). Setting the algorithm false positive rate to 30% yielded 90% sensitivity. The algorithm showed improved performance compared with radiologists for ENE larger than 1 mm (p&lt;0Â·0001) and in nodes with short-axis diameter 1 cm or larger.</p>

Protocol details have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Patients in the intermediate pathological risk group were randomly assigned to de-escalated versus standard dose post-operative radiotherapy (at 50 Gy or 60 Gy), which was the experimental focus of the trial. Patients were deemed high-risk, and not eligible for radiation alone, if surgical pathology showed more than four malignant lymph nodes, positive margin, or more than 1 mm of extranodal extension (ENE).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P10">ENE, when malignant cells infiltrate beyond the lymph node into surrounding tissue, is both a poor prognostic factor for oropharyngeal carcinoma and an indication for therapy intensification with postoperative chemoradiation (ie, trimodality therapy),<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which increases toxicity and health-care costs.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> ENE is only definitively diagnosed on pathology, and attempts to identify or predict ENE via human interpretation of pretreatment imaging have generally shown poor results.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>â€“<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Accordingly, there are high rates of incidental ENE following surgery for oropharyngeal carcinoma.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> For example, although the E3311 protocol specifically excluded patients with radiographically overt ENE, 31% of patients were allocated to the high-risk, trimodality arm, with 77% of these due to an ENE greater than 1 mm.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Additionally, patients receiving trimodality therapy had poorer toxicity and quality of life outcomes. Therefore, tools are needed to better predict ENE in the pretreatment setting to help select the ideal treatment de-escalation or intensification trials for patients and avoid unnecessary trimodality therapy.</p>

E3311 was held in the USA across 58 participating medical centres. All surgical specimens underwent centralised pathology review and ENE extent in millimeters was recorded. We retrospectively included all intent-to-treat E3311 patients with readily available pretreatment, diagnostic quality CT with intravenous contrast enhancement, and corresponding lymph node dissection pathology report with annotated ENE status and extent of ENE in millimeters. E3311 allowed pretreatment CT or MRI, and those without iodinated, intravenous contrast-enhanced CT were excluded.

DualNet is a visual geometry group-inspired architecture that receives and merges two 3D representations of lymph node regions of interest: one that retains original volume information, and one that is rescaled to be size invariant. Algorithm architecture and hyperparameters were all identical to those implemented in previous work.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Before doing the present validation study, several modifications to image acquisition and preprocessing workflows were made a priori (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> pp 2â€“3). Given the fundamental knowledge that increasing training data improves neural network performance, we retrained our initial model for this study, which was developed from a single institution,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> with two additional datasets that had been previously used as external validators.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Therefore, a total of three data sources were made use of for model training and tuning (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 6).

No readers were involved in the development of the algorithm. Each reader independently reviewed all study CT scans, one at a time, via the open-source software, 3D Slicer (version 4). The CT scan was viewable in the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes, with overlaid lymph node segmentations, which could be hidden at the readerâ€™s discretion. Reviews were done in isolation and readers were masked to the segmentation labels.

The primary endpoint of the study was the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic for ENE prediction, which measures discriminatory performance and reflects a combination of sensitivity and specificity. From previous work,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> we anticipated a minimum of 155 lymph nodes would be needed to detect a type I error of 5% with 80% power for the expected AUC improvement of 0Â·85 (+ 15%) over the expected benchmark of 0Â·70 for expert controls (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 13). 95% CIs were calculated, and algorithm AUC was compared with that of each reader via the Delong method,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> with a p value of less than 0Â·05 indicating statistical significance. For primary analyses, reader Likert scores were dichotomised (1â€“2 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> 3â€“4) to mimic a real-world decision to indicate negative or positive ENE prediction. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity (1 â€“ false negative rate), specificity (1 â€“ false positive rate), positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and raw accuracy. Deep learning algorithm secondary endpoints were calculated using four probability thresholds: a threshold that optimised Youden index (sensitivity + specificity â€“ 1) on internal validation and thresholds that yielded false positive rates at clinically meaningful values: 10%, 20%, and 30%. Performance metrics were evaluated for ENE overall and ENE more than 1 mm and in the subgroup of lymph nodes with short-axis diameter of 10 mm or more, which we believe would be the most relevant for real-world use as this threshold is used clinically to denote lymph nodes at risk of metastasis. Calibration was assessed via reliability diagrams and expected calibration error.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Post-hoc calibration using temperature scaling<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> was then done on the internal validation set to improve uncertainty estimation without affecting discriminatory performance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 4).</p>

A custom script was created to mimic potential human variations in node segmentation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 5) and AUC, range, and standard deviation were also analysed. Additionally, scanner noise on the order of around 5 Hounsfield units (HUs) has been recently implicated as adversarial images that could mislead neural networks,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> so we did sensitivity analyses by injecting random Gaussian noise to images at test time.

              <p id="P19">Of 360 eligible and treated patients in E3311, we obtained complete data meeting our inclusion criteria for 178 (49%; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 24). The remaining patients had either CT or pathology data that could not be retrieved from the participating institution. Included scans were from 46 participating institutions and various scanner models (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 7). From these, 313 lymph-node segmentations were manually generated and annotated for malignancy and ENE. There were 105 (34%) benign lymph nodes, 137 (44%) malignant lymph nodes without ENE, and 71 (23%) malignant lymph nodes with ENE. Of nodes with ENE, 20 (28%) were 1 mm or smaller, 39 (55%) were larger than 1 mm, and 12 (17%) were unspecified per the obtained pathology report. For further analysis, we labelled unspecified ENE as more than 1 mm in size, as these ENE could not be excluded in these cases. We also did sensitivity analyses excluding patients with unspecified ENE. Median short-axis diameter was 7 mm (range 4â€“14) for benign lymph nodes, 20 mm (6â€“37) for malignant lymph nodes without ENE, and 24 mm (12â€“42) for lymph nodes with ENE, and 204 (65%) of the 313 nodes had a short-axis diameter of 10 mm or more (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 9).</p>
              <p id="P20">Deep learning algorithm performance for ENE identification was superior to each of the four readers (algorithm 0Â·857, 95% CI 0Â·82â€“0Â·90; R1 0Â·66, 0Â·60â€“0Â·73; R2 0Â·71, 0Â·64â€“0Â·77; R3 0Â·70, 0Â·66â€“0Â·73; R4 0Â·63, 0Â·56â€“0Â·69; p&lt;(1 Ã— 10<sup>âˆ’5</sup>) for each; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table</xref>). For an ENE of more than 1 mm, the algorithm yielded superior performance compared with the readers (0Â·859, 0Â·82â€“0Â·90; p&lt;0Â·0001 for R1â€“4). For the subgroup of nodes with a short-axis diameter of 10 mm or more (n=204), the algorithm also had improved performance (AUC 0Â·74, 0Â·67â€“0Â·81), compared with readers, with reader performance particularly low in this subgroup (AUC range 0Â·55â€“0Â·62, mean 0Â·58, p&lt;0Â·006, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> pp 15â€“16). Inter-reader agreement for ENE was modest overall (Fleiss-Îº 0Â·32) and low for nodes with a short-axis diameter of 10 mm or more (Fleiss-Îº 0Â·16). Initial algorithm calibration was adequate, with probabilities tending to underestimate the likelihood of ENE.</p>
              <p id="P21">Deep learning algorithm sensitivity at the optimised Youden index threshold was 0Â·89 and specificity was 0Â·72. Sensitivity dropped to 0Â·72 when setting a threshold to allow no more than 20% false positive rate. There was considerable variation between reader sensitivities (range 0Â·45â€“0Â·96) and specificities (0Â·43â€“0Â·86), with the highest performing reader (R2) having a sensitivity of 0Â·63 and specificity of 0Â·78. Except for R3, specificity was higher than sensitivity, and no reader had both sensitivity and specificity greater than 70%. Matching the algorithm specificity to that of the reader with highest AUC (R2, false positive rate 22%) yielded improved sensitivity to 75% (+13%). Positive predictive value was uniformly lower than negative predictive value for all readers and the algorithm, probably owing to the lower prevalence of ENE, and the F1 score was higher for the algorithm than the readers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 14). Following post-hoc calibration with temperature scaling, calibration on the test set improved (expected calibration error 0Â·426 <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> 0Â·246; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>), without an effect on the AUC (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 4).</p>

Studies of adversarial images with Gaussian noise of âˆ’5 HU to 5 HU minimally degraded performance (0Â·853, 0Â·851â€“0Â·854).

Of false negatives, only one (13%) had an ENE of more than 1 mm (3 mm in extent). Of false positives, none had a calibrated probability of more than 85%, and only 12 (18%) had a predicted probability of greater than 70%. Lymph node mean short-axis diameter was higher for false positive predictions compared with the overall lymph node mean short-axis diameter (24 mm <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> 17 mm, p&lt;0Â·001), but lymph node mean short-axis diameter was not sigificantly different between false negative predictions and the overall cohort (21 mm <italic toggle="yes">vs</italic> 17 mm, p=0Â·16). Regarding readers, both false positive predictions and false negative predictions were more likely in larger nodes (p&lt;0Â·001 for each, R1â€“4), with the sole exception being false negative predictions for R3 (p=0Â·97). Scanner parameters, such as pixel spacing, slice thickness, and scanner manufacturer were not significantly associated with the algorithm or reader failure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 19).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P25">This study shows that imaging-based deep learning can improve the identification of ENE, including those larger than 1 mm, for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma in the pretreatment setting and is positioned for use as a screening tool to help treatment decision-making and selecting the optimal de-escalation strategy. Deep learning algorithm performance generalises to a diagnostically challenging set of HPV-associated cases where pretreatment knowledge of ENE would be clinically impactful. Furthermore, the algorithm performs this task with higher discriminatory performance, and particularly improved sensitivity, compared with experienced head and neck radiologists from tertiary comprehensive cancer centres. The improved sensitivity of the algorithm would translate to fewer missed diagnoses of incidental ENE and less subsequent trimodality therapy. In addition to the substantial performance gains compared with experts, the algorithm also has the benefit of producing standardised predictions, an adjustable threshold to fit the end userâ€™s preferences, and calibrated probabilities that align with real-world ENE likelihoods and could enhance clinical usability.</p>
              <p id="P26">Deep learning algorithm results on this prescreened, diagnostically challenging cohort show stable performance, with an AUC of 0Â·86, comparable to our previous work.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The study shows that an algorithm trained largely on HPV-negative head and neck cancers generalises well to the HPV-associated setting. We hypothesise that this generalisability is because ENE is a morphological, local phenomenon, with the algorithm detecting subtle imaging signals in the node periphery that are universally indicative of ENE across molecular subtypes. Given that this cohort was prescreened for overt ENE or matted nodes, we expect it to perform even better in unscreened populations.</p>
              <p id="P27">To our knowledge, there has been only one other deep learning classifier developed for pathological ENE detection, in a study of 51 patients with oral carcinoma, which did not have external validation, limiting direct comparison to our study.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> By contrast, there have been numerous studies of radiological diagnosis of ENE using a combination of radiologist clinical judgment and traditional imaging criteria.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> These studies show a wide range of sensitivities and specificities for ENE, with high inter-reader variability, and AUCs generally less than 0Â·70, consistent with the performance of the experienced head and neck radiologists in this study. Notably, we found extreme inter-reader variability in this dataset, and wide-ranging in sensitivities (46% to 96%) and specificities (43% to 86%), despite optional use of an educational guideline intended to help standardise predictions. We hypothesise that uncertainty in ENE prediction led to overestimation or underestimation depending on the readersâ€™ individual tendencies that might derive from personal or institutional experiences,<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and this was reflected in our post-study survey results (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref> p 23). For example, R3 reported a tendency to overestimate ENE, which reflected their high sensitivity and low specificity. Specific ENE detection training and improved guidelines might improve interobserver variability and accuracy in the future, though current strategies do not appear sufficient. However, the algorithm is agnostic to these biases, which might be a strength of an algorithm-based detection strategy.</p>
              <p id="P28">In positioning the algorithm for clinical use, an acceptable tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity of ENE identification is important to consider, while understanding that the ideal threshold is specific to the clinical user. Allowing a false positive ENE rate of 30% yielded 90% sensitivity, meaning that applying this algorithm at protocol screening could have substantially reduced allocation to the E3311 high-risk arm, which required trimodality therapy. In practice, however, clinicians might prefer a false positive rate of no more than 10% to 20%, which compromises sensitivity. Findings from several trials, including E3311,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> DART,<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> and ORATOR,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> suggest that, in current frameworks, patients with ENE might be better served with non-operative definitive therapy. Conversely, patients without ENE are currently the most suitable candidates for surgically based treatment de-escalation, with reduced trimodality therapy and reduced long-term sequelae, as shown in E3311.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The relevance of ENE could depend on its extent and, reassuringly, the algorithm performed comparably in discriminating ENE by size (ie, &gt;1 mm or â‰¤1 mm). The algorithm operating point can be adapted to various scenarios, though will always require expert input to optimise its value in clinical context. Notably, aside from ENE, there are other important considerations in determining suitability for operative management, such as primary tumour location, extent and number of positive nodes, and patient preferences that must be accounted for in decision-making. Beyond selection for de-escalation strategies, more accurate ENE prediction via the algorithm could also be helpful in selecting patients appropriate for treatment escalation, including addition of chemotherapy to radiation in earlier stage patients, and clinical trials of systemic therapy intensification. Given the limitations of radiological ENE detection, this study suggests that algorithm-enhanced ENE prediction could contribute to decision-making in newly diagnosed patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.</p>
              <p id="P29">Deep learning medical applications are still nascent, and there are barriers to clinical translation.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> To address some of these barriers, we did test-time experiments to ensure that the network would be robust to adversarial images and generalise to various clinical scenarios, including variations in lymph-node segmentations and scanner parameters. To test for every possible scenario is not feasible and so, for this algorithm, as with any other deep learning application, we would recommend a run-in period of local testing at an institution to identify possible dataset or performance drift.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> The algorithm (and readers) performed worse on larger lymph nodes, and we are actively investigating ways to improve performance in this subgroup.</p>
              <p id="P30">There are several other limitations to this study. Due to logistical and archiving issues, we could not procure the entire E3311 dataset for analysis, instead receiving a random sample of roughly half of the trial population. Additionally, validating the algorithm requires node-level annotations for ENE, which increase the manual resource needs for independent testing. We annotated at least the largest lymph node on each scan to ensure the algorithm analysed the node at highest risk of ENE but recognise that there might be exceptions to this, so other nodes with clear pathological ENE correlations were annotated as well. There is also the possibility that some node labels were misidentified and that pathological confirmation could be subject to interobserver variability, though the granular reporting and centralised pathological review of E3311 probably minimised these risks. Patient-level ENE prediction would promote translation to clinical use without reliance on manual segmentation, and work is ongoing to develop autosegmentation tools to facilitate this,<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> although there are inherent benefits of a node-based model. Above all, node-level prediction greatly denoises the imaging framework space and allows the algorithm to focus on the region where ENE is present. ENE is generally a subtle, localised radiographical phenomenon, and therefore, a node-by-node approach to detection is more scientifically plausible than scan-level prediction in the absence of datasets much larger than are currently available. Additionally, our study shows that the algorithm is robust to variations in node segmentation, so performance would not be expected to decline due to interuser segmentation variability. Incorporation of imaging methods such as MRI and PET might improve the identification of ENE, both from a radiologist and algorithmic perspective, however studies thus far have been inconclusive.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>â€“<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P31">With intensifying interest in de-escalation paradigms for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma, tools are needed to optimise patient selection, including improved pretreatment ENE identification.<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> We show the utility of CT-based deep learning to predict pathological ENE in a diagnostically challenging cohort of patients from a prospective, randomised de-escalation trial for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma. The algorithm shows high sensitivity and specificity for ENE identification, and substantially outperforms expert head and neck radiologists on direct comparison. Algorithm predictions could be provided to radiologists during the scan review or addended to a radiology report and given to oncology providers during the decision-making process. The deep learning algorithm should be prospectively tested in a randomised trial to determine its effect on treatment decision-making, quality of life, and disease control.</p>

                <p id="P36">(A) The previously developed deep learning algorithm was retrained on a combined, multi-institutional dataset from three sources to predict probability of nodal metastasis and ENE on a node-by-node basis. (B) The model was locked and tested on a curated dataset of 313 lymph nodes from 178 patients enrolled on the E3311 de-escalation trial for patient withs human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma, a trial that specifically excluded radiographic matted nodes or overt clinical ENE. Four expert head and neck radiologists from National Comprehensive Cancer Network comprehensive cancer centers, and with access to a validated educational guideline for radiographic ENE criteria, individually reviewed the lymph nodes, and made a prediction of node positivity or ENE on a forced Likert scale. ENE classification performance was compared between the deep learning algorithm and the radiologists, with a primary endpoint of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. 3D=three dimensional. AUC=area under curve. ECOG-ACRIN=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network. ENE=extranodal extension. ROC=receiver operating characteristic.</p>

                <p id="P38">Plots are binned in intervals of 10%, with predicted probability in the x axis, compared with the actual rate of ENE within that prediction interval on the y axis. Raw probabilities after testing on E3311 indicate mild underestimation of actual ENE rates. To develop a calibrated model whose probabilities would indicate real-world certainty, we did temperature scaling on the raw model outputs using the internal validation set from the combined Yaleâ€“Sinaiâ€“TCIA dataset. We then applied this mapping to the output probabilities for the E3311 dataset to yield a calibrated model, which maps very well to actual ENE rates, with improved expected calibration error.

                <p id="P43">We searched PubMed for articles published from Jan 1, 1990, until April 5, 2022, for diagnostic performance for extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancers, using the terms: ((extranodal extension) OR (extracapsular extension)) AND ((computed tomography) OR (magnetic resonance imaging)) AND ((deep learning) or (machine learning) or (radiologist)) AND ((head and neck cancer) OR (oropharynx)). Reviews were excluded, yielding 12 articles, ten of which pertained to head and neck cancer lymph nodes. Eight articles qualified the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists in identifying ENE and universally showed subpar performance or high inter-reader variability using various radiographical criteria. Our group previously published the first internal and externally validated CT-based, deep learning algorithm for ENE identification, showing superior performance when compared directly with two human experts. One other deep learning algorithm for ENE identification in patients with oral cancer has been since published, trained on a small, single-institution dataset without external validation. We found no articles investigating deep learning for ENE identification in the setting of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P44">This is the first study evaluating deep learning as a screening tool for the pretreatment identification of ENE in HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma and does so in the context of a multinational, randomised treatment deescalation trial. This study was done on a large cohort of patients who were, per protocol, excluded if overt radiographic ENE was suspected. This population thus represents a difficult litmus test for the algorithm in a cohort of patients where pretreatment ENE identification would be consequential. Additionally, the cohort had centralised pathology review for ENE, which included extent of ENE. The algorithm is directly benchmarked by four expert radiologists and shows that deep learning has a clear superiority in identifying ENE compared with the current standard.</p>

                <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                <p id="P45">This study shows that deep learning can predict ENE in a prospectively accrued cohort of patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma in the pretreatment setting with high accuracy, outperforming diagnostic experts. Given the increasing interest in therapeutic de-escalation strategies for HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma, the algorithm could be used to screen for ENE and help to select patients for operative versus non-operative management, thereby improving treatment personalisation and minimising the use of trimodality therapy.</p>
