When the same women were exposed to thirdhand smoke at least 21 days later, 389 genes associated with cell stress and survival pathways were differentially expressed, and many affected genes were associated with increased mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, DNA repair, cell survival, and inhibition of cell death.</p>

                  <p>Nasal epithelium samples were obtained from participants in a randomized clinical trial (2011-2015) on the health effects of inhaled THS. In a crossover design, participants were exposed, head only, to THS and to conditioned, filtered air in a laboratory setting. The order of exposures was randomized and exposures were separated by at least 21 days. Ribonucleic acid was obtained from a subset of 4 healthy, nonsmoking women.</p>

                  <p>Participants were 4 healthy, nonsmoking women aged 27 to 49 years (mean [SD] age, 42 [10.2] years) with no chronic diseases. A total of 389 differentially expressed genes were identified in nasal epithelium exposed to THS, while only 2 genes, which were not studied further, were affected by clean air. Enriched gene ontology terms associated with stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion were identified, such as respiratory electron transport chain (<italic>q</italic> = 2.84 × 10<sup>−3</sup>) and mitochondrial inner membrane (<italic>q</italic> = 7.21 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Reactome pathway analysis identified terms associated with upregulation of DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (<italic>q</italic> = 1.05 × 10<sup>−2</sup>). Enrichment analyses using ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways related to stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (eg, increased oxidative phosphorylation) (<italic>P</italic> = .001), oxidative stress (eg, glutathione depletion phase II reactions) (<italic>P</italic> = .04), and cell survival (<italic>z</italic> score = 5.026).</p>

                  <p>This study found that acute inhalation of THS caused cell stress that led to the activation of survival pathways. Some responses were consistent with stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion and similar to those demonstrated previously in vitro. These data may be valuable to physicians treating patients exposed to THS and may aid in formulating regulations for the remediation of THS-contaminated environments.</p>

              <p>Thirdhand smoke (THS) is a subset of chemicals in secondhand cigarette smoke (sidestream smoke emitted by a burning cigarette and exhaled mainstream smoke) that sticks to indoor surfaces and persists after active smoking has occurred.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Chemicals in THS accumulate and can react with other compounds or can be reemitted into the environment.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Nonsmokers can be exposed to chemicals in THS months or even years after smoking has stopped.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Many THS chemicals are toxic volatile and semivolatile organic compounds.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Nicotine, a major chemical in THS, has a high affinity for surfaces<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and can react with ambient nitrous acid to form tobacco-specific nitrosamines, some of which are carcinogens.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Nicotine-derived nitrosamines in THS include 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone, and N-nitrosonornicotine,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which are also found in secondhand smoke and have been associated with the development of lung cancer.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Ozone can also react with nicotine to form formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Owing to the presence of these and other hazardous chemicals in THS, such as acrolein, it is important to understand whether there is a correlation between exposure to THS and human health, especially in nonsmokers. Previous studies<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> have demonstrated that exposure of human cell lines to THS extracts for 24 hours increased DNA strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage. Mouse neural stem cells undergo blebbing, fragmentation, cytoskeletal disruption, and vacuolization when treated with extracts of THS.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Thirdhand smoke is also associated with stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH), which is accompanied by increased mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and reactive oxygen species (ROS).<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> During SIMH, punctate mitochondria fuse and form tubular networks that allow exchange of molecules, including mitochondrial DNA, as a survival mechanism.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Acrolein has been identified as a THS chemical that inhibits cell proliferation.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a metabolomics study using male germ cells, THS exposure was associated with downregulation of several molecular pathways, including nucleic acid metabolism and ammonia metabolism, and upregulation of glutathione metabolism.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Thirdhand smoke is also associated with adverse health effects in mice. Three-week old mice that were housed for 6 months in cages containing a THS-impregnated fabric and bedding showed an increase in inflammatory cytokines in lung tissue, impaired wound healing, and were hyperactive compared with controls.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Adult mice developed insulin resistance as a consequence of oxidative stress associated with THS and showed increased blood glucose levels, increased serum insulin levels, and accumulation of fat in viscera.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Oxidative stress in skeletal muscle and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide accompanied by low catalase activity was observed in long-term exposed mice.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> After THS exposure, neonatal mice had significantly more eosinophils, increased platelet volume, lower hematocrit levels, and decreased mean cell volume than controls, while adult exposed mice had a significant increase in the percentage of B-cells and a decrease in myeloid cells.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Elimination of THS can be challenging, as it persists in houses previously owned by smokers even after 2 months of vacancy.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Cars previously owned by smokers also retain THS, and new owners may be at risk of exposure.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Common household fabrics retained THS chemicals 19 months after smoking had occurred.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Individuals absorb nicotine through their skin while wearing THS-exposed clothes.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Moreover, infants whose mothers smoked outdoors had much higher levels of urine cotinine, a nicotine metabolite, than infants of nonsmoking parents.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Other examples of the persistence of THS have been reviewed recently.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although these prior studies demonstrate that humans are at risk of exposure to THS, the molecular effects of such exposure on humans have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of inhalation of THS chemicals on gene expression in humans. Nasal epithelial cells were collected from nonsmokers before and after 3 hours of exposure to either clean air or to THS, subjected to RNA sequencing, and analyzed for differential expression of genes (DEG). Significant changes in gene expression were found following THS exposure, but not exposure to clean air.</p>

It was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco, between 2011 and 2015. Briefly, 26 healthy nonsmokers who were not exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke in daily life were exposed, head-only, to THS aerosol and to conditioned, filtered air for 3 hours using an exposure chamber described previously.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Of these 26 individuals, 13 (8 women and 5 men) had nasal epithelial cell samples collected before and after each exposure. Nasal epithelial samples were collected from the anterior, inferior turbinate using small, sterile plastic curettes (RhinoPro; Arlington Scientific, Inc). These samples were immediately placed in RNAlater (Qiagen) and shipped frozen to the University of California, Riverside, where RNA extraction and subsequent analyses were performed.</p>

Samples with RNA integrity numbers between 8 and 10 were used for library construction. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an Oligo (dT) primer (Co-Factor), and limited cDNA amplification was performed using the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing–v4 (Takara Bio USA, Inc). Full-length cDNA was fragmented and tagged, followed by limited polymerase chain reaction enrichment to generate the final cDNA sequencing library (Nextera XT DNA Library Prep; Illumina). Libraries were sequenced as single-end 75–base pair reads using an Illumina NextSeq500 following the manufacturer's instructions. Because the amount of nasal epithelium in each sample was very limited, we were not able to perform confirmatory quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</p>

                <p>Participants were 4 healthy, nonsmoking women aged 27 to 49 years (mean [SD] age, 42 [10.2] years) with no chronic diseases. The samples collected were small and sufficient quantities of RNA for sequencing analysis could only be extracted from 4 women. By chance, these 4 participants had all been randomized to receive the clean air exposure first and THS exposure second; thus, we were unable to determine the effect of order on RNA expression. After processing RNA sequencing reads, data were analyzed to determine whether there were differences in gene expression in the groups exposed to either clean air (group 1 vs group 2) or THS (group 3 vs group 4) (eFigure 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The data set consisted of approximately 10 000 genes, of which 2 and 389 were significantly differentially affected (FDR &lt;0.10) in participants exposed to clean air and to THS, respectively (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The 2 downregulated genes (hemoglobin, alpha 1 and hemoglobin, alpha 2) identified when participants were exposed to clean air had an absolute fold change of 8.2 and 8.7, respectively (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). No genes were significantly upregulated in the group exposed to clean air (eFigure 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). Because these results showed that wearing the respirator for 3.5 hours and inhaling clean air did not significantly impact gene expression, clean air was not studied further.</p>
                <p>Nasal samples collected after THS exposure had a significant number of DEGs compared with samples collected before exposure (eTable 1 and eFigure 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). A total of 382 genes were significantly upregulated (FDR &lt;0.1), while 7 were downregulated (eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes for upregulated genes ranged from 2 to 7, while downregulated genes ranged from −2 to −9 (eTable 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).

                <p>Diseases and functions associated with the DEGs after THS exposure were identified by IPA (<xref rid="zoi190250t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These data were filtered and only functions with activated <italic>z</italic> scores that predict transcriptional activation or inhibition based on literature reports are presented (<xref rid="zoi190250t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The identified functions included decreased cell death and increased cell viability, homologous recombination, and cell proliferation. eFigure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref> shows upregulated genes associated with inhibition of cell death. The figure includes gene names and whether their expression could activate (orange lines) or inhibit (blue lines) cell death. For cell death, the majority of the upregulated genes predict inhibition (blue lines). Based on each gene’s biological role, IPA predicted that cell death had an activation <italic>z</italic> score of −3.117 (overall process decreased) (<xref rid="zoi190250t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Complementary to cell death, cell viability (<italic>z</italic> score = 5.026) (eFigure 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) and homologous recombination (<italic>z</italic> score = 2.828) (eFigure 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) both had increased activation states (<xref rid="zoi190250t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>The adverse health effects of THS have been studied in cultured cells and animal models,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> but to our knowledge similar investigations have not been previously performed in humans. Our study provides the first insight, to our knowledge, into the transcriptional responses of human respiratory epithelium to acute THS exposure. Remarkably, we found changes in gene expression in healthy nonsmokers following a 3-hour exposure to THS. The absence of an effect following clean air exposure provides evidence that the changes in gene expression following THS exposure are caused by THS per se and not by the respirator worn during exposure. Because gene expression in the nasal epithelium is similar to the bronchial epithelium,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> our data are also relevant to the cells deeper in the respiratory system.</p>
              <p>Our analyses demonstrated that brief exposure to THS affected mitochondrial activity. We previously reported that cultured mouse neural stem cells undergo SIMH following exposure to THS extracts.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This process was originally described during treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with UV light and cell cycle inhibitors, such as actinomycin D.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion is characterized by fusion of mitochondria and subsequent increased production of ATP and superoxide.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We found an enrichment in pathways and biological processes related to increased mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress after THS exposure, such as mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport chain (GO:0042773), respiratory electron transport (R-HSA-611105), and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="zoi190250t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Increased expression of these pathways is also consistent with an increase in ATP synthesis, as occurs in SIMH.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Some genes related to the citric acid cycle were also upregulated, which could also increase ATP production. Several studies have shown that cigarette smoking also induces activation of mitochondrial pathways similar to those found in our study.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
              <p>While SIMH results in increased ATP production, it also increases ROS.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Our IPA analysis showed that glutathione depletion phase II reactions were upregulated after THS exposure. Specifically, there was an increase in glutathione synthetase expression, which was also increased in a male germ cell line exposed to THS.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This gene is part of the glutathione synthetase pathway, which scavenges ROS,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggesting the increase of the glutathione synthetase gene is a cellular response to high levels of ROS.</p>
              <p>In prior studies, increased ROS was associated with oxidative stress and damage of proteins, lipids, and DNA,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> while THS treatment was correlated with DNA damage in vitro.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Our IPA-based enriched pathway analysis included upregulation of the nucleotide excision repair pathway in participants exposed to THS. Two of the genes affected in this pathway included xeroderma pigmentosum group C and RNA polymerase II. The former is essential for recognition of DNA damage and plays a role in the early steps of the nucleotide excision repair pathway.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Upregulation of RNA polymerase II has also been associated with a response to increased DNA damage.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Ingenuity Pathway Analysis also identified an increased activation of homologous recombination. This pathway provides a repair mechanism for double-stranded DNA breaks.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Activation of the DNA repair pathways is also a cellular mechanism to facilitate survival.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> In addition, an in vitro study showed that THS induces oxidation of mitochondrial proteins.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The increase in ROS as evidenced by upregulation of ROS scavenging genes in our data could also result in oxidation of mitochondrial proteins by high local concentrations of superoxide.</p>
              <p>Our data further demonstrate an overall increase in processes related to cell viability, which includes some genes involved in cell proliferation. Our results are consistent with previous in vitro studies showing increased proliferation of cultured mouse neural stem cells and human lung cancer cells exposed to THS extract.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Nicotine, a major component of THS<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and a chemical in our exposure chamber, can activate alpha nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in normal human airway epithelial cells, leading to phosphorylation (activation) of serine/threonine kinase Akt, which is involved in many cellular survival pathways.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Akt can be activated within minutes of exposure to nicotine or 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> further demonstrating that chemicals in THS could produce a rapid response. Nicotine is also associated with increased proliferation of human cancer cell lines by activating the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Considering that nicotine stimulates cell proliferation,<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> it is possible that nicotine in THS contributes to the increase in cell viability pathways that we observed.</p>
              <p>Nicotine is also involved in inhibiting apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> In our study, the increased expression of genes involved in inhibiting cell death (eFigure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190250-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) may have been associated with nicotine, which was present in the THS at a concentration of 0.03 mg/L (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 6.164). Consistent with our study, cells exposed to THS in vitro showed decreased expression in proapoptotic genes.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The mechanism by which nicotine inhibits apoptosis has been studied in mouse liver cells.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mitochondrial outer membrane by nicotine inhibited hydrogen peroxide–induced apoptosis by impairing calcium ion accumulation in mitochondria and cytochrome C release.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> However, this suppression of cell death may be transitory. Bahl et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> showed that cells exposed to THS for 30 days had a decrease in cell proliferation and lost mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that cells were entering apoptosis.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. This is an initial study based on 4 participants. Future work should be done to determine whether similar data are obtained with a larger number of participants that includes both sexes. In addition, longer exposures to THS could be studied.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, this is the first exposure study to document an association between THS and gene expression in humans. Our results show that THS induced cell survival responses, which included upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair, activation of cell viability, increased mitochondrial activity, and inhibition of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190250f3">Figure 3</xref>). These changes are very similar to those reported previously for in vitro cultured cells.<sup><xref rid="zoi190250r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190250r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Importantly, the changes in gene expression in the current study were seen following a relatively short (3-hour) exposure, indicating that humans respond rapidly to THS. Future studies on long-term exposure in conjunction with our study could broaden our understanding of the effects of THS on human health. Our study provides an important foundation for physicians treating patients exposed to THS and for future development of regulations dealing with remediation of indoor environments contaminated with THS.</p>
