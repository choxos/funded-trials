                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening can reduce lung cancer mortality among high-risk individuals, but uptake of lung screening remains low. Social media platforms have the potential to reach a large number of people, including those who are at high risk for lung cancer but who may not be aware of or have access to lung screening.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This paper discusses the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that leverages FBTA to reach screening-eligible individuals in the community at large and intervene with a public-facing, tailored health communication intervention (<italic>LungTalk</italic>) to increase awareness of, and knowledge about, lung screening.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study will provide important information to inform the ability to refine implementation processes for national population efforts to scale a public-facing health communication focused intervention using social media to increase screening uptake of appropriate, high-risk individuals.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Lung cancer kills more people annually than breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Lung screening with annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer-related mortality by identifying lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. <italic>However, population-level screening efforts are only effective when eligible, high-risk individuals are aware and engaged.</italic> In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid agreed to cover lung screening in response to the 2013 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Grade B recommendation for individuals aged 55 to 80 years with a 30-pack-year smoking history who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In response to new scientific evidence, updated recommendations have decreased the minimum screening eligible age to 50 years and pack-year history to 20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As part of Medicare’s coverage, in order for lung screening to be reimbursed, a shared decision-making and counseling visit must be conducted with one or more patient decision aids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Medicare’s unprecedented policy and coverage mandate fostered a unique opportunity for advancing understanding of the shared decision-making process for lung screening.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Although lung screening is recommended by the USPSTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], has the potential to detect lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages, has a 20% lung cancer-related mortality reduction in individuals who smoke long-term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and is covered by Medicare and other health insurers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] population uptake has been abysmal. Nearly a decade after the USPSTF recommended lung cancer screening, less than 5% of screening-eligible Americans have been screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Screening-eligible individuals are generally unaware lung screening exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and screening-eligible individuals in the U.S. do not screen – <italic>when they are aware</italic> – because of barriers to screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Given that high-risk individuals are generally not aware that lung screening exists, it is essential to employ new and novel community-focused communication strategies to increase awareness about lung screening so as to reach high-risk, screening-eligible individuals. Social media offers untapped opportunities to address the lack of awareness and knowledge about lung screening and thereby reach high-risk, screening-eligible individuals and increase screening adoption. As of 2023, individuals aged 65 and older are the fastest growing demographic group on Facebook and use of this social media platform among individuals born in or before 1945 has nearly doubled in the past three years. Further, among the 2.7 billion Facebook users, over 32 million are age 50 years and older – the age range for lung screening eligibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Because Facebook has the ability to target advertisements to individual users by key demographic and interest areas within their profile, Facebook-targeted advertisement (FBTA) offers an ideal social media platform to reach and deliver a public-facing, tailored health communication and decision support intervention to increase awareness of, and knowledge about, lung screening among those most at risk.</p>
              <p id="Par7">To facilitate awareness of the option to screen for lung cancer and support meaningful patient-clinician discussions about screening, effective communication strategies are needed to prepare patients to initiate (“Ask your doctor”) and to <italic>have</italic> these important discussions with their clinician. To foster both, our team developed <italic>LungTalk </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], a novel computer-tailored health communication and decision support tool to (1) increase awareness and knowledge about lung screening; (2) decrease perceived barriers to screening by addressing misinformation; (3) increase occurrence of a patient-clinician discussion about lung screening; and (4) increase screening rates among individuals whose decision after a shared decision-making discussion with their clinician is to screen. Given that new and novel ways to increase awareness and knowledge about lung screening and adoption in high-risk populations are essential to support effective population-based lung screening implementation, we seek to better understand how to raise awareness about lung screening.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Historically low levels of public trust in expert entities such as government, news media, and the healthcare system as well as growing awareness of the new cancer information ecosystem led us to consider social media as a novel platform for cancer communication. FBTA has been successfully used by our team and others to recruit individuals into research studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and provides “precision marketing” – sending the right message content to the right person at the right time via the right channel.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Early health communication tools and decision aids for lung screening have primarily focused on calculating personal risk for the development of lung cancer and subsequent recommendations to screen based upon that risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These tools range in level of complexity and delivery including pamphlets and brochures in print, web-based information, videos, educational scripts, and computer programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These tools can also be deployed in multiple formats such as by mail, telephone, in person and via the internet and have been found to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. <italic>LungTalk</italic> tailors messages based on smoking status, perceived barriers, and priorities for discussion in the patient-clinician encounter, allowing <italic>LungTalk</italic> to address individualized issues that are personally relevant to the lung screening decision. Ultimately, to support shared decision-making in lung screening, it is critical that health communication tools and decision aids about lung screening go beyond assessing risk and tailor messages based on multiple salient variables that may be personally relevant to the patient. <italic>LungTalk</italic> can be used as a public-facing health communication tool at multiple time points: prior to entrance into the healthcare system, during a clinic visit, and post-visit to support the decision to screen, or not, for lung cancer. In addition, <italic>LungTalk</italic> goes beyond risk assessment screening education to increase perceived benefits and self-efficacy and reduce perceived barriers in order to move a screening-eligible individual forward in stage of adoption for lung screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Finally, <italic>LungTalk</italic> is theoretically grounded, which increases our ability to determine what components of the intervention are driving behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Our overall objective in this study is to test the effectiveness of: 1) leveraging a well-established, social media-based platform (FBTA) to target screening-eligible individuals in the community and 2) a novel, tailored health communication and decision support intervention related to lung screening (<italic>LungTalk</italic>). Our central hypothesis is two-fold: 1) FBTA will be a successful platform to reach high-risk individuals who have not previously undergone or sought lung screening; and 2) tailored lung screening information compared to non-tailored information will increase knowledge and improve health beliefs about screening and subsequent screening uptake. This paper discusses the protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that leverages FBTA to reach screening-eligible individuals in the community at large and intervene with a public-facing, tailored health communication intervention (<italic>LungTalk</italic>) to increase awareness of, and knowledge about, lung screening.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p id="Par11">The INSPIRE-Lung Study is designed as a randomized, controlled, community-based trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of lung screening uptake by 6 months post intervention. Randomization will be performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation. See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for Trial Registration Data and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> for SPIRIT Flow Diagram of Participant Timeline. This study has two components: (1) to assess the ability of FBTA to <italic>reach</italic> high-risk individuals eligible for lung screening; and (2) to examine the comparative-effectiveness of <italic>LungTalk</italic> and a non-tailored lung screening information video in a national sample of screening-eligible, community-based individuals using an RCT design. <italic>Reach</italic> is defined as the absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of participating individuals assessed for lung screening knowledge, awareness and uptake, and reasons why or why not. <italic>Effectiveness</italic> is defined as increased knowledge, decreased perceived barriers to lung screening, occurrence of a patient-clinician discussion about the option to screen, and screening uptake, if the decision is to screen. Potential moderators of effectiveness (i.e., smoking status, gender, age, family history of lung cancer, provider recommendation, stigma, mistrust, fatalism, fear, worry, lung screening health beliefs) will also be assessed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hackensack Meridian Health (IRB Protocol #: Pro-2022–0860). In addition, all methods will be performed in accordance with the guidelines and ethical principles that are fundamental to human subject protection and electronic written informed consent will be obtained online from all study participants.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Trial registration data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Data Category</th><th align="left">Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Primary registry and trial identifying number</td><td align="left">ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05824273</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Date of registration in primary registry</td><td align="left">10 April, 2023</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Source of monetary or material support</td><td align="left">National Cancer Institute R01CA263662</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Primary sponsor</td><td align="left">Hackensack Meridian Health</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Collaborator</td><td align="left">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Contact for public queries</td><td align="left">Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, MPH, APRN, ANP-C, FAAN [lisa.carterbawa@hmh-cdi.org]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Contact for scientific queries</td><td align="left">Lisa Carter-Bawa, PhD, MPH, APRN, ANP-C, FAAN, Center for Discovery &amp;

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par12">We will leverage FBTA to recruit community-based lung screening-eligible individuals. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Smoking and Tobacco Use statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], we chose states with a relatively high (e.g., 15.9% or greater) adult smoking rate representing all U.S. census regions. We will employ FBTA in five states including Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Oregon. We chose these five states because they are geographically diverse across the U.S., their populations are racially and ethnically diverse, and they have moderate-to-high adult smoking rates increasing the likelihood of reaching screening-eligible individuals. We are partnering with the GO2 for Lung Cancer (GO2) to identify Centers of Excellence in Lung Cancer Screening (as designated by GO2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to connect individuals who seek a screening referral request but do not have a primary care clinician. There are more than 800 Centers of Excellence in Lung Cancer Screening nationwide, and there are currently 126 in the five states in which we will conduct the study. These centers are well-established, well-connected, dedicated to high quality screening and care, and have strong collaborators with their local primary care networks, making them the ideal national partner to connect participants without a primary care clinician to one for facilitating the patient-clinician discussion about screening. They can also link individuals to primary care clinicians regardless of insurance status through federally qualified health centers and community health centers fostering access to high quality screening for low income and other vulnerable subpopulations.</p>

                <p id="Par13">Eligibility criteria mirror the current USPSTF lung screening guidelines: 1) aged 50 to 80 years; 2) ≥ 20-pack-year smoking history; 3) individuals who currently smoke or quit smoking within the past 15 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

                <title>Recruitment rationale and procedures</title>
                <p id="Par14">We will use a highly successful recruitment strategy via FBTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to recruit 500 screening-eligible individuals from Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Oregon. See Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for CONSORT diagram. The Facebook user’s interest list includes a wide range of details a user can select when setting up and/or maintaining their profile that they have an interest in such as groups, hobbies, lifestyle choices, behaviors, points of view, specific organizations and more. This allows us to purposively sample people who are age 50 years and older, indicate smoking or smoking cessation as an interest and reside in a particular state, city, or zip code. Using this approach, as we have in prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we will target our advertisement on Facebook using the following keywords: <italic>cigarette, tobacco, nicotine replacement therapy, nicotine gum, electronic cigarette, smoking, vaping</italic>. Guided by the safety and monitoring guidelines for researchers using social media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], our approach includes design and close monitoring of the FBTA to ensure all methodologic and ethical standards are upheld. Currently, we have a potential reach of 550,000 potentially screening-eligible individuals in the 5 states above. As an example, with a $5,000 recruitment budget and an ad campaign that runs for 14 days, Facebook analytics estimate that 28,000 to 82,000 people per day will see the ad in their daily news feed in the five states and 262 to 758 unique Facebook users will click on the embedded eligibility survey link within the advertisement on a daily basis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram for INSPIRE-Lung Trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_15857_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <title>Description of the intervention</title>
                <p id="Par15">Individuals who enroll into the study will be randomized to one of two arms: <italic>LungTalk</italic> or the non-tailored lung screening educational video. <italic>LungTalk</italic> is a computer-tailored health communication and decision-making tool that is theoretically grounded in the Conceptual Model on Lung Cancer Screening Participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. See Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This model links the Health Belief Model to the Precaution Adoption Process Model and includes key psychological variables (e.g., stigma, mistrust, fatalism, fear and worry) as factors that may influence an individuals’ decision to screen, or not, for lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The tool as a whole serves as a cue to action for a screening-eligible individual to engage in a discussion with their clinician about the option to screen, or not, for lung cancer.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Conceptual model for lung cancer screening participation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2023_15857_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par16"><italic>LungTalk</italic> is an interactive computer program that takes approximately 8 to 12 min to complete depending upon specific tailoring variables selected by the user and includes embedded audio, video and animation segments with tailoring algorithms for scripts presented from a master content library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. <italic>LungTalk</italic> tailors initially on smoking status. Early in the program, the user is asked to indicate if they currently smoke cigarettes or if they quit smoking and subsequent content is aligned with an individual’s current smoking status. In addition, <italic>LungTalk</italic> tailors on the top three barriers to lung screening identified in our prior research testing the Conceptual Model for Lung Cancer Screening Participation (R15 CA208543) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Those barriers are: (1) cost/insurance issues; (2) worry; and (3) not receiving a recommendation from a healthcare clinician. After viewing an embedded video of how a lung scan is performed, the user will be asked if they perceive cost/insurance, worry, or lack of receiving a clinician recommendation as a barrier to getting screened. At this point, the user is able to choose none, one, two, or all three barriers. Based upon the user’s responses, <italic>LungTalk</italic> will play a brief video that includes messaging to address the perceived barrier. <italic>LungTalk</italic> concludes by offering the option of saving or printing a tailored summary at the end for individuals to use as a discussion prompt with their clinician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This print-out highlights key points related to lung health and screening, tailored by smoking status, offers question prompts to initiate a discussion with their clinician, and tailors the question prompts based upon questions that remain important to the user that they wish to discuss further with their clinician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Messages in <italic>LungTalk</italic> are presented at an 8th grade reading level, and in consideration of different ways people like to learn, the content is narrated as well as presented as key text on the screen.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The <italic>comparator/attention control condition</italic> is a non-tailored 5-min video from the GO2 for Lung Cancer about lung screening designed for the lay individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This video was chosen as the comparator to serve as an attention control condition for the nonspecific effects of the intervention by balancing attention, treatment contact, and delivery channel so that a precise test of the hypothesized active component (the tailoring in <italic>LungTalk</italic>) of the intervention comparator can be made. Attention control conditions require two components – clinical attention and a therapeutic benefit; choosing the GO2 for Lung Cancer’s lung screening video meets both requirements.</p>

Quantitative data collected from FB analytics during the recruitment campaign will assess reach by detailing: 1) reach; 2) link clicks; and 3) impressions. Reach in FB analytics is defined as the number of people who saw the FBTA at least once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

                  <title>Analysis of effectiveness</title>
                  <p id="Par25">Our analyses were defined a priori to address the study aims. We will use descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions/distributional assumptions to examine data quality, identify patterns of missing and out-of-range values, and evaluate the assumptions of statistical tests. Specifically, we will examine all aspects of data quality to ensure statistical integrity and accuracy including: 1) data skewness, kurtosis, and parametric assumptions; 2) intention-to-treat (ITT) principles; 3) missing data considerations; and 4) control of overall alpha to avoid inflated experiment-wise Type-I error due to multiple statistical tests. Remediation of normal distribution assumption violations will be accomplished using methods such as data transformations (e.g., log or square root for positively skewed variables), Box-Cox family transformations, or kernel estimation techniques to determine the best-fitting parametric density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], or other methods as appropriate. Assessment of internal consistency reliability of all scales will be carried out using the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. We will apply the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle in handling missing data on screening uptake. A study participant will be coded as ‘no screening uptake’ unless otherwise verified by our participating sites. We will examine violations of the missing-at-random assumption. If missing is not completely at random, then covariates associated with missingness will be incorporated into data analysis to minimized. A related approach is the use of mixed-effects models, which is capable of handling binary as well as continuous outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], to use all available behavioral outcomes data since HLM does not carry out list-wise deletion by default, thus the statistical power loss due to missing data may be minimal. Additionally, missing outcome data (assuming up to 20% of the respondents will be unreachable at our three-month follow-up) as well as missing assessments may be amenable to imputation by several techniques that can handle both continuous and categorical missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. We may also use the Pattern-Mixture Model to examine whether or not missed follow-up assessments are associated with baseline characteristics with safeguards to minimize model overfit. Finally, to control for potentially inflated Type-I error rate due to multiple comparisons, analyses will incorporate a multiple comparisons method, such as a False Discovery Rate-controlling procedure, which is more powerful than simple Bonferroni corrections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par26">Total knowledge scale scores, Lung Cancer Screening Health Beliefs (total scale scores for perceived risk, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy), and stage of adoption are continuous variables. Screening referral request and screening uptake are dichotomous variables. Prior to group comparisons, measures will be described by timepoint, both overall and by group. Within-group changes will be assessed using the standardized response mean (SRM) effect sizes (mean change divided by SD of change). The primary outcome is lung screening uptake but forward movement in stage of adoption (i.e., the change score) will also be evaluated as a secondary analysis. For between-group comparisons, continuous outcome variables will be compared using two-sided independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (accompanied by the standardized mean difference effect size, i.e., difference between group means divided by baseline SD) and dichotomous outcome variables will be compared using the Chi-square test, or two-sided Fisher’s exact test, if 20% or more cells have expected counts less than 5 (accompanied by the odds ratio effect size). In the case of differential attrition, as noted above, regression models will also be used to assess outcomes by adjusting for baseline covariates that differ significantly between participants who do and do not complete follow-up assessments. Moderators of intervention effectiveness will be assessed by regressing outcome variables (e.g., knowledge score) on randomization arm, the potential moderator, and an interaction term, where a significant interaction effect is indicative of moderation. Significant moderator effects will further be explored and described with stratified analyses.</p>

With a sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 250 per group and up to 20% missing assessment data (<italic>n</italic> = 200 available for analysis) on total knowledge scale and total perceived risk scale scores, we will have an 80% statistical power if the difference is d = 0.28 (in standardized effect size units, or Cohen d), in an independent-sample t-test with a two-sided type-I error rate of 5%.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">To date, researchers have focused on the implementation of shared decision-making in lung screening using various decision aids at the point of healthcare delivery. We are challenging the current status quo by shifting the focus of outreach and engagement back before the screening-eligible individual enters the healthcare system to identify effective communication platforms and interventions to increase lung screening awareness and knowledge. Upon study completion, we will have identified the reach of FBTA, and determined the effectiveness of a computer-tailored health communication and decision support tool intervention (<italic>LungTalk</italic>) using a social media campaign to increase screening awareness and uptake. Educating screening-eligible individuals about key factors related to lung screening at a population-based level by leveraging social media as a platform to reach the right people in order to implement this effort has the potential to enhance patient outcomes by: 1) increasing baseline knowledge; 2) decreasing misinformation; and 3) decreasing perceived barriers to screening. We expect that leveraging social media to increase awareness and knowledge will be an effective public-facing communication strategy for complex health topics such as lung screening. Equally important will be our ability to identify and engage vulnerable patient populations based upon precise targeting criteria. Ultimately, using a novel health communication strategy to tailor health messages based upon characteristics that are unique to the individual as well as leveraging social media to reach the target population and deliver this type of intervention are both innovative methods to engage high risk individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These findings will be used to inform how public health campaigns in lung screening can be scaled to support increasing awareness and knowledge. This contribution is significant because the gap in the current state of the science in lung screening is population awareness and knowledge which has led to the abysmal rates of lung screening discussions with clinicians (&lt; 10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and screening uptake (&lt; 5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
