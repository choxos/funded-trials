                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Bipolar disorder is a serious and common psychiatric disorder characterized by manic and depressive mood switches and a relapsing and remitting course. The cornerstone of clinical management is stabilization and prophylaxis using mood-stabilizing medications to reduce both manic and depressive symptoms. Lithium remains the gold standard of treatment with the strongest data for both efficacy and suicide prevention. However, many patients do not respond to this medication, and clinically there is a great need for tools to aid the clinician in selecting the correct treatment. Large genome wide association studies (GWAS) investigating retrospectively the effect of lithium response are in the pipeline; however, few large prospective studies on genetic predictors to of lithium response have yet been conducted. The purpose of this project is to identify genes that are associated with lithium response in a large prospective cohort of bipolar patients and to better understand the mechanism of action of lithium and the variation in the genome that influences clinical response.</p>

                  <title>Methods/Design</title>
                  <p>This study is an 11-site prospective non-randomized open trial of lithium designed to ascertain a cohort of 700 subjects with bipolar I disorder who experience protocol-defined relapse prevention as a result of treatment with lithium monotherapy. All patients will be diagnosed using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS) and will then enter a 2-year follow-up period on lithium monotherapy if and when they exhibit a score of 1 (normal, not ill), 2 (minimally ill) or 3 (mildly ill) on the Clinical Global Impressions of Severity Scale for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-S-BP Overall Bipolar Illness) for 4 of the 5 preceding weeks. Lithium will be titrated as clinically appropriate, not to exceed serum levels of 1.2 mEq/L. The sample will be evaluated longitudinally using a wide range of clinical scales, cognitive assessments and laboratory tests. On relapse, patients will be discontinued or crossed-over to treatment with valproic acid (VPA) or treatment as usual (TAU). Relapse is defined as a DSM-IV manic, major depressive or mixed episode or if the treating physician decides a change in medication is clinically necessary. The sample will be genotyped for GWAS. The outcome for lithium response will be analyzed as a time to event, where the event is defined as clinical relapse, using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. Positive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from past genetic retrospective studies of lithium response, the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen), will be tested in this prospective study sample; a meta-analysis of these samples will then be performed. Finally, neurons will be derived from pluripotent stem cells from lithium responders and non-responders and tested in vivo for response to lithium by gene expression studies. SNPs in genes identified in these cellular studies will also be tested for association to response.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>Lithium is an extraordinarily important therapeutic drug in the clinical management of patients suffering from bipolar disorder. However, a significant proportion of patients, 30–40 %, fail to respond, and there is currently no method to identify the good lithium responders before initiation of treatment. Converging evidence suggests that genetic factors play a strong role in the variation of response to lithium, but only a few genes have been tested and the samples have largely been retrospective or quite small. The current study will collect an entirely unique sample of 700 patients with bipolar disorder to be stabilized on lithium monotherapy and followed for up to 2 years. This study will produce useful information to improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of lithium and will add to the development of a method to predict individual response to lithium, thereby accelerating recovery and reducing suffering and cost.</p>

                <title>Clinical presentation and treatment of bipolar disorder</title>
                <p>Bipolar disorder is a major psychiatric disorder described by alternations between the extreme mood states of mania and depression and characterized by episodic relapses and chronic disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Bipolar disorder affects approximately 1 % of the population worldwide. It is a major cause of hospitalizations and healthcare expenditures, as well as suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
                <p>While there is no cure for bipolar disorder, it is a highly treatable and manageable illness. After an accurate diagnosis, most people (80–90 %) can achieve substantial stabilization of their mood and related symptoms with proper treatment. Medications known as mood stabilizers are usually prescribed to help control bipolar disorder. These are used both in the acute treatment of episodes and as maintenance treatment to prevent new episodes. The medications are in general effective in both the manic and depressive phases of the illness, hence the term mood stabilizer. However, in practice, these medications tend to be more effective against acute mania than acute depression.</p>
                <p>The action of lithium as a mood stabilizer was first identified by John Cade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since that time, it has remained the standard against which other medications are compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several different types of mood stabilizers are available in addition to lithium. These include some, but not all, anticonvulsants such as valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprizole and quetiapine also have demonstrated efficacy as mood stabilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p>Though there are now many effective mood stabilizers, lithium has remained the treatment of choice for bipolar disorder. Although lithium is effective in the majority of patients, 30–40 % fail to respond. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients cannot be maintained on lithium because of intolerable side effects such as weight gain, acne, thyroid suppression, and renal impairment. In recent years, clinical data have demonstrated that valproic acid, lamotrigine, olanzapine and other medications may have comparable efficacy to lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, these novel mood stabilizers have been thought to have a more benign side effect profile and to be better tolerated by patients. For these reasons, valproic acid, lamotrigine, olanzapine, aripiprizole, and quetiapine have begun to supplant lithium as the most frequently prescribed medication for bipolar disorder. However, the cost of treatment with these newer agents is in excess of 10 times higher than that of lithium ($60/mo for valproic acid vs. $15/mo for olanzapine vs. $1/mo for lithium). Also, other recent clinical studies, such as the BALANCE trial, have demonstrated superior overall efficacy of lithium for relapse prevention in comparison to valproate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, a subset of patients do extremely well on lithium and have excellent control of episodes with few, if any, side effects.</p>
                <p>As detailed below, a variety of data argue that good lithium responders constitute a clinically and genetically distinct group. As there is currently no method to identify this subset of lithium responders, lithium is being used less frequently despite the fact that many patients would respond very well to it. Furthermore, many patients who might have been excellent lithium responders are never able to benefit from lithium treatment because lithium is never tried. Development of a method to predict individual response to lithium before initiation of treatment would, therefore, be of great benefit to clinicians in making prescribing decisions and in accelerating recovery and reducing cost.</p>

                <title>Predictors of response</title>
                <p>A variety of clinical and biological predictors, as well as genetic data, suggest that lithium-responsive bipolar disorder may comprise a mechanistically distinct form of illness.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Clinical predictors</title>
                  <p>A recent scholarly review of the various predictors of good and poor outcome following long-term treatment with lithium proposes a useful nomenclature that classifies these predictors according to category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Psychopathological predictors of good response include initial good response within 6–12 months (highly reliable), classic euphoric/elated mania, positive family history of bipolar disorder with a good response to lithium in particular, the absence of a personality disorder, bipolar I disorder (as opposed to type II), the mania-depression-euthymic pattern of illness course, the presence of melancholic features during depressive episodes, and early onset of lithium therapy. Predictors of poor response in this category included mixed episodes (highly reliable), rapid cycling, mood incongruent psychotic symptoms, onset before the age of 18, high numbers of lifetime mood episodes, and the depression-mania-euthymia pattern of illness course. The most highly replicated environmental predictor is that of being single, not married.</p>

                  <title>Biological predictors</title>
                  <p>Biological predictors of good response to lithium include high RBC/plasma-lithium ratio (highly controversial), higher platelet serotonin-induced calcium mobilization, and high rate of red blood cell membrane phospholipids in lithium intracellular transport. Neurophysiologic predictors of good response include brain lithium concentrations above 0.2 mEq/L when measured by 7Li-MRS, decreased cerebral intracellular pH, white matter hyperintensity at (31)P-MRS, and high intensity of loudness dependent auditory evoked potentials. Neurophysiologic predictors of poor response have included epileptiform anomalies with diffuse theta waves on EEG and decreased cerebral phosphocreatinine levels at (31)P-MRS. Genetic predictors of good response include lower inositol monophosphatase mRNA expression and a high frequency of phospholipase C isoenzyme gamma-1. Genetic predictors of poor response include homozygotic forms of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), the presence of the A/A subtype of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), and a high frequency of human leukocyte antigens type A3 (HLA-A3).</p>

                <title>Mechanism of action of lithium</title>
                <p>A major challenge in the discovery of genes for mood stabilizer response is the lack of understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and the mechanism of action of the existing medications. Lithium, as the oldest mood stabilizer, has received the most attention in terms of its mechanism of action. A variety of protein targets and signal transduction processes have been reported to be inhibited by lithium. Therefore, the challenge has been determining which of these mechanisms are therapeutically important. Some of the earliest studies reported that cAMP generation in response to adrenaline was inhibited by lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Early on the theme began to emerge that inhibition of both sides of systems in balance led to an overall stabilization and reduced biochemical swings that might in turn underlie behavioral swings. One of the first such observations was that cAMP and cGMP production by norepinephrine and epinephrine, respectively, were both inhibited by lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lithium was also later reported by the same group to inhibit both adrenergic- and cholinergic-induced GTP binding in rat brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. G proteins as a target of lithium received further support with the observation that lithium inhibits expression of the gene for Gαi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and that it inhibits the action of Gαs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>The inositol signaling pathway has also been a major focus of lithium studies. In response to receptor stimulation, phospholipase C (PLC) breaks down phosphotidyl inositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These products act as intracellular signaling molecules triggering the release of calcium from intracellular stores and activating protein kinase C (PKC). Inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and inositol polyphosphatase (IPPase) then dephosphorylate IP3 and IP2 and recycle free inositol to the membrane. Lithium has been observed to inhibit IMP and IPP, leading to the hypothesis that lithium treatment leads to a depletion of free inositol, thereby inhibiting this signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p>Protein kinase C is a downstream target of phosphoinositide signaling that has received extensive attention. PKC activity has been shown to be reduced by lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has been reported to be elevated in mania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. At doses adequate to inhibit PKC, tamoxifen has been shown to have anti-manic properties clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Lithium also reduces the levels of a major substrate of PKC, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>The profound effects of lithium on morphogenesis in Drosophila led to a novel hypothesis of lithium’s mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Wnt signaling proteins bind to transmembrane <italic>frizzled</italic> receptors and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) via <italic>disheveled</italic>. This inhibition in turn promotes the stabilization of β-catenin. Lithium was shown to inhibit GSK3β and thereby mimic the effect of wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lastly, the most recent and novel proposed mechanism of action of lithium involves neuroprotection. Lithium has been shown to protect neuronal cultures from glutamate-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Lithium has also been shown to increase expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The neuroprotective effect of lithium may also be mediated by stimulating the phosphorylation of Akt-1 by phosphoinositide kinase (PI3-K), which in turn phosphorylates GSK3β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This process may inhibit the pro-apoptotic action of GSK3β.</p>

                <title>Lithium-mediated gene expression</title>
                <p>There are likely hundreds if not thousands of genes that are modulated in some way by lithium. Data have been emerging for the past several years that clearly demonstrate lithium-mediated gene expression changes. Bosetti et al. reported changes in the expression of a variety of genes in response to lithium, including those from signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The study of a larger gene array with 39,000 transcripts in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported 4,474 genes with nominally significant expression changes and 121 with a stringent Bonferroni correction. There were 13 genes affiliated with phosphotidylinositol metabolism, again consistent with the cell signaling pathway hypothesis. One of the more comprehensive studies reported to date used a human neuronal cell line (SK-N-AS), and they reported 347 upregulated and 324 downregulated genes, from 3 primary pathways: the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, an actin cytoskeleton pathway and a calcium signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
                <p>Expression patterns of micro RNAs (miRNA) in the hippocampus of rats have shown that lithium and valproate both decreased the expression of several miRNAs considered candidates for bipolar disorder; including the pathways involving Wnt/βcatenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A study of miRNA in lymphoblastoid cell lines found increased expression when exposed to lithium, with a clear variation in expression patterns with time, reflecting the dynamic biological system wherein gene expression is unlikely to be static [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>

                <p>There is much evidence to suggest that genetic factors play a strong role in the variation in response to lithium. Several studies have indicated that lithium-responsive patients are more likely to have a stronger family history of bipolar disorder than lithium non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Mendlewicz et al. have reported better lithium prophylaxis in concordant bipolar twin pairs than in discordant pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Grof et al. have shown that affected relatives of lithium-responsive bipolar probands are more likely to also be lithium responsive than the relatives of non-lithium-responsive probands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Based on the idea that lithium-responsive bipolar disorder is a distinct genetic subtype, several studies have focused on this phenotype for mapping genes for bipolar disorder. Turecki et al. have reported a genome scan of such families with significant evidence of linkage to a locus on 15q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Two studies have reported association of the gene PLCG1 to lithium-responsive bipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Two specific genes have been reported to be associated with response to lithium in a comparison of responders and non-responders: the serotonin transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and inositol polyphophatase (INPP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. One GWAS has been performed on a subset of the STEP-BD sample including 359 bipolar I or bipolar II patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The strongest region was on 10p15 (<italic>p</italic> = 10-7), and the gene GRIA2 also showed some evidence for association.</p>

                <title>Neurocognitive assessment</title>
                <p>Neurocognition will be assessed for several reasons. Bipolar subjects with cognitive deficits may comprise a distinct group with a different disease mechanism. If this is the case, neurocognitive measures may correlate with response and serve as an endophenotype for response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], substantially increasing the power to detect genes. Another reason has to do with side effects. Not only are such deficits part of the core bipolar phenotype, they may also be induced by medications. Cognitive slowing is a not uncommon side effect for many mood stabilizers. Testing may enable us to determine if these are markers for response, side effects or relapse, and if they are associated with specific genes.</p>
                <p>Based on a review of previous published data on cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder and the heritabilities of several neurocognitive measures, our overall assessment strategy will focus on a brief measurement of three domains: attention, verbal learning, and executive function.

                <p>There is emerging consensus that compounds that possess relapse and recurrence prevention efficacy in bipolar disorder stabilize mood by different mechanisms. Compounds that stabilize mood from both above and below baseline are viewed as having bimodal efficacy, e.g., they are able to delay or prevent both depressive and manic episodes. Those that stabilize mood by delaying or preventing episodes from below baseline are described as having the ability to delay or prevent depressive episodes without causing treatment-emergent mania, whereas those that stabilize mood from above baseline are believed to delay or prevent manic episodes without causing treatment-emergent depression. To identify pharmacogenetic predictors of spectrum of efficacy by mood state, the following definitions of relapse will be used:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Manic Relapse will be defined as patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for a manic episode but not a major depressive episode.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Depressive Relapse will be defined as patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode but not mania or hypomania.

After generating a filtered dataset, we will examine Q-Q plots of association statistics with case-control status defined by good versus poor responders in order to look for systematic deviations from expectation that may further reflect artefacts in the data. Through these procedures, we will generate a final, cleaned dataset for the downstream analyses. Notable findings will all be reviewed in further detail as a final quality control check to confirm that they are not due to artefacts of low MAF, low genotyping completeness, batch or laboratory effects, or population stratification. In addition, we will visually examine the actual intensity plots of the individual best SNPs to confirm the quality of the genotype calls and ensure there is no evidence of systematic error that might lead to spurious results.</p>

                <p>where h(t) is the hazard of relapse at time (t) and the time axis is defined as the time from stabilization on drug to either clinical relapse, censoring due to loss to follow-up or discontinuation of study medication, or the end of the follow-up period. This model is semi-parametric in that the baseline hazard of relapse can take any form, but the covariates enter the model linearly and are assumed to have constant relative hazard over the entire time period. This assumption of constant relative hazard over time can be evaluated (and remedied if needed) by including in the model interactions terms between the covariate of interest and time. Building on this framework, we will test in separate models whether the SNPs identified in the ConLIGen Retrospective Study are significantly associated with the relative hazard of clinical relapse. We will include in the models covariates for age, sex, clinical site, and up to 10 quantitative indices of ancestry (if preliminary analyses of the genetic data suggest evidence of population stratification in the sample) to control for the potential confounding effects on these associations. We will also be able to include a covariate for an indicator variable capturing whether the patient entered the prospective study already on lithium as allowed by the protocol in order to control for this as well as to test whether associations differ for these versus other patients.</p>
                <p>We will also examine repeated quantitative measures of depressive or manic symptoms taken at regular intervals over the period of follow-up. This will address the number of symptoms subjects continued to suffer even when they were considered in remission. For the repeated measures analyses, we will use longitudinal data methods to associate SNPs with differences in symptom measures over time. In particular, we will use linear regression models with general estimating equations (GEE) to account for the correlation engendered by repeated measures on the same participants. We will explore the repeated measures data to diagnose the nature of this correlation and then treat it as a nuisance variable in the model. We will then test whether the SNPs identified in the Retrospective Study or other retrospective datasets (ConLiGen) are significantly associated with differences in mean scores on the measures of depressive or manic symptoms, controlling for time of assessment, age, sex, clinical site, and the same quantitative indices of ancestry as the in the Cox model if deemed necessary. We will further explore for possible interactions between the SNP and time to test whether the effect of the SNP on depressive or manic symptoms changes over time.</p>
                <p>To determine whether the effects of SNPs found to be associated with response in these analyses are specific to lithium treatment, we will use two strategies. First, in the time to event and repeated measures analyses described above, we will examine whether the inclusion of a covariate describing prior disease episode frequency affects the estimated association between SNPs and clinical relapse and/or symptom differences. If the estimated association is mitigated, this will suggest that the SNPs are associated with the natural course of disease in general. If, however, the estimated association persists, this will suggest that the association is specific to lithium responsiveness. To further confirm this possibility, we will examine the data from the Depakote arm of the Prospective Study. We will test whether the identified SNPs predict clinical relapse or symptom differences among patients who are crossed over to Depakote. If they are not associated, this will suggest the variants are associated specifically with lithium responsiveness.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Based upon the well-established clinical efficacy of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder, we present here the study protocol of a large, multicenter prospective study designed to identify genetic predictors of good lithium response. The study is an 11-site open non-randomized trial of 700 Bipolar I patients treated with lithium monotherapy and followed for up 2 years. The long-range goal of the study is to better understand lithium’s mechanism of action and to develop a possible DNA test panel that will aid physicians in medication selection.</p>
              <p>During the study development, the following factors were considered:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Prospective vs retrospective. Almost all previous studies of lithium response have been done using standardized chart review and retrospective response data, which has the advantage of surveying the subject’s entire lifetime experience on lithium. However, it suffers the serious disadvantages of poor recall, state-related recall, lack of monotherapy (in general), qualitative instead of quantitative data and lack of observer ratings. For these reasons, we chose a prospective design. Though the much greater effort and expense will only allow for smaller sample sizes, we deemed the accuracy and superiority of the data to be the more important factors. This sample may serve as a “gold standard” sample for future studies, especially for replication of results.</p></list-item><list-item><p>How many mood stabilizers to study? We considered a design where subjects would be randomized between lithium and two other mood stabilizers such as lamotrigine or valproate. Though this design would have given us invaluable comparative information, we chose instead to have a larger sample size and better statistical power for one drug, lithium. The crossover of lithium failures to valproate provides some opportunity for comparison.</p></list-item><list-item><p>How to distinguish gene effects from natural course? If a genetic variant shows association to response, how do we know that this reflects the subject’s response to lithium vs. simply the natural course of the illness? Specifically, how do we know that a SNP is associated to lithium response or simply rapid cycling and is unrelated to drug? The scientifically ideal design would be to include a placebo arm as a control for natural course. However, given the severity of bipolar disorder, we deemed it neither ethical nor feasible to include such an arm. Instead, we have employed a detailed collection of information about lifetime cycling to covary for this effect. Of note, in the Perlis et al. study of lithium response in the STEP-BD sample, a similar inclusion of rapid cycling as a covariate had no effect on the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Monotherapy. Though perhaps a therapeutic ideal, monotherapy using any drug is not usually achieved in the management of bipolar disorder. However, if we allowed multiple drugs, then we would remain unclear as to which drug was driving the response and to which drug a genetic variant is associated. For these reasons, we chose to require monotherapy, though it excludes partial responders and the generalizability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Acute vs prophylactic response. A shorter and faster study might have focused on the acute response to lithium in treatment of depression, mania or mixed states. However, the most widely used application for lithium is prophylaxis, and by studying relapse prevention we focus on the greatest clinical utility. Most patients also enter the study on other medications and the acute stabilization period is confounded by these other medications and the changes in medications during this period</p></list-item><list-item><p>Duration of follow up. Twenty-four months of follow up was selected because the STEP-BD study showed that, at 2 years, about 50 % of treated bipolar I patients had relapsed. Two years was therefore selected to maximize power.</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p>In summary, only a limited investigation has been made of this area. Generally only a few genes have been tested and samples are largely retrospective. STEP-BD is the only truly prospective study, yet only about 200 subjects achieved monotherapy; other results are confounded by concomitant meds. There is a need for larger, better characterized samples and a more systematic approach to this area.</p>
