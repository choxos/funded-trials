Barriers to engagement included not needing or desiring assistance, participants perceiving that offered assistance was not relevant to their needs or that they would not qualify, competing priorities/forgetting, previous negative experiences or stigma, and technology or access challenges (online self-navigation group). Preferences around offered assistance that directly addressed barriers to uptake included changing messaging and framing around offered help and the ability to tailor modalities.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P5">Increasing recognition of the impact of health-related social needs (e.g., housing, food, transportation insecurities, medical debt) on health outcomes by payers, policy makers, and delivery systems has led to a burgeoning investment in the integration of social care into medical care. This issue is especially salient to diabetes where social risks persist as key reasons why &gt;31% of people with diabetes do not meet target goals for glycemic control or blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Models for social care assistance vary widely, from screening modality to whether screening is patient administered or administered by providers/staff and to the intensity of offered interventions. Assistance may range from more passive models such as providing patients a list of resources to more intensive in-person navigation and longitudinal follow-up to self-navigation approaches through mobile application or web-based methods.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P6">Despite the widespread availability of such social care assistance models, upward of half of patients screening positive for social risks either decline assistance or do not follow-up with offered resources.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Reasons include patients not perceiving a need for resources or feeling that offered resources would not be helpful, difficulty in navigating resources, being overwhelmed, competing priorities, not remembering receiving the information, stigma, and previous negative experiences with social care assistance.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P7">Little is known about how reasons for declining social care assistance may vary by the type of assistance offered. This mixed-methods study examined motivators, barriers, and preferences regarding the use of social care assistance utilizing data from a large-scale RCT investigating 2 modalities of assistance among people with poorly controlled diabetes: guided online self-navigation and in-person assistance.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="S6">
              <title>METHODS</title>
              <p id="P8">This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed method design<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> such that data from surveys informed sampling for subsequent qualitative interviews to gain a richer understanding of the quantitative findings and participant experiences surrounding the uptake of social care assistance. Study design, sampling, and qualitative data collection were guided by a phenomenological approach to better understand the phenomenon of engaging or not engaging with offered assistance.</p>
              <sec id="S7">
                <title>Study Sample</title>
                <p id="P9">Data came from a 6-month follow-up assessment of participants in an RCT evaluating the approaches to addressing social risks among people with poorly controlled diabetes. All study procedures were approved by the University of Michigan IRB. Potential participants meeting the following criteria were identified through the University of Michigan’s Diabetes Research Registry<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and electronic health record: (1) aged 18–75 years; (2) diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with prescribed medication; (3) has HbA1c ≥7.5% within the past 6 months; (4) has a positive screen for at least 1 social risk, including financial burden, food insecurity, and/or cost-related medication nonadherence; and (5) has mobile phone access. Exclusion criteria included significant cognitive impairment and active participation in another diabetes-related research study.</p>
                <p id="P10">Data analyses were conducted on a subset of participants recruited for the RCT. For the RCT, a total of 5,451 potential participants were contacted between June 2019 and September 2021; 893 were confirmed eligible. Of those, 522 (58%) consented to participate and were randomized to 1 of 2 study arms as follows:</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p id="P11">Guided online self-navigation provided login information for CareAvenue, an interactive website that builds participants’ capacity to address financial strain and other social risks while managing diabetes.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The website provides step-by-step guidance on navigating a set of low-cost resources on the basis of identified needs. Participants also received weekly interactive voice response calls and text messages to encourage the use of resources and provide support for diabetes self-management.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p id="P12">In-person assistance provided contact information for the Guest Assistance Program (GAP). GAP social workers provide assistance and resources for medical and nonmedical needs to patients receiving care within the local health system. Participants were responsible for reaching out to GAP. Participants received text messages to support diabetes self-management but only received GAP contact information once to minimize contamination as the active control arm of the larger RCT.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p id="P13">Of 522 participants randomized, 307 (59%) completed 6-month follow-up surveys and were included in this study. A total of 71 participants were lost to follow-up (not reachable [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=15], passed away [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=3], and withdrew from the study [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=53]). Those who withdrew were more likely to be younger, have fewer social risks, have fewer chronic conditions, and to have been living longer with diabetes. Attrition was significantly different between the 2 study arms (guided-self navigation [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=51], in-person assistance [<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=20]).</p>
                <p id="P14">Telephone surveys were administered by trained research staff at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive subsample of participants to further explore quantitative survey findings.</p>

                <p id="P18">Semistructured interviews were conducted with 40 participants who completed 6-month follow-up surveys between July 2020 and April 2021. Participants were sampled on the basis of reported engagement/nonengagement within each arm at 6-month follow-up, attempting to balance across strata. Interview guides were developed through an iterative process. Domains included previous experience with social care assistance, reactions to social care assistance offered during the study, motivators and barriers to following up with recommended resources, and preferences to improve acceptability and/or engagement with offered assistance. Telephone interviews were conducted by research staff experienced in qualitative methods and lasted approximately 30–45 minutes.</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p id="P22">A total of 307 participants completed 6-month follow-up interviews during the study period: guided self-navigation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=137) and in-person assistance (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=170). The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants are presented in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Participants randomized to both modalities were comparable on key sociodemographic characteristics.</p>
              <p id="P23">A total of 42% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=130) of the participants engaged with offered assistance (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=106 guided self-navigation arm; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=24 in-person assistance). A total of 77% of the participants in the guided self-navigation group (106 of 137) engaged with assistance, compared with 14% (24 of 170) of participants in the in-person assistance group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001). In the guided self-navigation group, higher educational attainment (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001) and higher health literacy (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.05) were seen among those who engaged. For in-person assistance, females (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.05) and participants with a greater number of social risks (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.01) were more likely to engage. Of those in the guided self-navigation group who engaged with assistance, 85% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=90 of 106) followed up with resources recommended through the online platform, compared with 33% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=8 of 24) participants in the in-person assistance group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&lt;0.001). However, among participants in the in-person assistance group who engaged with assistance, only 38% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=9 of 24) received a referral to other programs/services for support; of those, 89% (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=8 of 9) followed up with the referral. In interviews, participants in the in-person assistance group who did not receive a referral stated that they either did not qualify for assistance or the offered resources did not apply to their needs. In 1 instance, a participant explained that they did not personally receive a referral because they did not need the resources but passed referral information on to a family member.</p>
              <p id="P24">The qualitative sample included 40 participants: engaged with guided self-navigation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=16), nonengaged with guided self-navigation (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=2), engaged with in-person assistance (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=6), and nonengaged with in-person assistance (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>=16).</p>
              <p id="P25">Motivators for engaging with offered social care assistance are presented in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The most prevalent reasons for following up with offered assistance for both guided self-navigation and in-person assistance, which were also prominent in qualitative data, were that offered assistance addressed 1 or more needs (50%–75%) and that participants were interested in learning more about available resources (50%–66%). Ease of accessing each type of assistance also facilitated engagement (25%–38%).</p>
              <p id="P26">Barriers to engaging with offered social care assistance are presented in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A substantial proportion of participants in both the in-person assistance and online navigation groups indicated that they either did not need or were not interested in assistance (27%–38%) or that they did not think the resources would be helpful (14%). Participants also noted in interviews that offered assistance was not relevant to their needs, that they were already aware of resources being offered, or that they felt able to navigate the needed resources on their own. However, several participants who did not engage with assistance indicated that they kept the information in case they needed assistance in the future.</p>
              <p id="P27">Another prominent barrier to engagement revealed in qualitative data and, to a lesser extent, in quantitative data was stigma or embarrassment associated with contacting assistance, particularly among those offered in-person assistance. Some participants overcame this barrier and engaged with offered assistance despite noting unease. For others, previous experiences of judgment and loss of dignity were an insurmountable barrier to engagement. One participant specifically identified that pride kept them from contacting offered in-person assistance despite having unmet needs, continuing “I know I’m poor, but mentally I refuse to be poor.” Another participant formerly told by a social worker that they were too proud stated, “we have to change the attitude of the so-called helpers… if they change their attitude, maybe I’ll go. But I’m not going to put myself through that again.” A third participant described dehumanizing assumptions people made when they had previously sought assistance, stating “just because my hair is clean, I’m dressed in clean clothes, I’m driving a halfway decent car, you make the judgment that I don’t have a need. Well, I had a life before I had the need.” Other participants did not engage with assistance because they did not feel that they had “enough” need and were concerned about taking resources away from others in worse need.</p>
              <p id="P28">Further reasons participants did not engage with assistance that emerged in both quantitative and qualitative data included competing priorities (16%), lack of time (13%–23%), and, particularly for the in-person assistance group, not remembering receiving information about the resource (13%). Technology-based challenges also presented a barrier to participants in the guided self-navigation group. A substantial proportion of participants who did not use the online platform noted that they either did not have internet access (20%) or a computer (3%), could not figure out how to log into the website (27%), or had other technical difficulties associated with the platform.</p>
              <p id="P29">Another common barrier related to challenges in qualifying for resources. A number of participants did not engage because past experiences led them to believe that they would not qualify for the needed assistance. Several participants specifically described being ineligible for assistance because they were just above the poverty line. Some who had previously had negative experiences with social care assistance but were willing to re-engage with offered assistance through this study found themselves again denied needed services.</p>
              <p id="P30">Participants expressed a range of preferences around messaging and framing for offered assistance (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Participants noted that information should be framed in a respectful and nonintrusive manner, provide clarity around offered services and eligibility, and be presented in a way that supports behavior change.</p>
              <p id="P31">There were notable differences around how participants preferred to receive offered assistance, which did not always align with the mode of assistance to which they were randomized. Some indicated that they were more likely to engage with offered assistance if it came from their physician, whereas others preferred online modalities. Others expressed desiring more personalized outreach from a live person, including direct assistance in navigating resources.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P32">Patient interest in and engagement with social care assistance were identified through 2 modalities: guided online self-navigation and in-person assistance. Fewer than half of participants engaged with offered assistance, although engagement was substantially higher for guided self-navigation than for in-person assistance. Motivators and barriers to engagement were largely similar for both modalities. Common motivators for uptake of offered assistance across modalities included ease of use, anticipating that assistance could address 1 or more needs, and interest in learning more about the available resources. Although all participants screened positive for 1 or more social risks, a substantial proportion stated that they did not engage with offered modalities because they either did not need or were not interested in the assistance. Barriers to engagement, aligned with previous work,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> included participants perceiving that offered assistance was not relevant to their needs or that they would not qualify, feeling able to navigate resources on their own, stigma and/or previous negative experiences with social care assistance, competing priorities, and technological or access challenges. Preferences around offered assistance included suggested changes to messaging and framing and the ability to tailor how assistance is delivered.</p>
              <p id="P33">The study’s findings of noted discordance between patients screening positive for social risk and interest in offered assistance is consistent with findings of previous research.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To the investigators’ knowledge, this is the first study to specifically compare interest in assistance between 2 distinct modalities (in-person versus guided online assistance) as well as differences across modalities in both motivators and barriers to engagement. This study also included patients from a range of income levels, with nearly three quarters reporting income above 200% of the federal poverty level, compared with the findings of work examining interest in offered social care assistance focused on predominantly lower-income populations.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The fact that the study population, all of whom screened positive for at least 1 financial-related social risk, overall had relatively high income underscores the findings of previous work that experiences of financial hardship are not limited only to those with low income, particularly among individuals with chronic health conditions.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P34">Reports of not needing assistance despite a positive screen may be explained, in part, by how social risk screening is conducted. As De Marchis et al. note, positive screens are often inappropriately used to diagnose social needs rather than prompting further assessment.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> They additionally discuss that there may be a threshold at which people perceive that assistance is warranted for an identified risk—consistent with this study’s finding that some participants felt that they did not have enough need—and some instruments have long lookback periods such that positive screens may not reflect a current concern.</p>
              <p id="P35">Competing priorities as a prominent barrier to assistance uptake further highlight the need to understand individual context. Patient-centered engagement from screening through offering of assistance, including verifying the relevance of identified risk(s) and establishing salience, is likely critical to supporting follow-up and uptake of offered assistance. Although the rates of engagement were far lower for the in-person assistance group, this may have been due in part to differences in how the modalities were offered in the context of this RCT. Participants randomized to in-person assistance (active control) received assistance information only once, whereas those randomized to guided online assistance received weekly text messages encouraging them to log onto the platform. Follow-up reminders may have both facilitated engagement and ensured that participants did not forget about assistance information, a barrier noted for the in-person assistance arm in this study and other social care interventions.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P36">Reports of stigma as a barrier to engagement were less frequently reported among participants randomized to guided online assistance, which may reflect that an online platform allows a greater degree of perceived anonymity or privacy. A substantial proportion of participants across both groups did not engage owing to past negative experiences with social care assistance, including denial of services, challenges in getting help, and experiences of being treated poorly. Experiences of participants who were again denied services during this study may well have implications for their willingness to engage with future social care assistance.</p>
              <p id="P37">For those randomized to online self-navigation, technology challenges were a notable barrier to uptake. Technology platforms have been on the rise as a way for people to identify and navigate social care resources independently.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Although smartphone and broadband access is high in the U.S.,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> a digital divide remains regarding the ability, both technical and financial, to make full use of the technology available.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Taken together with this study’s finding that there are pronounced differences around how people prefer to receive offered assistance (e.g., online modalities, personalized outreach), there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
              <sec id="S12">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="P38">There are limitations to this study that should be noted. Participants were recruited from an ongoing RCT during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the study faced challenges with recruitment owing to institutional pauses in research. This study’s sampling for qualitative interviews was contingent on rolling enrollment in the study and subsequent completion of 6-month follow-up surveys. Owing to uneven distribution of participants eligible for interviews across groups of interest, it was difficult to recruit the target number of interview participants in some of the predefined strata. Despite imbalances in sample size, saturation was reached for 3 of the 4 groups. Although similar themes emerged across interviews in the nonengaged self-navigation group, saturation may not have been reached, which may limit the interpretation of these findings. The pandemic may have also influenced behavior and engagement with social care assistance compared with what may have occurred outside of a pandemic. Furthermore, this study’s findings may be subject to recall bias given that surveys and interviews took place 6 months after participants were offered social care assistance and were limited to self-report data for comparability between modalities. Participants were also randomized to assistance arms, therefore assigned modalities may not have aligned with individual preferences. Both modalities also had varying levels of reminders and prompts, which may limit the generalizability of findings. Finally, this was a sample of people with diabetes and poor glycemic control from a single health system, also limiting generalizability.</p>
                <p id="P39">Despite limitations, these findings have important implications for research and practice. There is a critical need to fill evidence gaps around social and medical care integration, including psychometric validity of screening instruments, which may directly impact how results are interpreted and acted on. Approaches to support the uptake of assistance should be grounded in behavior change theory and strategies, include an awareness of the influence of previous experiences with social care assistance, support heterogeneous preferences, and reflect patient centeredness. More research is needed to establish evidence-based best practices for how interventions can be tailored to better reach those who may otherwise not engage with offered resources.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p id="P40">Among people with diabetes who endorsed social risks, a number of barriers prevented engagement with offered social care assistance, ranging from previous negative experiences and stigma to not feeling that offered assistance was needed. Participants also expressed diverse preferences around how they would like to receive social care assistance. Strategies to increase engagement with offered resources need to be mindful of both individual- and population-specific barriers and ideally provide multiple options for how assistance is offered to improve the efficacy and reach of social care interventions.</p>
