                <p id="P3">A genetic etiology is identified for one third of congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, including 8% attributable to coding <italic>de novo</italic> variants (DNVs). To assess the contribution of noncoding DNVs to CHD, we compared genome sequences from 749 CHD probands and their parents with 1,611 unaffected trios. Neural network prediction of noncoding DNV transcriptional impact identified a burden of DNVs in CHD (<italic>n</italic> = 2,238 DNVs) compared to controls (<italic>n</italic> = 4,177; <italic>P</italic> = 8.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Independent analyses of enhancers showed excess DNVs in associated genes (27 genes vs. 3.7 expected, <italic>P</italic> = 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). We observed significant overlap between these transcription-based approaches (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.0, <italic>P</italic> = 5.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). CHD DNVs altered transcription levels in five of 31 enhancers assayed. Finally, we observed DNV burden in RNA-binding protein regulatory sites (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.1–1.2, <italic>P</italic> = 8.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). Our findings demonstrate an enrichment of potentially disruptive regulatory noncoding DNVs in a fraction of CHD at least as high as observed for damaging coding DNVs.</p>

            <p id="P4">Congenital heart disease (CHD), which occurs in 1% of live births, has seen marked improvements in survival with modern surgical and medical management<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The decrease in infant mortality has increased CHD prevalence in older individuals and exposed co-morbidities impairing quality of life and life expectancy. Elucidation of CHD etiologies may improve outcomes, so the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC) recruited &gt;13,000 patients and utilized whole exome sequencing (WES) and chromosome microarrays to study CHD genetic architecture. Our analyses identified damaging rare transmitted and <italic>de novo</italic> variants (DNVs) in 8% of sporadic CHD (including 28% of syndromic and 3% of isolated CHD)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Many DNVs identified in CHD patients alter proteins functioning in chromatin modification, regulation of transcription, and RNA processing<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p id="P5">Based on these findings, we hypothesized that additional CHD causes may reside in noncoding elements functional during cardiac development. To explore that, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) in 763 CHD trios comprised of affected probands and unaffected parents and in 1,611 child-parent trios without CHD. First, 14 CHD probands with previously undetected likely causal genetic variants were identified; then, we compared noncoding DNVs using three approaches in the remaining cohort. Two strategies focused on cardiac gene regulatory elements, using a neural network model predicting variant-level resolution functional impact and by analyzing multiple DNVs in genes with human fetal heart enhancers overlapping cardiomyocyte differentiation open chromatin. We identified significant overlap between results from these complementary approaches and confirmed differences on transcription activity for 5 of 31 variants tested. Our third strategy, which interrogated RNA processing, found significant enrichment of noncoding DNVs in cases. Finally, we observed potentially contributory noncoding DNVs in isolated CHD probands as well as those with neurodevelopmental delays or extracardiac anomalies, suggesting varying degrees of cardiac specificity. Taken together, these results demonstrate a noncoding DNV contribution to CHD mediated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory effects on cardiac development.</p>

We developed HeartENN (Heart Effect Neural Network, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), an extension of DeepSEA<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, which predicts molecular effect differences between any two alleles for every regulatory feature using convolutional neural networks. Another DeepSEA extension successfully identified noncoding DNV enrichment in autism<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. HeartENN was trained on 1,000-bp genomic sequence context with the same 184 cardiac noncoding regulatory features used for previous region-based burden tests, but not those used for subsequent multiple-hit analysis (see <xref rid="S14" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 7</xref>). Aside from using cardiac epigenomic training data and extending to mouse features, HeartENN is similar to DeepSEA. The HeartENN mean receiver operator characteristic area-under-the-curves (ROC AUCs) for mouse and human features were 0.9 and 0.85, respectively, similar to DeepSEA ROC AUCs; the area under the precision-recall curves were also comparable (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4</xref>). Beyond restricting to heart-related features, we defined no other CHD relevance hypotheses. The maximum functional difference score observed in any feature was assigned to each DNV (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>).</p>

Pathogenic variants, but not polymorphisms, had an excess of DeepSEA scores ≥ 0.1 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). Lacking an equivalent dataset of CHD noncoding variants to evaluate HeartENN, we compared the DeepSEA and HeartENN null distributions. After randomly down-sampling DeepSEA to match the number of HeartENN annotations and applying HGMD polymorphism scores, we observed similar null distributions for HeartENN and DeepSEA (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).

We, like others<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, observed a lack of significant findings across broad noncoding annotation categories. By contrast, our alternative interrogation of noncoding variants implicated noncoding DNVs in CHD pathogenesis.</p>
              <p id="P29">HeartENN, which provided variant-level scores, similar to the multifaceted DeepSEA algorithm that uncovered noncoding DNVs in autism<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, defined significantly more DNVs in CHD probands. Separate analyses of prioritized human fetal heart enhancers identified distinct and some overlapping DNVs in CHD cases. Notably, functional assays were positive when these two strategies were combined. Although there was no transcriptional regulatory category-wide burden, we observed Bonferroni-significant category-wide burden among heart-transcribed RBP binding sites. These data implicate noncoding DNVs in CHD at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory levels. Our ability to detect signals was strongly influenced by availability of cardiovascular development noncoding genomic data, allowing us a narrow search space for DNV interrogation.</p>
              <p id="P30">Through the two cardiac regulatory element strategies and their significant overlapping results, we identified known and potential human CHD genes. HeartENN-damaging variants were enriched for known human CHD genes (e.g., <italic>GATA4</italic>, <italic>OFD1</italic>), but there was little concordance between observed and reported cardiac/extracardiac phenotype constellations. Only one of seven genes identified with both approaches is implicated in heart development: <italic>COL1A2</italic> encodes a collagen highly expressed in developing cardiac valves<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>, and all seven probands with noncoding <italic>COL1A2</italic> DNVs had pulmonary and/or aortic valve abnormalities. Whether the other overlapping genes represent novel CHD genes or poor understanding of noncoding DNVs’ genic regulation remains uncertain.

              <p id="P31">Among 31 DNV-containing sequences functionally tested in iPSC-CMs, five (16%) significantly altered transcription. While that rate is consistent with bioinformatic enrichment analyses, there are reasons to consider this a lower bound. The sequences were only tested in fetal cardiomyocytes at two time points using minimal promoters not in their native genomic context. Oligogenetic effects were not modeled in this functional assay. Genes associated with the five positive DNVs provide clues regarding CHD causality. <italic>JPH2</italic> encodes junctophlilin-2, a membrane protein necessary for T-tubule formation, for which an N-terminal cleavage fragment modulates MEF2-mediated gene transcription, altering ERK and TGF-β signaling<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. <italic>SEMA4B</italic> is in the top quartile for developing heart gene expression and encodes a semaphorin that signals through plexin receptors.

              <p id="P32">Our cohort was selected for WES-negative trios and higher paternal age to increase statistical power to identify a noncoding and <italic>de novo</italic> signal, respectively. Among this CHD cohort, we estimated that the fraction of subjects harboring noncoding predicted functional DNVs that contribute to CHD is at least as high as the fraction of CHD cases with contributory coding DNVs. We observed consistent results in isolated CHD and those with NDDs or ECAs, which is distinctly different than the NDD and ECA enrichment among CHD probands with damaging coding DNVs. For the prioritized human fetal heart enhancer DNVs, this manifested as depletion of patients with CHD and NDD compared to WES-implicated coding DNVs. These results could be explained by cardiac-specific effects in at least a subset of DNVs, suggesting future work could build on the cardiac relevance described here with a focus on cardiac specificity. The implicated <italic>GATA4</italic> enhancer in a proband with isolated CHD illustrates the potential to uncouple frequently associated phenotypes through cardiac-selective regulatory effects.</p>
              <p id="P33">While our findings established that noncoding DNVs contribute to CHD pathogenesis, the relevant genetic mechanisms remain to be explored. Previous studies of rare coding variants suggested some are sufficient to engender CHD (<italic>i.e.,</italic> Mendelian genetic model), while many others are associated with incomplete penetrance, suggesting greater genetic complexity (e.g., oligogenic model) and/or environment effects. While noncoding DNVs contributing to CHD could act in a simple Mendelian manner (for instance, substantially reducing allelic expression), more modest gene expression effects would be congruous with an oligogenic mechanism. Future studies of noncoding variants observed in CHD are needed to establish transcriptional effect sizes and their ability to perturb heart development individually and in concert with other relevant factors.</p>
              <p id="P34">These data are the first to systematically associate human CHD with cardiac regulatory DNVs. Our findings highlight the potential of WGS to more fully elucidate the genetic architecture of CHD. Extension of the statistical framework used is likely to define additional noncoding variants in CHD. When applied to larger cohorts, we expect to refine the magnitude of noncoding effects and to investigate complex CHD genetics, such as epistatic and pleiotropic effects of noncoding and coding variants.</p>

                <p id="P39">DNV identification was performed for both cases and controls by pooling three pipelines from PCGC members at Mount Sinai, Columbia and Harvard. Mount Sinai used two tiers, a high stringency tier and a low stringency tier. High stringency tier parameters were GATK PASS (i.e., variants classified as true with an adaptive error model based on known true sites and artifacts), heterozygous ratio (AB) set to 0.3–0.7 in the proband, homozygous ratio (AB) less than 0.01 in both parents, depth (DP) ≥ 10, Joint Genotyping allele count (AC) = 1 across all trios, Genotype Quality (GQ) &gt; 60 (proband and parents), Alternate Allele Depth (AAD) &gt; 7 in the proband, and AAD &lt; 3 in each parent. The lower tier consisted of <italic>de novo</italic> calls falling outside of the higher tier that did not fail the following filters: GATK PASS, heterozygous AB set to 0.2–0.8, DP 7–120, AC = 1 in all trios, GQ &gt; 60 (proband), GQ &gt; 30 (parents), AAD &gt; 7. At Columbia, parameters for DNV identification were heterozygous or homozygous for the alternate allele in the proband, homozygous for the reference allele in the parents, not in a multiallelic site (3 or more), AC ≤ 2 in the cohort, Fisher’s exact test strand bias (FS) &lt; 25, variant quality by depth (QD) &gt; 2 for SNVs and QD &gt; 1 for indels, ReadPosRankSum &gt; −3 for indels, proband genotype Phred-scaled likelihood (PL) ≥ 70, proband AAD ≥ 6, proband heterozygous AB ≥ 0.28 if AAD ≥ 10 or heterozygous AB ≥ 0.20 if AAD &lt; 10, parental GQ ≥ 30, parental DP ≥ 10, parental AB &lt; 0.035, and population frequency &lt; 0.1% (1KG, ESP, ExAC). For the third pipeline at Harvard, the parameters were AC = 1, DP 7–64 inclusive, ADD ≥ 5, heterozygous AB 0.2–0.8 inclusive, homozygous AB ≤ 0.1. Putative <italic>de novo</italic> calls near indels, in a homopolymer indel, or in a dinucleotide repeat were subsequently visually filtered with IGV. After consolidating <italic>de novo</italic> calls, all variants were force called with FreeBayes<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. GATK and FreeBayes both perform local realignment. GATK uses a combination of known common variants, indels, and entropy calculations to generate log of the odds ratio (LOD) scores for alternative consensus sequences, replacing original alignments if LOD scores are higher. FreeBayes generalizes this Bayesian caller approach to allow for multiallelic loci and non-uniform copy number across samples, and the combination of GATK and FreeBayes variant calling was previously reported to improve the positive predictive value of indel identification to &gt;97%<sup><xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. Therefore, FreeBayes variant calling was performed on GATK-identified <italic>de novo</italic> variants to reduce false-positive variants. DNVs in Sinai’s high evidence tier but false with FreeBayes were manually reviewed. Finally, IGV plots of all the putative DNVs were passed through an 8-layer convolutional neural network trained on curated IGV plots, and classified into 6 categories (<italic>de novo</italic> SNVs, <italic>de novo</italic> insertions, <italic>de novo</italic> deletions, complex, uncertain, and false positives)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.

                <p id="P59">Five groups of annotations were defined to investigate post-transcriptional regulation through disruption of RNA-binding protein binding: (i) 3 variant types (SNV, indel, all); (ii) 3 region types (TSS ± 20 kb region anchor where TSS is gene transcription start sites, 3’UTR region anchor defined as (TES – 5 kb, TES + 20 kb) where TES is gene transcription end sites, no region restriction); (iii) 1 RBP category (union of eCLIP peaks from 160 RBPs, padded on both sides with 50 bp); (iv) 2 gene sets (unconstrained or pLI &gt; 0.5 constraint on nearest gene); and (v) histone mark annotations for actively transcribed regions in relevant proxy tissues, specifically H3K36me3 in eight human embryonic stem cell tissues: ES-I3 stem cells (E001), ES-WA7 stem cells (E002), H1 stem cells (E003), H9 stem cells (E008), HUES48 stem cells (E014), HUES6 stem cells (E015), HUES64 stem cells (E016), ES-UCSF4 stem cells (E024); plus human fetal heart tissue (E083).</p>
                <p id="P60">Histone modification peaks were downloaded as broadPeak files, originally determined from Roadmap Epigenomics ChIP-Seq<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Raw broadPeaks were preprocessed as follows to include the majority of the area between the 5’ and 3’ UTRs for transcribed genes and smoothen noise in identifying actively transcribed regions in proxy tissues: gaps under 1 kb between histone peaks within this region were filled in, resulting in slightly improved signal for genes with many nearby peaks throughout.</p>
                <p id="P61">Picking one annotation from each group resulted in 162 possible combinations. These annotation categories were considered in the combination-wide association test and yielded 105 independent tests, giving 4.76 × 10<sup>−4</sup> as the strict Bonferroni threshold. Two-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used to obtain odds ratios and associated <italic>P</italic>-values for all test combinations. DNVs within RefSeq protein-coding exons were excluded.</p>

                <title>Attributable risk calculation.</title>
                <p id="P62">The fraction of CHD attributable to noncoding DNVs was calculated by determining the excess fraction of DNVs in cases compared to controls, and we then assumed at most one contributory DNV per proband to calculate the attributable fraction (<xref rid="FD1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>). This AR was calculated for HeartENN-damaging DNVs at successively stringent thresholds, DNVs within prioritized human fetal heart enhancers in multiple gene sets, DNVs shared between these results, and DNVs implicated in the top RBP enrichment. The AR is cumulative across methods (after subtracting out the contribution of shared DNVs) and represent estimates that should be refined in future studies.</p>

                <p id="P74"><bold>a</bold>, Pairs of reference and DNV sequences were selected based on bioinformatic analyses for the following classes: prioritized human fetal heart enhancer only, high HeartENN score (≥0.5) only, HeartENN score ≥ 0.1 at an ATAC-seq peak, and HeartENN score ≥ 0.1 in a prioritized human fetal heart enhancer. The numbers of pairs tested and the numbers for which the DNV sequence resulted in significantly different levels of transcription are indicated. <bold>b</bold>, Boxplots for the five pairs for which the transcription level from the DNV (MT) was significantly different from the reference (WT) sequence. Boxplots show the median fold change (FC), first and third quartiles (lower and upper hinges), and range of values (whiskers and outlying points). Both <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold> show 2-sided <italic>t</italic>-test Benjamini-Hochberg <italic>P</italic>-values; each boxplot has at least 3 independent experiments with 4 technical replicates each, and the HeartENN ≥ 0.1 + FHP group was repeated 4 times. <bold>c</bold>, The genomic positions of the five DNVs for which transcription was significantly altered are indicated along with their bioinformatic classes, HeartENN functional difference scores, and associated genes.</p>

                <title>Enrichment of variants in RNA-binding protein category annotations.</title>
                <p id="P75"><bold>a</bold>, Five groups of annotations were defined to investigate post-transcriptional regulation through disruption of RNA-binding protein binding, resulting in <italic>n</italic> = 162 combinations of (i) variant type; (ii) region type; (iii) RBP category; (iv) gene sets, specifically pLI constraint on nearest gene; and (v) histone mark annotations for actively transcribed regions in relevant proxy tissues*. These annotation categories were considered in the category-wide association test and yielded 105 independent tests, giving 4.76 × 10<sup>−4</sup> as the strict Bonferroni threshold. <bold>b</bold>, Variant enrichment and significance for each test category, determined with a two-sided Fisher’s exact test: SNV-only tests used a total of <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> = 52,004 case SNVs and <italic>n</italic><sub>0</sub> = 106,438 control SNVs; SNV + indel tests used a total <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub> = 55,827 case variants and <italic>n</italic><sub>0</sub> = 113,467 control variants. The association tests passing Bonferroni significance have been highlighted in red. <bold>c</bold>, Detailed tabulation of the seven Bonferroni-significant Fisher’s exact tests (two-sided).</p>
