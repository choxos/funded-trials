Pharmacists recommended an antibiotic change in 25% (73/288) of timeouts with 70% (51/73) of recommended changes accepted by hospitalists. Barriers to adherence included unanticipated and weekend discharges. Compared to control services, there were no differences in antibiotic use after discharge during the intervention.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Antibiotic overuse is common and contributes to side effects, resistant infections, and unnecessary costs.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Antibiotics prescribed at hospital discharge account for over half of antibiotic exposure related to hospitalization for common infections<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and are major contributors to excessive antibiotic duration and potentially inappropriate use.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> In 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized the importance of optimizing antibiotic therapy at discharge in their Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs; however, methods to improve antibiotic use at discharge are not well developed.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P7">Antibiotic timeouts, or structured pauses to evaluate the need for ongoing antibiotic therapy, have been recommended by both the CDC and The Joint Commission to optimize antibiotic use.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> By discharge, there are often additional clinical and diagnostic data available to inform antibiotic necessity, selection, and duration, making discharge an opportune time to pause and reconsider antibiotic necessity and appropriateness. An antibiotic timeout at discharge may allow the provider to generate a final antibiotic treatment plan after systematically reviewing the patient’s hospitalization. Pharmacists would be in a unique position to perform such an intervention given their frequent involvement in antibiotic stewardship and medication reconciliation at discharge. Thus, we conducted a 6-month, controlled pilot study to determine feasibility of a pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout prior to discharge.</p>

              <title>METHODS</title>
              <sec id="S7">
                <title>Study setting and participants</title>
                <p id="P8">We conducted a single-center, controlled pilot study of adult medical patients anticipated to be discharged on oral antibiotics from a large, academic, quaternary referral hospital. The Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 guidelines were followed in preparing this manuscript.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The intervention group included patients on the hospital medicine service (in the United States, hospitalists are general medicine physicians who care mostly [or exclusively] for hospitalized patients) which consists of 10 single-hospitalist teams that each care for up to 11 patients. The control group included patients on the general medicine service, a teaching service including one attending physician (hospitalist, general medicine physician, or internal medicine subspecialty physician) plus a house officer (ie, medical trainee) team. Clinical pharmacists are assigned daily to multiple inpatient services that consist of general medicine, hospital medicine, and other teams. Pharmacists typically round with the general medicine teams in the morning, and then briefly (~10 minutes) round with hospitalist teams in the afternoon to review patient lists. Prior to the pilot, there was no standardized workflow for discussing antibiotics during rounds. Discussions on the antibiotic plan, including discharge plans, occurred at the discretion of the individual pharmacist and hospitalist.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S8">
                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="P9">We used an iterative approach to inform the design, development, and implementation of an intervention to improve prescribing at discharge (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This process, adapted from engineering frameworks, has been successfully used to implement infection control interventions.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The key strength of an iterative implementation strategy is that the intervention can be adjusted in near real-time based on formative evaluations (ie, feedback) conducted during early stages of the intervention. Using repeated cycles of design-test-revise, we were able to quickly adapt to unforeseen barriers to optimize intervention feasibility. At the conclusion of the study, a summative evaluation was conducted to evaluate feasibility and the intervention’s effect on antibiotic use and outcomes.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S9">
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="P10">The intervention occurred between May 1, 2019 and October 31, 2019 and was developed in accordance with published data on using timeouts to improve antibiotic use (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFig 1</xref> for timeline).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Timeouts are structured pauses that remind clinicians to reconsider whether the diagnosis has changed and whether antibiotic therapy is still appropriate. The timeouts were led by clinical pharmacists via structured conversations with hospitalists including four questions targeting common ways to improve antibiotic use at discharge: (1) stopping unnecessary therapy (ie, antibiotics prescribed for a noninfectious or nonbacterial syndrome), (2) reducing excessive duration, (3) improving appropriate selection, and (4) documenting the antibiotic plan in the discharge summary (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Our timeout was designed—and iteratively tested—in collaboration with the hospitalist, clinical pharmacist, and antibiotic stewardship teams.</p>
                <p id="P11">The timeout was initially designed to occur in-person during afternoon pharmacy rounds. After feedback from pharmacists, we also designed a process where a page was sent out automatically from the electronic medical system to the covering pharmacist when any of their patients had a discharge antibiotic order signed. This page served as a backstop alerting the pharmacist of potential timeouts if the team failed to alert them of a discharge. Because timeouts only occurred Monday through Friday, pharmacists were instructed to ask hospitalists about potential weekend discharges during Friday rounds.</p>
                <p id="P12">Initially, pharmacists were instructed not to perform timeouts on patients with an infectious disease (ID) consult or complicated infection (eg, bacteremia). However, during formative evaluations pharmacists suggested that discussing complicated patients would not only improve antibiotic use (eg, hospitalists misinterpreting ID consult notes) but would improve feasibility by reducing work required to identify eligible patients. Thus, we expanded our inclusion criteria on June 17, 2019 to include all patients anticipated to be discharged on oral antibiotics for any acute indication.</p>
                <p id="P13">Two clinical pharmacists (Pharm1, Pharm2) and 2 hospitalists (Author1, Author2) served as local champions to promote and educate their respective teams on the intervention. Prior to the intervention’s rollout, champions conducted teaching sessions to introduce the intervention, seek input, and gain support. To provide guidance on appropriate antibiotic therapy, we distributed a 2-sided pocket card listing the four timeout questions on one side, as well as recommended discharge antibiotics for common infections on the other (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P14">Primary feasibility outcomes focusing on usability, accessibility, awareness, adherence, and acceptability were measured through a combination of direct observation, hospitalist and pharmacist interviews, pre- and postimplementation hospitalist surveys, and prospective timeout and antibiotic data collected by the pharmacists. In addition, the summative evaluation included antibiotic use data collected for a subset of patients via the electronic medical record.</p>
                <p id="P15">Approximately every 2 weeks throughout the intervention, research personnel directly observed (without deliberate interference) antibiotic timeouts (observation guides in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref>). After each observation, the research team conducted “rapid debrief” interviews with the participating pharmacists and hospitalists (separately) to ascertain acceptability, usability, facilitators, and barriers to the timeout that just occurred and to the intervention overall. Debrief interviews used a structured interview guide (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref>) with additional questions added based on the timeout witnessed. Observations and interviews were conducted by 2 team members (Author2, Author3), audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim.</p>
                <p id="P16">Hospitalists who were on the hospital medicine service during the intervention were surveyed immediately after the study (November 2019) to assess the intervention’s feasibility, which included usability, awareness, adherence, and acceptability. All survey questions were derived from prior literature on care transitions and antibiotic stewardship, tested with local stakeholders, survey design experts, and non-study clinicians, and administered online using Qualtrics XM.</p>
                <p id="P17">During the intervention phase, pharmacists prospectively documented antibiotic timeout data in the electronic medical record including when the timeout occurred, indication for antibiotic therapy, which antibiotic was prescribed with dose/frequency, antibiotic duration, time spent on the intervention, and whether antibiotic changes were suggested and accepted.</p>
                <p id="P18">To assess the interventions effect on antibiotic use, we evaluated antibiotic use on general medicine (control) versus hospital medicine (intervention) services during the intervention versus 1 year prior (May 1, 2018 – April 30, 2019), focusing on a subset of patients typically prescribed antibiotics at discharge, including those with pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), or intra-abdominal infections (ICD-10 codes in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix</xref>). To identify patients with urinary tract infection (UTI), we included patients with any urine culture during hospitalization that was flagged as positive. We excluded patients discharged on IV antibiotics, antibiotic duration after discharge of &gt;14 days (to exclude chronic therapy), patients with severe immune suppression, those with osteomyelitis, and those with ≥1 blood culture positive for a bacterial pathogen. Demographic, clinical data, antibiotic use, and outcome data were collected from our institutional enterprise health data warehouse. In addition, for patients with timeout data, a team member (DG) reviewed each patient’s discharge summary to evaluate for appropriate antibiotic documentation.</p>

                <p id="P19">Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey responses, patient and hospitalist characteristics, and timeout data. For surveys, percent positive response was defined as either a “yes” answer, strongly agree/agree, or usually/always.</p>
                <p id="P20">All observation field notes and interview transcripts were coded individually by 2 reviewers using a mix of deductive (derived from the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Disease [TICD])<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and inductive coding. Using NVivo 12, we created code reports that were reviewed by the study team to develop themes based on TICD factors. Specifically, we focused on TICD determinants related to our primary outcomes including guideline factors (eg, usability, accessibility) and health professional factors (eg, awareness). Representative quotes or observations are reported from interview transcripts and observation field notes.</p>
                <p id="P21">Antibiotic use at discharge was measured as percentage of patients discharged on antibiotics and median duration of antibiotics prescribed at discharge. Segmented logistic regression models were used, allowing us to evaluate slope/level change pre- and post-intervention in antibiotic use at discharge. We ran separate models looking first for differences pre- and post-intervention in the treatment group and secondly, to compare the treatment and control groups over time. All logistic regression models were controlled for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, qSOFA (sequential organ failure assessment score) at 24 hours, diagnosis, presence of ID consultation, steroid use, length of stay, and source of admission (eg, home vs nursing facility) to produce adjusted odds ratios.</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p id="P23">During the intervention, we observed 6% (18/288) of timeouts and conducted 13 interviews with 6 hospitalists and 5 pharmacists (2 pharmacists were interviewed twice). Of those invited to participate, 1 pharmacist and 1 hospitalist declined to be observed. Among 102 hospitalists surveyed, the response rate for postintervention surveys was 70% (71/102 Characteristics of survey respondents are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eTable 1</xref>. Of the 71 hospitalists who responded to the postintervention survey, 48 (67%) had worked a hospital medicine day shift during the intervention period and were asked about usability, adherence, and acceptability.</p>

                <title>Pharmacist-collected timeout data</title>
                <p id="P24">Pharmacists conducted 288 timeouts: 52% (151/288) occurred during afternoon rounds, 45% (130/288) occurred over the telephone after pharmacists were alerted of a discharge through the alert page, and timing could not be classified in 2% (7/288). Pharmacists recommended an antibiotic change during 25% (73/288) of timeouts; hospitalists accepted 70% (51/73) of recommendations. Changes included decreasing duration (45%, 23/51), narrowing spectrum (41%, 21/51), and discontinuing therapy (14%, 7/51). Based on review of discharge summaries, documentation of indication (98%, 281/288), antibiotic name (92%, 266/288), and total intended duration (78%, 224/288) was common.</p>

                <title>Interview and observation data</title>
                <p id="P25">Generally, interviews and observations demonstrated the intervention was feasible (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based on observations (N = 18), antibiotic timeouts took on average 2.5 minutes (median 2 minutes). Pharmacists reported their total work related to each timeout (N = 288) was a median 5 minutes (interquartile range: 5-10 minutes). Notably, if the timeout occurred after a prescription had been sent to an outpatient pharmacy, time spent calling the pharmacy to change the prescription substantially increased pharmacist workload (up to 20 minutes).</p>
                <p id="P26">In nearly all observed timeouts, pharmacists had prepared for timeouts by reviewing the charts of patients on antibiotics prior to the timeout and had already decided whether they planned to recommend changes. This plan often changed in real time based on new clinical data provided by the hospitalists during the actual timeout. Though we designed the pocket card to be used by both hospitalists and pharmacists, only the pharmacists were observed using it (55% [10/18] of timeouts); hospitalists instead reported relying on the pharmacists for antibiotic guidelines.</p>
                <p id="P27">Barriers to feasibility identified from interviews and observations included interruptions to the timeout (eg, patient emergency) and limited information transfer (between hospitalists or pharmacists) during service handoffs. The main enhancers of feasibility were existing strong, collaborative relationships between hospitalists and pharmacists, familiarity with discussing antibiotic use, and ease of integration of the timeout into existing workflows (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P28">In the post-intervention survey, hospitalists who had worked a day shift during the intervention reported they were aware of the intervention (45/48; 94%) and that pharmacists usually or always discussed antibiotic use in patients who might be discharged on oral antibiotics (42/48 [88%]). Notably, based on both survey and observation data (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), pharmacists were more likely to query about antibiotic selection and duration as opposed to indication and documentation. When asked about the reasons for this during interviews, pharmacists noted the question on documentation made them “uncomfortable” either because they worried the question would offend hospitalists or because they had no baseline data to support the need to improve documentation:</p>
                <disp-quote id="Q1">
                  <p id="P29">“I personally think the question is a little awkward because I think some providers get like a little offended, like do you not think I document on this?”- Pharmacist (Interview)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p id="P30">During observations, we noted that the question on documentation (particularly early in the intervention) could provoke a defensive response from hospitalists, <italic toggle="yes">“I always do that!”</italic> Toward the end of the intervention period, hospitalists began to anticipate this question and respond preemptively, <italic toggle="yes">“Okay that [antibiotic change] is fine. I’ll make sure [I] document that in the discharge summary.”</italic> As for why pharmacists did not ask about indication, pharmacists reported they skipped this question if unnecessary:
<disp-quote id="Q2"><p id="P31">“You can kind of fast-forward through [the indication] because, you know, asking if a patient has a bacterial infection with a confirmed culture supporting it… is somewhat elementary.”- Pharmacist (Interview)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="P32">The number of timeouts conducted increased over time (eg, 34 in May, 54 in October; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">eFigure 2</xref>). Although our pharmacists documented 288 timeouts, only 125 were included in our electronic database created from ICD-10 codes. In fact, based on ICD-10 codes there were 417 patients potentially eligible for a timeout of which only 30% (125) received one. Though part of the discrepancy between cases captured by pharmacists and those identified by ICD-10 codes is due to the difficulty identifying “potential discharges on antibiotics” using ICD-10 codes, we also sought to determine other causes for non-adherence. Thus, we reviewed 10 medical charts of confirmed eligible patients without a timeout. Of those, 5 had a length of stay ≤ 3 days and 3 was discharged on the weekend (when timeouts were not performed).</p>
                <p id="P33">Though witnessed adherence to the intervention was high overall, we observed pharmacists adapting the exact questions and flow to fit their conversation style (100%, 18/18 observations). When asked about adaptations, pharmacists noted they individualized their approach over time:
<disp-quote id="Q3"><p id="P34">“I found myself and a lot of my colleagues may have drifted away from [the scripted conversation] and kind of felt out a style…”-Pharmacist (Interview)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="P35">As discussed previously, pharmacists and hospitalists noted early in the intervention that it was difficult to define the study population due to initially complex exclusion criteria. Addressing these exclusions increased the pharmacist workload and early data demonstrated pharmacists were often inaccurate in determining whether a patient should or should not be excluded from a timeout. In addition, pharmacists believed the timeout would still be helpful in complex patients, as it gave the team an opportunity to discuss the patient and provided a second pair of eyes. In response to this feedback, we expanded our inclusion criteria to include all patients discharged on oral antibiotics for any acute indication. Pharmacists appreciated this change:
<disp-quote id="Q4"><p id="P36">[How do you feel about reducing the exclusion criteria?] “even though we have a lot of ID consults in, it was still important to look at the actual duration of the antibiotics that we are discharging people on because, sometimes, those can look a little bit muddy and we need to fix them… it was a good move.”–Pharmacist (Interview)</p></disp-quote></p>
                <p id="P37">After this change, timeouts began to occur on nearly all patients discharged on oral antibiotics: patients reviewed and excluded by pharmacists before the change, 43.5% (64/147) versus 20.2% (52/257) postchange, (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001). However, the pocket card recommendations for narrow, short antibiotic courses still only applied to the least complicated patients. This created some confusion which we overcame through additional training. Regardless, for more complicated patients (eg, bacteremia, failure to improve, infectious complications), it was difficult to provide standard recommendations for treatment at discharge given the lack of national guidelines for these patients. Lack of clear guidelines and definitions for certain groups remained a barrier throughout the intervention.

                <p id="P40">Post-implementation survey responses demonstrated the intervention was well accepted and that hospitalists believed the intervention improved care and should be continued (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). During interviews, pharmacists reported the intervention was useful and they believed it had improved patient care. Hospitalists reported appreciating the structure of the timeout as it forced them to think about their prescribing plans and that having pharmacists was like a “second set of eyes.”</p>
                <p id="P41">Unlike hospitalists, pharmacists were more cautious about committing to continuing the intervention—they requested efficacy data and expressed concerns about workload as another new project was about to begin. They noted the timeout had been accepted by pharmacists initially because it had replaced another project that was ending, but they were concerned about the time commitment with other competing initiatives.</p>
                <p id="P42">We identified substantial contamination between intervention and control groups. It should be noted that clinical pharmacists participating with the hospitalists in the intervention phase were often simultaneously covering patients in our control population. During our observations, we discovered intervention pocket cards had been photo-copied, posted in the general medicine team rooms, and circulated among house officers. One pharmacist reported seeing the pocket card posted near the emergency department’s pharmacy (the emergency department was not included in this study). In addition to visible contamination, pharmacists noted:

                <p id="P44">After exclusions, we identified 711 patients from the electronic data warehouse discharged after a hospitalization for pneumonia (222, 31.2%), SSTI (134, 18.8%), intra-abdominal infection (27, 3.8%), or UTI (275, 38.7%). Over half (58%, 417) were on the hospital medicine service (intervention arm) and 41% (294) on general medicine service (control arm; see <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Generally, patients hospitalized on hospital medicine and general medicine services were similar.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P48">This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout at hospital discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a pharmacist-facilitated timeout targeting antibiotic use at hospital discharge. Pharmacist recommendations to change the antibiotic prescription occurred in 25% of cases and led to frequent changes, most commonly decreasing duration and narrowing spectrum.</p>
              <p id="P49">Primary barriers to timeout feasibility included interruptions during face-to-face rounds (ie, pager going off) and difficulty arranging a face-to-face meeting if the hospitalist was unable to attend the existing afternoon rounds. Furthermore, patients with a short length of stay or who were discharged on the weekend may have been less likely to receive a timeout. Despite these barriers, there were notable strengths of the intervention that led to its feasibility. The timeout was adaptable, and pharmacists found they could easily mold the intervention into their workflow and clinical style. Both hospitalists and pharmacists found the structure of the antibiotic timeout beneficial and believed it improved patient care. Notably, a defensive emotional response from the hospitalists was sometimes generated when the pharmacist asked them to ensure documentation of the antibiotic dose, indication, and duration in the discharge summary. This emotional response may be why we observed such a high rate of antibiotic documentation in the discharge summary compared to prior studies,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> as emotional drivers are a potential way to promote desired behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Improved documentation plays an integral part in The Joint Commission’s efforts to reduce communication breakdowns during transitions of care.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Facilitators of feasibility included a good pre-existing relationship between hospitalists and pharmacists, strong champions on both services, and certain features of the intervention including that it created a “structure” and ensured a “second pair of eyes” for discharge prescriptions.</p>
              <p id="P50">We also learned strategies which may improve future feasibility including minimizing and streamlining exclusion criteria and ensuring a back-up system in case in-person timeouts did not occur. Though we initially hesitated to include patients with an ID consult, pharmacists noted the intervention was useful even in these patients, as it helped improve interpretation of ID recommendations. In future iterations, the intervention should have as few exclusions as possible to increase usability and promote adherence.</p>
              <p id="P51">Traditional hospital-based antibiotic stewardship programs have been shown to reduce antibiotic use, costs, adverse events, and infection or colonization with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> More recently, Barnett and Yogo et al. evaluated interventions around the time of discharge as a potential tool for stewardship. Initial findings suggest discharge stewardship is well received and associated with less frequent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and shorter antibiotic durations following hospitalization.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Compared to both the Barnett and Yogo studies, we observed higher rates of pharmacist interventions at discharge (25% vs 9.7% and 23%, respectively) and higher acceptance of pharmacist recommendations (70% vs 58% and 67%, respectively). Possible contributors to this difference include the structured nature of our timeout, the prospective quality of the study, and an established stewardship role of pharmacists in our hospital system.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P52">Although our timeout led to frequent changes in discharge antibiotic prescriptions, no significant differences were observed in antibiotic use compared to the control. This lack of effect is likely multifactorial. First, our study was designed to measure feasibility and thus was underpowered to determine a difference in antibiotic use. Second, half of patients eligible for a timeout did not receive one—likely due to short hospitalizations, weekend discharges, or timeout interruptions. Third, there was substantial contamination between intervention and control groups which likely biased results to the null. Fourth, only 6% of timeouts were observed which could have led to an omission of timeouts that were impractical and inefficient. Lastly, pharmacists varied in their comfort level making recommendations; if they erred toward withholding recommendations this could limit the timeout’s effect. Given demonstrated feasibility, additional, larger studies with control groups less susceptible to contamination are needed to assess effectiveness. In addition, given the critical role nurses play in patient education and care coordination at discharge, future interventions should consider incorporating nurses into antibiotic stewardship during care transitions.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p id="P53">A pharmacist-facilitated antibiotic timeout at time of hospital discharge was feasible. Barriers to adherence include brief hospital stays, weekend hospital discharges, and strict inclusion criteria. These barriers could be overcome by expanding inclusion criteria and creating a back-up alert for weekend discharges. Further studies are needed to evaluate intervention effectiveness including assessing the effect on antibiotic use and clinical outcomes.</p>

After each stage of design and development, formative evaluations (including observations and feedback from pharmacists and hospitalists) were used to update the projects design.

The timeouts were led by clinical pharmacists who had a structured conversation with hospitalists including four questions targeting common ways to improve antibiotic prescribing at discharge: (1) stopping unnecessary therapy (ie, antibiotics prescribed for a non-infectious or non-bacterial syndrome), (2) reducing excessive duration, (3) improving appropriate selection, and (4) documenting antibiotic plan in the discharge summary.</p>

The pre-intervention was May 1, 2018-April 30, 2019 and the intervention period was May 1, 2019-October 31, 2019. A difference in differences approach with logistic regression models was used to evaluate slope/level change pre- versus postintervention in antibiotic use at discharge compared to the control group. Antibiotic use was controlled for patient age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index, qSOFA (sequential organ failure assessment score, higher scores indicate high risk of mortality) at 24 hours, infectious diagnosis, presence of infectious diseases consultation, prehospitalization steroid use, length of stay, and source of admission (eg, home vs nursing facility).</p>
