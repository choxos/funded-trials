                <p id="P2">HIV replication within tissues may increase in response to a reduced exposure to antiretroviral drugs. Traditional approaches to measuring drug concentrations in tissues are unable to characterize a heterogeneous drug distribution. Here, we used mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to visualize the distribution of six HIV antiretroviral drugs in gut tissue sections from three species (two strains of humanized mice, macaques, and humans). We measured drug concentrations in proximity to CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells that are targeted by HIV, as well as expression of HIV or SHIV RNA and expression of the MDR1 drug efflux transporter in gut tissue from HIV-infected humanized mice, SHIV-infected macaques, and HIV-infected humans treated with combination antiretroviral drug therapy. Serial 10-μm sections of snap-frozen ileal and rectal tissue were analyzed by MSI for CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and MDR1 efflux transporter expression by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The tissue slices were analyzed for HIV/SHIV RNA expression by in situ hybridization and for antiretroviral drug concentrations by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The gastrointestinal tissue distribution of the six drugs was heterogeneous. Fifty percent to 60% of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells did not colocalize with detectable drug concentrations in the gut tissue. In all three species, up to 90% of HIV/SHIV RNA was found to be expressed in gut tissue with no exposure to drug. These data suggest that there may be gut regions with little to no exposure to antiretroviral drugs, which may result in low-level HIV replication contributing to HIV persistence.</p>

              <p id="P3">The persistence of HIV despite treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy is the major obstacle to eradication of this disease, necessitating lifelong therapy in HIV-infected individuals. Rebound plasma viremia after treatment cessation is thought to be secondary to reactivation of latently infected memory T cell populations (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, it has been hypothesized that residual HIV replication from productively infected T cells within tissue reservoirs may also contribute to viral rebound upon treatment interruption (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P4">The evidence for continued production of replication-competent virions within certain anatomical sites has been extensively reviewed (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Several tissue compartments, such as the central nervous system (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), male and female genital tracts (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), peripheral lymph nodes (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), have been implicated as potential tissue reservoirs and have recently been characterized in nonhuman primate (NHP) models (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The consequences of persistent active HIV replication in GALT, such as prolonged immune dysregulation and incomplete CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell reconstitution during combination antiretroviral therapy, are different from the consequences in other anatomical compartments (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The mechanisms underlying HIV persistence in tissue reservoirs like GALT are unclear, but suboptimal antiretroviral drug penetration into tissues has been suggested as one potential cause (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Inadequate tissue exposure to antiretroviral drugs may explain the persistence of HIV replication.</p>
              <p id="P5">Traditional methods for measuring the penetration of small molecules into tissues are limited in their capacity to measure heterogeneity of drug distribution within tissues. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of tissue homogenates has been the gold standard for antiretroviral drug tissue analysis but provides only an aggregate concentration of drug over the entire tissue. If HIV replication occurs focally, for example, in a single lymphoid follicle, LC-MS analysis may not accurately represent antiretroviral drug concentrations at the site of action. Some groups have isolated mononuclear cell populations from tissues before performing LC-MS (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Although this method is an improvement over analysis of tissue homogenates, it does not fully account for drug lost during mononuclear cell isolation (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and cannot distinguish between mononuclear cell populations from different sites within the tissue.</p>
              <p id="P6">Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can be used to quantitate small molecules at discrete tissue sample locations while maintaining spatial information across the entirety of a sectioned tissue sample, which allows the analyte distribution within a sample to be visualized (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). An advantage of MSI is the ability of this method to spatially correlate antiretroviral drug distribution with sites of potential HIV replication in serial tissue sections. Focal HIV RNA expression in tissue areas with low antiretroviral drug concentrations could indicate areas where there is active viral replication.</p>
              <p id="P7">In addition to advancing our understanding of how antiretroviral drugs become distributed in tissues, MSI can provide information about whether antiretroviral drug distribution in tissues differs among preclinical animal models and between animals and humans. Although the development of any new therapeutic agent requires testing in animal models, efficacy end points may differ if the within-tissue drug distribution is different between the animal models and humans.</p>
              <p id="P8">Here, we used MSI to visualize the distribution of antiretroviral drugs from several therapeutic classes in gastrointestinal tissues from HIV-infected humanized mice, SHIV (simian/human immunodeficiency virus)–infected macaques, and HIV-infected human subjects. We assessed the colocalization of antiretroviral drugs with HIV target cells and viral RNA expression. Then, we determined the extent to which antiretroviral drug distribution was associated with potential sites of viral replication. We also evaluated antiretroviral drug distribution in the context of drug efflux transporter expression by gut epithelial cells.</p>

Images of endogenous cholesterol were included to delineate tissue orientation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In uninfected macaques, tenofovir (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and emtricitabine (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) showed disparate drug distribution patterns, with tenofovir having the highest signal in the lumen of the ileum, and low but consistent penetration into the mucosa and outer muscle layer of the ileum. In contrast, emtricitabine concentrations were below the detection limit of our MSI technique. Consistent with our previously published data (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), the distribution of efavirenz was heterogeneous throughout the ileum and rectum of uninfected macaques and was localized primarily to the mucosal layer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Conversely, raltegravir was localized to the lumen of the ileum and rectum of uninfected macaques with less penetration into the mucosal layer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). We next investigated the localization of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the ileum and rectum of uninfected macaques (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">G</xref> to <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>).

Raltegravir and emtricitabine could not be detected by infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI) in any gut tissue slices from either strain of humanized mouse, despite detection of drug concentrations in mouse plasma and tissue by LC-MS. We observed fewer detectable human CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the HIV-infected humanized mouse gut tissue samples (1 to 3% of cells were CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1M</xref>) due to the limited reconstitution of human T cells into this compartment, particularly in the case of the hu-HSC-Rag mice (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N</xref> shows the overlay of tenofovir with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, revealing that the low tenofovir signal had limited colocalization with the signal for CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

However, concentrations of these two drugs could only be detected sporadically in the gut biopsy samples by MSI, even before correcting for potential blood contamination using heme.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P22">Here, we assessed the distribution of antiretroviral drugs in gut tissues across three species and measured the distribution relative to CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells and expression of HIV or SHIV RNA. Despite dosing with combination drug therapy to a pharmacokinetic steady state, 40 to 60% of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells remained unexposed to antiretroviral drugs in gut samples from all three species. The limitations of using conventional methods for small-molecule quantitation in tissue (e.g., LC-MS analysis of whole tissue homogenates) have been acknowledged previously (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and different models of heterogeneous antiretroviral drug distribution in tissue have been proposed (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Our data highlight the advantages of using MSI for characterizing tissue pharmacology. We have shown here that antiretroviral drug exposure in some areas where HIV target cells reside may be very small. This is particularly relevant when drawing inferences about target concentrations for antiretroviral drug efficacy, because any proposed drug concentration would need to be achieved in every HIV-infected cell or HIV target cell.</p>
              <p id="P23">Our use of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells to assess antiretroviral drug exposure in the entire T cell population versus a more targeted evaluation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is a major limitation of our study. Our approach overestimated the number of actual HIV-infected cells or HIV target T cells. Our attempts to identify the smaller CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset were complicated by a high background signal that made discrete cellular identification impossible. However, given that about 50% of the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell population did not appear to be exposed to antiretroviral drug and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells represent about 50% of the total T cell population in the gut mucosa (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), we predict that some of these unexposed T cells were also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This assumption is supported by our data showing that viral RNA expression occurred in discrete clusters spread throughout lymphoid aggregates within the ileum and rectum of all three species. Our finding of viral gene expression in the gut during antiretroviral drug therapy is consistent with previous publications (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and is not surprising given the relatively short duration of drug treatment administered to the mice and macaques in our study. However, our study design was such that we could identify all potential areas of viral replication early during drug treatment in the animals and could determine overlap with drug concentrations. Future work will need to evaluate the relationship between drug exposure and viral gene expression in gut tissues after long-term suppression of plasma HIV RNA by antiretroviral drug therapy. We attempted to address this limitation by examining gut samples from HIV-infected women who had been on combined antiretroviral drug therapy for at least 5 years and who showed suppression of viral loads for more than 1 year. Viral RNA was detected in two of five rectum samples, where 100% of viral RNA was colocalized with at least one drug. We found that antiretroviral drugs, when detectable, were well above reported in vitro IC<sub>90</sub> values, suggesting that the drug concentrations may have been sufficient to inhibit HIV/SHIV replication. However, because the drug distributions were not homogeneous and T cells moved within tissues, viral replication could still have occurred.</p>
              <p id="P24">The lack of virus detection in plasma or development of drug resistance during prolonged combined antiretroviral drug therapy in many HIV-infected patients does not support the local tissue viral replication hypothesis (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is possible that ongoing viral replication occurs in small pockets of gut tissue and is held in check by high antiretroviral drug concentrations in other tissue regions or in plasma. This is supported by several studies demonstrating the detection of replication-competent HIV DNA in a wide array of tissues collected from HIV-infected patients on combined antiretroviral drug therapy with a suppressed plasma viral load (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Whereas HIV DNA is a more relevant marker of the latent HIV reservoir, it cannot be ruled out that some proportion of this DNA is undergoing transcription to RNA and eventually is being translated into viral proteins. Given the widespread detection of HIV DNA in tissues, if even a small proportion (&lt;1%) of total HIV DNA led to production of replication-competent virions, then our hypothesis that viral replication occurred in isolated pockets of gut tissue surrounded by efficacious concentrations of antiretroviral drugs would be reasonable.</p>
              <p id="P25">With our MSI approach, we only captured a static point in time, which did not reflect the dynamic movement of T cells within GALTs. These T cells might be exposed to adequate drug concentrations as they migrate through GALTs, but as they move from areas of high to low drug concentrations, they may end up exposed to much lower intracellular drug concentrations. A future goal of our work is to use MSI to capture intracellular concentrations of antiretroviral drugs in individual T cells.</p>
              <p id="P26">Although our detection of efavirenz, atazanavir, maraviroc, and raltegravir in gut tissues from three species was robust, we were unable to adequately determine the distribution of tenofovir and emtricitabine, which did not exceed their respective IC<sub>90</sub> values in most gut samples that we examined. Given that the sensitivity of our MSI method was lower for tenofovir and emtricitabine than the other antiretroviral drugs we tested, these data must be interpreted with caution. In addition, the active intracellular metabolites of these compounds (tenofovir diphosphate and emtricitabine triphosphate) could not be quantified by MSI because preparing tissue slices resulted in their degradation. Therefore, although we quantified these drug metabolites by LC-MS, we did not know the spatial resolution of these drug metabolites in the gut tissue samples. Possibly, these drug metabolites were present in greater abundance and in different distribution patterns than their parent compounds. This may be the case as in a previous study tenofovir diphosphate and emtricitabine triphosphate gut concentrations were high enough after daily oral administration to prevent rectal sexual transmission of HIV (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Because MSI technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that our detection limits for these drugs will improve, as will our ability to measure stable drug metabolite concentrations in tissues without compromising their distribution.</p>
              <p id="P27">Our work also shows the potential contribution of drug efflux transporter protein expression in the gut to differences in antiretroviral drug distribution. There were different degrees of colocalization of MDR1 efflux transporter protein expression with the different antiretroviral drugs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For example, the higher colocalization of MDR1 with raltegravir suggested that the MDR1 transporter may have acted as a barrier to raltegravir distribution into the gut mucosa from the gut lumen (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The MDR1 efflux transporter appeared to be less important for efavirenz distribution as indicated by the lower colocalization and lower concentration of efavirenz in the gut submucosa. Raltegravir, but not efavirenz, is a known substrate for the MDR1 efflux transporter (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). With the small number of mice and macaques investigated in this study and the large inter-animal variability in MDR1 transporter expression, the colocalization data were often not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
              <p id="P28">Previous work has shown that HIV infection can alter expression of drug transporters by as much as threefold (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and that HIV infection can alter several pharmacokinetic variables such as intestinal absorption and drug metabolism that may affect antiretroviral drug distribution in tissues (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Although the antiretroviral drugs examined here are known to use several of the drug efflux transporters that are altered during infection (e.g., raltegravir by MDR1), HIV/SHIV infection did not contribute substantially to drug distribution in ileal or rectal tissues in our study. It is possible that our animals were not infected for long enough for these changes to become apparent (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), but our data do suggest that uninfected animals can be used to assess antiretroviral drug distribution.</p>
              <p id="P29">Our study has a number of limitations including the technological limitations of MSI and the need for markers of antiretroviral drug efficacy. We generated data from 10-μm tissue slices. The lack of antiretroviral drug detection in some of these tissue slices despite detection with traditional LC-MS methods can be explained by the decreased sensitivity of the IR-MALDESI instrumentation that we used. The relationship between sensitivity and image spatial resolution when using MSI has been noted (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Compared to LC-MS, the LODs for IR-MALDESI for antiretroviral drugs in tissues are up to 10-fold higher, resulting in decreased sensitivity for detection of some antiretroviral drugs. The inherent decrease in sensitivity with MSI can be explained, in part, by the small tissue area ablated with each laser pulse. Given that each laser pulse ablates a 100-μm area at 10-μm thickness, the tissue volume per analysis is up to 100-fold less than that analyzed by LC-MS using tissue homogenates. In addition, although we demonstrated that tissue architecture could be identified in each tissue slice, our limited sampling of gut tissue may have led to some drug distribution being overlooked. We collected tissues at the end of the drug dosing interval, but tissue penetration of antiretroviral drugs may have been higher or more homogeneous at other pharmacokinetic time points. However, we minimized any sampling confounding by dosing mice and monkeys with drug to plasma steady-state conditions. Total tissue drug concentrations under steady-state conditions are less variable across the dosing interval compared to plasma and so are less likely to differ based on the time of tissue collection (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P30">At sampling locations where potential blood contamination was present, we used MSI detection of the blood marker heme b to correct our measurements. This may have resulted in an overcorrection particularly in mouse and human tissues. We attempted to correct this by applying this blood contamination correction to MSI, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and ISH images. The potential contribution from remnant blood to antiretroviral concentrations measured in tissue homogenates further illustrates the limitation of using LC-MS to measure drug concentrations, because there is no capacity to assess proportional antiretroviral drug concentrations in blood by this method.</p>
              <p id="P31">Although the RNAscope ISH method used here has improved specificity compared to traditional ISH for detecting HIV/SHIV-specific gene expression (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and the frequency of viral RNA-positive cells may be in good agreement with fluorescence detection of virus-producing cells (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), the aggregate viral RNA detection we obtained may overestimate viral replication by capturing virions trapped on follicular dendritic cells in B cell follicles. Further, the association between cell-associated RNA measured before drug treatment interruption and timing of viral rebound has been demonstrated in other studies (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), but we were not able to discriminate between cell-associated RNA and free virions in our study. By correlating antiretroviral drug distribution to gut regions where active virions could be produced, our results may represent a worst-case scenario. We attempted to overcome this limitation by staining all virus-infected tissues for the viral protein markers p27 (macaque tissue) or p24 (humanized mice and human tissue); however, we were unable to detect these two viral proteins with enough signal to perform a robust analysis with our drug concentration data. Currently, we are investigating measurements of downstream components of the HIV life cycle by ISH and IR-MALDESI MSI.</p>
              <p id="P32">We compared antiretroviral drug concentrations to their individual IC<sub>90</sub> values without consideration for the synergistic effects of antiretroviral drugs in combination (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The antiretroviral drugs evaluated here may have exceeded efficacious concentrations due to the presence of other active drugs at the same gut tissue locations, but we were unable to make those comparisons. This has direct relevance for measuring the proportion of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells exposed to at least one antiretroviral drug (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">table S2</xref>). Our analysis makes a distinction between CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells that are not exposed to drug and those that are exposed to at least one drug, but assessments of the whole drug combination regimen could not be performed. Future work will use the MSI signal from endogenous metabolites and lipids to segment and categorize histological features in each tissue (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) to allow for cross-experiment comparisons between the whole drug regimens.</p>
              <p id="P33">The antiretroviral drug concentrations measured in this study represent total rather than unbound drug, whereas drug efficacy is driven by free drug concentrations at the site of action (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The extent of protein binding and thus free drug concentrations can differ between plasma and tissues for anti-infective agents (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). In some cases, estimates of the free drug in tissues can be accurately extrapolated from plasma drug concentrations (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), but direct measurement of unbound tissue concentrations of drug provides the most useful data for efficacy. Strategies such as ultrafiltration or microdialysis have been used by others to measure unbound drug concentrations in tissues directly (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P34">We did find some viral RNA-expressing cells in gut tissue that were not located close to measurable amounts of drug, despite adequate (&gt;IC<sub>90</sub>) exposure elsewhere in the tissue. This does not prove a causal relationship between suboptimal antiretroviral drug exposure and ongoing viral replication given that we likely overestimated both of these variables, but it does suggest the feasibility of applying MSI to elucidate HIV persistence in gut tissue and potentially other tissues.</p>

                <p id="P35">The primary objective of this study was to use MSI to characterize antiretroviral drug distribution within gastrointestinal tissues from three animal models (two strains of humanized mice and macaques) and humans. The goal was to quantitatively determine whether antiretroviral drug exposure in gut tissue at a single time point resulted in areas where HIV target CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells or viral RNA expression did not overlap with drug distribution. Secondary objectives included correlating antiretroviral drug concentrations with drug efflux transporter expression, interspecies comparisons of antiretroviral drug exposure in gut tissues, and assessment of differences in infected and uninfected animals. We hypothesized that antiretroviral drug distribution would be heterogeneous in all three species and could result in tissue regions devoid of any drug. Animals were randomized to an antiretroviral drug treatment regimen, but human subjects were selected on the basis of the regimen they were currently taking. No element of this study was blinded.</p>

Detailed descriptions of the animals used for this study, including infection and dosing information, as well as plasma concentrations, have been reported elsewhere (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, female humanized mice from both models were dosed orally for 6 to 10 days with one of several antiretroviral regimens (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">table S4</xref>). In addition, male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were dosed for 10 days with tenofovir and emtricitabine (both subcutaneously) and orally with either maraviroc + atazanavir or efavirenz + raltegravir. Antiretroviral doses, routes of administration, and duration of therapy were chosen to mimic commonly used treatment doses in these models and achieve pharmacokinetic steady-state conditions for all agents.</p>
                <p id="P37">About one-half the animals in each dosing cohort were infected with HIV (humanized mice) or SHIV (macaques) to assess the relationship between antiretroviral tissue disposition and potential ongoing HIV infection using HIV<sub>Bal D7</sub> (hu-HSC-Rag mice), HIV<sub>JRcsf</sub> (BLT mice), or RT-SHIV<sub>mac239</sub> (macaques) as previously described in detail (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Animals were euthanized and underwent necropsy about 24 hours after the final antiretroviral dose. Plasma was collected, and tissues were removed from the body, cut into two about equalsized pieces, and snap-frozen on dry ice. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with locally approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocols.</p>

                <p id="P38">This study enrolled five HIV-positive women between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) with intact gastrointestinal and genital tracts, who had undetectable plasma HIV RNA (&lt;50 copies/ml) within 3 months preceding the study. Participants were recruited from the Infectious Diseases Clinic at University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill on the basis of receiving one of the study regimens (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as a fixed dose combination plus either efavirenz, raltegravir, maraviroc, or atazanavir) as part of their ongoing clinical care.</p>
                <p id="P39">Subjects could not have a history of gastrointestinal disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, and colon cancer) or have a history of gastrointestinal surgery. All subjects had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy tests on days of sampling and used at least one of the following methods of contraception from the screening visit through 72 hours before inpatient admission (at which time the women were asked to remain abstinent until after their follow-up visit): systemic hormonal contraceptive (oral, depot, transdermal, or implant), intrauterine device (IUD) placed at least 1 month before study enrollment, bilateral tubal ligation (sterilization), vasectomized male partners, or condom with spermicide.</p>
                <p id="P40">Additional inclusion criteria included BMI of about 18 to 37 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a total body weight of &gt;45 kg (99 lbs), and evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial and was willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other trial procedures. Further, women could not be receiving any known CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s wort) or inhibitors [ketoconazole, non–dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers, and macrolide antibiotics] other than those contained in their HIV regimen for at least 6 months before enrollment. Subjects had to be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse, douching, and all intrarectal objects and products for at least 72 hours before enrollment until study completion; have a negative hepatitis B surface antigen test as documented on screening laboratories; could not be actively involved in the conception process; were able to swallow pills; and have no allergies to any component of the study products (i.e., bowel preparation regimen).</p>
                <p id="P41">Participants were excluded if they had any clinically relevant abnormal screening evaluations or relevant comorbidities, untreated sexually transmitted infections (rectal chlamydia or gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomonas), were pregnant or lactating, or tested positive for any drugs of abuse that would increase study risks. Additional exclusion criteria included receiving CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors (other than those contained in their HIV regimens) in the previous 6 months, receiving any investigational drug in the last 4 months, history of inflammatory bowel conditions (Crohn’s disease), or not using an approved method of contraception (systemic hormonal contraception, IUD, bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized male partner, condom plus spermicide, female-only sex partners, or 3 months of abstinence before enrollment).</p>
                <p id="P42">Further, subjects were excluded if they had a history of febrile illness within 5 days before enrollment, active hepatitis B infection as determined by positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), any laboratory chemistry or hematology result grade 3 or greater according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Laboratory Grading Tables, history of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks [1 drink = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of spirits] per week, participation in a clinical trial involving rectal biopsies within 6 months preceding enrollment, blood donation of about 1 pint (500 ml) within 56 days before dosing, history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or allergy to latex or was unwilling or unable to comply with the dietary and concomitant drug restrictions in regard to study drug administration as outlined in the study procedures and prohibited medication sections. All study activities were approved by the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board, and all activities were conducted in accordance with all International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) industry standards. All participants provided written informed consent before study procedures were performed.</p>
                <p id="P43">After participant education, informed consent, and screening for study eligibility, participants were assigned to the treatment arm associated with the HIV regimen they were receiving. Within 42 days of screening, participants were admitted to the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS) Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) for a 36-hour inpatient sampling visit. For the 7 days before admission, participants were asked to follow a strict low-fiber diet in preparation for a colonoscopy. Once admitted, participants were given only clear liquids until becoming NPO (nothing by mouth) 4 hours before the scheduled colonoscopy. Bowel preparation included an oral laxative (two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) followed by 227.1 g of polyethylene glycol 3350 in a 1-gallon solution (GoLYTELY). The preparation was divided into two separate 2-hour blocks: the first beginning 18 hours before the scheduled procedure and the second half beginning 6 hours before the procedure. Before the procedure, a single 3-ml paired blood sample was taken and processed for plasma. During the procedure, 10 biopsies each were taken from the terminal ileum and rectum. Subjects were monitored for 6 hours after the procedure, before discharge, with follow-up visits within 14 days of discharge. An analysis of previous studies from our group in subjects receiving raltegravir or darunavir who underwent similar procedures showed an about 30% decrease in both gut tissue and plasma concentrations (as measured by traditional LC-MS) versus subjects who had not received a complete bowel preparation.</p>

Macaque tissues were mounted on optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and sliced individually; however, the small size of the mouse tissues and human biopsies (2- to 5-mm cross sections) precluded this method. Instead, tissues were grouped by dosing cohort and mounted within a 2:1 gelatin carboxymethylcellulose gel block, which was snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. Dosing groups for mice each contained <italic>n</italic> = 6, and six tissues were included in a single gelatin block (e.g., six ileums from the atazanavir-only dosing group in a single block and six rectums from the atazanavir-only dosing group in a single gelatin block). For the human samples, ileum and rectum from all five women were included in single blocks (one block for ileum and one block for rectum). Each frozen gel block was mounted on OCT, sliced, and thaw-mounted, allowing for mounting and analysis of up to six mouse tissues simultaneously (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).

Relative humidity inside the chamber was reduced to &lt;6% to allow for sample cooling without condensation of water vapor, and then humidity was increased to deposit a layer of ice across the entire stage. Tissues were ablated with two pulses of a mid-IR laser (IR-Opolette 2371, Opotek, Carlsbad, CA) with a 100-μm spot-to-spot distance. Ablated molecules were ionized by orthogonal electrospray using 0.2% formic acid in 50:50 methanol water as an electrospray solvent and sampled into a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) for analysis in positive ion mode. Because the detection of certain analytes (e.g., tenofovir and efavirenz) was found to be increased in humans by probing for negative ions, polarity switching was used during these experiments using 5 mM ammonium acetate in 50:50 methanol water as the electrospray solvent. Raw data from each voxel were converted to the mzML format with MSConvert (ProteoWizard) and then to the imzML format for interrogation using MSiReader, which allows for generation of images of antiretroviral distribution across the tissue slice (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P48">Absolute quantitation of antiretroviral concentration was achieved by spotting a series of calibration standards (of known antiretroviral concentration) onto a nondosed “blank” tissue slice from identical tissue matrices from each species (ileum or rectum; BioreclamationIVT, Baltimore, MD). Each calibration standard (100 nl) was spotted onto the tissue, allowed to air dry, then placed inside the source chamber, and analyzed in an identical manner to the samples. A new calibration tissue was analyzed every day that sample analysis occurred to account for interday variability in run conditions (electrospray stability, relative humidity, thickness of ice layer, etc.). Calibration tissues were analyzed in MSiReader, where the summed voxel intensity over each calibration spot was plotted against the known antiretroviral concentration to generate a calibration curve. The slope and intercept of this curve was applied to the summed voxel intensity value for each antiretroviral over the entire area of the corresponding sample to generate an absolute concentration (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). To quantify antiretroviral concentration in mouse tissues, a single calibration spot was applied to a blank mouse tissue and analyzed in tandem with macaque calibration tissues. The voxel intensity value for the mouse calibration spot was used to adjust the slope and intercept of the NHP calibration curve (to account for response differences between tissues from different species), and the adjusted calibration curve was applied to mouse samples. Resulting ng/slice concentrations were converted to μg/g using the known area of each tissue slice measured in MSiReader, depth of each tissue (10 μm), and an assumed tissue density of 1.06 g/ml.</p>
                <p id="P49">For the purposes of inclusion in this manuscript, “representative” tissue sections were selected primarily on the basis of morphology, slice quality, and quality of IR-MALDESI image. For example, when possible, we include tissue slices that show a complete cross section from gut lumen through the muscularis, with minimal tissue folding or tearing in the IHC or ISH slice. However, our results are based on analysis of all slices analyzed regardless of aesthetics, and we report descriptive statistics (median and range) for all variables. To assess interslice variability, we a priori took multiple consecutive slices from each tissue for IR-MALDESI analysis, with the idea that several backup slices would be available in the event of experimental error. Several of these backup slices were analyzed and compared to the original data, with good qualitative correlation in distribution.</p>

Before beginning the RNAscope procedure, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 15 min followed by dehydration with graded ethanol washes (50, 70, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each). Detailed methodology for the RNAscope procedure is described elsewhere (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Briefly, slides were boiled to retrieve epitopes in P2 buffer (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD) for 30 min followed by peroxidase blocking for 10 min at room temperature, rinsing with double-distilled water, dehydrating with 100% ethanol for 5 min, and then air-drying. Slides were then incubated for 10 to 20 min at 40°C with protease digestion solution from ACD (P3). After protease digestions, slides were rinsed with double-distilled water and incubated with HIV clade B or SIV<sub>mac239</sub> ACD probes for 2 hours at 40°C. Slides were then washed in 0.5× ACD wash buffer and incubated in amplification reagents according to the RNAscope 2.5 HD detection protocol (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). All reagents used in the hybridization process were obtained from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Newark, CA) and used according to the manufacturer’s protocol with some minor adaptations (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). After counterstaining slides with hematoxylin, slides were mounted in clear mount and coverslipped. Staining was performed on all 15 to 20 slides to ensure detection of positive signal. Results were compared across slides, and little variability was found. Thus, colocalization was performed using the tissue slice most adjacent to the slice used for MSI.</p>

                <title>Image colocalization</title>
                <p id="P53">A schematic of the colocalization workflow is shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S3</xref>. For a given sample (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S3A</xref>), MSiReader was used to export voxel intensity matrices for cholesterol, heme, and each antiretroviral of interest across the entire tissue slice into MATLAB; IF, ISH, and IHC samples were scanned as described above and downsampled to match the resolution of the MSI data (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S2</xref>). Off-tissue response was eliminated by using cholesterol signal to mask antiretroviral response such that only on-tissue signal was shown. To eliminate the confounding effect of antiretrovirals contained within the vasculature, antiretroviral responses were again masked on the basis of heme distribution (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S3B</xref>) to show only the antiretroviral signal that localized outside the microvasculature. To ensure that MSI-derived images and IF/IHC/ISH images were appropriately aligned before colocalization, co-registration was performed by rigid transformation of the moving cholesterol image using the background 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain as a fixed reference (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S3C</xref>). The resulting transform matrix was then applied to all antiretroviral images so that every antiretroviral image was identically oriented. Last, the heme-corrected transformed antiretroviral images were overlayed with the variable of interest (CD3, MDR1, etc.) to generate a fused image (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">fig. S3D</xref>) containing both the antiretroviral (in red) and the variable of interest (in green).</p>
                <p id="P54">To evaluate concentrations proximate to relevant variables, antiretroviral intensity from a given voxel was multiplied by the total slice concentration determined from the quantitative experiments and corrected on the basis of the proportional contribution of that voxel to the total antiretroviral signal detected in the slice. Descriptive statistics (median and range) were generated on the basis of these per-voxel antiretroviral concentrations for areas of colocalization with the variable of interest (CD3, RNA, etc.). Per-voxel concentrations were then thresholded on the basis of the maximum in vitro IC<sub>90</sub> value reported in the package insert for each drug to generate binary images, showing antiretroviral concentration above and below the IC<sub>90</sub> value. Where ranges of IC<sub>90</sub> values could be found, we used the highest value to provide conservatives estimates of adequate antiretroviral exposure.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="P55">Descriptive statistics (median, range) of plasma and tissue drug concentrations as well as correlation coefficients were generated for each drug in humanized mice and NHPs. Pearson correlation was used to assess potential effects of drug efflux transporter expression on antiretroviral drug distribution. Sample sizes were chosen to provide <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each animal dosing group, providing statistical power to detect 15% differences in antiretroviral drug penetration between groups. Because of evolving drug treatment regimens among our clinic population, we did not meet our recruitment goal of <italic>n</italic> = 6 for each treatment group in the clinical study and thus did not meet our prespecified power requirement. Comparisons between animal models and between anatomical compartments were performed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

Drug distribution images for all antiretroviral drugs administered to this macaque (B to E) are overlaid with the localization of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells from an adjacent tissue section (F), and the colocalization is shown in (G) to (J) (drug, red; CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, green).

In the BLT mouse ileum slice (K and L), tenofovir was the only drug detected by MSI and was overlaid with the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell image (N). In the human ileum tissue section (O to R), all three drugs contained in the patient’s antiretroviral drug regimen were detected by MSI.
