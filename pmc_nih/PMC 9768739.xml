                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P4">In SPRINT, a trial of intensive (systolic blood pressure &lt;120 mm Hg) versus standard (systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mm Hg) systolic blood pressure control in patients without type 2 diabetes, we defined a phenotypic representation of the study population using 59 baseline variables. We extracted personalised treatment effect estimates for the primary outcome, time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and acute decompensated heart failure), through iterative Cox regression analyses providing average hazard ratio (HR) estimates weighted for the phenotypic distance of each participant from the index patient of each iteration. Next, we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (known as XGBoost) to predict the personalised effect of intensive systolic blood pressure control using features most consistently linked to increased personalised benefit, before evaluating its performance in the ACCORD BP trial of patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to receive intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control. We stratified patients based on their predicted treatment effect, and key demographic groups (age, sex, cardiovascular disease, and smoking). We assessed the presence of heterogeneity with an interaction test, and assessed the performance of the algorithm in a simulation analysis of SPRINT in the presence or absence of an artificially introduced heterogeneous treatment effect.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p id="P5">From SPRINT, we included all 9361 study participants (mean age 67·9 years [SD 9·4], 3332 [35·6%] female) who underwent randomisation to either intensive (n=4678) or standard (n=4683) treatment. The median individualised HR for MACE was 0·63 (IQR 0·53–0·78). An eight-feature tool built for this analysis to predict personalised benefit in SPRINT was externally tested in ACCORD BP (4733 participants (mean age 62·7 years [SD 6·7], 2258 [47·7%] female), wherein it successfully identified individuals with differential benefit from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control (adjusted HR for MACE of 0·70 [95% CI 0·55–0·90] in individuals with above-median MACE benefit versus 1·05 [95% CI 0·84–1·32] for below-median predicted benefit; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0·0184). Subgroup analysis based on age (&lt;65 years: HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·71–1·12]; ≥65 years: 0·85 [0·67–1·09]), sex (male: 0·89 [0·72–1·10]; female: 0·85 [0·65–1·10]), established cardiovascular disease (no: 0·89 [0·70–1·14]; yes: 0·84 [0·67–1·06]), or active smoking (no: 0·85 [0·71–1·02]; yes: 1·01 [0·64–1·60]) did not identify groups with heterogeneity of treatment effect. In a simulation analysis of SPRINT, the proposed algorithm detected groups with heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence, but not absence, of simulated subgroup differences.</p>

              <p id="P8">Hypertension is the modifiable metabolic risk factor with the largest contribution to cardiovascular disease burden globally.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> with systolic blood pressure considered a stronger cardiovascular risk factor than diastolic blood pressure.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Blood Pressure trial (ACCORD BP)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> tested whether targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive group) reduces the incidence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) when compared with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard group). Although both trials included individuals with a systolic blood pressure of 130–180 mm Hg who had or were at an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes was an exclusion criterion in SPRINT and an eligibility requirement in ACCORD BP. Intensive systolic blood pressure treatment demonstrated a substantial cardiovascular benefit in SPRINT,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but similar benefits were not seen in ACCORD BP.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P9">These discordant findings might suggest that the benefits of intensive systolic blood pressure control depend on the phenotypic profile of each patient. Indeed, clinical practice guidelines have suggested that systolic blood pressure targets should be based on a patient’s cardiovascular risk profile;<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> however, risk profiles alone do not adequately capture the phenotypic diversity of individuals, which is a requirement for precision care.</p>
              <p id="P10">Our research group has recently published a machine learning-based approach that enables phenotyping of a clinical trial population based on baseline characteristics to predict treatment response.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> By defining a computational trial phenomap, a mathematical construct of the individual phenotypes across all these baseline measures, we can evaluate heterogeneous treatment effects via computational approaches that account for the phenotypic similarity of all included individuals, the treatment each individual received, and their subsequent clinical outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P11">In this study, we aimed to test our hypothesis that patients with hypertension exhibit differential cardiovascular benefits from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction based on their complex phenotypic profile at baseline. Using participant-level data from SPRINT, we developed a computational phenomapping strategy that leverages information from all trial participants to infer signatures of individualised benefit of intensive systolic blood pressure lowering among patients without type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> We then evaluated its ability to identify patients with type 2 diabetes in the ACCORD BP trial who benefitted from intensive systolic blood pressure control.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>

This method constructs a phenomap (two-dimensional representation) of the population based on the full breadth of baseline phenotypes seen in the trial.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This projection allows a degree of interpretability of the distribution of patients in this multidimensional phenotypic space, through colour-coded maps.</p>

                <title>Defining personalised treatment effect estimates</title>
                <p id="P19">For each unique participant, we measured the association of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction with the primary and secondary outcomes of interest using weighted estimation by Cox regression, as proposed by Schemper and colleagues.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Weights for our analysis were derived from the dissimilarity matrix with the contribution of each patient to the final prediction dependent on their phenotypic distance from the index patient. To ensure that patients who are phenotypically closer to the index patient carried higher cumulative weights than did patients located further away, we evaluated kernels with different exponential transformations of the similarity metric, defined as (1–Gower’s distance). These values were processed through a rectified linear unit function (with SoftMax pre-processing) before their inclusion as weights in the regression models. We also analysed discrete phenotypic neighbourhood sizes consisting of 5% or 10% of the phenotypically similar patients within each patient’s neighbourhood, as per our previous work.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> We selected the weight definition that provided the most consistent estimates with neighbourhood-based methods (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix pp 3</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">14</xref>). From each personalised Cox regression model, we extracted the natural logarithmic transformation of the hazard ratio (log HR) comparing intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control. Negative values favoured intensive systolic blood pressure control as more protective against the outcome of interest. Furthermore, for each patient, we calculated the difference in the weighted mean systolic blood pressure between the intensive and standard treatment groups at 1, 6, and 12 months.</p>

                <p id="P20">We trained an extreme gradient-boosting algorithm (XGBoost)<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to predict the personalised log HRs of MACE with intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction using a subset of 32 baseline variables (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix pp 11</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">12</xref>), which were selected based on their availability and consistent definitions between SPRINT and ACCORD BP. The model was trained in a randomly selected subset of SPRINT participants, consisting of 80% of the study population, with internal validation done in the remaining 20% of the trial population. Random sampling was done in R.</p>
                <p id="P21">Specifically, the XGBoost algorithm was constructed to identify the baseline phenotypes most strongly linked to the individualised log HR values in a Cox regression model. Model performance was evaluated using root mean square error as the loss function.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Optimal hyperparameters, including the learning rate and those defining the depth and structure of the tree-based architecture, were selected (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix pp 5</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">6</xref>) using a random search, and five-fold cross-validation for internal validation. To allow for interpretation of our model’s predictions, we assessed feature importance using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values to identify a predictor’s relative contribution, either positively or negatively, to the final prediction.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Further details are given in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (pp 6</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">To improve the model’s practical application, we selected features that were most strongly associated with the cardiovascular effects of an intensive treatment strategy based on a SHAP feature importance of 0·01 or higher, identifying eight features. These features were sex, renal function (glomerular filtration rate or creatinine), history of coronary disease requiring revascularisation, history of angina, active smoking, and statin or aspirin use. We retrained our model using this set of features, based on the same approach described above, and arrived at a parsimonious tool to predict the personalised benefit of targeting a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg. The final tool was named PRECISION (for PREssure Control In hypertenSION) and an online browser-accessible version of PRECISION was also made available for external use.</p>

                <p id="P24">To assess the sensitivity of the algorithm in detecting treatment effect heterogeneity in a clinical trial population, we performed a positive and negative control simulation study. Full details of the simulation are given in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (pp 8</xref>–<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">9)</xref>. Briefly, using the baseline SPRINT characteristics, we introduced artificial endpoints in the presence or absence of treatment effect heterogeneity in a predefined subgroup (ie, women on aspirin [n=1470, 15·7% of entire cohort] versus the rest of the cohort). Treatment effect heterogeneity was introduced using the method proposed by Rigdon and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> with our first simulation (positive control) introducing an average treatment effect of 6% among women with aspirin versus no effect among the rest of the cohort, and the second simulation (negative control) introducing an average treatment effect of 1% for all groups. Follow-up time data were introduced at random using a Gompertz distribution. Similar to our analysis in the original SPRINT dataset, we performed phenomapping of the baseline trial population and extracted individualised treatment effect estimates. Following this, we trained an XGBoost model in the randomly selected training set (n=6242, 67%), before applying the algorithm in the remaining (test) set (n=3119, 33%) to (1) compare the predicted effect estimates between our predefined patient subgroups (women on aspirin versus the rest of the cohort); and (2) allow the algorithm to identify de novo subgroups with treatment effect heterogeneity.</p>

              <p id="P29">From SPRINT, we included all 9361 study participants (mean age 67·9 years [SD 9·4], 3332 [35·6%] female, 5399 [57·7%] non-Hispanic White, 2802 [29·9%] non-Hispanic Black, and 984 [10·5%] Hispanic) who underwent randomisation to either intensive (n=4678) or standard (n=4683) treatment. Participants were followed up over a mean period of 3·8 years (SD 1·0), during which a first primary MACE event was reported in 562 individuals. For the secondary outcome of net clinical benefit, there were 365 total death events and 3529 serious adverse events, with the outcome occurring in 3549 participants. In ACCORD BP, 4733 participants (mean age 62·7 years [SD 6·7], 2258 [47·7%] female, 2864 [60·5%] non-Hispanic White, 1142 [24·1%] Black, and 330 [7·0%] Hispanic) underwent randomisation to either intensive (n=2362) or standard (n=2371) treatment. Participants were followed up for a mean period of 4·9 years (SD 1·2) with 553 first MACE events recorded. Secondary outcomes were not available in a manner that enabled a direct comparison with SPRINT.</p>
              <p id="P30">The phenomap of the SPRINT trial was based on pairwise distances between all trial participants according to the Gower’s dissimilarity index using 59 baseline phenotypic variables (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Visual assessment of the risk phenomaps showed that the treatment groups were randomly distributed in the phenomic space (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). By contrast, baseline phenotypic variables, such as sex, age, 10-year Framingham Risk Score for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were heterogeneously distributed reflecting distinct phenotypic neighbourhoods (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Longitudinal blood pressure monitoring confirmed a greater weighted mean systolic blood pressure reduction in the intensive group than in the standard group, over time, with overall consistent effects across phenotypic neighbourhoods (median neighbourhood difference of −5·4 mm Hg [IQR −6·0 to −4·9] at 1 month; −13·0 mm Hg [−13·6 to −12·5] at 6 months; and −15·4 mm Hg [−15·9 to −15·0] at 12 months; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 15</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P31">We subsequently calculated individualised estimates of cardiovascular and net clinical benefit with intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction by fitting a Cox regression model for each individual, weighted based on their phenotypic similarity to the rest of the trial participants. For the primary outcome of MACE, the median individualised HR (iHR) was 0·63 (IQR 0·53–0·78), with 8800 (94·0%) patients exhibiting an iHR of less than 1, favouring intensive systolic blood pressure treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, for the secondary (net benefit) endpoint of serious adverse events and all-cause mortality, the median iHR was 1·08 (1·01–1·15), with 1988 (21·2%) patient neighbourhoods exhibiting an iHR of less than 1 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). In sensitivity analyses, iHRs were poorly correlated with the baseline cardiovascular risk observed in patients in the control group of each phenotypic neighbourhood (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=−0·04, 95% CI −0·06 to −0·02), but were moderately to strongly associated with the observed absolute risk reduction (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=0·65, 0·64 to 0·66; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 16</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P32">An XGBoost algorithm that predicts a patient’s individualised hazard (log HR) based on baseline phenotypic variables, also collected in ACCORD BP, was trained and internally validated in SPRINT. SHAP analysis showed sex, renal function (glomerular filtration rate or creatinine), history of coronary disease requiring revascularisation, history of angina, active smoking, and statin or aspirin use to be key predictors of the individualised MACE benefit of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P33">When we trained an XGBoost tree algorithm on the subset of the eight most important features, there was no evidence of overfitting to SPRINT, with a root mean square error of 0·1930 (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0·47) in the 20% of the holdout test set from SPRINT, compared with 0·1864 (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0·52) in the training set consisting of 80% of the SPRINT participants. The learning curve for the performance of the XGBoost algorithm in the training and holdout SPRINT datasets is shown in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (p 17)</xref>. There was strong correlation between the predictions of the parsimonious (eight variables) and full model (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>=0·97, 95% CI 0·96–0·97).</p>
              <p id="P34">Application of the tool in the independent ACCORD BP trial showed that the predicted personalised benefit of intensive systolic blood pressure reduction did not differ between the intensive and standard treatment groups (p=0·46), which is consistent with the random allocation of these treatments (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 18</xref>). However, individuals with the highest predicted personalised MACE benefit had a lower actual MACE risk when assigned to intensive treatment than to standard treatment, with an adjusted HR for time-to-first MACE of 0·70 (95% CI 0·55–0·90) in individuals with above-median predicted benefit (high responders) versus 1·05 (95% CI 0·84–1·32) for below median predicted benefit (low responders; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>, p<sub>interaction</sub>=0·0184). Nelson-Aalen plots demonstrating the cumulative incidence of MACE in patients with high versus low predicted benefit are shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>. Among predicted high responders, the hazard curve started to separate 1 year after enrolment in ACCORD BP. These findings were consistent in an analysis where inverse probability censoring weighted estimator accounted for possible dependent censoring (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix p 19</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P37">Using data from SPRINT, we developed a machine learning-based tool that defines the individualised cardiovascular benefit from intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction based on eight core clinical features: sex, renal function (glomerular filtration rate or creatinine), history of coronary disease requiring revascularisation, history of angina, active smoking, and statin or aspirin use. The tool successfully defined a personalised benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering beyond the SPRINT population in patients with type 2 diabetes in the ACCORD BP trial, although there was no benefit from the approach in the overall study population.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Our algorithm, based on the full breadth and complex inter-relationships of recorded baseline phenotypic information, enabled the extraction of personalised estimates of cardiovascular benefit through iterative analyses of the data from each participant’s unique phenotypic angle. The strategy was robust in simulation experiments with positive and negative control outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P38">Previous studies have suggested heterogeneous treatment effects in SPRINT defined as an association between an individual’s baseline cardiovascular disease risk and the magnitude of absolute risk reduction with intensive versus systolic blood pressure control.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> To this end, various machine learning approaches—including recursive partition modelling,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> k-means clustering,<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and X-learners<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>—have been used to define broad patient groups that experience differential benefit from intensive blood pressure reduction. However, reliance on such broad subgroups and a priori exclusion of variables from the analysis based on presumed lack of clinical significance might restrict the applicability of these approaches.</p>
              <p id="P39">By contrast, our approach identified complex interactions between a patient’s sex, baseline renal function,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> cardiovascular risk profile (eg, anginal symptoms and previous coronary revascularisation), active smoking, and statin or aspirin use as key determinants of the personalised benefits of targeting a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg as opposed to less than 140 mm Hg. Our analysis also highlights how differences in the trial-wide outcomes for SPRINT and ACCORD BP might ultimately reflect differences in phenotypes of patients enrolled in the two trials, and therefore supports the cardiovascular benefits of intensive systolic blood pressure reduction in type 2 diabetes,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> despite the main results of ACCORD BP, which showed no substantial benefits for intensive systolic blood pressure reduction in this population.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P40">We believe that the present work represents a contribution in both methodological and clinical domains. First, our approach treats a trial phenomap as a continuum for evaluating individualised effect estimates. This method expands on our previous work<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> by yielding robust estimates that incorporate information from all participants in each iteration. Second, in contrast to previous approaches,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> by modelling the relative risk change, our study provides insights into the phenotypic characteristics that determine the extent to which a patient’s baseline cardiovascular risk is modifiable through intensive systolic blood pressure control. Third, our analysis provides a framework for learning from a positive trial to infer patient-level effectiveness in a null trial on hypertension management. Fourth, simulation studies demonstrate the ability of our method to detect meaningful heterogeneous treatment effects in the presence of a ground truth, without overfitting to random noise. Future studies should explore how our approach can complement alternative solutions that have found successful applications across disciplines, such as random forest-based approaches,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> “U-learners”,<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> transformed outcome trees,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> or the modified outcome method.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Finally, PRECISION, our decision support tool, is aimed at supporting shared decision making between patients and their health-care providers. The PRECISION tool shifts the focus from applying average effects of blood pressure reduction observed in a positive clinical trial to risk reduction for individuals based on their characteristics. Future clinical trials should explore the value of a decision support tool-guided pathway versus traditional pathways in guiding blood pressure management and combating therapeutic inertia.</p>
              <p id="P41">Our study has a few limitations. First, variation in effect estimates drawn from weighted analyses around each patient’s phenotypic location could be prone to random variation. Future studies should explore the robustness of a dynamic kernel definition, as opposed to a fixed kernel as used in this study. Second, to ensure consistency with the original trials, we chose the original primary outcome as our outcome of interest, with net clinical benefit analyses provided as secondary outcomes that could not generalise across studies due to variable definitions. Third, notable differences in the study design between SPRINT and ACCORD BP—such as the exclusion versus inclusion of patients with diabetes and use of unattended versus attended blood pressure measurements in SPRINT versus ACCORD BP—preclude direct validation of our findings, but support the generalisability of our tool. Fourth, further testing of our tool in diverse patient populations is needed to better understand the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic factors that might underlie such heterogeneous treatment effects. Fifth, our analysis was not compared with other potential methods proposed for the study of heterogeneous treatment effects in trials. However, our approach—which was externally validated in a second independent trial (ACCORD BP) and detected a simulated treatment effect—can be used as a framework to benchmark other methods. Finally, the algorithm should be evaluated prospectively before clinical implementation as a decision support tool.</p>
              <p id="P42">In this post-hoc analysis of two randomised clinical trials of systolic blood pressure control, we developed a machine learning-guided, evidence-based tool to extract individualised treatment effects based on participant-level data. When applied in two trials of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure control, our method identified explainable phenotypes associated with heterogeneous treatment effects that generalise to patients without and with type 2 diabetes. More importantly, our broader method provides a personalised approach to the translation of clinical trial findings and promotes the use of shared decision-making through personalised inference.</p>

                <title>Evidence before this study</title>
                <p id="P54">Hypertension is a key modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although the effects of blood pressure reduction in hypertension are well established, the optimal treatment goals for individual patients remain under debate. We searched PubMed on July 19, 2021, for studies published in English and relating to decision support tools to guide the personalisation of systolic blood pressure treatment targets. A second search was performed on Sept 29, 2022, with the same search criteria, to update our literature review. We used the search terms “hypertension”, “intensive blood pressure control”, “systolic blood pressure”, “heterogeneity”, and “machine learning”. Our search returned 5278 papers, 29 of which were relevant to the topic. Two large randomised clinical trials have evaluated the effect of intensive systolic blood pressure lowering for cardiovascular risk reduction. The SPRINT trial found that targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) as opposed to less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment) reduces the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with hypertension but without diabetes (types 1 and 2). By contrast, the ACCORD BP trial did not show a cardiovascular benefit for the intensive versus standard treatment strategy in type 2 diabetes. Our search revealed several studies and approaches for detecting and describing heterogeneity in the effects of intensive systolic blood pressure treatment. To date, studies have used a mixture of approaches, ranging from regression modelling with interaction effects to machine learning algorithms. Although many studies have suggested that the absolute risk reduction with intensive systolic blood pressure control is proportional to the baseline cardiovascular disease risk, others have demonstrated that more advanced machine learning algorithms might improve the detection of individualised treatment effects. Nevertheless, most previous studies restricted their analysis to modelling of absolute risk reduction, relied on a smaller number of recorded covariates, defined discrete numbers of phenotypic clusters, or did not demonstrate generalisability of their approach to independent patient populations.</p>

                <title>Added value of this study</title>
                <p id="P55">In this post-hoc analysis of SPRINT and ACCORD BP, we used machine learning to construct computational clinical trial phenomaps and investigate patient-level heterogeneity in treatment effectiveness of intensive blood pressure control. We leveraged this heterogeneity to develop an evidence-based tool to personalise the consideration for pursuing intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure treatment goals among patients without and with type 2 diabetes with high cardiovascular risk. This individualised approach to evidence synthesis could represent a novel strategy to maximise the benefits of intensive blood pressure control and might be a valuable adjunct to inform shared decision making in clinical practice. The approach also highlights a potential strategy for personalised inference from randomised clinical trials.</p>

                <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
                <p id="P56">Here, we present an objective decision support tool derived from two of the largest randomised clinical trials, to date, to have assessed the cardiovascular benefit of intensive versus standard systolic blood pressure reduction in hypertension. This tool might facilitate a more standardised, yet personalised, approach in the selection of optimal treatment goals for individual patients. Our analyses demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity in the individual benefit derived from pursuing intensive blood pressure control, and that phenotypic features that define benefit from intensive systolic blood pressure reduction might generalise to patients without and with type 2 diabetes.</p>
