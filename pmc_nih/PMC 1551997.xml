                  <p>To explore the potential association between asbestos exposure and risk
of autoimmune disease, we conducted a case–control study among
a cohort of 7,307 current and former residents of Libby, Montana, a
community with historical occupational and environmental exposure to asbestos-contaminated
vermiculite.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Cases were defined as those who reported having one of three systemic autoimmune
diseases (SAIDs): systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Controls were randomly selected at a 3:1 ratio

                  <p>The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for SAIDs
among those ≥ 65 years of age who had worked for the vermiculite
mining company were 2.14 (95% CI, 0.90–5.10) for
all SAIDs and 3.23 (95% CI, 1.31–7.96) for RA. In this
age group, exposure to asbestos while in the military was also an independent
risk factor, resulting in a tripling in risk. Other measures
of occupational exposure to vermiculite indicated 54% and 65% increased
risk for SAIDs and RA, respectively. Those who had
reported frequent contact with vermiculite through various exposure pathways
also demonstrated elevated risk for SAIDs and RA. We found increasing
risk estimates for SAIDs with increasing numbers of reported vermiculite
exposure pathways (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

                  <p>These preliminary findings support the hypothesis that asbestos exposure
is associated with autoimmune disease. Refined measurements of asbestos
exposure and SAID status among this cohort will help to further clarify
the relationship between these variables.</p>

          <body>
            <p>An association between occupational exposures of inhaled particulates and
autoimmunity was postulated as early as 1914, when <xref rid="b1-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Bramwell (1914)</xref> reported increased frequency of diffuse scleroderma (SSc) in stone masons. Although
genetic factors undoubtedly exist that affect the development
of systemic autoimmune diseases (SAIDs) in certain individuals, the
concordance of SAIDs among identical twins is only 25–40%, suggesting
that environmental factors play a substantial role (<xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al. 1999</xref>). Indeed, several environmental agents are implicated in triggering or
accelerating SAIDs, including mercury, iodine, vinyl chloride, certain
pharmaceuticals, and crystalline silica. However, much more research
is needed to determine the mechanisms and epidemiology linking exposures
to development of SAIDs. There is considerable epidemiologic evidence
supporting the hypothesis that occupational silica exposure is associated
with a variety of SAIDs, including SSc, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis, and small
vessel vasculitis (<xref rid="b7-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Koeger et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b13-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Parks et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b14-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Powell et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b19-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Steenland and Goldsmith 1995</xref>). Research regarding asbestos exposure and SAIDs has been much more limited.</p>
            <p>Asbestos-related lung disease continues to be a serious and significant
problem worldwide despite increasing awareness of health hazards of asbestos
inhalation. Asbestos exposure is associated with various lung
conditions, including fibrosis, pleural plaques, and cancer. Although
the exact mechanisms leading to the progression of these conditions have
not been fully explained, there is evidence that some of the lung abnormalities
seen with both asbestos and silica exposures are immunologically
mediated (<xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b4-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Holian et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="b16-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Perkins et al. 1993</xref>). Nevertheless, it is unclear how these innate immune responses might
translate to specific humoral responses. Increased serum immunoglobulins (Ig), positive
antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests, and immune complexes
have been reported in small cohorts of individuals exposed to asbestos (<xref rid="b8-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Lange 1980</xref>; <xref rid="b11-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Nigam et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b17-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Pfau et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b22-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Zerva et al. 1989</xref>), but no comprehensive study has been undertaken to assess the association
between asbestos exposure and autoimmune disease.</p>
            <p>Our major objective, therefore, is to establish whether such an association
exists, and the community of Libby, Montana, provides a unique opportunity
to investigate this question. Individuals in this population
experienced significant exposures that occurred as a result of asbestos-contaminated
vermiculite mining near the community. From the early 1920s
to 1990, the world’s largest vermiculite deposits, located
near Libby, were mined and processed. Vermiculite is a silicate mineral
with unique properties and numerous commercial applications (<xref rid="b9-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Lockey 1984</xref>). The fibrous minerals contaminating Libby vermiculite have been characterized
as both regulated asbestos fibers (e.g., tremolite and other
amphibole forms) and unregulated fibers (e.g., winchite and richterite) (<xref rid="b10-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Meeker et al. 2003</xref>). The various mining, transportation, and processing activities as well
as the personal and commercial use of vermiculite in the community have
led to widespread environmental exposures in the Libby area with this
asbestos-contaminated vermiculite. Potential asbestos exposures in
this community have been documented not only in the miners but also in
their family members as well as anyone who used the vermiculite or played
near the mine tailings (<xref rid="b2-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Dixon et al. 1985</xref>). A mortality study in this community found more than 40-fold increases
in standardized mortality ratios for asbestosis, and elevated mortality
also was observed for malignant neoplasm of respiratory and intrathoracic
organs (Horton et al., in press).</p>
            <p>Recently, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducted
an extensive screening program of &gt; 7,300 individuals from
this community (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Peipins et al. 2003</xref>). The initial results of this screening program identified various routes
of exposure in the community and how those routes of exposure were
associated with abnormalities on chest radiographs (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Peipins et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, when the ATSDR performed its screening in Libby during 2000–2001, 494 (6.7%) participants indicated that they
had been diagnosed with SLE, SSc, or RA (<xref rid="b12-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Noonan et al. 2005</xref>). By comparison, a prevalence of &lt; 1% for these three conditions
combined would be expected based on pooled estimates from 43 prevalence
studies (<xref rid="b6-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al. 1997</xref>). In the present study, we take these data a step further by exploring
the association of these systemic autoimmune conditions with various
parameters of asbestos and/or vermiculite exposure using a nested case–control
approach.</p>
            <sec sec-type="materials|methods">
              <title>Materials and Methods</title>
              <p>All human subjects provided informed consent for this study under a protocol
approved by the institutional review board for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The details of the ATSDR screening program
are described elsewhere (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Peipins et al. 2003</xref>). Briefly, individuals were eligible for the screening program if they
had resided, worked, attended school, or participated in other activities
in the Libby area for at least 6 months before 31 December 1990. All
screening participants who were ≥ 18 years of age and not
pregnant (<italic>n</italic> = 6,668) were offered chest radiographs. Two independent B readers
evaluated the radiographs for each subject for pleural and parenchymal
abnormalities. If these two readers disagreed regarding the presence
of pneumoconiosis for a subject, a third reader was used to adjudicate
the difference. Participants were classified as “positive” for
pleural or parenchymal abnormalities if at least two of
three B readers observed this type of abnormality on chest radiographs. Participants
also received spirometry testing and were considered to
have abnormal findings if they had a forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 80% predicted
and a ratio of 1 sec forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) to FVC that is ≥ 70% predicted. Data on exposure to asbestos-contaminated
vermiculite were based on occupational, residential, and
recreational histories collected during in-person interviews. Demographic
variables and data on other potential covariates were also
collected by in-person interview.</p>
              <p>This study was conducted in two phases. The initial characterization of
cases (<italic>n</italic> = 494) with SAIDs were those participants who, during the 2000–2001 ATSDR
screening program, responded affirmatively to the
question “Have you ever had rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or
lupus?” Potential controls were those screening participants
who answered negatively to this question. Controls were randomly selected
from within strata of sex and 10-year age groups at a 3:1 control-to-case
ratio (<italic>n</italic> = 1,482) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0114-001243">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>The initial screening question on SAIDs was collected only to identify
screening participants with health conditions that could have an impact
on pulmonary function or fibrosis. The second phase of this study involved
a mailed questionnaire to confirm the original self-reports of
SAIDs and to identify which of the three conditions the potential cases
were reporting. The follow-up survey was mailed to all 494 potential
SAID cases for whom current addresses were available. The follow-up survey
queried potential cases on whether or not they still considered
themselves to have one of the three indicated SAIDs, which SAID(s) they
had, whether or not their SAIDs were diagnosed by a physician, and whether
or not they were taking medication or other treatment for their
condition. For those reporting RA, additional questions were asked to
confirm the type of arthritis on which they were reporting (i.e., RA, osteoarthritis, or
general arthritis). This follow-up survey was approved
by the University of Montana investigational review board.</p>
              <p>Analyses were conducted using unconditional logistic regression using SAS (version 9; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The presence or absence
of SAIDs or a specific autoimmune disease in the postmailing analysis
was used as the dependent variable. The various pathways of exposure to
vermiculite and/or asbestos were considered as the main independent
variables of interest. Test for trend with increasing numbers of exposure
pathways was assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Potential confounders
included indications of restrictive spirometry and the presence
of pleural or parenchymal abnormalities. These pulmonary features
were the main outcomes of the ATSDR screening program and could be independently
associated with both asbestos exposure and biomarkers of autoimmunity (<xref rid="b17-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Pfau et al. 2005</xref>). For the final unconditional logistic regression models, all vermiculite/asbestos
exposure pathways and other potential risk factors were considered. Criteria
for inclusion in the final model included statistical
significance of the explanatory variable (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10), the presence of a confounding effect on other variables, and
the fit of the model.</p>

              <p>The distribution of SAID subjects for selected characteristics are presented
in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001243">Table 1</xref>. Among the 494 subjects responding positively to the original SAID screening
question, 287 (58%) were women. More than 75% of
SAID subjects lived in Libby for at least 15 years. Follow-up mailed
questionnaires were sent to all 494 subjects who were classified as having
SAIDs in the initial analysis. Of these, 208 (43%) participants
responded. Among those responding, 161 participants confirmed
that they had a physician-diagnosed SAID. The proportional distribution
of those reporting physician-diagnosed SAIDs was similar to the original 494 who
reported SAIDs with regard to sex, age, smoking history, and
years lived in Libby (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001243">Table 1</xref>). Among those reporting physician-diagnosed SAIDs, 129 participants indicated
that they had physician-diagnosed RA, 70% of whom took
medication for RA. Thirty participants indicated that they had physician-diagnosed
SLE, 63% of whom took medication for SLE. Another
four participants indicated that they had SSc, and two of those took

for cases and controls (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.90). Current and former smokers were more common among SAID subjects [odds
ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.22–2.44]. SAIDs also were associated
with parenchymal abnormalities and with restrictive spirometry but not
strongly with pleural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001243">Table 2</xref>). These associations remained consistent when evaluating those reporting
physician-diagnosed SAIDs (<italic>n</italic> = 161) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001243">Table 2</xref>). Both restrictive spirometry and parenchymal abnormalities as well as
current or former smoking were included in the unconditional logistic
regression models for vermiculite/asbestos exposure and risk of SAIDs.</p>
              <p>The adjusted ORs for various potential exposure pathways to vermiculite
and asbestos and risk of SAIDs are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ehp0114-001243">Table 3</xref>. Previous occupation with the mining company yielded no overall increased
risk for SAIDs (OR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.69–1.58). However, we
observed elevated ORs for previous occupation with the
mining company among those ≥ 65 years of age at the time of
the screening, particularly for RA. Among other occupational vermiculite
exposures, “dust or vermiculite exposure at jobs other than
W.R. Grace/Zonolite” was the most consistently associated with
reporting of any SAID or RA specifically. Among other occupations with
potential exposure to asbestos, only those reporting asbestos exposure
in the military were at increased risk for SAIDs and RA, yielding
ORs of 1.70 and 2.11, respectively. Several reported activities or experiences
were associated with increased risk of any SAID or RA specifically. Considering
all exposure pathways collectively, increasing opportunities
for vermiculite and/or asbestos exposure yielded increasing
risk estimates for SAIDs and RA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ehp0114-001243">Table 4</xref>). Although the number of SLE cases was too small (<italic>n</italic> = 30) to evaluate for trend as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ehp0114-001243">Table 4</xref>, we did observe an elevated risk for SLE among those with more than three
pathways of exposure versus those with three or fewer pathways of
exposure (OR = 4.45; 95% CI, 1.24–16.00). We did
not observe sufficient numbers of SSc cases to evaluate this disease
by asbestos exposure pathways.</p>
              <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ehp0114-001243">Table 5</xref> presents final unconditional logistic regression models in which all exposure
pathways and other potential risk factors were considered for
their contribution to the risk of SAIDs and RA. Because older participants
had differing occupational risk factors, we constructed models stratified
by age. For participants &lt; 65 years of age, dust or vermiculite
exposure at jobs other than W.R. Grace/Zonolite was the only occupational
exposure that remained in the models for both SAIDs and RA. For
participants ≥ 65 years of age, asbestos exposure in the military
yielded substantially elevated risk estimates for both SAIDs and
RA. For this age group, working at W.R. Grace/Zonolite also resulted
in a 3-fold greater risk for RA. Elevated ORs were also observed for
several nonoccupational exposures to vermiculite (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-ehp0114-001243">Table 5</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Although there is considerable epidemiologic evidence supporting the hypothesis
that occupational silica exposure is associated with a variety
of SAIDs, research regarding asbestos exposure and SAIDs has been much
more limited. The preliminary findings presented here support the hypothesis
that asbestos exposure is associated with the presence of autoimmune
disease. We found increased risk for SAIDs among those reporting
occupational and environmental or recreational exposures to vermiculite
and/or asbestos. Increased risk estimates were found for increasing
numbers of reported exposure pathways. The risk estimates by exposure
pathway remained elevated and in some cases increased after restricting
the cases to those who responded to a follow-up survey and confirmed
that they had a physician-diagnosed SAID or RA specifically. We recognize
the limitation of this approach of combining exposure pathways
of unequal intensity and duration, but it also provides an analysis
that parallels the previously observed findings of asbestos exposure and
lung abnormalities in this population (<xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Peipins et al. 2003</xref>). The multivariable analysis identified specific exposure pathways that
were independently associated with risk of SAIDs, including older subjects
who had worked for the mining company. Among older participants, we
also observed increased risk estimates for SAIDs and RA among those
reporting exposure to asbestos in the military. The risk for military
asbestos exposure was independent of the elevated risk for previous
work at W.R. Grace/Zonolite and other Libby exposure pathways. These
findings suggested that asbestos exposure in general rather than Libby
vermiculite exposure in particular could be relevant to SAID etiology.</p>
              <p>These findings were consistent with a recent immunologic study we undertook
among a small group of volunteers from this same Libby community (<xref rid="b17-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Pfau et al. 2005</xref>). The results of that study supported the hypothesis that increased frequency
of positive ANA would be found in the Libby group compared to
an age- and sex-matched unexposed population in Missoula, Montana. Among
the Libby volunteers, the titers of the positive ANAs were positively
correlated with the length of the individual’s estimated asbestos
exposure. Previous studies have measured several immune parameters
in populations exposed to asbestos. Investigators in India demonstrated
increased IgG, IgA, and positive ANAs in asbestos-exposed individuals, compared
to controls, even in the absence of apparent lung disease (<xref rid="b11-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Nigam et al. 1993</xref>). This finding suggested that immune alterations may precede the onset
of asbestos-related disease. A high frequency of positive ANAs was also
found in a Japanese group of asbestos plant workers (<xref rid="b20-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al. 1993</xref>). Interestingly, a 3-year follow-up study of the Japanese group showed
significant correlation of positive ANAs with progression of disease, leading
to additional diagnoses of asbestosis in a previously healthy
group (<xref rid="b21-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al. 1996</xref>). A study of Greek residents exposed to asbestos-contaminated whitewash
showed a correlation of immune abnormalities particularly in individuals
with pleural plaques (<xref rid="b22-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Zerva et al. 1989</xref>), whereas the Japanese study showed a greater effect in individuals with
diffuse fibrosis but not pleural plaques. In addition, a Polish study
reported increased ANA frequency particularly in individuals exhibiting
lung function deficits (<xref rid="b8-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Lange 1980</xref>).</p>
              <p>Despite some inconsistency between the studies cited above, all of these
immunologic studies illustrate two important considerations. First, asbestos
exposure is clearly associated with indices of autoimmune responses. Second, although
the details vary, the auto-immune responses appear
to correlate with asbestos-related disease, suggesting a possible
role for the autoimmune responses in the disease process. The temporal
relationship among asbestos exposure, autoimmune response, and asbestos-related
diseases is uncertain and beyond the scope of the present
study. Nevertheless, our findings of strong associations between asbestos
and/or vermiculite exposure and risk of SAIDs remained robust after
adjusting for objectively characterized pulmonary conditions that could
be associated with asbestos exposure.</p>
              <p>As described previously, the initial case group was based on those who
responded positively to a screening question about autoimmune conditions. Asbestos
exposure and SAIDs is a relatively novel avenue of research, so
it is not expected that participants would overreport SAIDs because
of a suspected association. For the same reason, we would not expect
self-reported asbestos exposure to be differentially misclassified
with respect to SAID status. As a first step toward improving disease
characterization, we conducted a mailing to all participants who indicated
having an SAID during the initial screening program. Of those who
responded to the mailing, almost 23% were unable to confirm
that they had RA, SLE, or SSc. In general, when restricting the analyses
to those reporting any physician-diagnosed SAID or RA specifically, the
risk estimates for several pathways of asbestos and/or vermiculite
exposure were increased. Comparisons of risk estimates between the original
group of suspected cases and those who reconfirmed diagnosis should
be made with caution, however, because both sets of cases are based
on self-report.</p>
              <p>Given the unique circumstances of community asbestos exposure and the resulting
screening program, it is also possible that there was a case
ascertainment error that was biased with respect to exposure. Specifically, those
with greater history of asbestos exposure would be more likely
to have lung abnormalities or frank asbestos-related disease and
would have received more intensive medical care. Better medical care could, in
turn, result in a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with other
conditions such as SAIDs. This concern is somewhat tempered by the
fact that pleural abnormality, the asbestos-related condition that has
been most strongly associated with asbestos exposure in this population, was
not associated with reporting of SAIDs.</p>
              <p>It is also possible, but less likely, that disease status was misclassified
among controls. Controls were chosen from among those in the cohort
who responded negatively to the screening questions about autoimmune
conditions, but we did not confirm the absence of disease among these
selected controls. It is possible that some participants with SAIDs
did not understand the screening questions and were inappropriately included
in the pool of potential controls. This possibility is expected
to be of minor concern based on the low prevalence of these conditions
in the general population (<xref rid="b6-ehp0114-001243" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study could suffer from exposure misclassification because these measures
were based on self-reported responses as part of a large community-based
screening program. Recall bias is a possibility, and persons
with chronic health conditions such as SAIDs could overreport past exposure
to vermiculite. In the future, we plan to improve on exposure
characterization for this cohort, incorporating job exposure matrices
and quantitative or semiquantitative assessment of other exposure pathways.</p>
              <p>In summary, these preliminary findings provide a unique insight into the
risk for autoimmune disease among a population with historical asbestos
exposures. These results warrant a more comprehensive case–control
study of this population with improved disease and exposure characterization
and the incorporation of biomarkers of genetic susceptibility.</p>
