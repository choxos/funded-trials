                <p>Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) have marked biologic and clinical heterogeneity, which confounds treatment decisions. Advances in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays using next-generation sequencing (NGS) have improved the detection of molecular relapse and driver mutations in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and show the potential utility of ctDNA across lymphomas. We investigated NGS-based monitoring of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences in patients with PTCL undergoing frontline treatment. Of 45 patients, 34 (76%) had tumor-specific clonotypes of the TCRβ or TCRγ genes identified, which included 18 (86%) from baseline tissue and 16 (67%) from baseline serum. Twenty-five (74%) patients had both TCRβ and TCRγ clonotypes, 23 (68%) had more than 1 TCRγ clonotype, and 4 (9%) had multiple TCRβ or TCRγ clonotypes, demonstrating significant intrapatient clonotypic heterogeneity. Among 24 patients with available serial serum samples during treatment, 9 (38%) cleared ctDNA after 2 cycles of therapy, and 11 (46%) had detectable ctDNA at the end of treatment. Patients with detectable ctDNA after therapy showed a trend toward worse survival. Notably, 2 patients with persistently detectable ctDNA after therapy remained in remission with 10 years of follow-up. Clonotypic heterogeneity in tumors and persistence, despite long-term remission, suggests variability in oncological potential.

              <p>Peripheral T-cell lymphom as (PTCLs) are among the most biologically and clinically heterogeneous lymphomas.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although frontline therapy cures approximately 75% of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL), fewer than 20% of patients with PTCL subtypes other than ALCL achieve long-term remission.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2-4</sup></xref> While autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is commonly used as consolidation after first remission in ALK<sup>−</sup> PTCL,<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> its necessity is unproven.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6-9</sup></xref> Furthermore, patient selection is largely empirical, highlighting the need for molecular tools for risk-adapted patient selection. Analyses of a mono- or oligoclonal T-cell population, including flow cytometry for TCRVβ and TCRβ constant region 1,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10,11</xref></sup> multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> rearrangments,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of TCR complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3)<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13,14</xref></sup> can diagnose and provide prognostic information in PTCL but require circulating lymphoma cells, which limits broad applicability.</p>
              <p>Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a minimally invasive and tumor-specific biomarker that is being explored in a variety of lymphomas to study disease biology and to aid in clinical decision making.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15–19</sup></xref> In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), rearranged immunoglobulin receptor genes can be detected, quantified, and tracked with high-throughput sequencing assays in the peripheral blood.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15,16</xref></sup> In one study, a tumor-specific clonotype was identified in the serum of 126 (64%) of 198 patients with DLBCL, quantitatively correlated with disease burden, and detected molecular relapse a median of 3.5 months before computed tomographic (CT) scans.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Another study confirmed these findings and demonstrated that the cell-free compartment in blood is superior for analysis of ctDNA in DLBCL.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We hypothesized that sequencing of the CDR3 region of <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> genes from cell-free DNA in serum would identify and quantify tumor-specific clonotypes in PTCL and allow for a minimally invasive assessment of therapy effectiveness, as well as provide a surveillance tool after therapy. Using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method targeting immunoglobulin receptor sequences, we assessed the predictive and prognostic ability of ctDNA in uniformly treated patients with PTCL who were undergoing frontline therapy.</p>

                <p>We analyzed ctDNA in patients with previously untreated PTCL who were subsequently treated with a clinical protocol involving dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-EPOCH) from May 1993 through December 2015. Previously, we had reported on the performance of immunoglobin receptor gene sequences as ctDNA in patients with subtypes of DLBCL treated with this protocol.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Eligibility for this correlative analysis was restricted to patients with nodal and extranodal PTCL subtypes, according to the World Health Organization’s diagnostic criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Additional key eligibility criteria included age ≥12 years, no previous treatment, and adequate major organ function, unless disease related, along with other criteria (supplemental Material). Patients with HIV, active symptomatic ischemic heart disease, and a history of systemic neoplasms within 5 years of treatment were excluded. Eligibility assessment included history and physical examination; standard laboratory tests; contrast CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis; and lumbar puncture, if clinically indicated.</p>

                <p>Diagnostic biopsies were stored as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. The protocol included prespecified collection and banking of research serum samples before therapy, before each cycle of chemotherapy, at the end of induction, and at each surveillance visit. At each time point, 10 mL of blood was drawn into a red-top serum-separator tube, centrifuged, divided into 1-mL aliquots in Eppendorf tubes, and stored at no lower than −20°C. Research blood samples were drawn only at the time of protocol-specified visits. DNA from pretreatment serum samples and FFPE biopsy specimens, when available, was analyzed for dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes, as previously described.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> For patients without baseline FFPE samples, only pretreatment serum samples were used for clonotype detection.</p>

                <p>Using high-throughput amplification and sequencing of the CDR3 of the <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ/TCRγ</italic> genes, distinct <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes were identified and quantified within each sample, and their relative frequency was calculated. The amount of each rearrangement was determined with a synthetic <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> repertoire that controls for PCR bias and quantifies the number of rearrangements within a sample, as previously described.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes were presumed to be tumor specific if they comprised &gt;3% of like sequences, were in &gt;0.2% of nucleated cells (FFPE), had &gt;40 observations, and had &lt;5 clonotypes within a 10-fold frequency, based on cellular clonotype detection in other T-cell malignancies.<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24,26</xref></sup> These were cataloged and tracked in subsequent samples. For cell-based samples (FFPE) the unit of quantification was the number of lymphoma cells quantified through <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ/TCRγ</italic> molecules (equivalent to 1 tumor cell) per 10<sup>6</sup> diploid genomes (equivalent to 10<sup>6</sup> cells). Identification and quantification were performed on all serum samples of patients with an identified <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ/TCRγ</italic> sequence, and the number of tumor-associated rearrangements was expressed per milliliter of serum input into the assay. The assay is capable of detecting 1 lymphoma ctDNA molecule within a sample. Interim monitoring was performed on all samples collected at the start of each cycle. Surveillance monitoring was performed on serial samples from the end of treatment (EoT) until disease progression and included only patients who achieved a complete response (CR). When there were multiple dominant clonotypes, the one with the most clonotypes per milliliter was used in all quantitative analyses. All analyses of ctDNA were performed by clinicians blinded to clinical outcomes.</p>

                <p>Median follow-up included time from the on-study date to death or last follow-up. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to date of progression, alternative therapy for active lymphoma, death, or date of last follow-up, and overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of study enrollment to date of death or date of last follow-up, according to the Kaplan-Meier method. We used the log-rank test, χ<sup>2</sup> test, and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, as appropriate. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ctDNA at 2 different time points (after 2 cycles and at EoT), as a test of early progression, by dichotomizing ctDNA measurements as “present” or “absent” and using clinical events vs no progression as the reference standard.</p>

                <title>Patients and baseline tissue samples</title>
                <p>Of the 54 patients with PTCL screened, 45 (83%) had baseline FFPE and/or baseline serum that could be tracked as tumor-specific clonotypes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Of those, 21 (47%) had FFPE samples available, including 16 (36%) with both baseline FFPE and serum available. Twenty-four (53%) patients had only baseline serum available for calibration. Eighteen (86%) of the 21 patients with FFPE samples available and 16 (67%) of the 24 patients with only baseline serum available had at least 1 dominant TCR rearrangement identified for tracking. Overall, 34 (76%) patients with available baseline samples had a tumor-specific clonotype identified for monitoring, and they comprised the study cohort. After a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 0.1-15.4), 20 (59%) patients clinically progressed or required alternative therapy for active lymphoma, and 14 (41%) remained free of clinical progression (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The study population included multiple subtypes of PTCL with the most common being ALK<sup>+</sup> and ALK<sup>−</sup> ALCL (32%) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS; 29%). As expected, clinical nonprogressors were more likely to have the ALCL subtype (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02) and to present with a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .02) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Almost all patients (94%) had advanced stage and the majority (64%) had either an intermediate-high- or high-risk International Prognostic Index (IPI) score.</p>

                <title>Clonotypic heterogeneity</title>
                <p>Significant clonotypic heterogeneity was observed in both FFPE and serum. In 18 patients with dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes identified from baseline FFPE samples, 15 (83%) also had TCR clonotypes identified from the serum (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, 13 dominant TCR clonotypes in 7 patients were exclusively detected in the serum, but not in the FFPE samples. Across individual patients, a median of 3 (range, 1-8) dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes were identified, including both tissue sources, and 17 (94%) patients had dominant clonotypes of both <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic>. The lone exception was a patient who had a singular dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> clonotype identified in FFPE tissue (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In 16 patients who had <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes detected exclusively from baseline serum, a median of 2 (range, 1-3) dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes were identified, and all 16 patients had at least 1 dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> clonotype identified, whereas 9 (56%) had a dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic> clonotype identified (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).

All 34 (100%) patients had at least 1 dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> clonotype, and 25 (74%) had at least 1 dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic> clonotype identified for tracking throughout therapy (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). The number of dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes was also variable across PTCL subtypes.

                <p>With a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 0.1-15.4), the median EFS and OS of the study patients was 3.5 years (95% CI, 0.3-12.6) and 11.5 years (95% CI, 2.5 years to not reached [NR]), respectively (supplemental Figure 1A-B).

                <title>Circulating tumor DNA kinetics during treatment</title>
                <p>We next investigated whether clearance of ctDNA as minimal residual disease (MRD) during therapy was associated with improved clinical outcomes in 33 patients with at least 1 serum sample collected during therapy (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Quantitative analysis of paired samples revealed a median 2.6-log decrease in ctDNA level after the first 2 cycles of treatment. After 2 cycles of therapy, 15 of 24 (63%) patients had persistently measurable levels of ctDNA (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Early clearance of ctDNA after cycle 2 was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in EFS (median [95% CI], 8.4 [0.1-NR] vs 2.0 [0.1-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .32) or OS (median, 8.4 [0.3-NR] vs 7.0 [0.5-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .44; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Similarly, in non-ALCL patients, early clearance of ctDNA after cycle 2 was not associated with a significant improvement in EFS (median [95% CI], 5.6 [0.1-NR] vs 1.1 [0.1-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .51) or OS (median [95% CI], 5.6 [0.4-NR] vs 7.0 [0.2-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .61; supplemental Figure 4A-B). Six (40%) patients with measurable ctDNA levels after cycle 2 finished treatment and were without clinical progression with at least 2 years of follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of ctDNA after 2 cycles of therapy to predict treatment failure was 75%, 50%, 60%, and 67%, respectively.</p>

                <p>We also investigated whether persistence of ctDNA as MRD at EoT was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Overall, 13 (54%) patients cleared ctDNA after therapy, whereas 11 (46%) had persistently measurable levels of ctDNA at EoT (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Of the 11 patients with measurable ctDNA after therapy, 6 (55%) had persistent disease on imaging scans, whereas 5 (45%) achieved CR. Of the 5 patients who achieved CR but had persistent ctDNA, 4 had extranodal sites of disease at presentation, with a paraspinal mass in 1 and pleural and/or pericardial effusions in the other 3. These patients later relapsed at a median of 8 months (3 months to 7 years) after EoT. The fifth patient in CR and with persistent ctDNA had stage III ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL with nodal involvement and was without evidence of clinical relapse at 1-year follow-up. In 13 patients who were MRD<sup>−</sup> at EoT, 5 (38%) were considered to have residual disease after therapy by imaging criteria. Patients who cleared ctDNA at EoT had a trend toward improved EFS (median [95% CI], NR [0.4 to NR] vs 0.7 [0.05-7.7] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .08) and OS (median, NR [0.7-NR] vs 7.0 [0.3-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .19) compared with patients with persistent levels of ctDNA after therapy (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>). In non-ALCL patients, clearance of ctDNA at EoT was not associated with an improved EFS (median [95% CI], 2.8 [0.1-NR] vs 0.7 [0.05-7.7] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .34) or OS (median, NR [0.4-NR] vs 7.0 [0.2-NR] years; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = .52), compared with patients with persistent levels of ctDNA (supplemental Figure 5A-B).

                <title>Circulating tumor DNA as surveillance after therapy</title>
                <p>Last, we investigated ctDNA as a surveillance tool to identify the early molecular relapse that precedes clinical detection. Sixteen (80%) of 20 patients who achieved a CR after therapy had at least 1 posttreatment serum sample available for surveillance ctDNA analysis. Eight (50%) of those patients relapsed, and 8 (50%) had no evidence of clinical relapse. Clinical relapses occurred at a median of 22.5 months (range, 3-92) after EoT, and a median of 4 serum samples (range, 1–24) were collected before clinical detection of relapse (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In 6 (75%) of the progressors, ctDNA was positive before the detection of clinical relapse, with a median lead time of 12.5 months (range, 0.1-82.4), and 5 (63%) patients had multiple time points with measurable ctDNA before clinical relapse (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In the 2 patients who did not have measurable ctDNA before relapse, patient 190 relapsed 8 years after initial therapy, and we were unable to confirm a clonal relationship to the original tumor. Patient 291 relapsed at the site of initial disease shortly after completing frontline therapy. The patterns of ctDNA kinetics before clinical relapse were variable, with 2 representative examples shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>. Patient 9, who had PTCL-NOS, did not progress clinically for 8 years after therapy and demonstrated fluctuating levels of ctDNA throughout surveillance before clinical progression. In contrast, patient 198, who had the PTCL-T follicular helper phenotype, relapsed 30 months after therapy and demonstrated a gradual pattern of slowly increasing levels of ctDNA throughout surveillance before clinical progression. Patients who did not progress were followed up for a median of 46.3 months (range, 12.5-181.3) after therapy and had a median of 10 serum samples (range, 5-17) collected (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Four (50%) of those patients had persistently negative ctDNA levels throughout surveillance. Two (25%) patients had a solitary time point that was positive for ctDNA at very low levels that was not associated with relapse and had no detectable ctDNA in subsequent serum samples. Patients 1 and 15 had detectable ctDNA at multiple time points during surveillance that was not associated with clinical relapse, but the patterns of ctDNA kinetics were distinctly different (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Patient 1 had moderately elevated levels of all 3 dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes that persisted throughout surveillance, with only minimal fluctuation, whereas patient 15 had multiple time points with low positive ctDNA and multiple time points without detectable ctDNA.</p>

              <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use NGS of the T-cell receptor in cell-free DNA to identify dominant sequences for qualitative and quantitative assessment of ctDNA within a clinical trial for PTCL. Circulating tumor DNA has already shown clinical utility in B-cell lymphoid malignancies, in which it correlated with disease burden and can be used to track MRD during and after treartment.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15,16,18</xref></sup> More precise measures of disease burden and response to therapy is of great importance in PTCL, as CR after frontline therapy is an inadequate indicator of long-term remission.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27–29</sup></xref></p>
              <p>Using high-throughput CDR3 amplification and sequencing, we detected dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> sequences in most (76%) patients with untreated PTCL and tracked them in the serum throughout therapy and beyond. We observed significant heterogeneity among CDR3 sequences, with a total of 50 dominant clonotypes in the 18 patients who had both FFPE and baseline serum samples available for analysis. Mature T cells may undergo up to 8 rearrangements with a resultant 8 clonotypes; because of allelic deletion and exclusion, only 2 are functionally expressed in each type of cell.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30–32</sup></xref> The diversity of CDR3 observed with ctDNA was similar to that described by whole-exome and RNA sequencing of cellular TCR in patients with PTCL-NOS,<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34,35</xref></sup> or adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In our study, most patients had up to 2 dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> clonotypes detected, consistent with the presence of a single malignant clone. However, 4 patients, 2 with PTCL-NOS and 2 with ALCL, had 3 or more dominant <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> clonotypes detected, indicating the presence of multiple (sub)clones. At least some of these clonotypes may have arisen from nonmalignant cells involved in an immune reactive process, and not from the actual tumor.</p>
              <p>Two hypotheses may explain this clonotypic heterogeneity. The malignant transformation that occurs before <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> rearrangement could result in subclones with divergent <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TCRβ</italic>, as has been suggested in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Conversely, an inflammatory milieu, similar to the one described in conjunction with chronic <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection in patients with mycosis fungoides, could give rise to several T-cell subclones, one of which could undergo malignant transformation.<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The lack of a greater clonotypic heterogeneity within our analysis, along with persistent clonotypes in patients with durable clinical remission, favor the latter hypothesis, although definitive conclusions require further studies.</p>
              <p>Heterogeneity was not limited to clonotypes. Our patients’ diagnoses ranged from ALK<sup>+</sup> ALCL, with a reported 5-year OS of 70%, to PTCL-NOS and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), with a 5-year OS of 32%, and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma with a 5-year OS of 7%.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This heterogeneity may in part account for the lack of difference in EFS or OS when we compared patients with baseline ctDNA levels that were higher and lower than the median. Similarly, we were unable to detect differences in survival between patients who cleared ctDNA after 2 cycles or at EoT, therapy compared with those with persistent levels of ctDNA, but this observation was greatly limited by the small number of patients in our series. Strikingly, 4 of 8 patients with PTCL who were in remission had posttreatment surveillance samples available for at least 1 ctDNA<sup>+</sup> time point, and 2 of those 4 had surveillance samples that showed persistently ctDNA<sup>+</sup> durable clinical remissions. These outcomes are in contrast to the data in DLBCL, where only 2 of 90 patients who were in remission and had low ctDNA<sup>+</sup>surveillance samples at 1 time point each and were negative when those time points were reanalyzed.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of interim and surveillance ctDNA as early biomarkers of relapse in PTCL were lower than those reported in patients with DLBCL who received similar treatment and whose samples were collected and analyzed in a similar manner.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> These test characteristics may not fully capture the potential utility of ctDNA clonotype detection and quantification. For example, diagnosis and restaging of patients with extranodal disease is particularly challenging to assess by conventional imaging, and the suspected sites of disease involvement may not be amenable to biopsy. In our study, 4 of 5 patients without disease on CT scans after therapy but with detectable ctDNA had extranodal disease at presentation, and all 4 ultimately relapsed. Conversely, 5 of 13 patients who were MRD<sup>−</sup> at EoT had residual disease by imaging, which indicates the limitations of ctDNA detection when a conservative algorithm is used to determine tumor-specific clonotypes. The use of ctDNA to identify patients with persistent extranodal disease that is undetected by imaging needs further evaluation.</p>
              <p>Assays for ctDNA can also be used as a “liquid biopsy” to genotype lymphoid malignancies. Targeted exome sequencing of cell-free DNA was used for genotypic profiling of 25 patients with AITL or PTCL-NOS.<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> This analysis focused on recurrent RHOA mutations, which were detectable in 16 (64%) patients; only 5 had serial samples available, and none were collected during first-line treatment. A limitation of this approach, however, is that a significant number of PTCL cases have few if any genomic alterations detectable even by whole-genome sequencing panels.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39,40</xref></sup> Another limitation of liquid biopsies in PTCL is the potential to identify mutations that are not related to lymphoma pathogenesis. <italic toggle="yes">TET2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DNMT3A</italic> mutations, common in AITL, are a hallmark of clonal hematopoiesis and may be detectable in ctDNA from patients without residual lymphoma. In contrast, TCR gene rearrangement is one of the defining characteristics of all mature T-cell malignancies, with tumor tissue <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> rearrangement detectable in 90% of patients.<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> When 1-step and multiplex PCR assays were used for qualitative detection of <italic toggle="yes">TCRγ</italic> rearrangements in FFPE samples, the detection rate was 79%,<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12,42</xref></sup> compared with 86% of patients in our study with baseline FFPE samples in whom a clonotype was detected in both FFPE and serum.</p>
              <p>Other strengths of our study include the uniformity of treatment that the patients received and the prespecified collection of correlative samples. However, the small study sample size and pathological heterogeneity prevent a complete evaluation of the utility of baseline, interim, and EoT ctDNA as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in PTCL and may not allow for true statistical differences to be seen. With that in mind, the positive and negative predictive values in this analysis were markedly lower than those in patients with DLBCL, where high-throughput amplification and sequencing of the immunoglobulin gene segments were used for ctDNA detection.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In summary, high-throughput sequencing of the <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> detected dominant and likely tumor-specific clonotypes in most of the patients with PTCL and successfully tracked those clonotypes throughout therapy. MRD negativity, defined as clearance of ctDNA after 2 cycles or at EoT, did not significantly predict clinical outcomes, but the results should be interpreted with caution, given the small study sample size. Notably, persistence of <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> clonotypes after therapy was not universally associated with clinical relapse. However, for patients in whom clonotype persistence indicated MRD, median lead time from clonotype detection to progression was 12.5 months. The biologic explanation of the persistence of clonotypic <italic toggle="yes">TCR</italic> sequences after therapy in patients who achieve a durable complete response is unknown and should be the subject of future research. Assays designed to guide therapeutic decisions in PTCL require further optimization.</p>
