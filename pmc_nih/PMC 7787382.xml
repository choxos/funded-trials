                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Effective implementation strategies are needed to increase engagement in HIV services in hyperendemic settings. We conducted a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial in a high-risk, highly mobile fishing community (HIV prevalence: approximately 38%) in Rakai, Uganda, to assess the impact of a community health worker-delivered, theory-based (situated Information, Motivation, and Behavior Skills), motivational interviewing-informed, and mobile phone application-supported counseling strategy called “Health Scouts” to promote engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>The study community was divided into 40 contiguous, randomly allocated clusters (20 intervention clusters, <italic>n</italic> = 1,054 participants at baseline; 20 control clusters, <italic>n</italic> = 1,094 participants at baseline). From September 2015 to December 2018, the Health Scouts were deployed in intervention clusters. Community-wide, cross-sectional surveys of consenting 15 to 49-year-old residents were conducted at approximately 15 months (mid-study) and at approximately 39 months (end-study) assessing the primary programmatic outcomes of self-reported linkage to HIV care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, and male circumcision, and the primary biologic outcome of HIV viral suppression (&lt;400 copies/mL). Secondary outcomes included HIV testing coverage, HIV incidence, and consistent condom use. The primary intent-to-treat analysis used log-linear binomial regression with generalized estimating equation to estimate prevalence risk ratios (PRR) in the intervention versus control arm. A total of 2,533 (45% female, mean age: 31 years) and 1,903 (46% female; mean age 32 years) residents completed the mid-study and end-study surveys, respectively. At mid-study, there were no differences in outcomes between arms. At end-study, self-reported receipt of the Health Scouts intervention was 38% in the intervention arm and 23% in the control arm, suggesting moderate intervention uptake in the intervention arm and substantial contamination in the control arm. At end-study, intention-to-treat analysis found higher HIV care coverage (PRR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and ART coverage (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028) among HIV–positive participants in the intervention compared with the control arm. Male circumcision coverage among all men (PRR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.14, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31) and HIV viral suppression among HIV–positive participants (PRR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.20) were higher in the intervention arm, but differences were not statistically significant. No differences were seen in secondary outcomes. Study limitations include reliance on self-report for programmatic outcomes and substantial contamination which may have diluted estimates of effect.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Combination HIV interventions (CHI), which include HIV Testing Services (HTS), antiretroviral therapy (ART), and voluntary medical male circumcision, have led to declines in HIV incidence in certain populations [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence on effective community-based implementation strategies for achieving high and sustained CHI coverage, particularly in HIV hyperendemic settings [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Pragmatic evaluations of comprehensive CHI strategies are needed to inform HIV programs and policy.</p>
              <p>HIV hyperendemic settings are geographically defined areas of high HIV transmission and prevalence [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rigorous evidence on CHI implementation strategies for these settings is of particular importance as they are a priority focus of the global HIV response [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many fishing communities on Lake Victoria in East Africa are HIV hyperendemic settings characterized by high rates of mobility, condomless sex, multiple sex partners, sex work, alcohol misuse, and inadequate health services [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Community health workers (CHWs) [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], using theory-based frameworks, motivational interviewing counseling techniques, and leveraging mobile health tools to identify and address barriers, may represent a strategy to promote CHI engagement and retention [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We conducted a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial called mHealth Lakefolk Actively Keeping Engaged (mLAKE) in an HIV hyperendemic fishing community (baseline HIV prevalence: approximately 38%; baseline ART coverage: approximately 67%; and HIV viral suppression: approximately 66% among HIV–positive residents) in Rakai, Uganda, to assess the impact on HIV service coverage and virologic suppression of a novel motivational interviewing-informed, theory-based, and mobile health-supported community health worker intervention called “Health Scouts.”</p>

In brief (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s001">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>), the study was a pragmatic, parallel, cluster randomized, controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The cluster randomized design was chosen to optimize external validity and rigor for this community-based intervention and to minimize contamination threats, which would have been substantial with household- or individual-level randomization; quasi-experimental designs were deemed less rigorous. The study design was pragmatically oriented as our primary goal was to understand Health Scout intervention impact under usual care conditions [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>

                  <p>The study setting was a single fishing community (area: approximately 2 km<sup>2</sup>; adolescent/adult population: approximately 4,000 to 5,000) on Lake Victoria in Rakai District of south-central Uganda. Since 2011, the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) has been the primary provider of CHI services in this fishing community. These services include an HIV clinic, community-based HIV testing, and mobile male circumcision camps. Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) became available to community residents in 2017. ART was initiated at the time of diagnosis (i.e., universal test and treat) throughout the study period. The HIV prevalence in this community was approximately 38% at the start of the study.</p>

                  <title>Eligibility criteria for clusters and participants</title>
                  <p>This fishing community, the largest in the region, was divided into 40 clusters. Contiguous clusters were defined with consideration of implementation logistics, minimizing contamination, and geographic features such as roads, buildings, and the lake shoreline. Each cluster was designed to contain roughly the same number of eligible households (approximately 60) and total eligible participants (approximately 107). All resident persons ≥15 years of age in intervention clusters were eligible to receive the Health Scouts intervention. Baseline characteristics and intervention impact was evaluated through the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) which included all persons aged 15 to 49 years who were resident in a household within the community for at least 1 month or resident for less than 1 month but with intent to stay. RCCS participation was not a requirement for receiving the Health Scout intervention.</p>

                  <title>Participant recruitment</title>
                  <p>Recruitment began with a community-wide sensitization in which community leaders and residents were informed about the trial through a series of meetings and public announcements. Health Scouts began visiting participants or “clients” in their households on September 21, 2015. In-migrating participants could be recruited at any time Health Scouts encountered them residing in an intervention cluster during the study period. Participants could also out-migrate or decline participation at any time. Health Scouts would not continue to follow participants if they moved residence from an intervention cluster to a control cluster. The recruitment for the RCCS followed usual procedures [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>

                  <p>The Health Scout intervention and initial implementation have previously been described in detail [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A situated Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (sIMB) theory-based conceptual framework (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s002">S1 Text</xref>) was developed, wherein the Health Scout counseling intervention was designed to promote relevant tailored information, motivation, and behavioral skills to improve client engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The general approach to the design and implementation of the Health Scouts intervention was pragmatically oriented [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. That is, while a framework for Health Scouts recruitment, training, tasks, quality assurance, and monitoring was developed, the intervention was designed with flexibility to adapt to any needs, constraints, and secular changes encountered during implementation. Core components of the intervention included (1) CHW (Health Scout)-based delivery; (2) counseling using motivational interviewing-informed strategies; (3) household-based delivery; and (4) mobile health-supported.</p>

                  <title>Health Scout phone application</title>
                  <p>The Health Scout Android-based application (Fig B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s002">S1 Text</xref>) functioned as a decision and counseling support mobile health tool to guide Health Scouts through counseling sessions (emocha Mobile Health Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America) [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using simple forms and an sIMB-guided algorithm (Fig C and Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s002">S1 Text</xref>), the application guided the Health Scout sequentially through 3 steps: (1) Household members were screened for age eligibility; (2) eligible residents were asked a series of triage screening questions, e.g., age, gender, HIV status, to determine which counseling modules should be activated; and (3) tailored modules with motivational interviewing-informed prompts and counseling messages were provided for the Health Scout to review with the client, focusing on areas where the client could most benefit given their current HIV service needs, information, motivation, and behavioral skills, tailored to individual and community contexts. A CHI approach was incorporated, with 10 counseling modules targeting both HIV–positive and HIV–negative residents (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s002">S1 Text</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Community mobilization included informational meetings with community leaders and public drama shows depicting proposed Health Scout activities [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Ten Health Scouts were initially elected and recruited from the community and underwent residential- and field-based trainings on application and smartphone use, confidentiality, disclosure, HIV-related knowledge, cluster boundaries, and avoiding contamination [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Motivational interviewing skills, a communication strategy that emphasizes a nonjudgmental and nonconfrontational approach to behavior change, were integrated into training with core competencies evaluated [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Health Scouts were each initially assigned 2 clusters, which together contained an average of about 215 eligible clients at baseline. Health Scouts attempted to visit all clients within their clusters within 3 months of study initiation and follow up each client within their cluster once every 3 months for approximately 3 years. During each visit, Health Scouts would systematically approach clients at their households and, after receiving oral consent, counsel clients with assistance from systematic prompts from the smartphone application. All initial visits occurred at the clients’ residence, but follow-up visits could occur at an alternate place, e.g., work location, based on clients’ preferences. Health Scouts were provided a phone, work supplies, and compensation for their work (approximately 60USD a month).</p>

                <p>As Health Scouts resided in the community, control arm residents could interact with Health Scouts as they would in routine encounters, but Health Scouts were instructed not to conduct mobile health-supported counseling home visits with residents in the control clusters. Household residents in both study arms had access to the standard of care HIV prevention and treatment services, which included free HTS, ART, and condoms at a community-based HIV clinic; peer services for patients on ART [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; access to male circumcision through periodic mobile male circumcision camps; and, beginning in 2017, oral PrEP.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The trial had 3 primary programmatic outcomes (self-reported linkage to HIV care, ART coverage, and male circumcision coverage) and 1 primary biologic outcome (HIV viral suppression, defined as &lt;400 copies/mL, among HIV–positive participants; see Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003475.s002">S1 Text</xref> for detailed outcome definitions). Secondary outcomes included HTS coverage, HIV incidence, and consistent condom use. The study was nested within the RCCS, which was used to assess baseline characteristics and all study outcomes through 3 community-wide, cross-sectional surveys. RCCS surveys were conducted at baseline (approximately 4 months prior to intervention start), at the study midpoint (approximately 15 months after intervention start) and at the study end-point (approximately 39 months of total follow-up). The RCCS is an open, population-based cohort focused on HIV surveillance among persons 15 to 49 years of age [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Since 2011, the RCCS has surveyed all age-eligible individuals, regardless of HIV status, in this community approximately every 18 months [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. At each survey, the RCCS first conducts a census of households with GPS coordinates recorded, and all resident household members are enumerated by sex, age, and duration of residence. These GPS coordinates were used to classify participants into specific study clusters. After census, the RCCS conducts interviews with consenting participants to assess demographics, sexual behaviors, and HIV service uptake. Blood samples are collected for HIV viral load assays. Following the interview, free HIV testing services with results immediately returned are offered to consenting participants.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample size for this trial was fixed at 40 clusters (20 intervention, 20 control, approximately 107 eligible participants in each cluster); therefore, we estimated whether the trial had power to detect relevant and realistic differences in primary study outcomes, i.e., minimum detectable differences between arms, based on our prior experience with CHW interventions and mobile health tools in Uganda [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Detailed power calculation inputs and results were previously described [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In summary, the trial was estimated to have the power to detect minimum difference prevalence risk ratios with 80% power of ≥15% differentials in HIV care coverage, ≥20% in ART coverage, ≥41% in viral suppression, and ≥23% in male circumcision coverage.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>Given the fixed sample size and desire for baseline comparability of important characteristics, we used restricted randomization to 1:1 allocated intervention and control arms [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. First, we defined a priori acceptable differences in baseline cluster level characteristics [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Second, we conducted independent, computer-generated randomizations with those not satisfying comparability criteria removed. Subsequently, 1 randomization sequence was randomly drawn for the allocation of intervention. The final assignment of clusters to intervention and control arms was done in a public coin flip ceremony witnessed by study staff and the Health Scouts. By the nature of the intervention, Health Scouts and participants were not blinded to the intervention assignment. The study team and primary analyst were blinded to the intervention assignment during analyses.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Individual-level data for study outcomes were used to estimate the efficacy of the intervention. The primary analysis was by intent-to-treat and used log-linear binomial models to estimate prevalence risk ratios for each outcome comparing the intervention versus the control arm. A generalized estimating equation with an exchangeable correlation structure was used to account for within-cluster correlations. Separate analyses were conducted for each RCCS follow-up survey to assess the shorter (mid-study survey) and longer-term (end-study survey) effects of the intervention. A serial cross-sectional analysis approach was chosen a priori, as high loss to follow-up was anticipated in this mobile population, and our main interest was outcomes across the entire population present at the time of survey and not just participants present at baseline. An intention-to-treat analysis adjusting for age and sex was also performed. Finally, an as-treated analysis was conducted with exposure defined as self-reported receipt of any Health Scout counseling (exposure data was also collected through the RCCS survey).</p>

                <p>From study initiation to the start of the end-study survey period, Health Scouts completed a total of 11,221 counseling sessions among 2,532 unique residents. The median number of sessions per client was 4 (IQR: 2 to 7); the mean number of sessions per client was 4.43 (range: 1 to 18). A total of 614 clients received only 1 counseling session.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this cluster randomized trial, a motivational-interviewing informed, theory-based, mobile health-supported CHW intervention moderately improved HIV care and ART coverage among residents of an HIV hyperendemic fishing community in Uganda. Viral suppression and male circumcision coverage were not significantly improved in the intention-to-treat analysis, but the direction of effect consistently favored the intervention arm across all outcomes. Adjusted and an as-treated analyses were supportive of the primary intention-to-treat analysis. Prior CHW-based HIV interventions in Africa have incorporated mobile health tools [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], motivational interviewing [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the sIMB framework [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but to our knowledge, this is the first report of an effective intervention combining all of these elements.</p>
              <p>While the absolute difference in outcomes was modest, e.g., approximately 5% difference in ART coverage, these differences may have meaningful public health impact as small improvements in settings with already high levels of coverage and viral suppression could be needed for HIV epidemic control [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Comprehensive, community-based interventions such as the Health Scouts may contribute to the incremental gains in HIV care outcomes needed to reduce HIV incidence in similar settings, particularly if the intervention facilitates the recruitment of hard-to-reach individuals. As CHWs are often present in HIV-affected communities, adopting the Health Scouts approach into ongoing programs could offer added benefits in HIV treatment and prevention.</p>
              <p>This study had a number of limitations. According to self-report, a substantial number of participants residing in control clusters at the time of survey had been counseled by a Health Scout, indicating contamination of the control arm. Participant flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003475.g001">Fig 1</xref>) from intervention to control arms and vice versa appeared modest; however, these data only captured residence at the time of survey, and participants may move residence more than once during inter-survey intervals, e.g., many participants rely on short-term rentals or transient sleeping under boats. Participants were also classified in intervention and control arms based upon household Global Positioning System (GPS) data collected using handheld GPS devices, which can be imprecise, potentially resulting in misclassification. Some cluster boundaries were also physically altered by shoreline erosion and demolition and construction of houses, potentially leading to contamination and/or misclassification. However, contamination and nondifferential misclassification would have likely biased results toward the null, suggesting that the Health Scouts effect is likely greater than observed. Future studies may consider having entire communities randomized to decrease contamination risks.</p>
              <p>The study population was highly mobile, as evidenced by the high rates of lost-to-follow-up, return-to-follow-up, and movement between study arms. However, the overall effect of this mobility would most likely also be a dilution of measured impact. Based on self-report, the intervention reach in this study was moderate with only 38% of residents reporting receiving counseling by the Health Scouts in the intervention arm by study end. Of note, if there had been no contamination and 100% reach in the intervention clusters, the overall reach in all 40 clusters would be maximized at 50%, and this study had 30% overall community reach. Regardless, the moderate reach in intervention clusters may have reduced community-wide impact, and additional evaluations of barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation are planned. Study outcomes, except for viral suppression, were based on self-report, as were measures of Health Scouts exposure. Self-report has known limitations, particularly social desirability bias, but we have previously validated self-report of ART use and male circumcision in this setting [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>Of note, no significant differences in outcomes were seen at the mid-study survey in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. The intervention reach may have been insufficient at that time to produce detectable impacts on outcomes. Health Scouts may also have needed time to develop trusting relationships with clients to better affect behavior change. Despite contamination between the groups increasing between mid-study and end-study, effect measures did reach statistical significance at the end-study. Further evaluations of the long-term implementation and sustainability of this approach could be informative.</p>
              <p>In summary, a novel, theory-based community health worker intervention using motivational interviewing techniques and a mobile health tool was associated with improved HIV service engagement in a highly mobile HIV hyperendemic setting. This community-based intervention may be a useful component of a comprehensive response aiming for 95-95-95 and HIV epidemic control [<xref rid="pmed.1003475.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Future mixed-methods evaluations of this implementation strategy will be informative to better understand important issues around implementation, replicability, costs, and sustainability.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>This article, describes the finding from a pragmatic randomized trial on novel Community Health Worker intervention, called "Health Scouts" for HIV Service Engagement defined as (adherence to ART therapy, viral suppression and male circumcision) in a Hyperendemic Community in Rakai,Uganda. One of the strengths of the study is that is uses a Theory based intervention grounded in a Motivational Interviewing Framework. The use of pragmatic, cluster- randomized trial also provides a rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of CHW interventions for people with HIV in improving health outcomes. The use of a mobile application in a hypendemic, low resource setting is also useful to the field. However there are a number of limitations that need to be addressed prior to publication. The article could be strengthened by stating clearly up front the recruitment procedures, clear eligibility for the study population and more in-depth information about the intervention itself. Furthermore there appears to be great loss to follow up on the intervention from baseline to mid study and end study period thus limiting the reliability and validity of the study findings. </p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>* How is self-care defined?</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>* The introduction begins by describing combination HIV Interventions (CHI) of HIV testing, male circumcision, and antiretroviral therapy. How does the CHW intervention and/or mobile application link to the CHI.</p>
              <p>* HIV prevalence is 38%--what is the level of viral suppression? Is ART available? </p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Study design: what is usual care that the Health Scout intervention is compared to?</p>
              <p>Participant eligibility criteria: If the study is about HIV care coverage and ART therapy—why is the eligibility for this study limited to just people HIV &gt;15 rather than all resident. Or state that this is sub-study of the larger study. </p>
              <p>Participant recruitment: page 7 Health Scouts started visiting "clients". How were clients contacted? Describe the community mobilization techniques? Did CHWs going randomly from house systematically and inform clients about the program and see if someone wanted to participate.?</p>
              <p>Phone application Intervention: How many modules? what was the protocol for delivering modules? </p>
              <p>Implementation: How many clusters were each CHW assigned? So Health Scout CHWs were in all 40 clusters? Mobile clusters were only in a few? How many clients in each cluster; how often follow up in 3 month follow-up (weekly?) at least once? </p>
              <p>Control arm: what was the standard of care? </p>
              <p>Outcomes: If person tests positive are they informed of the results? How is HIV self-care coverage? How is MC coverage measured? How is ART measured? </p>
              <p>Sample size: provide 2-3 sentences about the power calculation and estimated size of each population in the clusters</p>
              <p>Statistical Analysis: The analysis and results could be strengthened if authors examined the sample that had baseline and follow up data either mid point or end survey. </p>
              <p>Results-Table</p>
              <p>Is there an attrition analysis? According to tables there is significant lost to followup between baseline, mid point and end survey. How many people had completed data ie. at least one baseline and follow up.</p>
              <p>How did you calculate the response rates for follow time points? Given the samples size at mid year and end study more than 50% of the sample 425 (baseline to end survey) and 413 for controls. AS new participants were recruited at mid year -were they matched to </p>
              <p>Implementation measures: The average of 4 visits over 3 years seems quite low over 3 years. What was the average time in the intervention? Is this just for people with HIV? nearly 25% received only 1 session--why such a big LTF? What was the protocol? </p>
              <p>Only 38% of the intervention group received the Health Scout intervention with the mobile app. This seems low for an intervention design. </p>
              <p>For those who are not HIV infected what were their outcomes of interest? It is not clear why they are included in this study. </p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Is the intervention sustainable? It seems there was high turnover among Health SCOUTS from 10 to approximately 5? </p>
              <p>LImitations: The authors duly note that contamination could be reasons for null effects between intervention and control groups. Was supervision provided to Health Scouts to try to limit contamination. What further recommendation for future study designs and would the authors recommended? Step Wedge?</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>PMEDICINE-D-20-03569R1</p>
              <p>This pragmatic cluster RCT examines the effectiveness of a community-based motivational interviewing m-health intervention embedded within the Rakai cohort. The study design and careful plan are strengths. However, there are some loose ends that would be worth clarifying further. In particular, more discussion of the pilot data, contamination, LTFU, and intervention would enhance the value of this study.</p>
              <p>MAJOR COMMENTS</p>
              <p>(1) Pilot data. Given that there was no difference between the two arms, it would be helpful to know about the pilot data that informed the sample size calculation and study design. However, I could not find published pilot data demonstrating the effectiveness (beyond feasibility) of this specific intervention in the protocol manuscript or this submitted paper. Could this data be highlighted?</p>
              <p>(2) Contamination. The extent of contamination in Figure 1 seems rather modest. While I agree this would bias towards the null, the sample size calculations accounted for 10-50% contamination. A more thorough discussion of contamination and mention of this in the abstract would be useful for the reader. </p>
              <p>(3) Rakai cohort LTFU and migration. The study was nested within the Rakai open cohort, making this one of the most extensively researched populations in the world. Given this context, it is surprising that migration and LTFU were such unanticipated problems. Did something change with the cohort over time or is there some other explanation for these differences? </p>
              <p>(4) Health Scouts. More details on these individuals either in the text or a supplement would be useful. Based on looking at the protocol, they had no experience with motivational interviewing and were tasked with implementing a substantial public health task with minimal mentorship. How was "basic competency with assigned tasks" evaluated in the field? What support was provided and how were they compensated?</p>
              <p>(5) M-health data. Was the back-end data from app use also used to see levels of use? This implementation data might be able to what extent scouts were implementing the standard intervention.</p>
              <p>MINOR COMMENTS</p>
              <p>(1) Abstract, results section. Contamination. Given that contamination was an important part of this study, including some basic description of the scope of contamination in the abstract would be important. </p>
              <p>(2) Abstract, results section, sentence starting with "At end-study, self-reported.." I believe that the counselling was the intervention itself, correct? Would consider revising this sentence to focus on exposure to the intervention in the two study arms. </p>
              <p>(3) Secondary outcomes. It would also be useful to see the pre-specified secondary outcomes of interest (condomless sex, viral load, testing coverage, etc).</p>
              <p>(4) Per protocol analysis. The protocol published in Trials does not specify a per-protocol analysis. Was this added later? It's a nice addition to the paper, but would be appropriate to note that this was not pre-specified (if this was the case).</p>
              <p>(5) Figure 2S. Its great to have some screen shots, but would be good to have a larger high-resolution version of this content. </p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>Alex McConnachie, Statistical Review</p>
              <p>Chang et al present the results of a cluster randomised trial of a community health worker intervention to improve HIV service engagement in a hyperendemic setting in Uganda. This review considers the use of statistics in the paper.</p>
              <p>Overall, I found the paper to be interesting, and well written. The study background, methods, and results, are described clearly.</p>
              <p>The sample size justification is reasonable; studies like this often have a fixed sample size, and the question is whether the study has power to detect a reasonable effect. There is a reference to another paper with details of the sample size calculations, which is fine, but I think in the current paper it would be good to state what minimum effect size the study was powered to detect.</p>
              <p>The statistical analysis methods are acceptable, as far as they go. One of the most striking results is the level of contamination between the study arms, with almost a quarter of the control arm reportedly receiving the intervention. Whilst an ITT analysis is perfectly reasonable, I feel the authors should seek to estimate what the true impact of the intervention might be. For example, this could involve a CACE analysis to estimate the effect of the intervention amongst those who received it. This, coupled with the estimated reach of the intervention, could give an estimate of the impact of the intervention over a population. Currently, we have estimates of differences in outcomes between two groups with different levels of access to the intervention, which provide evidence of intervention effects, but do not give good estimates of the magnitude of those effects. What matters, I think, are the differences in outcomes between a population with access to the intervention and the same population without access to the intervention.</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>This paper reports the primary outcomes of a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effect of a community health workers intervention (called "Health Scouts") on engagement into HIV care and prevention measured at the population level.</p>
              <p>The trial was embedded into a population cohort used to measure the different outcomes at baseline, mid-point and end line.</p>
              <p>Implementing and evaluating complex combination interventions are crucial to achieving epidemic control. The results reported in this paper are entirely relevant in this context.</p>
              <p>Overall, the Health Scouts intervention could be more described in the paper, the authors referring to a protocol paper published in Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2243-6">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-017-2243-6</ext-link>). In particular, it is unclear what are the counselling messages delivered by the scouts. The paper is focused on the 4 primary outcomes of the trial, 3 of them concerning only HIV-positive individuals (HIV care coverage, ART coverage and viral suppression) and one among men (male circumcision). When just reading the paper, it seems strange that all individuals were eligible for the scout intervention as it was unclear that would be the counselling for negative women.</p>
              <p>In the protocol paper, it appeared that there are 9 counselling modules: 1 HIV serostatus unknown or no recent HIV test, male or not pregnant female; 2 HIV serostatus unknown or no recent HIV test, pregnant female; 3 Male, not circumcised; 4 HIV+, not in care; 5 HIV+, in care, not on antiretroviral therapy (ART); 6 HIV+, on ART; 7 HIV+, pregnant; 8 Male having condomless sex; 9 Female having condomless sex. However, it is not described whare are the recommendations for each group. For example, are uncircumcised HIV-positive men invited to get circumcised?</p>
              <p>According to the protocol paper, there are 4 defined secondary outcomes (HIV testing, HIV incidence, HIV treatment failure and condom use). What are the reasons for not reporting these 4 outcomes in the same paper as the 4 primary outcomes? It would provide a more global view of this global and multi-component intervention.</p>
              <p>The paper is relatively silent about what was done by the health scouts, just mentioning 11,221 counselling sessions among 2,532 unique residents. Do the authors have any information/statistic about the content of the sessions? Was data collected in the app about the profile of the beneficiaries? </p>
              <p>Regarding the 4 primary outcomes, they should be more formally defined, with a precise definition of the numerators and the denominators.</p>
              <p>It appears in the Results that 3 surveys have been conducted at baseline, mid-point and endline. However, the baseline survey is not mentioned in the methods. Was it also conducted as part of RCCS?</p>
              <p>Regarding the analysis of the primary outcomes, it seems that only within-cluster correlations were taken into account, but that the models were not adjusted on sociodemographic characteristics. In the protocol paper, it is written: "If a baseline outcome or demographic variable are significantly different between arms with p-value ≤ 0.1, adjusted regression analysis on the outcome variables will be conducted adjusting for baseline covariates." According to table 1S, at baseline, the two arms differ statistically (p &lt; 0.1) in terms of sex, marital status and educational status. Therefore, could the authors justify the choice of non-adjusting on these variables?</p>
              <p>Considering the fact that only a small proportion (38%) of participants self-reported health scouts counselling at endline in the intervention arm and that 23% of participants reported health scouts counselling in the control arm, did the authors consider the possibility of a comparison of the different outcomes between those reporting counselling vs the others, as a complementary analysis to the intent-to-treat analysis?</p>
              <p>The authors may consider some rewording of the two paragraphs presenting the intention-to-treat analyses as it is confusing in its current form. The two paragraphs start with the number of HIV-positive participants, suggesting that this subgroup was the denominator of the different outcomes. But this is true only for 3 outcomes (HIV care coverage, ART coverage and viral load). Clearly, male circumcision coverage used a different denominator, not mentioned in the text. Also, could the authors clarify if male circumcision coverage was computed among all men or only among those HIV-negative?</p>
              <p>In the discussion, there is the following statement: "The intervention arm in this study was able to achieve these benchmarks" (i.e. 95-95-95 Unaids' targets). However, data to justify this statement are not presented in the paper. Besides, achieving these targets at endline without knowing what was the situation at baseline nor what was achieved in the control arm, doesn't mean anything about the contribution of Heath Scouts in this achievement.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Chang,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Novel Community Health Worker Strategy for HIV Service Engagement in a Hyperendemic Community in Rakai, Uganda: A pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial" (PMEDICINE-D-20-03569R2) for consideration at PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with editorial colleagues and it was also seen again by 3 reviewers. I am pleased to tell you that, provided the remaining editorial and production issues are fully dealt with, we expect to be able to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>Our publications team (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) will be in touch shortly about the production requirements for your paper, and the link and deadline for resubmission. DO NOT RESUBMIT BEFORE YOU'VE RECEIVED THE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, we look forward to receiving the revised manuscript shortly. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Please confirm that all elements of your paper, including fig B, for example, can be published under a CC BY licence.</p>
              <p>You mention a "redacted version" (of the study data) in your data statement. Please explain what is being redacted; it may be that adapting this to "anonymised data" or similar would be preferable as "redacted" may raise questions for readers about what is being obscured. </p>
              <p>Please restructure the abstract so that the 4 primary outcomes are listed (we suggest with the "primary biologic outcome" last) and then the findings on each presented in the same order. </p>
              <p>We suggest quoting the number of participants in the two study arms at baseline, early in the "Methods and findings" subsection of your abstract. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the "Conclusions" subsection of your abstract to note the null findings on two of the primary endpoints. </p>
              <p>Please add bullet points to the author summary; and adapt the final subsection to contain at least 2 points. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the wording of your author summary to substitute "no significant changes", or similar, for "no large changes".</p>
              <p>We understand that "hotspots" is not a universally popular term in this context, and ask you to remove it. </p>
              <p>In the (quite brief) introduction and/or discussion sections of your main text, are there similar published interventions that could be mentioned and cited?</p>
              <p>At the start of the methods section, please adapt the wording to make it clear that reference 18 is the study protocol. </p>
              <p>Where appropriate, e.g., in the methods section, please substitute "sex" for "gender". </p>
              <p>As discussed in the response-to-referees, please note at the end of the results section that the as-treated/per-protocol analysis was not prespecified. </p>
              <p>Please quote exact p values or "p&lt;0.001" (noting several instances of "p&lt;0.0001" in table G, for example). </p>
              <p>We ask you to revisit the discussion of "direction of effect" early in the discussion section of your main text, so as to avoid any implication that non-significant findings are significant. </p>
              <p>To references 7 and 34, please add URLs and accessed dates, if available. </p>
              <p>Please add an author (or institutional author) name to reference 12. </p>
              <p>To reference 30, please add the first author's initial in place of the first name. </p>
              <p>Noting table C, we understand that the CONSORT guideline discourages baseline statistical comparisons. </p>
              <p>We were unable to find the CONSORT checklist with your resubmission, and ask that you include this with your revision. In the checklist, please ensure that individual items are referred to by section (e.g., "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by line or page numbers, as the latter generally change in the event of publication. </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>Thank you for your thorough response to the reviewers comments. The response and changes to the manuscript are acceptable and more clearly explain the design, data analysis and limitations and limitation of the findings. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>Alex McConnachie, Statistical Review</p>
              <p>I am happy with the revisions made by the authors in response to my original comments.</p>
              <p>The addition of an as-treated analysis does not achieve what I had hoped in terms of an assessment of the potential impact of the intervention for a population, compared to a population without access to the intervention, but on reflection it may not be possible to do a CACE analysis in this setting. The authors do recognise that their intervention effect estimates are likely to be underestimates of the true impact of the intervention. On that basis, I have no additional comments to make.</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>The authors provided a detailed rebuttal letter and answered to all reviewer's comments. In particular, they added detailed about the intervention, a multivariate-adjusted analysis of the outcomes, the secondary outcomes and an as-treated analysis. The analysis has been clearly improved.</p>
              <p>I just have a little comment regarding secondary outcomes: they are presented only in supplementary materials. However, there is enough space in Table 2 to add them to the main article.</p>

The copyeditor will be in touch shortly before sending you the copyedited Word document. We will make some revisions at copyediting stage to conform to our general style, and for clarification. When you receive this version you should check and revise it very carefully, including figures, tables, references, and supporting information, because corrections at the next stage (proofs) will be strictly limited to (1) errors in author names or affiliations, (2) errors of scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and (3) printer's (introduced) errors. Please return the copyedited file within 2 business days in order to ensure timely delivery of the PDF proof. </p>
              <p>If you are likely to be away when either this document or the proof is sent, please ensure we have contact information of a second person, as we will need you to respond quickly at each point. Given the disruptions resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there may be delays in the production process. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused and will do our best to minimize impact as far as possible.</p>

              <p>Please note that an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you opted out when submitting your manuscript. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online, uncheck the box. Should you, your institution's press office or the journal office choose to press release your paper, you will automatically be opted out of early publication. We ask that you notify us as soon as possible if you or your institution is planning to press release the article.</p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
