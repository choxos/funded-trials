                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In people with peripheral artery disease, post hoc analyses of the LITE (Low Intensity Exercise Intervention in Peripheral Artery Disease) randomized trial were conducted to evaluate the effects of walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms on walking velocity and the Short Physical Performance Battery, compared with walking exercise without ischemic leg symptoms and compared with a nonexercising control group.</p>

                  <title>Methods and Results</title>
                  <p>Participants with peripheral artery disease were randomized to: home‚Äêbased walking exercise that induced ischemic leg symptoms; home‚Äêbased walking exercise conducted without ischemic leg symptoms; or a nonexercising control group for 12¬†months. Outcomes were change of walking velocity over 4¬†m and change of the Short Physical Performance Battery (0‚Äì12, with 12=best) at 6‚Äê and 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup. A total of 264 participants (48% women, 61% Black race) were included. Compared with walking exercise without ischemic symptoms, walking exercise that induced ischemic symptoms improved change in usual‚Äêpaced walking velocity over 4¬†m at 6‚Äêmonth (0.056 m/s [95% CI, 0.019‚Äì0.094 m/s]; <italic toggle="no">P</italic>&lt;0.01) and 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup (0.084 m/s [95% CI, 0.049‚Äì0.120 m/s]; <italic toggle="no">P</italic>&lt;0.01), change in fast‚Äêpaced of walking velocity over 4¬†m at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup (<italic toggle="no">P</italic>=0.03), and change in the Short Physical Performance Battery at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup (0.821 [95% CI, 0.309‚Äì1.334]; <italic toggle="no">P</italic>&lt;0.01). Compared with control, walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic symptoms improved change in usual‚Äêpaced walking velocity over 4¬†m at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup (0.066 m/s [95% CI, 0.021‚Äì0.111 m/s]; <italic toggle="no">P</italic>&lt;0.01).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In people with peripheral artery disease, those who walked for exercise at a comfortable pace without ischemic leg symptoms slowed their walking speed during daily life and worsened the Short Physical Performance Battery score, a potentially harmful effect, compared with people who walked for exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms. Compared with a control group who did not exercise, home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms significantly improved change of walking velocity over 4¬†m at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, but this benefit did not persist at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup.</p>

                <p>The exercise interventions lasted 12 months (ie, 52‚Äâweeks). Participants were asked to walk for exercise at home for 5‚Äâdays per week, working up to 50 minutes of exercise per session. Between weeks 1 and 4, participants in the exercise intervention groups visited the medical center once weekly to meet with the coach, who oriented the participant to the exercise intervention and helped the participant adopt behaviors to help him/her adhere to walking exercise at home. Between weeks 5 and 52, participants were contacted via telephone by study coaches. During each coach contact (in person during weeks 1‚Äì4 and by telephone during weeks 5‚Äì52), behavioral methods were incorporated to assist those randomized to exercise with walking exercise at home 5‚Äâdays per week. During the on‚Äêsite visits, participants were taught to use the ActiGraph to collect data on their walking exercise activity and upload the data on a personal computer or a tablet provided by the study. Before beginning the exercise intervention, the coach worked with each participant randomized to an exercise group to identify the ActiGraph activity counts corresponding to walking exercise without ischemic leg symptoms (Likert ischemic claudication pain scale score, ‚â§2) and the ActiGraph activity counts corresponding to walking exercise that induced maximal ischemic leg symptoms (Likert ischemic claudication pain scale score, 4‚Äì5) for each individual. These personalized thresholds for each intensity of exercise were defined for each individual during the initial on‚Äêsite visit by having him/her wear the ActiGraph to collect activity counts per minute while walking for exercise for ‚âà5¬†minutes at a pace inducing maximal ischemic leg symptoms and separately at a comfortable pace without leg symptoms. These ActiGraph benchmarks established for each participant were uploaded to the study website and used to guide home walking exercise activity, helping participants to monitor the intensity of their walking exercise at home to help them adhere to walking exercise at the intensity corresponding to the participant's group assignment (ie, walking for exercise either with or without ischemic leg symptoms). Individualized benchmarks of ActiGraph activity counts were remeasured at months 1, 3, 6, and 9, and after significant medical illness to reflect change in these exercise intensity benchmarks as each participant progressed through the trial. These benchmarks were referred to when evaluating whether participants were adhering to the intensity of walking exercise assigned by the randomization process. Participants randomized to exercise wore their ActiGraph device during walking exercise activity and uploaded data on exercise frequency, intensity, and duration to the study website using their home computer or tablet provided by the study.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> These data, viewable to the participant and study coach, were used by the coaches to provide feedback to participants during weekly telephone calls.</p>

These analyses included all participants with follow‚Äêup data, regardless of adherence to their assigned intervention. The 6‚Äê and 12‚Äêmonth changes in usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity, fast‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity, and the SPPB were treated as dependent outcomes, whose covariance was modeled via an unstructured variance‚Äìcovariance matrix.

Participants without baseline measures for study outcomes were excluded from analyses. The results from mixed models for repeated measures analyses are valid under the missing at random assumption. In additional analyses to examine the missingness mechanism, baseline characteristics between participants with PAD who completed all follow‚Äêup tests, those who completed some follow‚Äêup tests, and those who were excluded because they did not complete any follow‚Äêup tests reported herein were compared.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this multicentered randomized clinical trial of people with PAD, compared with home‚Äêbased walking exercise conducted at a comfortable pace without ischemic leg symptoms, home‚Äêbased walking exercise conducted at a pace that induced ischemic leg symptoms significantly improved performance on 4 of 6 functional outcomes not related to walking endurance, including usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity at 6‚Äê and 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, fast‚Äêpaced walking velocity at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, and the SPPB at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup. Compared with home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a comfortable pace, home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace that induced ischemic leg symptoms also significantly increased participant‚Äêreported walking speed at 6‚Äê and at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup. The statistically significant effects of home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms on usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity at 6‚Äê and 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup and on the SPPB at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup met the criteria for a clinically meaningful change, compared with walking exercise at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Similarly, the statistically significant effects of home‚Äêbased walking exercise conducted at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms on usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup met the criterion for a clinically meaningful change, compared with the attention control group.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Together, these results showed that home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace that does not induce ischemic leg symptoms was significantly worse than walking exercise that induces ischemic leg symptoms for outcomes of walking speed and the SPPB. Results also showed that walking for exercise at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms was significantly worse than the control group for the outcome of usual‚Äêpaced walking velocity at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup.</p>
              <p>Previous small clinical trials suggested that supervised treadmill walking exercise at a comfortable pace improved walking performance measures in people with PAD and attained benefit that was not significantly different from supervised treadmill walking exercise at a pace that induced maximal ischemic leg symptoms.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> However, these prior studies had small sample sizes and may have lacked statistical power to demonstrate significantly different effects of walking exercise at a pace that induced ischemic leg symptoms compared with walking exercise at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms. In addition, these prior randomized trials used treadmill walking performance as the primary outcome measure. Prior work documented a learning effect of treadmill walking exercise on the outcome of treadmill walking performance in people with PAD.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Compared with these prior studies,<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> results reported herein included a larger sample size and studied functional outcome measures that have been previously shown to predict mobility loss, cardiovascular mortality, and all‚Äêcause mortality.<xref rid="jah37596-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jah37596-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms significantly improved usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity, compared with the nonexercising control group at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, but had no effect on the usual‚Äêpaced 4‚Äêm walking velocity at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, compared with the control group. These results suggest diminished potency of the walking exercise intervention at high intensity over time for this outcome.</p>
              <p>Although participants randomized to walking exercise at a comfortable pace without ischemic leg symptoms walked for exercise for a longer duration (more minutes and more days), compared with participants randomized to walking exercise at a pace that induced ischemic leg symptoms, walking exercise at a comfortable pace did not improve walking velocity or the SPPB at either 6‚Äê or 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, compared with the control group who did not exercise. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that walking for exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms is more important than walking for exercise more frequently or for a longer duration. On the basis of data reported herein, participants with PAD should not be advised to walk for exercise at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms.</p>
              <p>In this study, home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms was significantly worse than home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms for multiple functional outcomes. In comparison, the control group who did not exercise was significantly worse than home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms for only 2 outcomes (usual‚Äêpaced walking velocity and participant‚Äêreported walking velocity at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup). Walking exercise at a comfortable pace could potentially have adverse effects on walking speed or the SPPB if participants slowed their walking speed during daily life in response to the exercise intervention, in which they were instructed to walk at a pace without ischemic leg symptoms. However, because the nonexercise control group was not asked to walk for exercise, the control group would not have voluntarily slowed its walking speed, which may explain why the nonexercise control group was significantly worse for a smaller number of outcomes than the group who walked for exercise at a comfortable pace, and compared with the group who walked for exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms. In addition, the control group had a smaller sample size than the 2 exercise groups, which reduced statistical power to demonstrate statistically significant differences in change in 4‚Äêm walking velocity or the SPPB between the participants randomized to walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms and the control group who did not exercise.</p>
              <p>This study has some limitations. First, results reported herein may not apply to supervised treadmill exercise interventions. Second, a small proportion of participants randomized into the LITE trial (41/305 [13%]) did not complete the 4‚Äêm walking velocity measures or the SPPB, or respond to the question on self‚Äêreported walking pace, and were not included in these analyses. Third, these results are post hoc and exploratory and require confirmation. Fourth, some comparisons likely lacked statistical power to attain a statistically significant difference because of the relatively small sample size. For example, the 2 comparisons between the 2 exercise groups that were not statistically significant had <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&lt;0.15, favoring the exercise group who induced ischemic leg symptoms. In addition, the control group included a smaller sample size than the 2 exercise groups. Fifth, the validity of the comparison based on mixed models for repeated measures analysis depends on the missing at random assumption, which was not empirically verifiable. However, there were no statistically significant differences in characteristics of people who completed all follow‚Äêup visits, those who completed some follow‚Äêup visits, and those excluded because they did not complete ollow‚Äêup visits (Table¬†<xref rid="jah37596-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). Sixth, in these post hoc analyses, outcomes were not prioritized and there was no formal adjustment for multiple testing. Therefore, some comparisons may have been statistically significant by chance. Seventh, some baseline characteristics were different between the 3 comparison groups. However, except for prevalence of myocardial infarction at baseline, none of the differences was statistically significant and additional adjustment for characteristics that differed at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>‚â§0.2 across the 3 groups at baseline did not meaningfully change the results.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>In people with PAD, those who walked for exercise at a comfortable pace without ischemic leg symptoms slowed their walking speed during daily life and worsened the SPPB score, a potentially harmful effect, compared with people who walked for exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms. Compared with a control group who did not exercise, home‚Äêbased walking exercise at a pace inducing ischemic leg symptoms significantly improved 4‚Äêm walking velocity at 6‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup, but this benefit did not persist at 12‚Äêmonth follow‚Äêup.</p>
