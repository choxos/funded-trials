                  <p>Mean 25(OH)D level at 12 months was 26.0 ng/mL with low dose and 36.0 ng/mL with high dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The proportion of participants reaching a value ≥ 20 ng/mL was 86% in the low dose, and 99% in the high dose arms, with no gender differences. The increment of 25(OH)D per 100 IU/day was 1 ng/mL with the low dose, and 0.41 ng/mL with the high dose. Serum 25(OH)D levels at 1 year were highly variable in both treatment arms. Baseline 25(OH)D level and vitamin D dose—but not age, BMI, gender, or season—were significant predictors of serum 25(OH)D level post-intervention.</p>

            <p>Vitamin D is a steroid hormone known for its critical role in bone metabolism and musculoskeletal health (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Ample evidence also demonstrates its extraskeletal physiologic actions (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem that affects all populations (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It is particularly common in the Middle East, despite the region’s abundant sunlight (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Vitamin D supplementation is a universally accepted therapeutic approach; but guidelines vary widely globally (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends that a daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> dose of 600 IU is adequate to bring 97.5% of the population to a prespecified desirable 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The 2011 Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline proposes that the daily dietary intake should be 1000 to 2000 IU to reach a target level above 30 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Some reasons behind this lack of consensus include scarcity of clinical trials–based evidence, different target populations, varied desirable 25(OH)D levels, and discordant approaches to the vitamin D dose-response relationship (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
            <p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) clearly demonstrate substantial variability in reported levels achieved for comparable doses, within, and between ethnic groups (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12-14</xref>). This raises questions regarding the applicability of the IOM recommended daily allowance (RDA) to non-US populations. Furthermore, there has been a rising trend for hypervitaminosis D due to over supplementation in both developing and developed countries (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
            <p>In this study, we capitalize on data available from a completed vitamin D trial, to investigate the impact of 2 doses of vitamin D, bracketed between the IOM RDA and the upper tolerable limit, on vitamin D nutritional status, in elderly ambulatory individuals.</p>

Study subjects were recruited from outpatient clinics or through advertisements posted at AUBMC, Hotel Dieu de France, Rafic Hariri Governmental University Hospital, and health dispensaries of the Ministry of Social Affairs, all from the greater Beirut Area.</p>
                <p>Exclusion criteria included patients with prediabetes on oral hypoglycemic medications, diabetes (fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C] ≥ 6.5%), chronic heart failure (stage III or IV), liver failure or cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 30 mL/min), cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Participants were also excluded if they had conditions or were on medications known to affect bone metabolism, such as osteomalacia, history of kidney stones, fragility fractures, or a 10-year fracture risk (FRAX) exceeding 10% for major osteoporotic fractures using the Lebanon Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) version 3.08 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.jsp" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/tool.jsp</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>Study Drug</title>
                <p>All subjects received 4 tablets of calcium citrate daily (Citracal D: 250 mg elemental calcium and 125 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/tablet) amounting to a total of 1000 mg of elemental calcium and 500 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> daily. Additionally, each subject received 2 pills identical in shape, size, color, smell, and taste, taken once weekly, consisting of placebo in the low dose arm and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (Euro D: 10 000 IU/pill) in the high dose arm. All the pills were provided by Europharm, Canada. Based on the certificate of analysis provided by Europharm to the Canadian regulatory agencies for all trial lots, the actual vitamin D<sub>3</sub> content was 150 IU and 11 000 IU in the Citracal D and Euro D tablets, respectively. Therefore, participants received a total daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> equivalent of 600 IU in the low dose arm and 3750 IU in the high dose arm. Daily calcium intake was assessed through a detailed food-frequency questionnaire about the consumption of several dairy products.</p>
                <p>All the study drugs were stored and dispensed in identical boxes at the central pharmacy in AUBMC, where the senior pharmacist implemented randomization and allocation concealment with stratification by gender and center (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).

                <p>Participants presented for follow-up every 3 months, where weight, height, and vital signs were measured, questionnaires were administered, study bottles were returned, and refill bottles were provided. At each visit (3, 6, and 12 months), study subjects were asked about adverse events, medication intake, and pill counts. Each participant was also contacted by phone every 2 weeks to encourage compliance, which was calculated as the percentage of full possible dose ([total number of study drug pills taken/total number of pills provided] ×100).</p>
                <p>Serum 25(OH)D levels were assayed at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months. Blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 minutes, centrifuged for 20 minutes, and immediately processed, or stored at −80 °C, depending on the assay. Serum 25(OH)D was run using liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS) at the Mayo Clinic Clinical Laboratories, (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota). That laboratory participates in the vitamin D quality assurance program, DEQAS. The LCMS methodology in that laboratory is directly traceable to NIST, Mayo Lab = 0.9599 × NIST − 1.3716, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9922. Vitamin D assays were run in batches at study completion, and samples drawn at serial time points for each hormone were included within the same assay for each study subject. Intra-assay coefficients of variation are 3.8%, 2.4%, and 4.7% at 25, 54, and 140 ng/mL, respectively. Inter-assay coefficients of variation are 6.4%, 6.8%, and 5.0% at 24, 52, and 140 ng/mL, respectively.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>The analyses were performed on all randomized subjects who completed the 1-year trial. For almost all variables, data was normally distributed, based on an inspection of histograms and stem leaf plots. Variables were appropriately summarized as mean ± SD or N (%). Serum 25(OH)D levels were compared between groups using the independent <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test and within the same group using paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test. Categorical variables (proportions) were compared using Pearson chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, as applicable. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison between different seasons. Scatter plots tracing each individual’s response to therapy were created by GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Dynamically fit sigmoidal curves illustrating the percentage of patients reaching a spectrum of desirable 25(OH)D levels, in both arms, were generated using SigmaPlot version 15.0 (Systat Software Inc., San-Jose, CA). Bland-Altman plots showing the overlap in delta 25(OH)D between the low and high dose arms were also generated using SigmaPlot. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to explore possible predictors of mean serum 25(OH)D levels at 1 year, and the likelihood of reaching a level above the preset threshold values of 20 and 30 ng/mL. Predictors assessed were age, gender, baseline BMI, season, having a baseline serum 25(OH)D &gt;20 ng/mL, and the vitamin D dose. We calculated the mean delta 25(OH)D per 100 IU at 1 year in each of the low dose and high dose arms, unadjusted and after adjustment for significant predictors. Given that the relationship between vitamin D dose and serum 25(OH)D level is linear at doses between 400 and 1600 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), we calculated the dose that would bring 97.5% of our cohort to a serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 20 ng/mL. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant and was not adjusted for multiplicity of testing. Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).</p>

                <p>Originally, 129 and 128 elderly participants were randomly assigned to receive the high and low dose of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, respectively. Of them, 35 subjects (14%) did not complete the study, and 1 participant refused to share samples with collaborators (for LCMS assay). There was no statistical difference in the dropout rate between the 2 treatment arms. Participants’ baseline characteristics and comorbidities did not differ in the remaining 221 participants from the originally randomized group of 257 subjects (data not shown). The volume of blood sample from 1 subject in the low dose arm and 5 subjects in the high dose arm was not sufficient at follow-up; hence, no outcome data is available for these subjects.</p>
                <p>The remaining overall study group consisted of 122 women and 99 men with a mean age of 71.1 ± 4.7 years, a BMI of 30.2 ± 4.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 20.4 ± 7.4 ng/mL. A total of 111 participants received the low dose, and 110 received the high dose (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Age, gender, baseline BMI, dietary calcium intake, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D levels, and season of recruitment did not differ across treatment arms.</p>

                <title>Interindividual Variability in Serum 25(OH)D Levels Achieved at 1 Year</title>
                <p>Scrutiny of the individual serum 25(OH)D values at 1 year, and the difference in 25(OH)D levels between 12 months and baseline, reveal high variability in the magnitude and direction of response to both doses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To evaluate the impact of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels and dose on the response to therapy, we performed regression analyses of the change (delta) in serum 25(OH)D level with changing baseline 25(OH)D levels, for each dose. As the baseline 25(OH)D levels increased, the change in serum 25(OH)D levels at 1 year decreased, with both doses (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, for any baseline serum 25(OH)D level, there could be substantial variance and overlap in the delta vitamin D achieved, within and between treatment groups (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). The mean increment with the low dose was 6 ng/mL, with a wide range from −13 to 26 ng/mL (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), and 15 ng/mL with the high dose, ranging between −13 and 41 ng/mL (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This 1-year double-blind controlled vitamin D trial reveals that in elderly subjects with an overall baseline serum 25(OH)D level of 20.4 ng/mL, the achieved 25(OH)D level after 1 year of supplementation was 26.0 ng/mL and 36.0 ng/mL, with low and high doses, of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> respectively. Importantly, it demonstrates that the recommended IOM daily dose of 600 IU only brings 86% of elderly overweight or obese ambulatory Lebanese individuals to a serum 25(OH)D level at, or above, the desirable cutoff of 20 ng/mL. However, a higher dose of 3750 IU/day, which is below the upper tolerable limit of 4000 IU/day, brings more than 99% of the study population to such a target. Baseline 25(OH)D level and vitamin D dose were the only significant predictors of 25(OH)D level post-intervention. The increments per 100 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day were 1.00 ng/mL/ 100 IU with the low dose, and 0.41 ng/mL/100 IU with the high dose.</p>
              <p>Although hypovitaminosis is a global problem, there is still lack of consensus over the recommended intake that prevents patients from developing musculoskeletal health outcomes, such as bone loss or hip fractures (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Several international agencies, such as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), Nordic Council of Ministers (NORDEN) (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the German Nutrition Society (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), established their recommendations based on a common target 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL. Yet, their recommendations for desirable dose still varied widely, reflecting the uncertainty of the evidence regarding dose response. The IOM’s and NORDEN’s RDAs, which should meet the needs of “nearly all” healthy individuals (ie, 97.5%), aged 50 to 70 years, were 600 IU/day and 400 IU/day, respectively. The German Nutrition Society and the ESFA proposed “Adequate Intake (AI)” values of 800 IU/day and 600 IU/day, respectively.</p>
              <p>Multiple randomized control trials tried to establish the optimal vitamin D dose that achieves a target desirable level. Our findings are consistent with those reported in a recent small 6-month trial by Shirvani et al, who investigated the effect of 3 different vitamin D doses (600, 4000, and 10 000 IU/day) in 30 healthy young adults with a mean BMI &lt; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and mean baseline level of 17.1 ± 5.9 ng/mL. A vitamin D dose of 600 IU/day corrected 25(OH)D level to ≥ 20 ng/mL in 71% of the participants but brought only 14% of participants to ≥ 30 ng/mL. However, higher doses of 4000 and 10 000 IU/day allowed all participants to reach a serum 25(OH)D level ≥30 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Another trial on 225 free-living Caucasian adults &gt;64 years demonstrated that 600 IU/day was adequate for 99% of the participants to achieve a 25(OH)D level of ≥ 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Heaney et al investigated several vitamin D doses (0, 1000, 5000, and 10 000 IU/day) in 67 healthy men (mean age, 38.7 ± 11.2 years) in Nebraska in order to identify the steady state cholecalciferol input during winter that sustains the baseline autumn 25(OH)D level of 20.8 ng/mL. He concluded that in addition to the daily contribution from food and tissue stores, healthy men would need around 500 IU/day to sustain their starting 25(OH)D level (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Gallagher et al investigated a wide range of vitamin D doses (400-4800 IU/day) in 163 healthy postmenopausal women in Nebraska, (mean age, 67 years), and found that 800 IU/day is needed to achieve a level ≥ 20 ng/mL. The dose-response relationship was curvilinear, plateauing at a level of around 44.9 ng/mL in subjects receiving doses greater than 3200 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Smith et al combined the analysis from the VitaDAS and ViDOS studies and showed in a best fitting model that, in Caucasians, 800 IU/day and 2400 IU/day are required to reach serum 25(OH)D levels of 20 ng/mL and 30 ng/mL, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A trial of 126 Chinese adults &gt; 60 years of age showed that 2000 IU/day is required to allow &gt; 86% of individuals to achieve the Endocrine Society recommended level of 30 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In another trial of 92 healthy postmenopausal Indian women (mean age, 54.8 years), only 16% and 66.67% of participants achieved a level ≥ 20 ng/mL with 500 IU and 1000 IU per day, respectively (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). An RCT of 328 healthy African American women (43-59 years of age) showed that 1640 IU/day was required to achieve 20 ng/mL in 97.5% of the participants (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), possibly reflecting the need for a higher dose in subjects with lower baseline levels.</p>
              <p>According to a meta-analysis conducted in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which included 2 trials in the elderly (age &gt; 65 years) and 17 in adults (18–65 years), only 89% receiving high dose (&gt;2000 IU/day) and 71% of participants receiving intermediate (800–2000 IU/day) doses, reached a desirable threshold of 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Another recent meta-regression analysis investigating region- and age-specific responses to vitamin D supplementation showed that adults in the MENA region require 1229 IU/day to reach ≥ 30 ng/mL, whereas European adults (65-85 years old) can achieve the same level with only 797 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Shab-Bidar et al also conducted a meta-regression analysis including 7150 individuals (mean age, 65.8) from several regions including the United States, Europe, Australia, and India, and reported that a dose of 800 IU/day is required to bring &gt;97.5% of subjects to 20 ng/mL (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). To avoid the limitations inherent to meta-analysis of aggregate data, Cashman et al conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-regression using 7 wintertime North European RCTs to derive estimates of recommended vitamin D intakes. The ages in these trials varied widely, with only 1 trial in elderly participants (mean age, 70 years), while other trials were in children, adolescents, and younger adults. The IPD–derived estimate that brought &gt;97.5% of the population to ≥ 20 ng/mL was ~26 µg/day (1040 IU/day), after adjusting for age and baseline level, whereas a standard meta-regression analysis of aggregate data from the same RCTs (assessed by several international agencies) had estimated the vitamin D requirement to be ~14 µg/day (560 IU/day) (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Considering that the relationship between vitamin D dose and serum 25(OH)D level is linear at doses from 400 to 1600 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and the mean increment per 100 IU at low doses is 1 ng/mL, we project that the RDA in the overweight and obese Lebanese elderly would be 1100 IU/day. Such projection is based on mean increments in serum 25(OH)D levels and does not take into account individual variations in response to vitamin D supplementation. Importantly, our projection is consistent with that reported by the IPD meta-analysis by Cashman et al (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p>Baseline 25(OH)D level and vitamin D dose were the only significant predictors of 25(OH)D level post-intervention, accounting for 36.2% of the variance in response to therapy. In line with our results, several previous studies consistently reported that the vitamin D dose (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31-37</xref>) and baseline 25(OH)D level (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31-35</xref>) are significant predictors of the achieved level post-intervention. Exceptionally, 1 meta-analysis conducted by Autier et al on 6207 Caucasian participants older than 50 years receiving median vitamin D3 dose of 800 IU/day (range, 200-10 000 IU/day) revealed an inverse association between baseline 25(OH)D level and increments of serum 25(OH)D, but it did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Conversely, another global study of 7564 postmenopausal women from 5 continents showed that the achieved level was higher for individuals with a baseline level &lt; 25 nmol/L (&lt;10 ng/mL), compared with those &gt; 50 nmol/L (&gt; 20 ng/mL) (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This heterogeneity in results could be due to variations in ethnicity and age across studies. Other factors such as age (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), type of vitamin D (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), trial duration (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), as well as BMI and season (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), were significant predictors of achieved serum 25(OH)D level in the literature, but they did not reach statistical significance in our trial. This may be explained by the relatively narrow range for age and BMI, in an exclusively older cohort, with entry criteria stipulating a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The impact of ethnicity on the achieved level after supplementation was explored by Mo et al, in an analysis that showed that vitamin D dose and baseline 25(OH)D level consistently and significantly predicted the achieved level in adults from different regions including Europe, North America, Asia, and the MENA region, whereas age was a significant predictor only in Europe (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It was otherwise difficult to dissect the influence of ethnicity on achieved level, as many meta-analyses included trials from diverse regions/ethnicities and did not account for this variable.</p>
              <p>Our 25(OH)D increments per 100 IU/day were 1 ng/mL for subjects randomized to 600 IU/day and 0.41 ng/mL for subjects randomized to 3750 IU/day. This trend is similar to what has been reported in the literature. Gallagher et al noted increments of 1.6 ng/mL per 100 IU in postmenopausal older women randomized to 400 IU/day, and 0.6 ng/mL per 100 IU in women randomized to 4800 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Mo et al also demonstrated that among the elderly, there was an inverse trend between the dose administered and the achieved level, where the increment was 3.3 nmol/L per 100 IU/day (1.3 ng/mL per 100 IU/day) with the low weighted mean dose of 606 IU, whereas it was 1.7 nmol/L per 100 IU/day (0.68 ng/mL per 100 IU/day) with higher doses of 3900 IU/day (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). He also showed that the increment per 100 IU/day is dependent on both the baseline 25(OH)D level (where it was highest in Asian adults who have a lower baseline than North Americans and Europeans), as well as age (where it was highest in adults aged &gt;64 years compared with those aged 18-64 years receiving the same low dose) even though the weighted mean baseline 25(OH)D level in the elderly was higher than that of the adults (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The increment per 100 IU/day also varies by body size, with smaller increments reported in individuals with higher BMI (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Chakhtoura et al also demonstrated that the increment per 100 IU/day was lowest (0.4-0.5 ng/mL) with high (3750 IU) and intermediate (1000 IU) doses, and highest (1 ng/mL) with low doses (600 IU) (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study has few potential limitations. It was limited geographically to the Greater Beirut area; however, study subjects were recruited from health centers that draw from 30% to 40% of the Lebanese population. The baseline 25(OH)D level (20.4 ng/mL) is representative of the general Lebanese population and is comparable to baseline levels in many other elderly cohorts worldwide (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Our cohort consists of overweight and obese individuals (mean BMI, 30.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); therefore, our findings are not generalizable to a population of leaner elderly individuals. However, our results apply to a large proportion of males and females older than 65 years worldwide. Indeed, the overweight and obesity rates average at 40% in males and 35% in females in developing countries, and at around 65% for males and females in developed countries (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The trial lacked a placebo arm because it would be unethical to have a control group without vitamin D supplementation given that more than half of our elderly cohort had a 25(OH)D level below 20 ng/mL. Importantly, the low dose corresponds to the currently recommended RDA by the IOM for adults and elderly until age 70 years, and thus serves as an appropriate surrogate control in our cohort. Our study duration was only 1 year, but vitamin D levels plateau within few weeks of administration (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). We measured serum total 25(OH)D levels, and not the free or bioavailable metabolites. However, we have recently shown in this trial cohort that free and bioavailable 25(OH)D levels are not superior to total 25(OH)D in predicting bone health outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We did not test the efficacy of an intermediate dose, for example, 2200 IU/day, due to lack of sufficient funding.</p>
              <p>Our study has several important strengths, including its double-blind design, its clinical relevance from recruiting high-risk elderly individuals, having included both genders, and having recruited across all seasons. We used vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, the most commonly used form of vitamin D, measured its actual content in the tablets administered, and used LCMS for serum 25(OH)D measurements. We also ensured high compliance of study subjects. Importantly, our choice of the doses of vitamin D also serves as a crucial strength, as the low dose (600 IU/day) is anchored at the IOM-recommended dose, and the high dose (3750 IU/day) is below the IOM upper tolerable limit.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, in elderly overweight and obese Lebanese ambulatory subjects, with a mean 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL, the IOM recommended dose of 600 IU/day is not sufficient to bring 97.5% of the cohort above the desirable threshold of 20 ng/mL. The trial fills a major knowledge gap and provides evidence for care pathways and guidance for defining adequate vitamin D intake for ambulatory elderly subjects, from this region. We project that a dose of 1100 IU/day would approximate the RDA for the elderly Lebanese. A dose response curve adjusted by age and baseline 25(OH)D level would best be suited to identify the lowest dose that surely allows individuals in the Middle East to achieve the desirable level.</p>
