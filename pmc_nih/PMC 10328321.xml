                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>To fully leverage the potential of the early care and education (ECE) setting for childhood obesity prevention, initiatives must not intervene solely at the organizational level, but rather they should also address the health needs of the ECE workers. Workers suffer disproportionately high rates of obesity, and have reported low confidence in modeling and promoting healthy eating and activity behaviors. However, information regarding the effectiveness of improving ECE workers’ health behaviors or whether such improvements elicit meaningful change in the ECE environment and/or the children in their care is limited.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>The proposed study will integrate a staff wellness intervention into a nationally recognized, ECE obesity prevention initiative (Go NAPSACC). Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness program will be assessed using a clustered randomized controlled trial including 84 ECE centers, 168 workers, and 672 2–5-year-old children. Centers will be randomly assigned to 1) standard “Go NAPSACC” or 2) Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness. Outcome measures will assess impact on dietary intake and PA behaviors of 2-5-year-old children at 6 months (primary aim) and 12 months. Secondarily, we will compare the impact of the intervention on centers’ implementation of healthy weight practices and the effect on ECE workers’ diet quality and PA at 6- and 12 months.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite significant efforts to thwart the increasing incidence of obesity, rates have continued to climb over the past two decades [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Once established, obesity is associated with a myriad of health issues including type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] several cancers [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], lower quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and high burden of medical costs (~$150 billion annually) [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Research shows that the ages between 0–5 years are a critical period in the development of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and that childhood obesity is highly predictive of adult obesity [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Poor eating and physical activity habits, developed during childhood, are important causes of excessive weight gain [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, the environment to which young children are exposed, especially the adult-child relationships they experience, play a key role in shaping these habits that mediate risk of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, early care and education (ECE) centers ─ and their staff ─ have been identified as critical partners in public health efforts to address today’s obesity epidemic.</p>
              <p>Developed over 20 years ago, “Go NAPSACC” is one of the most widely implemented evidence-based childhood obesity prevention initiative [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Go NAPSACC’s user-friendly and interactive tools guide ECE directors through a five-step improvement process [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Go NAPSACC has been implemented in over 25 states and received national recognition as “best evidence for impact” on childhood obesity [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While Go NAPSACC is shown to be efficacious in improving organizational-level policies and practices around healthy eating and physical activity in ECE programs, the program is primarily delivered through ECE directors with little direct engagement of other workers (e.g., teachers, assistants, cooks). Research has shown that workers’ own eating and physical activity patterns reduce their confidence and ability to model and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors to children [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ECE workers specifically list their own lack of knowledge about nutrition and physical activity as critical barriers to obesity prevention efforts [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], including Go NAPSACC [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Untapped opportunities exist to address workers’ health that would both improve their own quality of life and create healthier environments for the children in their care.</p>
              <p>Using Go NAPSACC, we have the opportunity to assess if a comprehensive early childhood obesity prevention initiative that also addresses the health of ECE workers elicits meaningful change in the ECE environment and health behaviors of children in their care. If successful, findings will provide a highly implementable, scalable, and sustainable strategy that would enhance the standard paradigm of early childhood obesity prevention initiatives. This manuscript presents the background, rationale, and design to be used in this study.</p>

                <title>Design overview</title>
                <p>The proposed study is a cluster-randomized trial with a six-month active intervention and a six-month no contact follow-up period. Centers in both arms will receive the standard Go NAPSACC program. The intervention arm will be enhanced with an ECE worker-level healthy lifestyle intervention that encourages healthy eating, increased physical activity, and weight management (Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness). The dual primary outcomes are child’s diet quality and physical activity between baseline and post-intervention (6 months); secondary outcomes include worker diet quality, physical activity, weight, and centers’ use of evidence-based healthy lifestyle practices. The assessment schedule is shown in <xref rid="pone.0286912.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05656807, Protocol version 1.0, 22 March 2023).</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>A convenience sample of 84 ECE centers will be recruited in four cohorts across four years from central North Carolina. ECE centers will be identified from the NC Division of Child Development and Early Education website (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ncchildcare.ncdhhs.gov/childcaresearch" ext-link-type="uri">ncchildcare.ncdhhs.gov/childcaresearch</ext-link>), a publicly available database of licensed ECE facilities. Recruitment efforts will incorporate a multi-phase approach to ensure the engagement of centers and center directors as well as workers and parents. Recruitment efforts within each county will start by identifying community organizations which have established working relationships with local ECE centers. These community partners will be asked to endorse study participation and help distribute study information through their existing communication channels (e.g., newsletters, emails, partner website, group meetings). These communications will be followed by personalized email and mailed invitations about the study directly to centers from the study team. Then the team will follow up with direct solicitation to center directors to gauge interest and confirm center eligibility. Eligible ECE centers must 1) be open year-round, 2) be licensed with no plans to close in the next two years, 3) have been in operation for at least one year, 4) have at least two classrooms serving children 2–5 years-old, 5) serve lunch, 6) have no history of Go NAPSACC participation in the past 6 months. Additionally, two ECE classroom teachers serving 2–5-year-old children and eight primary caregivers of children from each classroom must provide written consent to participate. Once initial interest and eligibility are confirmed, an in-person recruitment visit will be scheduled to introduce the study to ECE teachers, answer questions about participation, invite teacher participation, and conduct informed written consent procedures. Eligible ECE workers must 1) be 18 years-old or older, 2) be a teacher of a 2–5-year-old classroom, 3) be able to read English, and 4) not be pregnant, nor planning to become pregnant in the next year. Once a center and teachers agree to participate, we will work with them to recruit children from their center. A follow up visit will be scheduled to collect written consents and answer any questions from primary caregivers. Eligible children must 1) be in a classroom with a participating ECE teacher, 2) be 2–5 years old, and 3) consenting primary caregiver must be able to read English.</p>

Go NAPSACC provides a well-known platform within the ECE setting that allows intervention materials and support to be available continuously; thus, participants can engage with intervention materials on their own schedule and progress at their own pace. Go NAPSACC offers a suite of interactive, online tools that guide center directors through a 5-step improvement process (described below) to increase use of healthy eating and physical activity evidence-based practices (<ext-link xlink:href="https://gonapsacc.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://gonapsacc.org/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Standard Go NAPSACC theoretical model</title>
                <p>The Go NAPSACC program is guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and the Social Ecological Model (SEM). A core concept in SCT is reciprocal determinism, which suggests that behavior is shaped by the dynamic and reciprocal interaction between personal, environmental, and behavioral factors. SCT also recognizes that behavioral capability, observational learning, reinforcement, expectancies, and self-efficacy influence behavior. SEM posits that health behaviors are shaped by individuals’ interactions with the physical and social environment, recognizing sources of influence coming from individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy levels. Go NAPSACC applies this to children in ECE by recognizing that their eating and physical activity behaviors will be shaped by this ECE environment, and the opportunities it offers to experience, learn about, and build skills needed to adopt healthy lifestyle habits.</p>

The SLD, originally developed by Epstein [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], is an effective weight loss strategy for both children [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and adults [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Stoplight approaches categorize foods by energy content: green (low calories/high nutrients: consume freely), yellow (moderate calories/high nutrients: consume in moderation), and red (high calories/low nutrients: consume sparingly). Stoplight approaches may be easier for participants to understand and take less time than traditional calorie monitoring, particularly when asked to track only red foods. Tracking only red or high-calorie foods is a form of simplified or partial self-monitoring with demonstrated feasibility, acceptable adherence rates, and leads to clinically relevant weight losses [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

Using NDSR output, we will calculate Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) scores which assess conformance with dietary guidelines, providing a score ranging from 0 to 100, where scores closer to 100 indicate higher diet quality [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
                <p>Teachers’ dietary intake will be assessed using food records collected and analyzed by the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool developed by the National Cancer Institute. This tool has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and has been validated in adults [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. ASA24 is an automated web-based tool which allows multiple 24-hour recalls to be completed independently by participants using any internet enabled device. The website prompts participants to report detailed information about all the food and beverages consumed, using a multi-step process in which they record eating occasions, times, and add foods and beverages consumed. Teachers will record all food, beverages, and supplements consumed for 3 days (2 weekdays, 1 weekend day) within a 2-week period. Using ASA24 output, we will calculate HEI-2015 scores [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>

The EPAO uses direct observation and review of written documents to capture environmental components of ECE: foods and beverages provided, feeding practices, feeding environment, menus, time provided for active play and outdoor play, indoor and outdoor play environment, teacher active play practices, screen availability, teacher screen practices, education and professional development, and policy. This measure has good inter-rater reliability [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and sensitivity to change following interventions [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. For EPAO data collection, each classroom will be observed for a full day. Data will be scored according to the EPAO scoring rubric, which first assesses compliance with nutrition and physical activity best practices, scoring each best practice using a 4-point scale (where higher scores indicate better compliance). Best practice compliance variables are then used to calculate environmental component scores that capture the various aspects of the nutrition and physical activity environment. Each environmental component score is calculated by averaging the relevant best practice compliance scores. Finally, the environmental component scores are summed to determine an overall nutrition and physical activity environment score.</p>

Using maximum likelihood methods, we will use multi-level linear mixed models (PROC MIXED) with repeated measures to estimate change at 6 and 12 months and to test for statistical differences across groups in changes over time. Models will include random effects for cluster to account for covariance between participants within the same center as well as fixed effects for time, trial arm, and time*arm interaction. A proper error covariance structure will be chosen based on model fit indicated by model likelihood, Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion. To further explore the effect of the intervention, these analyses will be followed by sensitivity analyses that adjust for baseline variables distributed differently between intervention groups and examine completers only. Similar analyses will be completed for each secondary outcome including teacher physical activity, HEI scores, weight, as well as center physical activity and nutrition environments. While every effort will be made to avoid missing data, we expect some missing data due to attrition and nonresponse.

                <p>This trial is powered to detect between group difference (Standard Go NAPSACC vs. Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness) of 5 units in child HEI score and 1 minute per hour in non-sedentary physical activity. Based on intraclass correlation (ICC) from our preliminary work and those of others [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], we estimate ICC of 0.04 and 0.07 for HEI score and 0.07 and 0.10 for non-sedentary physical activity at the teacher- and center-levels, respectively and standard deviation of change in HEI score of 11 units [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and non-sedentary physical activity of 3 minutes per hour. Furthermore, we calculated power for each of the two primary comparisons using a type I error rate of 2.5%, thus keeping overall Type I error rate at 0.05. Sample size was initially calculated using assumptions associated with non-sedentary physical activity knowing that the higher ICC would require a larger sample size. This sample size was then used to conduct a power analysis for HEI score. Given this, a sample size of 84 centers, with two 2-5-year-old classroom per center, and an average of 4 children per classroom, for a total of 672 children, would allow us to detect a clinically meaningful difference in non-sedentary physical activity with 88% power and HEI score with 99% power at α = 0.025 level of significance between the two study arms. Even with up to 20% attrition for centers and children, a completer’s only analysis will still provide 81% and 98% power for change in non-sedentary physical activity and HEI score, respectively, which is higher attrition than we expect based on our previous trials [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Initiation and evaluation of the Go NAPSACC Cares program is based on the premise that ECE workers are critical for the success of ECE-based early childhood obesity prevention initiatives, with the goal of improving ECE workers’ eating and activity behaviors such that these positive changes have a ripple effect onto child behaviors. The study is expected to include 84 ECE programs, 168 teachers, and 672 children followed over 12 months. All participating ECE programs will be exposed to the Go NAPSACC program and an implementation specialist for 6 months. In the staff wellness arm teachers will also receive a tailored diet and physical activity intervention during this 6-month period. During the maintenance period (months 7–12) all participants will maintain access to their respective program materials but engagement with research staff and interventionists will cease.</p>
              <p>Information regarding the effectiveness of improving worker health behaviors or whether such improvements elicit meaningful change in the ECE environment and the children in their care is limited [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. For example, no study included in a 2020 scoping review of interventions targeting the health status of the ECE workforce reported data on the impact on child outcomes and only 5 of 11 studies reported worker health outcomes. 79 Moreover, the majority of these studies are limited by small samples [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], no control groups [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and lack of objective measures of physical activity, environment, and workplace supports [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. One study published subsequent to the 2020 scoping review found workers’ self-reported increases in their own health status were associated with greater improvements in the classroom environment, however, no objective measures of workers’ health or child outcomes were collected [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Moreover, the low-intensity of these interventions is an additional methodologic concern as evidence suggests more intensive lifestyle interventions are needed to produce clinically meaningful change in health behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Due to the limited body of evidence available, and the potential health benefits to workers and the children in their care, the 2020 scoping review concluded there is a critical need to develop and evaluate ECE worker health promotion interventions [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Considering Go NAPSACC’s wide dissemination within ECE setting, it offers a natural platform to deliver a health promotion intervention for ECE workers. This addition will not only address the health needs of workers but could also improve their engagement in Go NASPACC’s program-wide efforts to implement evidence-based childhood obesity prevention practices.</p>
              <p>To address gaps in the field, we considered several design features. These included: type of worker intervention, BMI inclusions, dietary strategies, and self-monitoring approaches. Comprehensive healthy lifestyles approach with a focus on weight management was chosen because it has been identified as a primary health concern of ECE workers [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] and our own research has shown a high desire for such interventions. We hypothesize that meeting these demands of the workers, via a Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness program, will improve the health status of the worker, boost instruction and modeling of healthy lifestyle behaviors in ECE settings, and may subsequently enhance Go NAPSACC’s effect on the ECE environment. We chose to include ECE workers with BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2. An estimated 88% of the ECE worker population are classified with overweight or obesity [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], therefore, the majority of workers will benefit from a weight management intervention. For individuals who are within the healthy BMI range (18.5–24.9 kg/m2) recommendations will be tailored to improving physical activity and diet quality for general health. Self-monitoring is associated with improved weight loss and maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Adherence to self-monitoring protocols is improved, and the probability of dropout is reduced in weight management trials using electronic compared with traditional pencil/paper records [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Thus, to improve the low compliance with self-monitoring seen in our previous trial [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] we chose the Fitbit (PA) and Bluetooth-tooth enabled scales (weight) as these commercially available technologies are easy to use, provide immediate feedback, and interface seamlessly with any Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g. smartphone, tablet computer). The stoplight approach to dietary changes, originally developed by Epstein [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], is an effective weight loss strategy for both children [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and adults [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as indicated by a Grade 1 ranking (strong, consistent, supporting evidence) from The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library [<xref rid="pone.0286912.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
              <p>A unique feature of this study is the inclusion of the secondary users within each center. While per study protocol two 2–5-year-old classroom teachers from each center will be recruited and enrolled for all study components, we will allow access to the staff wellness program to all ECE workers (e.g., other teachers, assistant teachers, and additional staff) in centers randomized to the Go NAPSACC+ Staff Wellness arm. Gauging interest and use of the staff wellness online tool (e.g., logins, lessons completed, health behavior data entered) of staff not officially enrolled in the study will provide insight into pragmatic use of the program in the ECE setting. This information will add additional insight regarding the accessibility and sustainability for future implementation.</p>

              <p>In conclusion, Go NAPSACC Cares is a clustered randomized trial to evaluate if improving ECE care workers’ health behaviors elicit meaningful change in dietary and physical activity behaviors in 2-5-year-old preschool children in their care and of the ECE environment. The study will improve our understanding of how workers’ own health outcomes facilitate the impact of such initiatives. It will also provide a highly implementable, scalable, and sustainable strategy that would optimize obesity prevention in the ECE setting. The Go NAPSACC Cares study represents an important step forward to evaluate the potential impact ECE workers have on the care environment and children’s eating and physical activity behaviors.</p>
