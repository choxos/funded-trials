                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>In low-income and middle-income countries, affordable direct-acting antivirals are urgently needed to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The combination of ravidasvir, a pangenotypic non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor, and sofosbuvir has shown efficacy and safety in patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection. STORM-C-1 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir in a diverse population of adults chronically infected with HCV.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>STORM-C-1 is a two-stage, open-label, phase 2/3 single-arm clinical trial in six public academic and non-academic centres in Malaysia and four public academic and non-academic centres in Thailand. Patients with HCV with compensated cirrhosis (Metavir F4 and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A) or without cirrhosis (Metavir F0–3) aged 18–69 years were eligible to participate, regardless of HCV genotype, HIV infection status, previous interferon-based HCV treatment, or source of HCV infection. Once daily ravidasvir (200 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) were prescribed for 12 weeks for patients without cirrhosis and for 24 weeks for those with cirrhosis. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12; defined as HCV RNA &lt;12 IU/mL in Thailand and HCV RNA &lt;15 IU/mL in Malaysia at 12 weeks after the end of treatment). This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, number <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02961426" id="interrefs20">NCT02961426</ext-link>, and the National Medical Research Register of Malaysia, NMRR-16-747-29183.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 14, 2016, and June 5, 2017, 301 patients were enrolled in stage one of STORM-C-1. 98 (33%) patients had genotype 1a infection, 27 (9%) had genotype 1b infection, two (1%) had genotype 2 infection, 158 (52%) had genotype 3 infection, and 16 (5%) had genotype 6 infection. 81 (27%) patients had compensated cirrhosis, 90 (30%) had HIV co-infection, and 99 (33%) had received previous interferon-based treatment. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were pyrexia (35 [12%]), cough (26 [9%]), upper respiratory tract infection (23 [8%]), and headache (20 [7%]). There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to serious adverse events related to study drugs. Of the 300 patients included in the full analysis set, 291 (97%; 95% CI 94–99) had SVR12. Of note, SVR12 was reported in 78 (96%) of 81 patients with cirrhosis and 153 (97%) of 158 patients with genotype 3 infection, including 51 (96%) of 53 patients with cirrhosis. There was no difference in SVR12 rates by HIV co-infection or previous interferon treatment.</p>

                  <p>In this first stage, ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir was effective and well tolerated in this diverse adult population of patients with chronic HCV infection. Ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir has the potential to provide an additional affordable, simple, and efficacious public health tool for large-scale implementation to eliminate HCV as a cause of morbidity and mortality.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">In 2016, prices of direct-acting antivirals restricted access to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in most low-income and middle-income countries in which the burden of disease was the greatest. 50 middle-income countries, estimated to host 43% of the global HCV burden, were excluded from license agreements of originator companies for key HCV drugs, leaving a large treatment gap. Ravidasvir has been developed in a public–private partnership to be available for the treatment of HCV at an affordable price. A landscape analysis involving desk research, workshops, and interviews with key stakeholders was done by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases <italic>initiative</italic> in 2014, after which in-depth research into HCV was done and meetings were held with key stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention in this area. A PubMed search was done using the terms “daclatasvir” and “ravidasvir” for clinical trials published from Jan 1, 2011, to May 2, 2016, without language restrictions, and a search was done using the same terms for abstracts from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver conferences from Jan 1, 2011, to May 2, 2016. An investigator's brochure for ravidasvir was available. Before this study, there was little evidence on the efficacy of ravidasvir in patients with HCV. Efficacy of ravidasvir in combination with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir and ribavirin in patients with HCV genotype 1 had been shown in Taiwan and China, and a phase 3 study in Egypt concluded that ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir is efficacious and safe in patients with by HCV genotype 4. However, we were aware of the results of these studies, which had not yet been published, and data on the efficacy and safety of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir in patients with other HCV genotypes were not available.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Stage one of the STORM-C-1 study is the first trial to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 12-week and 24-week ribavirin-free regimens of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir in people with HCV from diverse clinical backgrounds, including patients with HIV co-infection and genotypes other than 1 or 4. Interim analysis showed that treatment in 301 patients without and with compensated cirrhosis was efficacious, regardless of HIV infection and previous interferon experience: 97% of patients had SVR12 in the full analysis set. Of note, 96% of the patients with difficult-to-cure HCV genotype 3 with cirrhosis had SVR12 without ribavirin. In this study population with high incidence of comorbidities, the regimen was well tolerated, had a favourable safety profile, and there were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions with HIV antiretrovirals commonly prescribed in Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">The overall high SVR12 rate in this interim analysis supports the use of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir as a 12-week and 24-week treatment option for patients with genotype 1a, 1b, or 3 infection, either with or without compensated cirrhosis. A small number of patients with genotypes 2 and 6 were treated; the enrolment of an additional 300 patients in stage two of the study will provide additional data on efficacy and safety for these subgroups. This new regimen appears to be suitable for use in diverse populations, including patients with HIV and multiple comorbidities, and could minimise pretreatment assessments and on-treatment monitoring, allowing the management of HCV in decentralised public health settings under the supervision of appropriately trained health-care professionals. The low rate of unsuccessful treatments has potential implications for retreatment, which is important for countries in which access to salvage therapies is restricted and expensive. The use of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir could be scaled up, together with active identification and linkage to care of patients with HCV, in test and treat approaches. It has the potential to provide an additional affordable, simple, and efficacious public health tool for large-scale implementation to eliminate HCV as a cause of morbidity and mortality in countries that do not have, or have overcome, sofosbuvir patent barriers.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para90">Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) are an important advance in the treatment of HCV; however, only about 5 million (7%) of the 71 million patients with HCV infection received treatment with DAAs worldwide as of 2017.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although license agreements have been signed between originator and generic companies for important HCV drugs to increase access to treatment, primarily in low-income and middle-income countries, most countries do not implement ambitious test and treat programmes because of prohibitive treatment costs.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p id="para100">Globally, the two most prevalent genotypes of HCV are genotype 1, which accounts for 44% of infections and is more prevalent in high-income countries, and genotype 3, which accounts for 25% of infections and is more prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Genotype 3 infection is harder to treat with DAAs, especially in patients with co-factors for poor response, such as cirrhosis and previous peginterferon-based therapy, and is associated with hepatic steatosis and increased risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Regional HCV treatment guidelines differ on the treatment of genotype 3 infection: US guidelines recommend the addition of ribavirin to sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir combination regimens,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> whereas European guidelines do not recommend use of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in patients with genotype 3 infection and cirrhosis, preferring recommending a longer treatment duration with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para110">Ravidasvir, an oral, pangenotypic non-structural protein 5 A (NS5A) inhibitor, is under development as an affordable DAA for public health use.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> It has high activity against HCV genotype 3a,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> with inhibitory effects on HCV variants with NS5A resistance mutations.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of NS5B polymerase approved for treatment of HCV genotype 1–6 infections in combination with other DAAs.</p>
              <p id="para120">At the time this study started in 2016, no safety or efficacy studies for ravidasvir had been published. Since then, three studies have been published. In 298 patients with HCV genotype 4 infection from Egypt, a 12–16 week oral formulation of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin showed good safety and efficacy, with an overall sustained virological response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) of 95%.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Ravidasvir in combination with ritonavir-boosted danoprevir and ribavirin had efficacy in patients with genotype 1 infection: 38 (100%) of 38 patients from Taiwan<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and 306 (96%) of 318 patients from China had SVR12.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> However, ribavirin is teratogenic and often poorly tolerated, necessitating additional pretreatment evaluation and more on-treatment monitoring of haemoglobin, making it unsuitable for certain subpopulations of patients with HCV.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para130">Therefore, there is a need for an affordable, pangenotypic, potent, and safe HCV treatment regimen to complement other regimens, which has low risk of drug–drug interactions and that is simple and suitable for use in decentralised public health settings. The STORM-C-1 study was designed in two stages to allow for interim analysis and presentation to relevant authorities. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a ribavirin-free ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir regimen in a diverse group of patients with HCV, with or without cirrhosis.</p>

                <p id="para140">The first stage of this phase 2/3, multicentre, international, open-label, single-arm study was done at six public academic and non-academic centres in Malaysia and four public academic and non-academic centres in Thailand (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>). Only patients without cirrhosis were recruited in Thailand.</p>
                <p id="para150">Patients aged 18–69 years, with a body-mass index (BMI) of 18–35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with chronic HCV infection of any genotype (viral load ≥10<sup>4</sup> IU/mL) with (Metavir score of F4 with Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) or without (Metavir score of F0–F3) compensated liver cirrhosis, and with or without HIV co-infection were eligible for inclusion, irrespective of whether they had received a previous interferon with or without ribavirin regimen. Women of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at screening and baseline; patients with virologically controlled HIV co-infection; and non-injecting drug users, including participants compliant in an opioid substitution maintenance programme, were also eligible for inclusion.</p>
                <p id="para160">Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (evidence of advanced stage liver cirrhosis and CTP score &gt;6 or any history of decompensation, including ascites, variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or hepatic encephalopathy), hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B virus co-infection (hepatitis B surface antigen positive), serum creatinine more than 1·5-times the upper limit of normal or end stage renal disease, and those who had received any previous NS5A inhibitor therapy, were not eligible for inclusion.</p>
                <p id="para170">The trial was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations.

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para180">Patients without cirrhosis received 200 mg oral ravidasvir and 400 mg sofosbuvir once daily with food for 12 weeks; individuals with cirrhosis received a 24 week regimen. Regimen dose, schedule, and duration were based on all available clinical data for ravidasvir and the treatment durations used for the pharmacologically similar sofosbuvir and daclatasvir combination.</p>
                <p id="para190">HCV RNA concentrations in serum or EDTA plasma were quantified using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative test (version 2.0; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; lower limit of quantification 15 IU/mL) or the Abbott m2000 system (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA; lower limit of quantification 12 IU/mL; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para200">Presence of cirrhosis was determined either by liver stiffness measurements of more than 12·5 kPa with an M probe or more than 10 kPa with an XL probe by transient elastography (FibroScan, EchoSens, Paris, France), liver biopsy, or an aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index score of two or more in the absence of a liver biopsy or valid liver stiffness measurements result.</p>
                <p id="para210">HCV genotype was determined by the Versant HCV Genotype Inno-LiPA Assay v2.0 (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) in Thailand and the Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II (Abbott Laboratories) assay in Malaysia. Genotype and subtype were confirmed using RNA sequencing of stored baseline samples, and in case of discrepancy, the sequencing derived result was used. Retrospective population sequencing (25% cutoff) of NS5A and NS5B regions was done by the Laboratory of Virology (Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland) or the Public Health Promotion Research and Training-Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences Laboratory (Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand) for all virological failures to identify pre-existing polymorphisms and characterise emerging HCV viral resistance-associated variants; any change from baseline in patients who did not have SVR12 was recorded.</p>
                <p id="para220">Patients could withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardising their standard medical care or possible participation in future research studies. A study site investigator could decide to end a patient's participation in the study if they believed participation would be detrimental to a patient's wellbeing.</p>
                <p id="para230">On-treatment visits were scheduled at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12 for participants without cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis had additional visits at weeks 16, 20, and 24. Post-treatment visits were scheduled at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after treatment completion for all participants. Routine blood and urine test samples were collected, ECG and radiological imaging of the liver (for hepatocellular carcinoma) were done, patients were assessed for safety, and the CTP score was determined for individuals with cirrhosis according to the schedule of visits and study assessments.</p>
                <p id="para240">To assess the possible effect of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir treatment on concomitant antiretrovirals concentrations (tenofovir, emtricitabine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), plasma samples were collected from patients with an HIV co-infection at the same time post-dose on day 1 (ie, before the first dose of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir), and at week 4 (ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir at steady state); and week 4 to day 1 concentration ratios for each antiretrovirals were calculated.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para250">The primary efficacy outcome was SVR12, evidenced by HCV RNA concentration less than the lower limit of quantification. The main secondary efficacy outcomes were SVR at 4 weeks (SVR4) and SVR at 24 weeks (SVR24), evidenced by HCV RNA concentration less than the lower limit of quantification; virological breakthrough, defined as either a confirmed one or higher log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment or confirmed HCV RNA more than or equal to the lower limit of quantification if HCV RNA previously decreased to less than the lower limit of quantification while on treatment; and virological relapse, defined as HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantification at the end of treatment but more than or equal to the lower limit of quantification during the post-treatment period. Reinfections (patients with different HCV genotype at baseline and relapse) were not considered virological failures. Non-virological failure was any failure that did not meet the virological failure criteria (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2–3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para260">Safety outcomes included occurrence of the following events until 24 weeks after the end of treatment: any adverse event, treatment-related adverse event, adverse event leading to premature treatment discontinuation, laboratory abnormality, grade 3 or 4 adverse event, serious adverse event, or death.</p>
                <p id="para270">Adverse events and severe adverse events were graded according to the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Paediatric Adverse Events (version 2.0). Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events that started between the date of first study drug dose and the end of study visit, or before the date of first study drug dose but worsened between the date of first study drug dose and the end of study visit. Safety endpoints were assessed by the principal investigator (IA-M and S-ST) and by representatives (VG, CM, FS, SS) of Drugs for Neglected Diseases <italic>initiative</italic> (DND<italic>i</italic>).

                <p id="para300">The interim analysis of the efficacy, safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir was planned when 300 patients had completed or prematurely discontinued the study. We calculated that this sample size would provide more than 86% power to detect 6% or higher improvement in the overall SVR12 rate from a prespecified performance goal of 85% (two-sided exact binomial test, α=0·05). This goal was based on published results for other treatments and in line with a WHO publication describing the ideal public health HCV treatment.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> On the basis of results of previous clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of ravidasvir, we estimated that the overall SVR12 rate would be at least 91% (ie, at least 6% more than the prespecified performance goal). Proceeding to stage two of the study would only occur if the efficacy and safety results from stage one were considered satisfactory by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, specifically if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the observed overall SVR12 rate was more than 85% in the intention to treat analysis and there were no safety issues (deaths or grade 3 or 4 treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events). Stage two will supplement these interim results with additional information on the performance of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir against the main HCV genotypes found in Malaysia and Thailand (genotype 1, 3, 6, and to a lesser extent 2). The final analysis is planned in 600 patients, combining data from both stages. This sample size would ensure that the width of the 95% CI for the expected overall SVR12 rate would be lower than 5%. A separate analysis of the stage two results is not planned.</p>
                <p id="para310">As planned in the protocol, the efficacy of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir was evaluated overall and in each of the following prespecified subgroups: patients with or without cirrhosis, each HCV genotype, patients who had previous or no previous interferon therapy, and those with or without HIV co-infection. The study was not powered for a subgroup analysis and these results are presented using descriptive statistics.</p>
                <p id="para320">Primary analysis of efficacy outcomes was done for all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had not reported current active injection drug use at screening (full analysis set). A secondary analysis (per-protocol set) included all patients in the full analysis set population who did not prematurely discontinue the study, who had a 90% or higher adherence to ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir (number of tablets used divided by number of tablets prescribed), did not have missing SVR12 results, and had no major protocol deviations, such as eligibility criteria not met, during the study. If a post-treatment HCV RNA value was missing within the analysis window and was followed by a valid value, the missing value was substituted with the subsequent valid value. The 95% CI for proportions were calculated using the exact Clopper-Pearson method. Analysis of safety outcomes was done in all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of a study drug.</p>
                <p id="para330">Statistical analyses were done using Stata (version 14.1). Two independent adjudication committees determined whether HCV viral load values were evaluable and adjudicated key data used for the analysis.

Of the 15 treatment-emergent serious adverse events that occurred post-treatment, four (27%) were classified as grade 1 or 2 and 11 (73%) as grade 3.</p>
              <p id="para450">All serious adverse events were judged as not related to ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir treatment by both investigator and sponsor, except for one patient with transient acute kidney injury, which was assessed as possibly related to sofosbuvir by the investigator. There were no treatment discontinuations due to serious adverse events related to study drugs. One serious adverse event assessed as not related to the study drug led to permanent treatment discontinuation. In three (1%) of 301 patients there were ten treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Five of these events were considered to be treatment-related (tiredness, palpitations, hot flush, breast engorgement, and fatigue), two were considered probably related (diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort), and three events considered not related (vomiting, investigations of cardiac disorders, and lethargy).</p>
              <p id="para460">Mean adherence to the study drugs in the full analysis set was 98% (SD 11), with treatment compliance rates similar between patients without cirrhosis (99% [10]) and with cirrhosis (97% [15]). There were no clinically relevant vital sign changes or physical findings. There were no grade 4 treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. Bilirubin concentrations were elevated in 30 (10%) of 301 patients (16 [7%] of 220 patients without cirrhosis and 14 [17%] of 81 patients with cirrhosis). Four hyperbilirubinaemia events were classed as grade 3, none of which were considered clinically significant. There was no signal of drug-induced liver toxicity. None of the patients had a change in ravidasvir or sofosbuvir dose during the study.</p>
              <p id="para470">In the subset of patients with HIV co-infection receiving efavirenz, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine, or nevirapine, concomitant treatment with ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir did not affect serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HIV viral suppression, or CD4 cell counts. Of 63 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based antiretrovirals, mean creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault equation remained stable from baseline (95·9 mL/min [SD 27·1]) to 12 weeks (94·1 mL/min [26·8]) in patients without cirrhosis and from baseline (93·6 mL/min [41·4]) to 24 weeks (99·8 mL/min [47·3]) in patients with cirrhosis. Measurement of antiretrovirals plasma concentrations revealed no clinically significant changes in antiretroviral concentrations at week 4 compared with the day before ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir treatment initiation and no antiretroviral dose adjustments were needed (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para480">Interim analysis of results for the 301 patients enrolled in stage one of the STORM-C-1 study show that 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir was efficacious in those with HCV genotype 1a, 1b, or 3 infection, either with and without cirrhosis. In the full analysis set, 97% patients had SVR12 and SVR24. Similar SVR12 and SVR24 rates were observed consistently across subgroups, except for a lower SVR12 rate (81%) in the small number of patients with genotype 6 infection. The low number of patients makes it difficult to draw conclusions for genotypes 2 and 6; as a result, more patients with these genotypes have been recruited in stage two of STORM-C-1 to evaluate ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir efficacy more accurately in these populations.</p>
              <p id="para490">The high SVR12 rate in patients with genotype 3 infection and cirrhosis is particularly relevant for resource-limited settings, in which retreatments for unsuccessful DAA regimens are unavailable or unaffordable. The SVR12 rate in this study is higher than that reported in the ALLY study<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> (20 [63%] of 32 patients), which assessed a 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> the French Temporary Authorisation for Use programme with sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 12-weeks (31 [67%] of 46 patients) or 24-weeks (185 [95%] of 195 patients),<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> the ASTRAL-3 study<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> of a 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir (73 [91%] of 80 patients), and an a study of a 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir (seven [50%] of 14 patients with GT3b HCV).<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> This ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir regimen might be appropriate for countries with high prevalence of genotype 3, seeking a ribavirin-free treatment algorithm that will have efficacy in most patients and can be effectively scaled up, without burdening over-stretched health-care systems or compromising response rates. The rapid suppression of HCV RNA after treatment initiation might be useful for prevention of forward transmission in certain clinical settings and populations engaged in high-risk behaviours, such as injection drug use, tattooing, men having sex with men, and sex workers. As in other trials, we observed high concordance between SVR12 and SVR24 (97%).<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para500">There were no deaths and a small number of treatment-emergent severe adverse events during and after treatment. Additionally, there was no safety signal and no need for dose adaptation during the study treatment. No patients were withdrawn from the study because of treatment-emergent severe adverse events related to study drugs.</p>
              <p id="para510">Drug–drug interactions between antiretrovirals and daclatasvir and velpatasvir necessitate either switching antiretrovirals or adjusting the dose of daclatasvir. In participants with HIV, no clinically significant drug–drug interactions between ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir and antiretrovirals commonly used in this region were found, and no antiretroviral dose adjustments were needed. None of the patients had a change in ravidasvir or sofosbuvir dose during the study. The treatment was well tolerated, overall compliance rates were consistently high throughout the study and in all groups (&gt;95% for both study drugs), and the safety profile appears similar to that observed for other NS5A inhibitor DAAs in terms of frequency, severity, seriousness, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Combining ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not affect serum creatinine concentration or creatinine clearance (calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation) during or after treatment. The safety profile, high rates of treatment compliance, and absence of clinically relevant pharmacological interactions with commonly used antiretrovirals indicate the potential for effective use of this combination in primary care settings with a small amount of monitoring required and without the need for complex adjustment of co-medications.</p>
              <p id="para520">Ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir is efficacious in the presence of baseline resistance-associated variants, and no new NS5A resistance-associated variants were seen in the small number of unsuccessful treatments.</p>
              <p id="para530">This study was designed to reflect real-world patient populations with high percentages of comorbidities and co-medications. Because few exclusion criteria prevented enrolment, the study population is representative of the general population of patients with HCV in Thailand and Malaysia. The recruited population showed a high rate of compliance, potentially indicating a recruitment bias leading to overestimation of efficacy. The study was done in highly skilled centres to ensure Good Clinical Practice compliance and optimal patient care, potentially introducing selection bias by recruiting more difficult to treat patients, leading to underestimation. Given the small number of patients in each subgroup, firm conclusions cannot be made about efficacy in patients with genotype 2 or genotype 6 infection. The results cannot be generalised to patients with HCV and decompensated cirrhosis or hepatitis B co-infection because decompensated cirrhosis or hepatitis B co-infection were excluded in this study protocol. Because no control group was used, the efficacy of sofosbuvir and ravidasvir cannot be formally compared with other DAAs.</p>
              <p id="para540">This easy to use, ribavirin-free regimen is well tolerated, has no clinically relevant drug–drug interactions, and does not require intensive pretreatment evaluation or on-treatment monitoring. The SVR12 rate is high in otherwise difficult to treat patients with genotype 3 infection and cirrhosis, the effect of baseline resistance-associated variants is small, and few patients would need retreatment. This ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir combination appears suitable for use in diverse populations, including individuals with HIV and multiple other comorbidities, and it could provide an additional affordable public health solution with some key advantages for countries that do not have, or have not overcome, sofosbuvir patent barriers. This regimen might be useful in decentralised public health settings in countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, in which a high proportion of the population are estimated to have a chronic HCV infection.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The use of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir could be scaled up, together with active identification and linkage to care of HCV infected persons, in test and treat approaches. An ongoing second stage with 300 additional patients will provide more information on the performance of ravidasvir plus sofosbuvir in the main genotypes found in Malaysia and Thailand.</p>
