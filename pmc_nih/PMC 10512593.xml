                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p id="P4">Cohort study analyzing fatty acid data from the Mega Donna Mega study, a randomized control trial with infants born &lt;28 weeks of gestation (n = 204) receiving standard nutrition or daily enteral lipid supplementation with arachidonic acid (AA):docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (100:50 mg/kg/day). Infants received an intravenous lipid emulsion containing olive oil:soybean oil (4:1). Infants were followed from birth to postmenstrual age 40 weeks. Levels of 31 different fatty acids from serum phospholipids were determined by GCeMS and reported in relative (mol%) and absolute concentration (μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) units.</p>

                <sec id="S3">
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p id="P5">Higher parenteral lipid administration resulted in lower serum proportion of AA and DHA relative to other fatty acids during the first 13 weeks of life (p &lt; 0.001 for the 25th vs the 75th percentile). The enteral AA:DHA supplement increased the target fatty acids with little impact on other fatty acids. The absolute concentration of total phospholipid fatty acids changed rapidly in the first weeks of life, peaking at day 3, median (Q1-Q3) 4452 (3645–5466) μmol l<sup>−1</sup>, and was positively correlated to the intake of parenteral lipids. Overall, infants displayed common fatty acid trajectories over the study period. However, remarkable differences in fatty acid patterns were observed depending on whether levels were expressed in relative or absolute units. For example, the relative levels of many LCPUFAs, including DHA and AA, declined rapidly after birth while their absolute concentrations increased in the first week of life. For DHA, absolute levels were significantly higher compared to cord blood from day 1 until postnatal week 16 (p &lt; 0.001). For AA, absolute postnatal levels were lower compared to cord blood from week 4 throughout the study period (p &lt; 0.05).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P7">Extremely preterm infants (born &lt;28 weeks’ gestation) often show low postnatal levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) associated with an increased risk for neonatal morbidities [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Preterm infants can synthesize the omega-6 LCPUFA arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n–6) and the omega-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n–3) from the precursors linoleic acid (LA 18:2 n–6) and α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n–3), respectively [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, although the capacity of endogenous synthesis is significant, estimates of accretion rates suggest that supplementation with AA and DHA is required to match the infant’s needs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P8">Fortification of intravenous lipid emulsions and enteral supplementation have been assessed as ways to improve LCPUFA status in preterm infants [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Supplementation has primarily focused on DHA, but DHA together with AA, has also been evaluated [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Fish oil-containing intravenous lipid emulsions, now widely used in neonatal intensive care units, have a high DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n–3) content but are relatively low in AA [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, these emulsions increase infant DHA and EPA but reduce their AA levels, resulting in an AA:DHA ratio that may be non-physiological [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Enteral supplementation with fish oil or human milk with high DHA concentration has a similar effect on circulating LCPUFA levels in the preterm infant, i.e. DHA levels increase while AA is reduced [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A limitation of many previous studies assessing LCPUFA status in preterm infants is that only a few longitudinal samples have been evaluated for fatty acid status. Therefore, changes in blood fatty acid composition related to nutrition and metabolism may go undetected.</p>
              <p id="P9">The Mega Donna Mega (MDM) trial recently investigated the effect of enteral supplementation with AA:DHA (2:1 ratio) on the outcome of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in extremely preterm infants. Daily supplementation from birth to term equivalent age significantly reduced the risk for severe ROP by 50% and increased the molar fractions of AA and DHA in serum phospholipids [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P10">In this secondary analysis of the MDM trial, we aimed to investigate infants’ serum complete fatty acid profiles over the first months of life, expressed in relative and absolute units, and how the profiles were modulated by the administration of parenteral lipids and enteral AA:DHA supplementation.</p>

                <p id="P12">The Regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Gothenburg approved the study (Dnr 303–11, T570–15). The study was performed following theethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. Informed signed consent for all participants was obtained from parents or legal guardians. Infants were recruited between December 2016 and August 2019 at three centers in Sweden: Queen Silvia Children’s Hospital in Göteborg, Skåne University Hospital in Lund, and Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The randomization strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria have been previously described [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The intervention supplement was Formulaid<sup>™</sup> (DSM Nutritional Products, Heerlen, Netherlands), a triglyceride oil made from extracts of the filamentous fungus <italic toggle="yes">Mortierella alpina,</italic> and the dinoflagellate <italic toggle="yes">Crypthecodinium cohnii,</italic> containing AA and DHA in a two-to-one ratio. Formulaid<sup>™</sup> was administrated enterally starting within 72 h after birth and lasted until 40 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). The dose was 0.39 mL kg<sup>−1</sup> daily, equal to 100 mg AA and 50 mg DHA per kg body weight and day. Infants assigned to control received standard care.</p>

The parenteral nutrition was initiated as early as possible after birth and was provided either via 3-in-1 (Numeta G13E, Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden) or by individually composed parenteral nutrition consisting of glucose (monohydrate 50 g 100 ml<sup>−1</sup>), amino acids (2 g 100 ml<sup>−1</sup> Vaminolac<sup>®</sup>, Fresenius Kabi, Uppsala, Sweden or 3.1 g 100 ml<sup>−1</sup> Primene, Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden), and lipids. The composite lipid emulsion Clinoleic 200 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> (Baxter Medical AB, Kista, Sweden), based on olive oil (80%) and soybean oil (20%), was used at all sites either as part of Numeta G13E or as part of individually composed parenteral nutrition. Parenteral and concomitant enteral lipid, protein and carbohydrate intakes were gradually increased during the following 3–4 postnatal days according to Swedish national guidelines targeting a lipid intake of 3–4 g/kg/d, protein of 3.5–4 g/kg/d, and carbohydrate of 11–16 g/kg/d. The parenteral nutrition was supplemented with fat-soluble vitamins (Vitalipid<sup>®</sup>, Fresenius Kabi), water-soluble vitamins (Soluvit<sup>®</sup>, Fresenius Kabi), and trace elements (Peditrace<sup>®</sup>, Fresenius Kabi). Enteral feeds were introduced, if possible, from the first day of life and consisted of mothers’ own milk, if available, and otherwise of pasteurized donor human milk. Enteral feeds were advanced according to the infant’s feeding tolerance to a target volume of 160–180 ml kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. Individualized targeted fortification, based on weekly macronutrient analyses of either mother’s own or donor milk, was done using human milk fortifiers (Nutriprem HMF, Nutricia; PreNAN HMF, Nestlé; or Enfamil HMF, Mead Johnson) and/or fat emulsions and/or carbohydrates. Donor milk was replaced by preterm formula beyond 34 weeks PMA.</p>

                <title>Blood sample collection and fatty acid analysis</title>
                <p id="P15">Blood was collected in serum separator tubes from cord blood (2 mL) and infant arterial or venous blood (0.6 mL) at postnatal age (PNA) 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days and at postmenstrual age (PMA) 30, 32, 34, 36, and 40 weeks. Blood samples were allowed to clot for a minimum of 0.5 h and a maximum of 2 h before centrifugation (1500 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 10 min), followed by serum collection. Samples were stored at −20 °C for up to one week before long-term storage at −80 °C.</p>
                <p id="P16">For analysis, serum (25 mL) was spiked with an internal standard (1,2-dinonadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and the sample was lyophilized. Total lipids were extracted [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and a phospholipid fraction was obtained by fractionation on a SEP-PAK aminopropyl cartridge (Waters Corp.). Phospholipid-bound fatty acids were converted into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by acid-catalyzed transmethylation and analyzed by GC–MS as previously described [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Samples were assayed in 94 separate batches between September 2017 and December 2019. All samples from an individual were assayed in the same batch. An internal control sample consisting of pooled adult serum was included in each batch to follow variability in the method. Thirty-one fatty acids were quantified in all samples. For quantification, the ratios between the peak area of the internal standard (19:0 methyl ester) and the peak areas of each target fatty acid were compared to linear calibration curves made from authentic standards. Fatty acid concentrations were calculated in relative (mol%) and absolute serum concentration (μmol l<sup>−1</sup>) units.</p>
                <p id="P17">We observed differences between extraction batches in the absolute quantification related to the analyst and the methylation reagent lot. The internal control sample was therefore used to normalize between extraction batches. Adjustments were made for each fatty acid separately, using a ratio between the concentration of the internal control in each batch and the mean concentration of the internal control sample for all batches. The inter-assay CV for the relative quantification of DHA, AA, and LA were 11.9%, 6.9%, and 6.8%, respectively. The inter-assay CV for the absolute quantification of DHA, AA, and LA were 10.2%, 9.2%, and 10.1%, respectively.</p>

                <p id="P18">We previously [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported the relative serum levels of AA and DHA in infants based on a timescale that combined infants’ PNA with PMA. In this secondary analysis, data were analyzed based only on the infants’ PNA (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). The rationale for using only the PNA-based time scale was to achieve a comparable exposure time of the enteral supplementation independently of GA at birth.</p>
                <p id="P19">Infants were classified into three categories based on the administration of parenteral lipids during the first four weeks of life. Per each infant and day, the amount of administered parenteral lipids was standardized into a parenteral lipid standard deviation score (PNSDS) using the studied population’s daily means and standard deviations. Daily PNSDS were then flagged with higher intake if they were greater than 0, and the percentage of follow-up time on this higher intake was calculated (% time with PNSDS&gt;0). Finally, % time with PNSDS&gt;0 was categorized into three categories for analyses: ≤25th percentile, 25th-75th percentile, and ≥75th percentile. The amounts of administered parenteral lipids and their relationship to serum phospholipids were then described for the three categories.</p>
                <p id="P20">Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Rstudio Version 1.2.5033, R Version 4.0.4 [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and the ggplot2 package was used for plotting results. For heatmaps, data was standardized with a standard deviation of 1 centered at 0, means were calculated for each time point, and plots were generated using the R package pheatmap. Identification of fatty acid profiles by clustering was performed as previously described [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. UMAP transformation was done with the R package Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection in R using default settings.</p>
                <p id="P21">For differences in patient characteristic distribution between the two randomized groups, Fisher’s exact test was used for dichotomous variables and Mann–Whitney U-test for continuous variables. Test for trend between three categories of parenteral lipids was performed using Mantel–Haenszel Chi-Square test for dichotomous variables, Chi-Square test for non-ordered categorical variables, and Jonckheere–Terpstra test for continuous variables. Unadjusted pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare fatty acid levels in cord blood with later postnatal time points.</p>
                <p id="P22">Longitudinal fatty acids were analyzed using mixed models for repeated measures data with normal distribution, adjusting for within-infant correlation, and modeling age in days with the spline function. Fixed knots at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 fractions of time resulted in lower Akaike’s Information Criterion. The models included treatment arm, age (spline function), and interaction between intervention and age, and were adjusted for center, gestational age at birth, birth weight including interaction with age, and sex. Diagnostic plots of residuals were reviewed and found satisfactory. The difference between the estimated mean values of fatty acids for the two treatment arms was computed, adjusting the confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values for multiple testing using the Scheffe-Holm method. Similar models adjusted for GA at birth, birth weight, and both variables, including interaction with PNA and sex, were also performed for the three categories of PNSDS (≤25th, 25th-75th, ≥75th percentile). Statistical analyses were limited to the first 13 weeks to have a similar distribution of gestational ages at birth across the analysis period. All tests were two-sided and evaluated at a 0.05 significance level.</p>

                <p id="P25">To further investigate the relationship between serum fatty acids and parenteral lipids, infants were grouped into three categories based on percentiles of their standardized daily parenteral lipid intake in the first four weeks of life (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

In both treated and control groups, oleic (18:1 n–9) and linoleic acid were the fatty acids that showed the greatest change over time, both in relative and absolute units. The change in oleic acid was transient over the first week, whereas linoleic acid levels increased rapidly after birth and then were maintained at high levels throughout the study period. As no placebo was given to the control group, the additional fat provided to the intervention group through the supplement could have affected the total lipid intake. However, there was no difference between groups in lipid intake, nor in parenteral fluid or human milk intake over the first four weeks of life (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Effect of parenteral lipids on infant serum phospholipids and LCPUFAs</title>
                <p id="P36">The strikingly different patterns observed for relative (mol%) and absolute (μmol l<sup>−l</sup>) fatty acid concentrations were related to a significant increase in total serum phospholipids starting soon after birth. The magnitude of this phospholipid expansion appears to be strongly related to parenteral lipid administration: at one week postnatal age, infants who received the most parenteral lipids (the ≥75th percentile category) showed around 40% higher total serum phospholipid fatty acids compared to infants who received the lowest amount of parenteral lipids (the ≤25th percentile category). Nevertheless, infants who primarily received enteral nutrition also showed an increase in total serum phospholipid fatty acids in the first week of life. Thus, the increase in total serum phospholipids appears to represent a physiological response to extrauterine life and the transition from glucose to fat as the main energy source. Previous studies have shown a similar increase in the concentration of serum/plasma phospholipids after birth in preterm infants [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="P37">Intravenous lipid emulsions and fat-soluble vitamin supplements are emulsified with egg yolk phospholipids that contain some DHA and AA [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found that administration of parenteral lipids resulted in higher absolute infant DHA and AA at day 7, but lower relative levels of these LCPUFAs. As we sampled blood during continuous lipid infusion, it is clear that the phospholipid composition of the intravenous lipid emulsion impacted infant serum lipid composition. The main fatty acid of the intravenous lipid emulsion used in this trial is oleic acid (approximately 55% [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Accordingly, oleic acid was among the serum fatty acid that showed the largest postnatal concentration change, with a rapid but transient increase during the first two weeks of life.</p>
                <p id="P38">As seen over the whole study period, infants on high parenteral lipids displayed lower relative levels of both DHA and AA. Robinson et al. showed that red blood cell (RBC) DHA, but not AA, decreased more in extremely low birth weight infants with prolonged exposure (&gt;28 days) to a lipid emulsion based on soybean oil than in infants with shorter exposure (≤28 days) [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, numerically, also RBC AA levels were lower in the group with longer exposure to the lipid emulsion. The addition of both DHA and AA to the intravenous lipid emulsion may help to ameliorate infant LCPUFA deficiency.</p>

We found that the absolute phospholipid DHA concentration increased after birth and was higher at all postnatal time points (up to 16 weeks) compared to that in cord blood, indicating that DHA available for accretion is maintained in the postnatal period. However, although the absolute concentration of AA initially increased, at week 4 and beyond the serum AA concentration was lower compared to that in cord blood. The accumulation of AA in the forebrain is markedly higher than that of DHA during the third trimester <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We speculate that the decline seen in serum AA reflects the high demand of the developing brain and other tissues. Our data suggest that further efforts are needed to increase preterm infant AA and the availability of this important LCPUFA for accretion.</p>
                <p id="P40">As we reported previously [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the AA:DHA supplement increased the relative proportions of infant serum AA and DHA. Here, we further show that the supplementation resulted in a significant increase in absolute AA levels and a trend towards increased absolute DHA levels. Concerns have been raised that fish oil supplementation increases infant blood EPA to unphysiological levels, and skews the n–3:n–6 LCPUFA ratio [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study the intervention had minimal effects on fatty acids other than AA and DHA, demonstrating that the lipid supplementation strategy could precisely modulate the target fatty acids.</p>
                <p id="P41">Collins et al. investigated dose–response of emulsified DHA via tube feeding on circulating RBC levels in infants born less than 30 weeks’ GA [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Administration of 120 mg/kg/day DHA during the first four weeks of life increased the molar fraction of DHA in RBC phospholipids by nearly 50%. In the N3RO trial (N-3 fatty acids for improvement in Respiratory Outcomes) of infants born before 29 weeks GA, emulsified DHA at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg significantly increased the whole blood level of DHA (3.9 weight% vs 2.5 weight% in the control group at mean 36.1 weeks GA). In comparison, we report a modest increase in infant serum phospholipid AA and DHA, although the fatty acids were given at a relatively high dose, 100 and 50 mg/kg daily, respectively. The recent ImNuT (Immature, Nutrition Therapy) trial, also enterally supplementing preterm infants with AA:DHA at 100:50 mg/kg/day, reported a small increase in the molar percent of whole blood DHA between day 2 and PMA 36 weeks but no significant effect on AA levels [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In both this and the ImNuT trial, the supplement was provided as pure oil, and emulsification of the fat would likely have enhanced the LCPUFA bioavailability, as demonstrated in both experimental and clinical studies [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Increased supplement dosing and/or improved lipid delivery may be needed to avoid infant LCPUFA shortfall.</p>

                <title>Fatty acid clustering</title>
                <p id="P42">We grouped fatty acids according to postnatal level profiles and found several distinct clusters. Some fatty acids clustered according to class; for example, the proportion of the n–3 fatty acids, except DHA, were found in one cluster. The proportion of DHA, on the other hand, shared profile with the long-chain saturates stearic (18:0), behenic (22:0), and lignoceric acid (24:0). The n–6 LCPUFAs AA, adrenic (22:4 n–6), and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5 n–6) clustered together in data based on both relative and absolute concentration, albeit with very different profiles. This analysis highlights the complexity of lipid metabolism during early postnatal life and calls for further studies to determine the origin and fate of circulatory fatty acids.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="P43">There are limitations to our study. First, infants in the control group did not receive a placebo treatment. However, there was no difference in total lipid intake between the active and the control group. Second, when investigating the impact of parenteral lipids on infant LCPUFA levels we did not account for other potential confounders such as blood transfusions, LCPUFAs in human milk, LCPUFAs in the human milk fortifiers, and lipids present in other fortifiers, which may impact infant plasma levels [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Third, we used a postnatal timescale when assessing fatty acid levels, although sample collection was based on both postnatal age and postmenstrual age. As a result, infants born at the lowest GAs were overrepresented in numbers at later time points. However, for statistical analyses, we limited the time so that there was a similar distribution of the three GA strata. The strengths of this study lie in the high temporal resolution, the relatively large number of infants recruited at several centers, carefully weighted GA groups, prospectively daily collected nutritional data, and the combined reporting of fatty acids levels in relative and absolute units.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="P44">Following preterm birth, infant LCPUFA levels fall below those of the fetus <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic>. The long-term consequences of this LCPUFA deprivation during a sensitive time of development are not yet fully understood. No current nutritional management program restores preterm infant fatty acid profiles to match the intrauterine situation, and whether this is achievable or even desirable, has not been established. This and other studies have provided in-depth knowledge on circulating fatty acids in the preterm infant in the first months of life. However, there is limited consensus on the ideal fatty acid supplementation and profile to aim for when feeding the preterm infant to promote optimal growth and long-term health, warranting further studies.</p>
