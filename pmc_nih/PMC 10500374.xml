                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial of 7945 adults, participants exposed to green (“choose often”), single traffic light, physical activity calorie equivalent, or nutrient warning labels selected 28 to 39 fewer calories from beverages and 13 to 18 fewer calories from snacks than participants exposed to calorie labels, which were statistically significant reductions that were similar across the 4 interpretative labels. Effects did not differ by participants’ education level.</p>

Similarly, compared with the control label, exposure to the green (ADE, −12.7; 95% CI, −17.3 to −8.2), traffic light (ADE, −13.7; 95% CI, −18.2 to −9.1), physical activity (ADE, −18.5; 95% CI, −23.1 to −13.9), or nutrient warning labels (ADE, −14.2; 95% CI, −18.8 to −9.6) led participants to select fewer calories from snacks (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). These effects did not differ by education level. The green labels were rated as less stigmatizing than the other interpretative systems but otherwise generally received the least favorable label reactions and perceptions (eg, elicited less attention, were perceived as less trustworthy), while the nutrient warnings and physical activity labels received the most favorable ratings.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Poor dietary quality remains a leading cause of death in the US.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although most US adults have suboptimal diets, dietary quality is even lower—and has improved more slowly—among people with lower education levels.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> One potential driver of poor dietary quality is that people have limited access to easy-to-understand nutrition information when deciding which foods to buy. Currently, the primary source of nutrition information in the US is the Nutrition Facts label.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Although this label provides important information about nutritional content and ingredients, it typically appears on the back or side of product packaging and includes only numeric information (eg, calorie content). Perhaps for these reasons, many people—particularly people with lower education levels—have difficulty using and understanding this label.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To provide easier-to-access nutrition information and address poor dietary quality, the Biden-Harris Administration and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have indicated plans to develop a front-of-package food labeling system that would quickly communicate products’ nutritional quality.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> There is broad agreement that such food labeling systems should be <italic>interpretative</italic>—that is, they should provide guidance, judgment, or recommendations rather than only numeric information.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Although evidence indicates that interpretative food labeling systems encourage people to make healthier food purchases,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> it is unclear which systems are most effective at changing behavior, including for people with lower education levels. This gap is important given that more than half of US adults have not completed a college degree.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Several types of front-of-package food labeling systems have been proposed or studied. The FDA, for example, is developing an “endorsement” label that promotes foods meeting the FDA’s definition of healthy.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Research has also suggested the promise of single traffic light labels that categorize foods and beverages as unhealthy (red labels), moderately healthy (yellow labels), or healthy (green labels)<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and physical activity calorie equivalent labels that translate foods’ calorie content into minutes of physical activity needed to burn those calories.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Several Latin American countries require that products display nutrient warning labels on foods and beverages that are high in nutrients of concern, like sugar and sodium,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> while voluntary labeling systems, like Australia’s Health Star Rating and France’s Nutri-Score, rate products’ overall healthfulness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Because studies have not tested some of these labeling systems against one another, their relative effects on behavior are unknown, making it challenging for policymakers to know which labels to pursue. Moreover, it is unclear whether interpretative food labeling systems have different effects depending on people’s education level, as most randomized trials of food labeling systems have had limited power to detect moderation by education.</p>
              <p>To address these gaps and inform food labeling policies, this randomized clinical trial sought to examine the effect of different food labeling systems on beverage and snack selections and to assess whether label effects differ by education level in a well-powered sample. We also evaluated how people responded to and perceived the labeling systems.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The survey research firm CloudResearch recruited a sample of US adults approximately matched to the US population on gender, age, ethnicity, and US Census Bureau region. Recruitment occurred from November 16 to December 3, 2022, with a pause during Thanksgiving weekend. Eligible participants lived in the US and were 18 years or older. To maximize statistical power to detect moderation by education level, approximately half of the sample had lower (some college or less) and higher (associate degree or higher) education levels.</p>
                <p>The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved the study, and participants provided electronic informed consent.

                <title>Approach</title>
                <p>Participants completed an online survey programmed in Qualtrics. Qualtrics randomized participants to 1 of 5 trial arms using a simple allocation ratio: (1) control (calorie labels only on all products); (2) green labels (green “choose often” labels added to healthy products with no additional labels on products not meeting healthfulness criteria); (3) single traffic light labels (hereafter, traffic light labels; green “choose often,” yellow “choose sometimes,” and red “choose rarely” labels added to healthy, moderately healthy, and unhealthy products, respectively); (4) physical activity labels (labels showing calorie content expressed as minutes of physical activity required to burn those calories added to all products); or (5) nutrient warning labels (“high in” warning labels added to products exceeding thresholds for sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or calories) (<xref rid="zoi230969f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Calorie labels were displayed in all arms because most beverages and packaged snacks in the US display these labels.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Interpretative labels were added to the calorie labels in the interpretative labeling arms. We examined these 4 interpretative labeling systems to allow for comparison with the author team’s recent field experiment using the same systems<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and because they represent a range of types of interpretative labeling systems (one that only encourages healthy foods, one that only discourages unhealthy foods, etc).

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>After participants reviewed consent instructions and provided electronic informed consent via the survey they were instructed to complete 2 online vending machine selection tasks: one for beverages and one for snacks, in random order. We focused on vending machine selections to allow comparison with the author team’s field experiment,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which also focused on vending machine selections (analyses ongoing at time of publication). Before viewing the products, participants in the interpretative labeling systems viewed a digital poster explaining their randomly assigned labeling system, modeled on posters used in the field experiment (eFigure in <xref rid="note-ZOI230969-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Next, all participants were asked to imagine that they were viewing a vending machine and to select 1 item that they would most like to purchase from 16 products shown in random arrangement, similar to prior studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230969-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref> summarizes product details. Products were shown with participants’ assigned label(s) on the front of the package.

                <p>To minimize social desirability bias and incentivize participants to select items that they wanted to receive, participants were told that 100 participants would be randomly chosen to have their selections delivered. In reality, these participants received a $2.50 gift card (more than the amount of the most expensive product); participants were debriefed on this procedure and could request that their data be removed. Participants were prompted (but not required) to select a product in each selection task. After completing the tasks, participants responded to survey questions.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI230969-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref> provide details on power calculations. Briefly, the target total sample size of 8000 participants (1600 per labeling arm) would yield 80% power to detect an effect of each interpretative labeling system vs control on beverage calories selected of Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 0.167 (approximately 11 kcal) or larger and 80% power to detect an interaction between the front-of-package labeling arm and education of Cohen <italic>d</italic> = 0.28 (approximately 18.5 kcal) or larger.</p>
                <p>We preregistered all analyses except where noted (<ext-link xlink:href="https://aspredicted.org/8e34a.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://aspredicted.org/8e34a.pdf</ext-link>). All analyses were intent to treat. We examined the effect of each interpretative labeling arm on calories selected using regression. For beverage calories, we used 2-part models to address zero inflation, with logistic and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for the first and secondary parts, respectively. For snack calories, we used OLS regression. All models regressed calories selected on indicator variables for each trial arm (excluding the control as the referent). No covariates were included. We used the models to estimate average differential effects (ADEs) of each interpretive labeling system compared with control. The ADEs for 2-part models were calculated overall (ie, combining the 2 parts of the model) using the chain rule; standard errors were calculated using the delta method. We used the Holm-Bonferroni method to correct <italic>P</italic> values for multiple comparisons, considering 4 tests per outcome (each interpretative labeling system vs control). We additionally tested whether the 4 interpretative labeling systems differed from one another in their effects on calories using χ<sup>2</sup> tests (beverage calories) or Wald tests (snack calories). We corrected these <italic>P </italic>values using the Holm-Bonferroni method (6 tests to compare the 4 interpretive labeling systems to one another). Throughout, we report corrected <italic>P</italic> values.</p>
                <p>We examined whether the effects of the interpretive labeling systems on calories selected were moderated by education by adding education level (some college or less vs any college degree) and its interaction with trial arms to the primary models. We examined the joint statistical significance of the interaction terms.</p>
                <p>We followed a similar approach to examine secondary outcomes using 2-part models for zero-inflated continuous outcomes (ie, sugar), OLS for nonzero-inflated continuous outcomes (eg, sodium, attention to labels), logistic regression for binary outcomes (eg, noticing the label), and multinomial logistic regressions for categorical outcomes (eg, likelihood of selecting a healthy, moderately healthy, or unhealthy beverage; we opted against ordered logit due to lack of proportionality<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>). Comparisons of the interpretative labeling systems to one another for secondary outcomes were not preregistered.</p>
                <p>We also conducted non-preregistered moderation analyses examining whether the effects of the interpretative labels on stigma were moderated by body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared; ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs &lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) using the same approach as for the education moderation analyses. Analyses were conducted in Stata/MP, version 17.1 (StataCorp), and used 2-tailed tests. A corrected <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were replicated by a second analyst.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this large randomized clinical trial, exposure to green “choose often,” single traffic light, physical activity, or nutrient warning front-of-package labeling systems led participants to select beverages and snacks with fewer calories compared with exposure to calorie labels alone. These 4 interpretative labeling systems also reduced selection of sugar from beverages and sugar and saturated fat from snacks. These results reinforce prior studies indicating that interpretative food labels are more effective at promoting healthier food selection than numeric labels.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The 4 interpretative labeling systems led to similar effects on beverage and snack calories selected regardless of participants’ education level. To our knowledge, this is among the largest randomized trials to examine whether the effects of interpretative food labels differ by education level.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> The present results suggest that interpretative food labels would be unlikely to exacerbate education-based disparities in dietary quality, an encouraging finding given that Chile’s nutrient warnings may have yielded larger benefits among more highly educated households.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In general, the 4 interpretative labeling systems performed similarly to one another in their effects on calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium selected from beverages and snacks. By contrast, the 4 interpretative labeling systems differed in how they affected psychological outcomes. For example, the nutrient warning labels elicited the most attention, thinking about health effects, and negative emotions, followed by the physical activity and traffic light labels. The green labels elicited the least attention, thinking about health effects, and emotions. Because these reactions are associated with behavior change,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> the present results suggest that traffic light labels, physical activity labels, and nutrient warning labels might be more promising than green labels for spurring long-term behavior change. These results align with research finding that endorsement labels like the green “choose often” label used in this study are generally less effective than labels that explicitly discourage unhealthy foods.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This study is among the first to examine the effects of interpretative food labeling systems on stigma,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> an important contribution given that stigma toward people with obesity is pervasive and harmful to mental and physical health.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> In the present study, none of the labeling systems elicited high absolute levels of stigma (mean ratings were all &lt;2.5 on the 1-5 scales), though we did find that some of the interpretative labeling systems elicited slightly more stigma than the calorie labels. Importantly, none of the interpretative labels led to higher feelings of disgust toward people with obesity,<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggesting that interpretative labeling systems can be designed to encourage healthier purchases with minimal or no increases in stigma.</p>
              <p>Together, these results suggest that policymakers have a variety of promising policy options when selecting an interpretative front-of-package labeling system to encourage healthier purchases. Policymakers’ choice of system might depend on how they weigh different criteria (eg, whether high trustworthiness or low stigma is more important). Policymakers might also consider how each system could further other goals, such as whether certain systems are more likely to elicit beneficial product reformulation<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> or improve consumer understanding of product healthfulness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Finally, policymakers might consider how different labeling systems could undergird other regulations, such as taxes, marketing restrictions, or school nutrition standards.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study had limitations. First, we measured hypothetical selections, although we incentivized realistic behavior. Second, participants had only brief exposure to labels in the context of an online vending machine experiment. Future research should explore the effects of repeated, in-person exposure to labels and examine effects in more contexts (eg, when selecting groceries). Third, we did not study some of the labeling systems in use internationally, such as the Nutri-Score, Heath Star Rating, or multiple traffic light labeling systems, and we did not examine other important aspects of label design, such as whether labels include government attritubtion.<sup><xref rid="zoi230969r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230969r64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> Fourth, of the labels we tested, only nutrient warnings have been broadly implemented. Fifth, some of the labeling systems we tested used different underlying nutrition criteria, so we cannot separate the effects of label design vs the criteria for applying the labels. However, this study design reflects real-world differences in how labels would be implemented. Strengths of this study included the randomized design, realistic stimuli, and large sample that enabled us to compare different label designs with one another and examine whether education level moderated label effects on product selections.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial of front-of-package food labeling systems, all 4 interpretative labeling systems reduced calories selected from beverages and from snacks compared with calorie labels, including among people with different education levels. Single traffic light, physical activity, and nutrient warnings showed more promise for spurring long-term behavior change than green labels.</p>
