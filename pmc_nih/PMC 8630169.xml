                <p id="Par1">To improve the power of mediation in high-throughput studies, here we introduce High-throughput mediation analysis (Hitman), which accounts for direction of mediation and applies empirical Bayesian linear modeling. We apply Hitman in a retrospective, exploratory analysis of the SLIMM-T2D clinical trial in which participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical diabetes/weight management, and fasting plasma proteome and metabolome were assayed up to 3 years. RYGB caused greater improvement in HbA1c, which was mediated by growth hormone receptor (GHR). GHR’s mediation is more significant than clinical mediators, including BMI. GHR decreases at 3 months postoperatively alongside increased insulin-like growth factor binding proteins IGFBP1/BP2; plasma GH increased at 1 year. Experimental validation indicates (1) hepatic GHR expression decreases in post-bariatric rats; (2) GHR knockdown in primary hepatocytes decreases gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production. Thus, RYGB may induce resistance to diabetogenic effects of GH signaling.</p>

              <p id="Par4">Given the major public health and personal burden of T2D, the identification of new approaches to therapy for both T2D and obesity is critical. Increasing evidence supports that surgical approaches to T2D are effective for both long-term weight loss and improved glucose metabolism, resulting in remission of T2D in ≈90% of patients at 1 year and 45% at 5 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and that these effects are superior to traditional nonsurgical diabetes management. Surgery’s beneficial effects have been attributed to weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity, but improved glycemic control occurs within days after RYGB, before substantial weight loss, supporting an important role for weight-independent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Additional metabolic effects of surgery which may contribute to improved glycemic outcomes include increased postprandial insulin and incretin hormone secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, reduction in circulating amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, alterations in bile acids, FXR signaling and FGF19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and changes in microbiome metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but preclinical studies indicate these cannot fully explain clinical improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, the primary molecular factors mediating improved metabolism and remission of T2D in response to surgical procedures remain uncertain.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To identify mediators of metabolic improvement after surgical vs. medical therapy for T2D, we perform a retrospective exploratory analysis of the SLIMM-T2D trial, in which participants with type 2 diabetes were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical diabetes weight management (DWM), and fasting plasma proteome and metabolome were assayed up to 3 years. Greater clinical improvement was seen in RYGB than in DWM for multiple outcomes, including reductions in body weight (assessed by BMI), glycemia (assessed by HbA1c), triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and reductions in the number of antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, all RYGB participants achieved 10% weight loss before 3 months, whereas only 37% of DWM participants achieved 10% weight loss before 3 months. Given that participants in SLIMM-T2D were randomized to either RYGB or DWM, we can infer causal effects of RYGB (relative to the DWM control) on the outcomes at, for example, one year, and then ask if any clinical outcome or analyte measured at 3 months mediates this causal effect. Identifying mediators among approximately 2000 measured analytes would be a key step to develop new nonsurgical approaches to weight loss and glycemic control in T2D. Many mediation methods are available, but they have been found to lack power in high-throughput studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A previous comprehensive comparison of mediation methods concluded that the best balance between false positive rate and power was offered by the joint significance method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The joint significance method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> in our example assesses if two tests are jointly significant for each analyte: (I) is RYGB associated with analyte abundance at 3 months? and (II) is analyte abundance at 3 months associated with HbA1c at one year given RYGB? The joint significance method was also recommended by another comparative study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, where a bootstrap-based method that assesses the product of effects I and II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> performed only slightly worse than the joint significance test. However, the bootstrap-based method could not be used in their genome-wide application, since it was too computationally expensive to perform sufficient numbers of bootstraps to reach genome-wide significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The joint significance method was also shown to control its false-positive rate in theory and to be more powerful than the commonly-used product significance method for mediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another popular mediation test not included in these comparative simulations is based on the potential outcomes framework<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This framework supports very general causal models, but also assesses significance with the bootstrap or other resampling methods, and so is also computationally burdensome for high-throughput data.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here we report the development of a mediation method termed High-throughput mediation analysis (Hitman) and apply this method to proteomic and metabolomic data from the SLIMM-T2D randomized trial.

After 3 years, no DWM participants achieved study-defined glycemic goals (HbA1c &lt; 6.5% and fasting glucose &lt; 126 mg/dL), whereas eight RYGB participants did, and seven of these eight participants were not receiving any anti-diabetes medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

                <title>Longitudinal analysis of the plasma proteome</title>
                <p id="Par8">Fasting proteomics were profiled at baseline, the 3 month time point, and years 1, 2, and 3 in RYGB and DWM. At baseline (pre-randomization), there were no statistically significant proteins (FDR &lt; 0.15). For post-randomization time points, reduction in BMI was greater in RYGB, so groups were compared both with and without adjustment for each person’s BMI change. Differences in the baseline-corrected proteome in RYGB vs. DWM (i.e., differences between groups in changes from baseline) emerged at the 3 month time point, with 14 significant proteins in the unadjusted analysis and 8 in the BMI-adjusted analysis. Differences of baseline-corrected protein abundance in RYGB vs. DWM persisted at years 1, 2, and 3. The baseline-corrected log<sub>2</sub> fold change values for the 19 proteins differentially abundant with fold-change absolute value &gt;1.5 at any time point without BMI adjustment are depicted in the heatmap in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>.

The range of colors show log<sub>2</sub>(RYGB/DWM) from −1.6 to 1.6, which corresponds to fold changes from −3 to 3. Analytes with a larger absolute value of fold-change are shown as only having fold change absolute value of 3, so that weaker fold changes are easily observed.

                <p id="Par9">We observed several proteins with important roles in systemic metabolism to be significant in unadjusted analyses at several time points, but never significant with BMI adjustment. We considered such analytes as potentially regulated by weight-dependent mechanisms. For example, proteins upregulated post-baseline included sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), upregulated at all post-baseline time points, and adiponectin, upregulated at 12, 24, and 36 months. Conversely, GHR was downregulated at all post-baseline time points; leptin was downregulated at 12 and 24 months, while C-reactive protein and insulin were downregulated at 12 and 36 months. Multiple complement factor proteins were downregulated at 12, 24, and 36 months, including complement factor H (CFH), C1s, and C5.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Several proteins remained significant after BMI adjustment, indicating potential weight-independence. These include increases in (1) bone structural proteins integrin-binding sialoprotein (IBSP), which was increased at all post-baseline time points in the unadjusted analysis and at 3 and 12 months in the BMI-adjusted analysis, and osteomodulin (OMD), which was increased with and without BMI adjustment at 12, 24, and 36 months, (2) fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), the intestinally-derived target of bile acid and FXR signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which was increased with and without BMI adjustment at 36 months, and (3) insulin-like growth factor binding protein IGFBP2, recently shown to be increased after RYGB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, potentially via improved leptin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, was increased at all post-baseline time points in the unadjusted analysis and at the 3 month time point in the BMI-adjusted analysis. Of the complement factors, only complement factor B (CFB) remained significant after BMI adjustment, at 12, 24, and 36 months.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Upregulation of IGFBP2 (&gt;50%, FDR &lt; 5% at all post-baseline time points in SOMAscan, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>) was confirmed by ELISA, which showed significant differences in baseline-corrected values (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at 12, 24, and 36 months (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>), and ELISA changes per person over time were significantly correlated to corresponding SOMAscan changes (<italic>r</italic> = 0.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−7</sup>).</p>

                <title>Longitudinal analysis of the plasma metabolome</title>
                <p id="Par12">At baseline (pre-randomization), there were no significant differences in the fasting metabolome between groups. Significant differences in the baseline-corrected metabolome emerged at the 3 month time point, with 96 metabolites differentially abundant in the unadjusted analysis and 74 in the BMI-adjusted analysis; 45 metabolites were common to both analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Differences between arms of baseline-corrected metabolite abundance persisted at years 1, 2, and 3. The baseline-corrected log<sub>2</sub> fold change values in RYGB vs. DWM for the 85 metabolites differentially abundant with fold-change absolute value &gt;1.5 at any time point without BMI adjustment are depicted in the heatmap in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. Although the color scale is the same as that in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> to permit comparison, fold changes were much greater for the metabolome. For example, the BCAA-related metabolite 3−hydroxyisobutyrate was 88% lower in RYGB (i.e., down by &gt;9-fold) with significance in both the unadjusted and BMI-adjusted analysis at the 3 month time point.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Prolylhydroxyproline, a marker of bone collagen degradation, was increased in RYGB at the 3, 12, and 36 month time points, and was also increased with BMI adjustment at the 3 and 12 month time points, again suggesting that postoperative bone metabolic changes are independent of weight loss. The abundance of metformin was reduced with or without BMI adjustment at 12 months, in agreement with reduced medication use in the RYGB group. Interestingly, increases in the conjugated bile acid glycochenodeoxycholate sulfate emerged with time, with significance at the 12 month time point in unadjusted analysis and both the 12 and 36 month time point in the BMI-adjusted analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Having both metabolites and proteins on the same subjects is an advantage of our study, so we tested the correlation of top metabolites’ vs. top proteins’ baseline-corrected changes at 3 months (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Multiple analytes were highly correlated. For example, the metabolite most correlated to GHR was prolylhydroxyproline (<italic>r</italic> = −0.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, FDR &lt; 0.002); prolylhydroxyproline was also negatively correlated with CNDP1 (beta-ala-his dipeptidase or carnosine dipeptidase 1; <italic>r</italic> = −0.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>, FDR &lt; 0.004) and positively correlated with IGFBP2 (<italic>r</italic> = 0.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>, FDR &lt; 0.002). GHR and CNDP1 were positively correlated to the BCAA-related metabolites beta-hydroxyisovalerate and isovalerylcarnitine, and these were negatively correlated with IGFBP2 (FDR &lt; 0.08 for all these correlations).</p>

                <p id="Par22">We sought to identify analytes whose change in abundance at the postoperative 3 month time point mediated RYGB’s improvement in diabetes control at one year. We know that RYGB improves diabetes outcomes from prior studies, so we can be confident that RYGB actually improves diabetes, as we observe, rather than the opposite direction of effect (in which case RYGB would exacerbate diabetes). A reasonable mediation method to use would be the joint significance method. However, one drawback of the joint significance test and other mediation methods when the direction of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome is known is that they do not account for the direction of effect of the mediator, so they could call as significant an “inconsistent” mediator, which suppresses or inhibits the causal effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. For example, relative to DWM, RYGB decreases the baseline-corrected abundance of retinol at the 3 month time point, and RYGB decreases baseline-corrected 1 year HbA1c (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, left side). However, a decrease in retinol is associated with an increase in HbA1c—a direction of mediation inconsistent with RYGB decreasing HbA1c, so retinol does not appear to mediate RYGB’s beneficial effect.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>GHR is a consistent mediator of change in HbA1c.</title><p>Retinol is an inconsistent mediator (i.e., it suppresses or inhibits the causal effect; left side) whereas GHR is a consistent mediator of HbA1c change at 1 year (right side). <bold>a</bold>

                <p id="Par23">A second drawback of the joint significance and other mediation methods is that they are intended for testing only one or a few mediators. Thus they do not employ powerful statistical methods for high-throughput data, such as linear regression modeling with empirical Bayesian modeling of an analyte’s variance with the R package Limma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, which has been validated in multiple omics platforms, and is particularly powerful for small sample sizes.</p>
                <p id="Par24">To address these limitations, we developed high-throughput mediation analysis (Hitman). Hitman is designed for studies where the exposure causes a significant change in the outcome in the same direction as known a priori and high-throughput mediators are assayed. Hitman improves power by accounting for the direction of effect and by employing empirical Bayesian linear modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. If a mediator’s direction of effect is consistent with the prespecified direction of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome, its <italic>p</italic>-value from the joint significance test is halved. Otherwise, its <italic>p</italic>-value becomes one. In the case of the inconsistent mediator retinol, Hitman assigns a <italic>p</italic>-value of one. The description of the algorithm, implemented in our R package <italic>Hitman</italic>, mathematical proof that Hitman provides valid p-values when there is a causal effect whose direction is known, and details of our simulations and their results are provided in Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Using simulations similar to those of Barfield et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and MacKinnon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, we compared Hitman against the joint significance test and the potential outcome mediation test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which had not been included in previous simulations. Consistent with our mathematical proof, our simulation using 50 samples demonstrates that Hitman properly controls its false positive rate when the causal effect’s direction is known and specified prior to the analysis. Our simulations also test the ability of the methods to detect consistent mediators, and confirm that Hitman has more power. For example, when the true causal mediation effects are of a size termed “small”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the joint significance and the potential outcome mediation test identify mediation in &lt;2.5% of simulations, whereas Hitman identifies mediators in &gt;6%, which is significantly greater than both (odds ratio (OR) = 2.89, 95% CI = [2.48, 3.39], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>). When the true effect is of “medium” size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, the proportion of simulations that identified mediation by the joint significance test and the potential outcome mediation test were 53.9 and 57.4%, respectively, whereas Hitman identifies 68.5% (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = [1.52, 1.71], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>).</p>
                <p id="Par26">The directional nature of Hitman accounts for much but not all of Hitman’s power, since the empirical Bayesian variance estimation adds power, particularly with smaller sample sizes. Smaller sample sizes are common in basic research with model organisms, where variance between units in a group is expected to be small. Using Limma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> also allows for testing high-throughput data types that are not normally distributed, such as RNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. We demonstrate the benefit of using Limma by simulating as above but with only 15 samples. We also compare these simulations against a simplified version of Hitman that does not use Limma, which is applicable to scenarios other than high-throughput data. We find with medium effect size that the joint significance and the potential outcome method have power &lt;7%, the simplified version of Hitman that does not use Limma has power 11.8%, and Hitman has the power of 16.1%, which is significantly greater than the others (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = [1.32, 1.55], <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−15</sup>).</p>
                <p id="Par27">We next conducted omics simulations using datasets of 500 analytes where <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted with the false discovery rate (FDR). We simulated sample sizes of 15 and 50, either 1, 5, or 25 consistent mediators, and 200 analytes associated with the exposure but not the outcome in three scenarios: (1) analytes are independent and mediators are consistent; (2) analytes are dependent on each other and mediators are consistent; and (3) analytes are dependent on each other and there are an equal number of consistent and inconsistent mediators of equal effect. We compared the joint significance method, Hitman, and the version of Hitman that does not use Limma. We did not include the potential outcome mediation test in these simulations because of its computational cost. We modeled dependence between analytes based on the dependence structure from the GTEx expression dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which was adjusted for measured and inferred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> covariates, like the processing by Oliva et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par28">We found that power increased with more samples and fewer mediators, whether these mediators were consistent or inconsistent, and that including dependence from GTEx had little effect on the results, most likely because its covariates were properly accounted for. We also found that Hitman controls its FDR in all scenarios and has the most power, with the greatest advantage when <italic>N</italic> = 15. For example, in scenario 1 when <italic>N</italic> = 15 and there was one true mediator, the joint significance method had power of 31.5%, whereas Hitman had power of 42.4% (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = [1.33, 1.93], <italic>p</italic> = 5*10<sup>−7</sup>).</p>

We also tested the change in proteins and metabolites at the 3 month time point vs HbA1c change at the 18, 24, and 36 month time points. However, we found no significant protein or metabolite mediators of HbA1c at these later time points, potentially because after 12 months the number of participants with HbA1c measurements declines substantially, or there are additional secondary changes, such as progressive weight loss or inter-individual variation in diet or other factors (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

Insulin secretion, defined as the change in insulin from 0 to 30 min during a mixed meal tolerance test, was improved in RYGB vs. DWM, as expected (means of changes: RYGB = 37.4, DWM = 0.808; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). No single analyte was identified as a significant mediator, but one pathway, Caffeine Metabolism, significantly mediated improved insulin secretion (FDR &lt; 10<sup>−4</sup>).

No individual proteins or metabolites were significant mediators of insulin sensitivity, but many top-ranking analytes were BCAA-related metabolites.

Robust GHR mediation led us to hypothesize that reductions in plasma GHR reflected reduced tissue content or altered receptor shedding, and thus could be associated with reduced growth hormone (GH) signaling. In the liver, GH is best recognized as a determinant of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) secretion during periods of nutritional sufficiency, but GHR also exerts complex pro-diabetogenic effects on glucose metabolism via IGF1-independent pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Indeed, IGF1 was not identified as a mediator by Hitman, and neither SOMAscan nor ELISA measures of IGF1 differed between groups at the 3 month time point (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Levels of IGFBP1 and IGFBP2, which are repressed by GH signaling, were increased in RYGB vs. DWM at multiple time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).

              <p id="Par37">RYGB yielded weight loss and improvement in multiple clinical parameters. Our proteomic and metabolomics analysis in the fasting state revealed both weight-dependent and -independent protein and metabolite changes. Weight-dependent changes included decreases in insulin, leptin, proinflammatory proteins, amino acids, and lipid-related metabolites; these changes are consistent with improved insulin sensitivity, loss of adipose mass, and reductions in inflammation observed in prior studies of RYGB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, the differential abundance of several analytes linked to bone or bile acid metabolism remained after BMI adjustment, suggesting weight-independent mechanisms underlying these changes. For example, the highly abundant bile acid and FXR ligand glycochenodeoxycholate sulfate and the intestinal FXR-dependent hormone FGF-19 were upregulated at later time points even with BMI adjustment in participants randomized to RYGB, consistent with prior reports in patients post-RYGB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and in those with hypoglycemia after gastric bypass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par38">Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine Degradation was the most significantly changed pathway at the 3 month time point between groups and a significant HOMA-IR pathway mediator. There were robust post-RYGB decreases in BCAA and multiple downstream catabolic intermediates, including C3 and C5 acylcarnitines. Our results are in agreement with reduced BCAA in response to RYGB in nonrandomized studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and prior findings of increased BCAA in insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Lower BCAA levels post-RYGB may be a consequence of weight loss-related improvements in insulin sensitivity or altered microbial metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, but may also contribute directly to improved insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Our data reveal a marked 88% reduction in the valine catabolic intermediate 3-hydroxyisobutyrate at the 3 month time point, which is particularly interesting since 3-hydroxyisobutyrate can exit mitochondria and serve as a signaling molecule, promoting muscle lipid uptake and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par39">The significant protein putative mediator of improved glycemic control was GHR, which was reduced after RYGB. GHR at the 3 month time point is a more significant mediator of glycemia at 1 year than any clinical markers, including BMI, indicating that GHR may have clinical significance as a biomarker of bariatric surgery or as a therapeutic target. In agreement, liver <italic>Ghr</italic> expression was significantly reduced after VSG in rats with dietary obesity. These data are consistent with the &gt;50% reduction in <italic>Ghr</italic> mRNA expression and protein (assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry) in liver and multiple intestinal segments recently reported at both 9 days and 9 weeks post-RYGB in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. These reductions in <italic>Ghr</italic> were also observed in weight-matched mice, indicating weight-independence. In our human cohort, reduction in GHR was closely correlated with reductions in BCAA-related metabolites, which have also been linked to improved post-surgical metabolism.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Beyond reductions in GHR content, we observed changes in plasma levels of downstream targets of GH signaling, with a robust increase in IGFBP1 at the 3 month time point and both IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 at 12, 24, and 36 months; these changes are concordant with reduced GH effect within IGF1-independent pathways regulating hepatic and systemic metabolism. The time course of these effects provides potential clues. Reduction in GHR at the 3 month time point was accompanied by an increase in the GHR-dependent target IGFBP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. By contrast, increases in GH measured by ELISA were not observed at the 3 month time point, but only emerged at 12 months. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that late postoperative increases in GH may reflect both acquired GH resistance following RYGB, together with the reversal of obesity- and inflammation-associated reductions in GH secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The emergence of increases in GH at 12 months in the surgical group could also contribute to sustained lipolysis in adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Additional experiments will be required to identify the tissue-specific changes in GH action associated with improved metabolic control after RYGB in patients with T2D.</p>
              <p id="Par41">Given that GH excess (due to acromegaly or pharmacologic use of GH in adults) is associated with increased glucose levels and diabetes in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>, a net reduction of GH signaling would be expected to improve systemic metabolism. Indeed, rodent models with experimental ablation of either <italic>Gh</italic> or <italic>Ghr</italic> have increased healthspan, delayed aging, and improved insulin sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Mice with liver-specific ablation of <italic>Ghr</italic> have impaired gluconeogenesis, with overt hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Moreover, inhibition of GH action by the GHR antagonist pegvisomant improves systemic insulin action in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Our data in isolated primary hepatocytes with experimental knockdown of <italic>Ghr</italic> provide further support for an important role for reduction in GHR-dependent signals as a mediator of improved glucose metabolism. Efficient <italic>Ghr</italic> knockdown reduced expression of gluconeogenic enzymes <italic>Pepck</italic> and <italic>G6pc</italic>, and enhanced the action of insulin to repress glucose production. Taken together, our study adds to the growing evidence that RYGB decreases GHR-dependent signaling in the liver, and supports that this reduction may contribute to lowering of glucose and robust improvements in diabetes control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par43">We have developed and applied a mediation method that can be applied to studies where samples are randomized to a treatment (or can be modeled as randomized given covariates) whose causal effect on the outcome is consistent with prior knowledge and these samples’ potential mediators are assayed. As others have noted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, mediation analyses can be misled by confounding variables, such as an unmeasured factor that both affects GHR at the 3 month time point and (independently of GHR) affects HbA1c at one year. To avoid confounding among measured mediators, some high-throughput mediation approaches decompose measured analytes to identify latent mediators that are independent of measured confounders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. However, these latent mediators are composed of multiple analytes and can be difficult to interpret and follow-up experimentally. Furthermore, in complex biological systems, many potential confounders are unmeasured, such as microbiome changes in this study, so confounders’ impact often cannot be prevented by decomposing measured analytes. To avoid confounding, it is helpful to control for relevant covariates. For example, in this study Hitman analyzed changes within individuals, which obviates the need to control for some demographic variables. For our omics simulations, we measured inter-gene dependence in GTEx after controlling for previously identified covariates and unknown factors using surrogate variable analysis (SVA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which decreased dependence. However, Hitman tests mediators individually and does not attempt to control for confounders or inter-analyte dependence, so its results should be considered exploratory, like other causal mediation methods that test analytes individually in omics datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Future work should focus on combining Hitman with methods that consider multiple mediators simultaneously, such as pathway analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and account for some level of confounding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par44">As required for a directional (“one-sided”) test, the direction to be tested in Hitman is defined using prior knowledge before Hitman is applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>; this must be the same as the observed direction of the exposure’s effect on the outcome. The question of when directional tests are appropriate is often debated, but the primary criteria are that the direction of the test should align with prior evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> and the scientific hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. These two criteria are related since scientific hypotheses are based on prior evidence. For example, multiple studies (including ours) have found that RYGB causes a robust decrease in HbA1c. This provides confidence that RYGB truly decreases HbA1c, which supports the hypothesis that there exist mediators of RYGB’s decrease in HbA1c. If the observed causal effect is not in the pre-specified direction or no information about the direction of a potential causal effect is available, then Hitman should not be applied, as the approach of using a directional test is invalid, and the false positive rate could be inflated by two-fold.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Here we are interested in consistent mediators, which can explain the causal effect of the exposure on the mediator and the mechanism of action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. The mediation hypothesis in the inconsistent direction is that there exist mediators that suppress or inhibit RYGB’s reduction of HbA1c. Detecting inconsistent mediators could be of value, as these mediators could be blocked to enhance RYGB’s reduction of HbA1c. If these exist, though, their effect size should be small relative to the magnitude of RYGB-related reduction of HbA1c. If only inconsistent mediators are of interest, though, Hitman can be slightly modified so that consistent mediators are assigned a <italic>p</italic>-value of one and the <italic>p</italic>-value of inconsistent mediators are halved. Without this modification, Hitman has no power to detect inconsistent mediators.</p>
              <p id="Par46">We acknowledge that profiling semi-quantitative plasma metabolomics and proteomics, with emphasis on the secreted proteome, cannot fully define the pleiotropic effects of bariatric surgery, including both weight-dependent and weight-independent changes in complex inter-organ communication, gut microbiome effects, tissue-specific protein abundance, or flux in metabolic pathways. Moreover, medication usage, activity, and diet composition could impact both clinical and omics differences between groups in the human cohort. Although studies in rodents cannot fully recapitulate human systemic metabolism, we were able to identify and validate changes in <italic>Ghr</italic> and related pathway genes under controlled experimental conditions. The analytes we have identified and validated can be modulated in future studies to determine whether they can be utilized for non-surgical control of glucose metabolism in T2D, and our mediation method can be applied in translational omics studies.</p>

                <p id="Par67">Primary hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type C57Bl6 male mice at age 8 weeks. After anesthesia (pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg), the vena cava was cannulated (30G) and the portal vein was cut for drainage. The liver was perfused for 5 min with 20 mL of perfusion solution (NaCl 140 mM, Tricine 25 mM, KCl 5.5 mM, EGTA 0.5 mM, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 0.5 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 0.3 mM, pH 7.4) and then for 5 min with 25 mL of digestion buffer (Eagle’s balanced salts (NaCl 115 mM, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25 mM, D-Glucose 5.5 mM, KCl 5.5 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.3 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> 0.8 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 0.8 mM), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and collagenase type II) for 5 min. The liver was harvested and minced; the cell suspension was filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer; cells were collected via centrifugation (200 × <italic>g</italic>, 3 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of complete DMEM (glucose 450 mg/dL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cell suspension was mixed with 10 ml of Percoll and centrifuged at 340 × <italic>g</italic>, 10 min); the pellet was resuspended in 25 mL complete DMEM, centrifuged again (200 × <italic>g</italic>, 5 min), and resuspended in 10 mL complete DMEM. Cells were counted and seeded at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL onto collagen-coated plates.</p>

Freshly isolated primary hepatocytes (<italic>n</italic> = 6 in si-GHR; <italic>n</italic> = 6 in non-targeting controls) were added to each well (800 μL/well), and medium containing siRNA and transfection reagents was replaced after 24 h.</p>
