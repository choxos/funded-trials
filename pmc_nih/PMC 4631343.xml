                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Whereas systematic screening programs have reduced the incidence of cervical cancer in developed countries, the incidence remains high in developing countries. Among several barriers to uptake of cervical cancer screening, the roles of religious and cultural factors such as modesty have been poorly studied. Knowledge about these factors is important because of the potential to overcome them using strategies such as self-collection of cervico-vaginal samples. In this study we evaluate the influence of spirituality and modesty on the acceptance of self-sampling for cervical cancer screening.</p>

                  <title>Methodology</title>
                  <p>We enrolled 600 participants in Nigeria between August and October 2014 and collected information on spirituality and modesty using two scales. We used principal component analysis to extract scores for spirituality and modesty and logistic regression models to evaluate the association between spirituality, modesty and preference for self-sampling. All analyses were performed using STATA 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Some 581 (97%) women had complete data for analysis. Most (69%) were married, 50% were Christian and 44% were from the south western part of Nigeria. Overall, 19% (110/581) of the women preferred self-sampling to being sampled by a health care provider. Adjusting for age and socioeconomic status, spirituality, religious affiliation and geographic location were significantly associated with preference for self-sampling, while modesty was not significantly associated. The multivariable OR (95% CI, p-value) for association with self-sampling were 0.88 (0.78–0.99, 0.03) for spirituality, 1.69 (1.09–2.64, 0.02) for religious affiliation and 0.96 (0.86–1.08, 0.51) for modesty.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our results show the importance of taking cultural and religious beliefs and practices into consideration in planning health interventions like cervical cancer screening. To succeed, public health interventions and the education to promote it must be related to the target population and its preferences.</p>

Of the 528 000 new cervical cancer cases that occurred globally in 2012, 85% of these were in Sub Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is largely due to the absence of large scale population based screening programs [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In these countries, cervical cancer screening efforts are largely opportunistic and sporadic, resulting in low uptake and lack of public health benefit [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several methods of cervical cancer screening have been utilized since the introduction of Pap smear in 1928 [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More recently, HPV DNA testing is increasingly used with several countries implementing it as a primary screening method, as a result of a greater protection against invasive cancer, when compared to cytology [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is largely because HPV DNA based testing is more objective and more reproducible compared to other cervical cancer screening modalities [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Considering that the infrastructural requirements for HPV DNA based testing is less stringent than required for cytology based screening, with fewer clinic visits required, this may be a feasible alternative in resource limited environments [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>In order to substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer in Sub Saharan Africa, there is a need to implement sustainable and accessible population based screening programs and address the barriers to cervical cancer screening uptake. Several studies have explored some of these barriers. These have focused on socioeconomic barriers (cost of screening, stigma associated with a positive result, embarrassment, lack of trust in the health care systems, spousal disapproval); health systems barriers (accessibility, multiple visits, discomfort, complications from screening procedure, sex of health care providers) and lack of awareness. Few have examined the role of religious and cultural factors [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p>
              <p>There are several challenges in evaluating the effects of religiosity and health outcomes. One of these is the difficulty in defining the concept of religiosity and understanding it as a measurable trait that influences health care behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Till date, most studies on health outcome and religiosity in Sub Saharan Africa have typically used one general measure, such as attendance at religious gatherings or active religious participation or observance, without recognizing the multidimensional nature of this attribute [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore the use of a singular measure such as attendance at religious gatherings may be heavily confounded. For example, increase in religious participation may serve as a coping mechanism in dealing with illness and conversely illnesses that result in reduced mobility may reduce religious participation [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Despite the difficulties in measurement, studies show that religions help shape the way individuals interpret and seek help for their illnesses [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is therefore important to evaluate the influence of religiosity in interventions to improve health care utilization.</p>
              <p>Self-collected cervical samples for HPV DNA based tests for cervical cancer screening may reduce some of the barriers to uptake including those related to religious and cultural norms of modesty, fear of pelvic examinations, concerns about the sex of the health care provider, sanitary environment of the health care centers and requirements for multiple clinic visits [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although several studies have indicated that the use of self-sampling methods for HPV DNA detection is feasible in African countries, few studies have evaluated its acceptability and even fewer have explored the potential barriers to its use, particularly the influence of spirituality and modesty in communities with high levels of self-reported spirituality [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study we evaluated the influence of self-reported spirituality and modesty on the uptake of cervical cancer screening, in particular how these affect acceptance of self-collected samples, in order to inform the design of targeted interventions that would increase cervical cancer screening uptake in these communities.</p>

                <title>Study Population</title>
                <p>Between August and October 2014, we recruited 600 women in Ondo and Abuja in the south western and north central regions of Nigeria respectively. Women were eligible to participate if they were over 18 years with no obvious physical ailments. We spoke to eligible women at markets, mosques, churches, schools, banks, and on the streets and invited them to participate. The authors EOD, EJA, PB and FIM led the recruitment team and were assisted by TU, CO, SI, EO, FA, OO and OA (acknowledged in the paper). All recruiters were females, familiar with local cultures and norms and dressed in culturally appropriate attire during recruitment. Participants had the options of a self-administered questionnaire or an interviewer administered questionnaire. We obtained written informed consent from all women before they were enrolled in the study.</p>
                <p>We collected demographic information including age, education, religion, ethnicity and occupation. In order to evaluate socioeconomic status we asked about household ownership of consumer goods (car, motorcycle, refrigerator, television, bicycle and fan), characteristics of the household dwelling (type of toilet facility, separate room for cooking, source of fuel for cooking, source of drinking water and type of residence) and house ownership. We also collected information on knowledge of cancer and of cancer screening, and attitudes towards screening for any cancer in general, and specifically for cervical cancer. Preference for self-sampling was collected as a categorical variable with four possible responses (prefer to self-sample at home, prefer health care provider irrespective of gender in a hospital, prefer female health care worker in a hospital, and prefer male healthcare worker in a hospital) For this analysis responses were dichotomized into two—prefer to self-sample at home and prefer a health care provider in the hospital.</p>

We evaluated sampling adequacy and suitability of our data for PCA by computing the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) values, conducting the Bartlett’s test of sphericity, and examination of the correlation matrix of our variables [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The items “frequency of prayers and attendance at religious gatherings were poorly correlated with other variables in the 7 item spirituality mini scale (highest correlation was 0.16). Furthermore, the KMO values for “frequency of prayers” and “attendance at religious gatherings” were 0.53 and 0.50 respectively, which are both considered “miserable” for KMO scores [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore these items were excluded. Sensitivity analysis showed that the inclusion of the poorly correlated variables: frequency of prayers and attendance at religious gatherings in the spirituality score did not significantly alter the results with a p-value of 0.04 for the goodness of fit test. After exclusion, all KMO values for the individual items were ≥0.80 and the overall KMO measure was 0.83. The Bartlett’s test of sphericity showed a patterned relationship between the items (χ2 (6) = 1513.35, p&lt; 0.001). We used the multiple criteria of an eigenvalue cut-off of 1, cumulative variance explained, scree plot and interpretability of extracted components to determine the number of components to retain [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We identified one component that explained the cumulative variance of 70%. We predicted scores using the component loadings for the retained component and each participant received a score for the variable spirituality. Each score was a linear combination of the component loadings of the items used to measure spirituality. The variable, spirituality should be interpreted as a continuum and participants may exist at any point in this continuum.</p>

              <p>With respect to the indicators used to measure spirituality, responses were skewed. Over 90% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with the statements: I feel God’s presence every day and I am comforted by his presence; I find strength and comfort in my religion most of the time; I believe that God watches over me at all times; and I believe that the events in my life happen according to God’s predestined plan. Therefore the responses to these questions were dichotomized into 2 categories: strongly agree or not.</p>
              <p>In multivariable analysis, we found that women who reported high levels of spirituality were less likely to prefer self-sampling (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78–0.99, p value = 0.03) adjusting for age, religious affiliation, geographic location and socioeconomic status (<xref rid="pone.0141679.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Muslim women in our study were more likely to prefer self-sampling compared to Christians and the multivariable OR was 1.69 (95% CI = 1.09–2.64, p value = 0.02). Geographic location was also independently associated with preference for self-sampling with women in north central Nigeria less likely to prefer self-sampling compared to women in the south western region of the country, adjusting for age, spirituality, religious affiliation and socioeconomic status. The odds ratio was 0.47 (95% CI = 0.29–0.74, p-value = 0.001). We also found lower preference for self-sampling among women in the higher compared to lower socioeconomic class. The multivariable OR, adjusting for spirituality, age, religious affiliation and geographic location was 0.45 (95% CI = 0.41, 0.97, p value = 0.04)</p>

              <p>In this study of women in Nigeria, we found an association between spirituality, religious affiliation, socio-economic status and geographical location, and self-reported preference for self-sampling for cervical cancer screening.</p>
              <p>Women who were classified as having high levels of spirituality were less likely to report that they would accept self-sampling for cervical cancer screening. This finding may reflect perceptions of body image and a particular sensitivity about performing intra-cavitary procedures on themselves among these women. Our finding that Muslims were more likely to prefer self-sampling than Christians, which was not attenuated after adjusting for spirituality, modesty, age, geographic location and socioeconomic status, may suggests that there are other cultural factors, other than spirituality, that influences the acceptance of self sampling among Muslims. From our previous qualitative research, we identified that Muslim women perceived a sense of discrimination at health care facilities which prevents them from seeking care for non-critical services (manuscript under review). This may explain the preference for self-sampling since this does not require clinic visits. Alternatively cultural practices that normalise intra-cavitary insertions may be more prevalent among Muslim women resulting in their being more comfortable with self-collecting a sample for cervical cancer screening. Studies in Uganda have also shown that women who reported inserting herbs to widen the birth canal during pregnancy or regularly douche were more comfortable with self-collection of samples (13). Acceptance of self-collection may also reflect the attitude of these women to exposure of their bodies to other people, concern about sex of health care workers and beliefs about disease aetiology.</p>
              <p>Our finding differs from results of some studies evaluating the influence of spirituality and religion on acceptance of self-sampling. In a study of 300 women in Uganda and 50 (mostly migrant) African-Caribbean women in the UK, researchers did not identify an association between religious beliefs and self-reported preference for self-sampling. While we used several measures to ascertain religiosity, these other studies asked a single question about whether religious beliefs would influence choice of self-sampling [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This may explain the difference in our results. Other possible explanations for the difference include variations in pattern and practice of religions and spirituality in different communities.</p>
              <p>Participants from the south western region of Nigeria were more likely to prefer self-sampling than women from the north central region. This may reflect the higher levels of exposure to formal education and Western influence on norms and values in the south western region of the country compared to the northern region [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as well as a higher degree of social disinhibition. Studies of African immigrants to the US suggest that the uptake of self sampling for cervical cancer screening increases with acculturation using length of residency as a proxy [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
              <p>Overall the self-reported acceptance of self-sampling for cervical cancer prevention in this population was low. This could be partly explained by our finding that although a large proportion of participants had heard about cancer, relatively fewer participants were aware of cervical cancer, its symptoms, cervical cancer prevention/screening methods and the possibility of self-collection of samples for screening. The lack of knowledge about cervical cancer may also be related to the hidden anatomical location of the cervix in contrast to the breast, for example, which is located on the surface, as well as cultural and social inhibitions in discussing sexual and reproductive health. Although studies done in developed countries show a high level of acceptance [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], studies in Africa have revealed varying levels of acceptance of self-collection of samples for cervical cancer screening [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Typically, studies that reported high levels of acceptance have included an educational intervention where information was provided on cervical cancer, prevention methods and self-collection of samples; evaluated acceptance after women had been given the opportunity to use the self-collection device or were conducted in women who had been screened for HPV [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141679.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In scenarios where acceptability was evaluated prior to any intervention, low acceptance rates as reported in our study was observed [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>One major criticism of studies on religiosity is the methodological flaws in the ascertainment of spirituality using one indicator such as attendance at religious gatherings [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Spirituality is a complex construct that includes a wide variety of behavioural aspects, such as attendance at religious gatherings, solitary prayer, meditation, reading sacred texts, as well as attitudinal aspects such as values, beliefs and feelings [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We address this by measuring spirituality with a multidimensional self-report survey instrument derived from the B-MMRS taking into account four domains of religiosity—daily spiritual experiences, values and beliefs, meaning and religious practices. The B-MMRS is designed for use in heterogeneous populations (regardless of religious affiliations) among adults of all ages [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>One of the strengths of our study is the sample size. The traditional protocol of sample size determination is power analysis, however this approach is not very useful when dealing with psychometric measurements [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. There are varying opinions on sample size recommendations for studies utilizing data reduction techniques, with sample sizes varying from 50 [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] to 1000 [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The general rule of thumb of 100 as poor, 200 as fair, 300 as good, 500 as very good and 1000 or more as excellent from the work of Comrey and Lee is widely used [<xref rid="pone.0141679.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. With a sample size of 600, our study is sufficiently powered to evaluate the latent constructs of spirituality and modesty among Nigerian women.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our findings suggest that acceptability of self-sampling for cervical cancer prevention without prior educational intervention would be low among Nigerian women. Our results demonstrate the importance of taking cultural and religious beliefs and practices into consideration in planning health interventions like cervical cancer screening. In order for these to succeed, the choice of intervention and public education to promote them must be guided by adequate knowledge of the target population and its preferences in order to maximize impact. Therefore public health interventions targeted at reducing the burden of cervical cancer in developing countries need to incorporate public education on cervical cancer and its prevention.</p>
