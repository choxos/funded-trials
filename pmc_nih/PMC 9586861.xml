                <p id="Par1">Talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, is active in germline <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> (g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>)-mutant advanced breast cancer, but its activity beyond g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> is poorly understood. We conducted Talazoparib Beyond BRCA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03690193?term=NCT03690193">NCT02401347</ext-link>), an open-label phase II trial, to evaluate talazoparib in patients with pretreated advanced HER2-negative breast cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or other solid tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 7) with mutations in homologous recombination (HR) pathway genes other than <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>. In patients with breast cancer, four patients had a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial response (overall response rate, 31%), and three additional patients had stable disease of ≥6 months (clinical benefit rate, 54%). All patients with germline mutations in <italic>PALB2</italic>
<italic>(</italic>g<italic>PALB2</italic>; encoding partner and localizer of BRCA2) had treatment-associated tumor regression. Tumor or plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) HR deficiency (HRD) scores were correlated with treatment outcomes and were increased in all g<italic>PALB2</italic> tumors. In addition, a g<italic>PALB2</italic>-associated mutational signature was associated with tumor response. Thus, talazoparib has been demonstrated to have efficacy in patients with advanced breast cancer who have g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations, showing activity in the context of HR pathway gene mutations beyond g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>.</p>

              <p id="Par3">PARP inhibitors, including talazoparib and olaparib, are currently approved for the treatment of HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in patients who harbor a genomic <italic>BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic> (g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>) mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Additional drugs in this class, including niraparib and rucaparib, are approved for ovarian cancer therapy or maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. These therapies are rooted in the concept of synthetic lethality wherein deficiency in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic> or other homologous recombination (HR)-associated genes in the tumor renders tumor cells sensitive to PARP inhibition by disabling a PARP-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) repair pathway in the context of defective HR DNA repair, which is dependent on <italic>BRCA1,</italic>
<italic>BRCA2</italic> and associated factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, in the setting of g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutation (or presumably somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for <italic>BRCA1 or</italic>
<italic>BRCA2</italic>) and PARP inhibitor therapy, tumor cells cannot repair ssDNA breaks that accumulate through metabolic processes and DNA replication leading to tumor-specific lethality, whereas normal cells can use HR to repair these lesions and thus are spared. This observation has driven the clinical development of PARP inhibitors for tumors with g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The OlympiAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and EMBRACA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> clinical trials of olaparib and talazoparib, respectively, in g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>-mutant advanced metastatic breast cancer showed similar increases in progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 3 months compared to chemotherapy treatment of physician’s choice, which led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of these agents for this specific patient population. Efficacy of monotherapy PARP inhibitors has also been demonstrated in patients with pancreatic cancer with g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations (POLO trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), as well as in patients with prostate cancer with either g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations (PROfound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) or other HR-associated mutations (TOPARP-A/B<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, TRITON-2 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), GALAHAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, TALAPRO-1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>)). Recently, veliparib has also shown efficacy in combination with first-line chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer followed by maintenance therapy (VELIA/GOG-3005)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Veliparib also has benefit if used in combination with chemotherapy in advanced HER2-negative breast cancers with g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations (BROCADE3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These studies highlight the importance of biomarkers in selecting patients for PARP inhibitor therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Possible biomarkers explored for PARP inhibitor-based therapy include germline DNA alterations, somatic (tumor) DNA mutations and HR deficiency (HRD) scores. Large population-based studies have identified that 24% of patients with breast cancer and 30.9% of patients with ovarian cancer have undergone germline DNA analysis for mutations associated with cancer onset in the current era<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These numbers are expected to increase as DNA testing continues to expand into community-based oncology practices. This type of testing has the potential to identify g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations or other germline HR-associated gene mutations that could be used to select PARP inhibitor therapy for patients with advanced disease.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Similar to germline testing, somatic tumor genetics is rapidly expanding, especially in the treatment of advanced or metastatic cancers, with the goal of identifying mutations associated with therapeutic benefit of FDA-approved agents or as enrollment criteria for clinical trials of novel or expanded-access therapies. In one large retrospective analysis of over 17,000 tumors across 21 different tumor types, we found that 17.4% of tumors harbored mutations in genes associated with HR pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In primary prostate cancers, the prevalence of HRD mutations was 9.9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, with a higher rate (11.8–21.3%) found in metastatic lesions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. This suggests that PARP inhibitors could benefit patients with a wider subset of tumors than currently envisioned by only assessing g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> status.</p>
              <p id="Par7">As opposed to assessing gene-specific mutations in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> or other HR-associated genes, HRD scores can tabulate a genome-wide metric of HRD. This metric can integrate up to three types of chromosomal aberrations associated with HRD, including LOH, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Clinical studies have determined that an elevated HRD score is associated with response to platinum-based chemotherapy in early-stage triple-negative breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and increased PFS in ovarian cancer treated with niraparib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, higher LOH was associated with benefit from rucaparib maintenance therapy (ARIEL 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A high HRD score may reflect the presence of <italic>BRCA1</italic> and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations, mutations in other HR-associated genes or methylation of HR genes. Therefore, tumors with high HRD scores are a promising subset to consider for PARP inhibitor therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par8">While HRD and LOH assays have been approved by the FDA to select patients with ovarian cancer for treatment with PARP inhibitors, the data in advanced breast cancer are less clear. The Treating to New Targets trial did not demonstrate a role for HRD testing to identify patients with wild-type <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> who have advanced triple-negative breast cancer more likely to benefit from carboplatin as opposed to taxane chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, in the SWOG 1416 trial of cisplatin with or without veliparib, an higher HRD score was associated with improved PFS with the addition of veliparib to cisplatin in patients with germline wild-type g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> advanced triple-negative breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Taken together, previous studies have suggested that other biomarkers beyond g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> may be associated with clinical responses to PARP inhibitors, but the data remain relatively sparse. We explored the hypothesis that triple-negative breast cancers with high HRD scores (cohort A) or any solid tumor with germline or somatic mutations in HRD-associated genes other than <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> (cohort B) could be used to select patients for talazoparib monotherapy in the Talazoparib Beyond BRCA phase II clinical trial. Here we report the results of 20 patients treated in cohort B who were enrolled based on identification of an HR pathway-associated mutation other than g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> on either germline or somatic next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing. We report that patients with breast cancer with mutations beyond g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> had a 31% overall response rate (ORR), whereas no objective responses were observed in non-breast tumors. The responses of patients with breast cancer were driven, in part, by patients with germline mutations in <italic>PALB2</italic>
<italic>(</italic>g<italic>PALB2</italic>; encoding partner and localizer of BRCA2) and were correlated with high HRD scores. These results indicate that PARP inhibitors should be further explored in metastatic or advanced breast cancers that have HR-associated mutations beyond <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic>.</p>

Nineteen patients discontinued therapy due to disease progression; one patient withdrew from therapy with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) stable disease (SD) due to concern of nontarget disease enlargement.

                <p id="Par18">Next, we assessed whether HRD scores could serve as a biomarker of response to talazoparib therapy. The continuous treatment response by change in tumor size as measured by RECIST criteria (sum of longest diameters, SLD) was plotted as a function of the tumor HRD score (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In cases where more than one HRD score was available per patient, the higher score was used. This analysis yielded a positive correlation between continuous treatment response and HRD score, with higher HRD scores associated with better response to therapy (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.64, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008). In particular, all five assayed tumors derived from patients with g<italic>PALB2</italic> (one g<italic>PALB2</italic> tumor HRD score failed) passed the HRD cutoff of 33, and four out of five passed the HRD cutoff of 42. The HRD threshold of ≥33 captures 99% of known <italic>BRCA1</italic>- and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic>-deficient ovarian cancers, whereas the HRD score of ≥42 captures 95% of known <italic>BRCA1</italic>- and/or <italic>BRCA2</italic>-deficient ovarian cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, but cutoffs are less well defined for other tumor types. This correlation was primarily driven by the patients with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations as removal of these patients from the analysis yielded a nonsignificant result (<italic>r</italic> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.92 by Pearson’s correlation). This indicates that HRD score may capture patients in addition to those with <italic>gBRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations who benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy. Namely, patients with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations have tumors with a high degree of genomic instability that mirror g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2-</italic>mutated tumors.</p>

                <p id="Par21">Given that we observed characteristic LOH associated with germline mutation of DNA repair genes, we pursued further genomic characterization of patient materials. Plasma was prospectively collected from patients at study enrollment (baseline) and at the time of disease progression for exploratory studies of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma was sequenced with two technologies: (1) the commercial Signatera assay and (2) plasma whole-exome sequencing (pWES), which was performed independently of tumor biopsy sequencing, but was compared to normal tissue to isolate tumor-associated mutations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–c</xref>). The variant allele fraction (VAF) for each single-nucleotide variant (SNV) or indel is plotted at baseline and progression. Of the 19 patient samples available for tumor WES, 4 were excluded due to hypocellularity and/or low genomic DNA recovery. The remaining 15 patients had successful design of 16-plex Signatera assays. Signatera-based ctDNA was detected in 25 of 29 plasma samples (86%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). pWES detected 1,493 and 1,771 SNVs in ctDNA at baseline and progression, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), compared to 3,464 variants detected in tumor tissue. There was no significant difference in the number of overlapping mutations per sample between baseline ctDNA and tumor tissue compared to progression ctDNA and tumor tissue (13 ± 33 and 38 ± 75 (median ± interquantile range (IQR)), respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.16 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This indicates that pWES of ctDNA can detect tumor-associated SNVs and indels in an unbiased manner, which partially, but not completely, overlap with variants detected by tumor sequencing.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>ctDNA variants and ctHRD score correlating with treatment outcomes.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Variants detected by Signatera assay of baseline and progression ctDNA samples plotted by VAF.

                <p id="Par22">Unbiased detection of ctDNA variants at baseline and progression allowed us to query whether certain variants were associated with talazoparib response or resistance. There were 136 deleterious variants that increased in frequency by more than fivefold in progression samples compared to baseline samples in responders (patients who had evidence of tumor shrinkage of at least 20% from baseline; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Although indels resulting in the reversion of initiating HRD mutations have been previously reported as a mechanism of resistance to PARP inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we did not detect any such mutations in this dataset, despite mean coverages of 600× and 450× across the exome panel and the <italic>PALB2</italic> gene, respectively. A significant increase in SNVs, but not indels, was detected in both responders (patients with breast cancer with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations) and other patients at progression compared to baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that specific mutations associated with therapy resistance were potentially identified in our dataset, although further confirmation of their relevance to cancer progression is needed.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Although specific mutations could be associated with resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy, we also sought to identify additional biomarkers of response to therapy. Our previous results indicated that HRD score based on tumor sequencing correlated with continuous response to talazoparib as measured by a change in SLD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Thus, an HRD score derived from pWES of ctDNA (here termed ctHRD) was also assessed as a biomarker of PARP inhibitor response. Recently, a computational workflow (scarHRD) has been established to calculate HRD scores from tumor NGS data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. This algorithm was applied in the tumor and ctDNA WES datasets. The scarHRD score calculated from tumor WES was highly correlated to the Myriad HRD score on tumor-derived samples (<italic>r</italic> = 0.85, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004 by Pearson’s method) indicating that the scarHRD metric may be a suitable proxy for the Myriad HRD test.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Next, we assessed the relationship between ctHRD levels and treatment response. When focused on the patients with abundant detected ctDNA (Signatera VAF &gt; 20%, <italic>n</italic> = 12), a significant correlation was observed between baseline ctHRD score and continuous time to progression after talazoparib treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>, <italic>r</italic> = 0.61, <italic>P</italic> = 0.037, by Pearson’s method), but correlations with tumor shrinkage were not found to be statistically significant. In contrast, ctHRD scores calculated from progression time points were not significantly associated with time to progression (<italic>r</italic> = 0.38, <italic>P</italic> = 0.22, by Pearson’s method). This could not be accounted for by a decrease in progression VAF, as progression samples had a slight but significant increase in VAF compared to baseline (5.7% ± 10.5% versus 4.9% ± 10.4% (median ± IQR) for progression versus baseline). This indicates that baseline measurement of ctHRD could be considered as a potential biomarker of benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy and that ctHRD scores may evolve during cancer progression or therapy.</p>

We performed an exploratory de novo mutational signature analysis using all collected variants from tumor and ctDNA sequencing for all patients.

Cohort B of the Talazoparib Beyond BRCA trial was specifically assessed by either germline or somatic mutations in a panel of genes associated with HR pathway activity as entry criteria. Our results demonstrate that this may be a useful strategy especially in patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer in whom we report a 31% ORR. These positive results were driven in large part by individuals with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations, as all five breast cancers with this entry criterion (and one pancreatic cancer patient with g<italic>PALB2</italic> and g<italic>BRIP1</italic> mutations) had tumor shrinkage as the best response. Our results were first reported at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2019 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>) and then subsequently corroborated in the recently reported TBCRC 048 Olaparib Expanded study reported at ASCO 2020 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>). In our study, tumors with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations had uniformly high HRD scores, which led to a positive correlation in our cohort between high tumor HRD scores and magnitude of tumor response to talazoparib monotherapy in this setting. In contrast, tumors with other mutations including g<italic>ATM</italic> and g<italic>CHEK2</italic> mutations had LOH, but not increased HRD scores, as predicted by previous laboratory studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. One responding patient had combined mutations including g<italic>FANCA</italic>, g<italic>CHEK2</italic> and s<italic>PTEN</italic> mutations (with LOH for <italic>FANCA</italic>), perhaps highlighting the role of <italic>FANCA</italic> in PARP inhibitor sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

Previous studies have identified that it has a scaffolding function in nucleating a BRCA1–BRCA2 complex, stabilizes BRCA2 protein levels and is required for HR-mediated DNA repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Given this strong scientific rationale, it is perhaps unsurprising that g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations appear to closely phenocopy g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations in conferring sensitivity to PARP inhibition in our study. The functional relevance of g<italic>PALB2</italic> in HR-mediated DNA repair is buttressed by our finding of high HRD scores in tumors from these individuals. In addition, other studies have identified tumors with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations as sensitive to PARP inhibitor therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">PARP inhibitors represent an orally available, well-tolerated, single-agent therapy. The identification of further biomarkers to expand access to this type of treatment to tumors beyond g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>-mutated advanced breast or ovarian cancers would have a meaningful impact for patients otherwise treated with infusional chemotherapies. Our study suggests that breast or pancreatic cancers with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations should be pursued more extensively in larger clinical trials for PARP inhibitor monotherapy. In breast cancer, g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations confer a higher risk of various breast cancer subtypes including hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, in proportions similar to those seen with g<italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Individuals with g<italic>PALB2</italic> mutations have increased risks for breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) of ~3.8–5.0), male breast cancer (OR of ~10) and pancreatic cancer (OR of ~1.5–2.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The elevated risk for ovarian cancer is modest and influenced by familial factors, whereas there are no consistent elevated risks reported for prostate or colorectal cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In our study, the g<italic>PALB2-</italic>associated tumors tended to have LOH and high HRD scores. The HRD assay could be considered as a qualifying biomarker for PARP inhibitor therapy, although further studies are required to determine whether HRD scores independently predict treatment responses beyond targeted mutation sequencing for g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> or g<italic>PALB2</italic>. Additionally, our finding that metastatic biopsies had higher HRD scores than primary tumors may reflect ongoing accumulation of genomic scars in HR-deficient tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. This could suggest a preference of metastatic biopsies for HRD scores in future clinical trials. The use of an HRD score to select patients for PARP inhibitor therapy is currently under study in cohort A of the Talazoparib Beyond BRCA study, specifically in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, although this design could also be contemplated for other tumor types.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Genomic analyses including tumor panel and exome sequencing as well as WES of plasma ctDNA have allowed us to explore additional potential biomarkers of talazoparib response. Among potential biomarkers, we identify a tumor mutational signature prevalent in the g<italic>PALB2</italic> samples and present to a lesser extent in other tumors that correlated with tumor response. This mutational signature strongly resembled the known HRD-associated signature 3, which has been previously attributed to tumors bearing g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations and was also detected in the g<italic>PALB2</italic> samples previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Additionally, we calculated ctHRD scores from baseline plasma samples and found this score to be a potential biomarker for duration of treatment response.

The study protocol was updated to allow for enrollment of non-breast cancer solid tumors.</p>

                <title>Objectives and endpoints</title>
                <p id="Par33">The primary objective was to determine whether single-agent talazoparib can result in a 30% or greater rate of objective response. Secondary objectives included determination of the CBR, PFS and safety. Correlative objectives included comparison of HRD scores in responders versus non-responders and assessment of the concordance of HRD scores in primary versus metastatic tumors. Plasma was prospectively collected at baseline and after progression for exploratory cfDNA assessment. Objective tumor treatment responses were scored by RECIST 1.1 criteria. CBR was defined as CR, PR or SD at ≥ 24 weeks per RECIST v1.1. PFS was evaluated using the Kaplan–Meier method. To assess safety of talazoparib in this study population, adverse events were graded using CTCAE v5 and summarized descriptively.</p>

                <title>Statistics and reproducibility</title>
                <p id="Par34">A two-stage design was used for the enrollment of study participants separately in cohort A and cohort B with a set null hypothesis of ≤ 5% ORR and an alternative response rate of ≥ 30%. Interim analyses were to be performed, separately in each cohort, after accrual of ten response-assessable patients. If at least 2 of the 10 patients responded, then 10 additional patients were to be enrolled for a total of 20 patients in each cohort. Based on our statistical constraints, at least 3 patients of the 20 patients must respond in each cohort to declare statistical significance at a one-sided 5% level with 80% power or better. No data were excluded from the prespecified analyses. There was no treatment randomization; investigators were not blinded to outcome assessments.

                <p id="Par35">Tumors with g<italic>BRCA1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> mutations demonstrate HRD, which can be quantified by the NGS metrics of LOH, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions. Summation of these metrics leads to a combined HRD score (range, 0–100) with higher values indicative of a higher burden of genomic alterations due to HRD, which has been referred to as a ‘genomic scar’ (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>). HRD scores were assessed on FFPE tumor tissues by myChoice HRD CDx assay (Myriad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>). Metastatic biopsy samples were requested, but primary tumor samples were allowed if additional metastatic biopsy was contraindicated or infeasible. NGS of FFPE tumor tissue was performed using a 108-gene panel assay (Myriad). The Signatera assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and ctDNA WES and tumor WES were performed by Natera. WES of the tumor was performed on germline DNA isolated from ten FFPE slides or tissue blocks. Matched normal WES was performed from germline DNA isolated from 1 ml of buffy coat. Signatera was performed according to a standard workflow including design of up to 16-plex patient-specific somatic assays based on tumor–normal WES. Plasma samples from EDTA BCT tubes were processed for cfDNA extraction, library preparation, bespoke multiplex PCR with appropriate Signatera assays, NGS (HiSeq 2500) and analysis. SNP genotype concordance between tissue and normal samples for WES and between normal and plasma samples was verified. Tumor tissue was sequenced to a mean deduplicated coverage of 180× with uniformity of &gt;70% of target bases having &gt;100× deduplicated coverage. Matched normal WES was performed to a mean deduplicated coverage of 50× with a uniformity of &gt;70% of target bases achieving &gt;30× deduplicated coverage. Median-extracted cfDNA metrics were as follows: 16.7 ng ml<sup>-1</sup> of plasma and 44.7 ng total of cfDNA across all 29 plasma samples from 15 patients. WES of plasma ctDNA was performed using a portion of the Signatura libraries. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina Novaseq platform at &gt;200× coverage. Somatic variant calling of pWES was performed by state-of-the-art variant callers accompanied by proprietary filtering approaches. Variants previously reported to be germline in public datasets such as dbSNP and population studies were also filtered out to avoid germline variant selection. Tumor variants were visualized by ComplexHeatmap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. ctHRD was calculated by first deriving allele-specific copy number profiles from pWES with Sequenza<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> followed by scarHRD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Proportional Venn diagrams were created with the BioVenn R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. De novo mutational signatures were calculated with the mutSignatures R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. ggPlot2 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>) was used to generate graphics. All statistical tests are two-sided unless otherwise stated. Data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Data collection and analysis were not performed with blinding to the conditions of the experiments. Data points were not excluded from analysis.</p>
