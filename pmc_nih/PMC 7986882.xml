                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Fewer than half of all people in the USA have a documented advance care plan (ACP). Hospitalisation offers an opportunity for physicians to initiate ACP conversations. Despite expert recommendations, hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) do not routinely engage in these conversations, reserving them for the critically ill.</p>
                  <p>The objective of this study is to test the effect of a novel behavioural intervention on the incidence of ACP conversations by hospitalists practicing at a stratified random sample of hospitals drawn from 220 US acute care hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We developed <italic>Hopewell Hospitalist</italic>, a theory-based adventure video game, to modify physicians' attitudes towards ACP conversations and to increase their motivation for engaging in them. The planned study is a pragmatic stepped-wedge crossover phase III trial, testing the efficacy of <italic>Hopewell Hospitalist</italic> for increasing ACP conversations. We will randomise 40 hospitals to the month (step) in which they receive the intervention. We aim to recruit 30 hospitalists from up to eight hospitals each step to complete the intervention, playing <italic>Hopewell Hospitalist</italic> for at least 2 hours. The primary outcome is ACP billing for patients aged 65 and older managed by participating hospitalists. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase.</p>

            <p>Advance care planning (ACP) is an integral part of the National Academy of Medicine’s objective of ensuring that patients receive person-centred, family-oriented and evidence-based care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> ACP improves the quality of end-of-life care, while reducing unwanted resource utilisation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Unfortunately, fewer than half of all people in the USA have documented ACPs, such as an advance directive.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Existing guidelines therefore advocate that physicians use hospitalisation as an opportunity to initiate these conversations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
            <p>Multiple barriers exist to the initiation of ACP in the hospital.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> High-quality conversations require physicians to have the motivation, skill and time to engage in these emotionally complex interactions. As a result, physicians typically defer ACP for all except the most critically ill. In contrast, experts advocate that these conversations occur prior to discharge for all patients over the age of 65.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Efforts to facilitate ACP through text-based education, reminders, incentives and outreach by opinion leaders have had variable success.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> How best to ensure that physicians meet this standard therefore remains unclear.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref></p>
            <p>We propose a novel intervention to modify physicians' knowledge of and attitudes towards ACP conversations and increase their motivation for engaging in them. The central mechanism is <italic>narrative engagement</italic> (ie, using storytelling to change behaviour).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Stories deliver memorable messages that resonate with recipients in personally relevant and meaningful ways.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Programmes using stories to transmit best-practice decision principles have reduced drug use among middle school students, reduced sexually transmitted diseases among high school students and increased the rates of mammogram acquisition among low-income minority groups.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> We built a customised adventure video game that uses narrative engagement to educate physicians about the benefits of ACP for all patients age 65 and older.</p>
            <p>The objective of the planned study is to test the effect of the video game intervention on ACP rates, measured by billing, among a convenience sample of 150 hospitalists recruited from up to 40 US hospitals staffed by a large, nationwide acute care physician practice with an ongoing ACP quality improvement initiative. We hypothesise that the intervention will increase ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination, and have 80% power to detect a 1% absolute increase and 99% power to detect a 3.5% absolute increase.</p>

                <title>Conceptual framework</title>
                <p>Our population of hospitalists employed by a national physician practice already receive best-practice ACP interventions designed to increase: (1) knowledge of ACP guidelines (through web-based didactic education); (2) identification of patients to prioritise for ACP (through decision support and reminders in the electronic medical record); (3) the influence of social norms (through audit and feedback regarding ACP billing rates compared with hospital peers) and (4) extrinsic motivation (through a financial incentive of $20 for each billed ACP conversation). These efforts have increased ACP substantially over the last 3 years, but rates remain below the standards set by a Delphi panel of experts, who recommend ACP conversations for all inpatients over the age of 65.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 16</xref> Formative work, consistent with behavioural theory, suggested positive attitudes could facilitate ACP; therefore, we chose hospitalists’ attitudes towards ACP conversations as the primary intervention target.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
                <p>To intervene on this target, we refined an existing intervention based on the theory of narrative engagement.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The intervention—an adventure video game—had proven successful at improving physician decision making in trauma triage, without any identifiable adverse consequences.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Strong conceptual reasons existed to believe it would have efficacy in this context.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–23</xref> Finally, in assessing potential harms and benefits associated with this intervention, we relied on a meta-analysis of interventions to increase ACP, which found positive outcomes for patients.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>

                <title>Study overview</title>
                <p>We developed the video game (<italic>Hopewell Hospitalist</italic>) in collaboration with Schell Games (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) through an iterative process involving behavioural scientists, hospitalists, palliative care experts, intensivists and game developers, with the intention of increasing physicians’ frequency of ACP conversations with hospitalised patients. We plan to compare the impact of <italic>Hopewell Hospitalist</italic> on ACP practices before-and-after intervention dissemination in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>A stepped-wedge trial randomises physician participants (and the patients they collectively care for) at the group level (eg, hospital); each group ‘crosses over’ from control to intervention at a randomised timepoint and is followed through multiple ‘time steps’ of data collection.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This trial design is the best option to test the efficacy of the video game because: (1) physician-level randomisation risks misclassifying patients, contaminating control physicians and failing to address group-level attitudes to and practices of ACP; (2) a two-group parallel cluster randomised design risks imbalance among groups, especially if relatively few hospitals participate in the study, because of the high intraclass correlation (ICC) that exists for ACP billing at the hospital level and (3) there are logistical challenges to rolling out the intervention simultaneously at all hospitals.</p>
                <p>We will use a stepped-wedge design with five steps (with each step lasting 1 month), and will compare the difference in ACP billing of physicians enrolled in the trial in the time period before and after intervention dissemination. A preperiod of 3 months duration will yield retrospectively measured observations that augment the analysis data. Drawing on more than 3 years of data, inclusive of the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2017–June 2020), organisation-wide ACP billing rates for patients 65 and older increased from 5% to 22%, corresponding to a 1.5% absolute quarterly increase. We hypothesise that physicians will have a 5% absolute increase (a 3.5% net increase) in ACP billing in the quarter after dissemination of the intervention (primary outcome).</p>

                  <title>Study setting</title>
                  <p>We partnered with a national physician practice that employs acute care providers in hospital medicine, emergency medicine and critical care. This physician practice: (1) staffs over 200 hospitals with a wide variety of geographical and organisational characteristics, increasing the generalisability of our observations; (2) has already implemented best-practice quality improvement efforts to improve ACP practices at its hospitals, making our comparator enhanced usual care and (3) seeks to further increase ACP rates, increasing organisational buy-in.</p>

                  <title>Hospital sampling</title>
                  <p>We will sample hospitals staffed by the physician practice using the following inclusion criteria: at least two quarters of contracting with the practice, a risk-adjusted ACP billing rate &gt;0% in Q2 of 2020, agreement of physician leaders within the hospital to participate and availability of an onsite, practice-employed, nurse liaison to collect secondary outcome measures.</p>
                  <p>Once a hospital is sampled, we will recruit hospitalists at the hospital by distributing email invitations. Eligible hospitalists are those employed by the practice for at least two quarters. We will obtain consent from interested physicians, collect baseline demographical and professional characteristics, as well as initial baseline measurements of attitudes towards ACP, then provide them with instructions on how to complete study tasks. A full list of the study sites will be published with the study results.</p>

                  <p>We will randomise sampled hospitals to the order in which they receive the video game. We will generate randomisation schemas using R statistical software (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), using random block sizes of 8, seeking to balance hospital risk-adjusted ACP rate, change in ACP rate between Quarter 2 2019 and Quarter 1 2020, practice size (number of practice-employed hospitalists) at the hospital and region. Although we cannot blind study personnel and participants, we will mask the hospital’s assignment during the analysis phase.</p>

                <p>We will preload new iPads with the video game and mail them to hospitalist participants. We will ask participants to spend a minimum of 2 hours completing the intervention task, and then complete a web-based questionnaire with items assessing (a) the intervention’s usability, (b) fidelity of intervention delivery and receipt and (c) mediators of intervention receipt. Completing the questionnaire will take approximately 15 min. Participants should complete the two portions of the study protocol within 2 weeks of receipt of the iPad. They will keep the iPad as an honorarium (approximate value $300). Reminders will include three email letters and a phone call, made by the study principal investigator (AEB). Participants will continue to receive all usual care ACP interventions, mandated by the practice, throughout the study period.</p>

                    <p>Our primary outcome will be the patient-level binary variable indicating whether an ACP bill occurred during their hospitalisation. The study sample will be restricted to patients over the age of 65 before-and-after dissemination of the video game intervention: each hospital will contribute a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 8 months of data while exposed to the intervention arm and the reverse (between 8 to 3 months) to the enhanced usual care arm depending on their step (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). We will screen the practice’s discharge abstracts for the presence/absence of ACP charges (billing codes 99497 and 99498) and will categorise each patient as having had (or not had) an ACP conversation during their hospitalisation. The rationale for using ACP billing as the primary outcome is: (1) it can be obtained administratively for all patients and (2) it is a less sensitive but more specific measure of a comprehensive ACP conversation than the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) self-report measure of ACP because it is a time-based billing code requiring an ACP conversation of at least 16 min in length.</p>

                    <p>Secondary measures of physician ACP behaviour will include a self-report measure and a chart-abstraction based measure. We will collect each physicians' self-report MIPS ACP quality measure (the proportion of patients who have an ACP or surrogate decision maker documented in the medical record (or declined to participate in the process) of all patients 65 years and older treated by the physician). Additionally, practice nurse liaisons will provide a 20% random sample of the charts of eligible patients. We will review these charts for documentation of a conversation about ACP. This will allow estimation of the sensitivity and specificity of claims-based and MIPS-based measurement of ACP relative to chart review.</p>
                    <p>Secondary measures of patient outcomes (ie, downstream consequences of intervention enactment) will include: disposition status, in-hospital mortality, 90-day mortality and resource utilisation during the index hospitalisation. Index hospital outcomes will be drawn from the practice’s data; post-discharge 90-day episode-based outcomes will be drawn from linked CMS and SSA data.</p>

                  <p>Next, we will compare ACP billing proportions for the period before and after intervention distribution among enrolled physicians using a Student’s t-test.</p>
                  <p>To test the efficacy of the intervention, we will fit a mixed effects patient-level logistic regression model for patients treated by physicians enrolled in the trial (ie, physicians who were sent an iPad with the game during the intervention period), with presence of ACP billing during the hospitalisation as the dependent variable. Since the linkage of a patient to a specific physician is inexact, we do not involve physician attribution in our primary outcome analysis. Instead the key predictor will be a time-varying variable indicating whether the patient received care—as measured by daily billing—by a hospitalist who consented to receive the intervention before (0) or after (1) the hospital was randomised to intervention roll-out. The model includes dummy variables for time-period to absorb trends across time and random-effects for hospital to account for the clustering of observations within hospitals. In addition, we will adjust for patient and hospital covariates hypothesised to influence the likelihood of an ACP conversation (eg, cancer diagnosis).</p>
                  <p>A range of dependent variables are analysed in the secondary analyses. In analyses that involve physician variables, the mixed-effects generalised linear model will be extended from a two-level model to a three-level model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental appendix</xref> for details) for ACP billing. We will also test the efficacy of the intervention on secondary outcome measures, and the effect of mediators and moderators on the effect of the intervention. We will account for multiple comparisons when reporting analyses of secondary outcomes.</p>

                <title>Human subjects and power calculation</title>
                <p>We arrived at our sample size using a combination of feasibility (cost) and assumptions regarding effect size, absence of any pilot data about the latter. For each step, we plan to recruit 25 –30 physicians from 4 to 8 hospitals. Assuming a baseline ACP rate of 22% (rising by 1.5 percentage points per quarter), a hospital ICC coefficient of 0.01–0.10, and 160 evaluable patients per physician quarter, we can detect between a 1 percentage-point absolute difference with a power of 80% and a 3.5 percentage-point absolute difference with power of 99% using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level between ACP billing rates before and after the distribution of the intervention.</p>
                <p>The method of computing power for this stepped-wedge design follows the commonly used strategy for cluster randomised trials of first determining the design effect, which can be thought of as a measure of the inefficiency of the given design in comparison to a completely randomised design that is expressed in terms of a ratio of the sample sizes needed to obtain equally precise estimates and then applying conventional power calculations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplemental appendix</xref>).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref></p>

              <p>We designed the protocol to complement best practices in system-level QI initiatives. We struggled with three design challenges, which we resolved both by reviewing the existing literature and through iterative consensus when data did not exist. First, we debated the unit of randomisation. We considered and then rejected physician-level randomisation for both conceptual and pragmatic reasons. Conceptually, shift-based hospital physicians practice collaboratively, so that the work flow of one individual can have important implications for colleagues’ role responsibilities. As we considered peer effects, we imagined that, on one end of the spectrum, unexposed physicians might also shift their practice patterns, and, on the other hand, exposed physicians might be pulled back to conform to group norms. Either scenario risks biassing results towards the null if physicians are the unit of randomisation. Pragmatically, patients (particularly the sickest ones) may have contact with multiple physicians during the course of one hospitalisation. Consequently, physician-level randomisation risks the misclassification of patients. In contrast, hospital-level randomisation alleviates these concerns, although it decreases power (due to increasing within-cluster correlation) and increases the complexity of ensuring adherence to the intervention.</p>
              <p>Second, we debated how to deliver the intervention. We decided to deliver the intervention using the platform of a video game to encourage utilisation and to harness the power of narrative engagement to stimulate behaviour change. Although potentially more enjoyable than standard didactic text-based CME, it does not rise to the level of entertainment. To further incentivise participation and engagement, we decided to deliver the game preloaded on a new iPad. In prior work, we found providing a fixed material honorarium (ie, an iPad) produced adherence rates of up to 80%.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We considered, but rejected, alternative strategies of distributing the intervention, including requesting that physicians download the game onto personal devices or using refurbished iPads. Providing an honorarium to promote adherence restricts the use of the intervention to the research setting, but maximises the fidelity of the intervention delivery and receipt across participants.</p>
              <p>Third, we debated how to assess the impact of the intervention. Direct observation has the greatest validity but limited feasibility. Review of charts or electronic health records provide an alternative. Although dependent on the quality of physician documentation, this method allows for the evaluation of a larger number of physicians. However, the resources and time required to abstract charts would limit our ability to detect small (although significant) effect sizes. We therefore opted to use billing proportions as our primary outcome measure. In 2016, CMS rolled out a time-based billing code for ACP conversations held in the hospital. We anticipate that the use of billing codes will bias our results towards the null and plan to perform secondary analyses using alternative methods of measuring ACP practices to test the validity of our primary analyses.</p>
              <p>Advances in technology hold the potential to transform the means by which behavioural and social science interventions are delivered. They ensure treatment fidelity and can extend treatment duration, thus improving behavioural maintenance. We have developed one such behavioural intervention to encourage hospital-based physicians to initiate ACP conversations for hospitalised older adults, and plan to test its efficacy. We intend that results of this trial will contribute to the literature on physician QI and the efficacy of video games as behavioural interventions.</p>
