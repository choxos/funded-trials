                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">There is conflict regarding the benefits of greater amounts of intensive upper limb rehabilitation in the early period post-stroke. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of providing intensive therapy during the early period post-stroke and to develop a randomized control trial that is currently in process. Specifically, the study investigated whether an additional 8 h of specialized, intensive (200–300 separate hand or arm movements per hour) virtual reality (VR)/robotic based upper limb training introduced within 1-month post-stroke resulted in greater improvement in impairment and behavior, and distinct changes in cortical reorganization measured via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), compared to that of a control group.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Seven subjects received 8–1 h sessions of upper limb VR/robotic training in addition to their inpatient therapy (PT, OT, ST). Six subjects only received their inpatient therapy. All were tested on measures of impairment [Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UEFMA), Wrist AROM, Maximum Pinch Force], behavior [Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)], and also received TMS mapping until 6 months post training. ANOVAs were conducted to measure differences between groups across time for all outcome measures. Associations between changes in ipsilesional cortical maps during the early period of enhanced neuroplasticity and long-term changes in upper limb impairment and behavior measures were evaluated.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The VR/robotic group made significantly greater improvements on UEFMA and Wrist AROM scores compared to the usual care group. There was also less variability in the association between changes in the First Dorsal Interosseus (FDI) muscle map area and WMFT and Maximum Force change scores for the VR/robotic group.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">An additional 8 h of intensive VR/robotic based upper limb training initiated within the first month post-stroke may promote greater gains in impairment compared to usual care alone. Importantly, the data presented demonstrated the feasibility of conducting this intervention and multiple outcome measures (impairment, behavioral, neurophysiological) in the early period post-stroke.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par8">Approximately 795,000 new or recurrent strokes occur each year in the United States and the prevalence of chronic stroke is approximately seven million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is a leading cause of adult long-term disability in the United States with the financial burden of related care among the fastest-growing expenses for Medicare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Proportionally more stroke survivors are left with upper extremity impairment and disability than that of the lower extremity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. At 6 months post-stroke only 5–20% achieve full return of arm function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is thus imperative to develop and test innovative upper extremity training protocols that are based on sound principles of motor learning, and also to compare changes in impairments, behavior, and brain organization to help identify the neural substrates of recovery.</p>
              <p id="Par9">There is a time-limited period of unique neuroplasticity post ischemic stroke that lasts about one to 3 months in humans. This plasticity mediates spontaneous biological recovery and produces enhanced responsiveness to rehabilitative interventions introduced during that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is believed that during this time of unique plasticity, impairment based recovery is maximal and is mediated from both of these related processes - spontaneous recovery and enhanced responsiveness to training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, it would be logical to assume that additional hours of intensive training initiated within the acute and early sub-acute period post-stroke (acute: 1–7 days post, early sub-acute: second week - 3 months post [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) would interact with this distinct type of plasticity and result in better outcomes compared to conventional rehabilitative care. Careful review of the literature suggests that the relationship may not be so straightforward. For example, a 2014 meta-analysis found a positive relationship between increased therapy time and clinical measures of function and impairment overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, other individual studies (including a large randomized controlled trial (RCT)), and a sub-analysis from a 2004 review, that have focused on therapy within this early phase, and specifically compared higher amounts of upper limb therapy to lower amounts, found no statistically significant benefit of higher amounts of intervention on different outcomes measured at varied time points post training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, an influential study by Dromerick et al. found that 3 h of Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) led to worse outcomes on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) - [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] when compared to 2 h of CIMT or 2 h of conventional occupational therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Mechanisms of neuroplasticity such as the formation of new synaptic connections with concomitant modification in the cortical excitability and somatotopic remapping can be positively influenced by training methods that are developed from established principles of motor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study presented here was performed to determine feasibility, and to help develop a large scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) that we are currently conducting at a nationally recognized rehabilitation center [(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT03569059)]. Specifically, the research was formulated to help fill a gap in the literature by testing whether gains in upper limb impairment and behavior are greater if an additional 8 h of intensive, motor learning based VR/robotic training (VR group) is provided during the first month post-stroke compared to usual care alone (UC group). The VR/robotic system enables 200–300 activity based hand and arm movements per hour of training. This volume is necessary to elicit neuroplastic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and is much greater than the average of 40.64 (32.14) repetitions per session provided by conventional rehabilitation in similar settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Bilateral cortical reorganization was evaluated via changes in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) induced maps.</p>
              <p id="Par11">In contrast to trends in the literature, we hypothesized that participants in the VR/robotic training group would demonstrate greater gains on both impairment (assessed with the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment - UEFMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], wrist active range of motion – Wrist AROM, and Maximum Pinch Force) and behavioral measures (assessed with the Wolf Motor Function Test - WMFT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) compared to the UC group due to preferential effects of the VR/robotic training on the unique plasticity occurring during the first month post-stroke.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Topographic patterns of reorganization of the corticospinal system can be quantified using TMS induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to assay the integrity of the sensorimotor cortex representation of arm and hand muscles. Although some studies using TMS mapping to track ipsilesional motor reorganization over the first months to 1 year following stroke have indicated that increased excitable areas in the ipsilesional hemisphere are associated with recovery of the upper limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], other studies have found no change in ipsilesional excitable area over the same period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This contradiction of findings is part of a larger current controversy over the interpretation of M1 reorganization as it relates to recovery. Further research is necessary to better understand the complex relationship between effector specific M1 reorganization, amenability of the effector to training, and behavioral and impairment based gains. To date, we know of only two studies that have sought to quantify the neuroplastic changes (via TMS mapping) evoked by an intervention in this same early stage following stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Results from Boake et al. (2007) indicated that an increased number of MEP-active sites in the ipsilesional hemisphere was associated with increased functional improvement in individuals receiving CIMT compared to controls receiving usual care. In contrast, Platz et al. (2005) did not find any change in the number of active sites in their two treatment groups (Bobath or Impairment Oriented Arm Training). We surmised that if greater impairment and behavioral-based gains in the VR group is attributed to bolstering neuroplastic changes that normally occur during this time period, the VR/robotic training would be associated with a greater expansion in ipsilesional M1 hand muscle representations (measured via TMS) compared to the hand muscle territory measured in the UC group (which would be reflective of neuroplastic changes attributed to spontaneous mechanisms and usual care).</p>

The Haptic MASTER is an admittance-controlled robot with six degrees of freedom. A three-dimensional force sensor measures the external force exerted by the user on the robot.

This training system can be readily adapted in terms of speed, accuracy, amount of assistance provided by the robots, and the ratio of patient movement amplitude to avatar movement amplitude. The treatment group performed three simulations for the hand, and three for the arm - training approximately 10 min on each of the six simulations during each session. Each training simulation was designed to use an activity to address an impairment commonly experienced by persons with stroke. The hand simulations consisted of the games: Monkey Business, Space Pong, and Piano Trainer. Their forearm was supported on a table during these hand activities.

                  <p id="Par25">Surface electromyographic activity (EMG, Delsys Trigno, at 2 kHz) was recorded to measure the MEPs elicited by TMS. EMG was recorded from 5 hand muscles contralateral to the stimulation side: first dorsal interosseus [FDI], abductor pollis brevis [APB], abductor digiti minimi [ADM], flexor digitorum superficialis [FDS], and the extensor digitorum communis [EDC]. Motion of the contralateral arm was limited during TMS mapping by securing the arm and hand in a splint and via verbal cueing. To ensure spatial TMS precision for the repeated assessments, each subject’s head was coregistered to a canonical high-resolution anatomical MRI for frameless neuronavigation (Advanced Neuro Technology). All TMS measures were taken at rest and background EMG was monitored to ensure that muscles remained relaxed. The TMS coil (Magstim, 70 mm double coil) was held tangential to the scalp, with the handle held posteriorly and at 45° off the sagittal plane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. MEPs were sampled until the location with the largest MEP was determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This method affords high intra- and inter-experimenter reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], has been cross-validated with fMRI, and is robust in identifying the location of greatest activation for a given muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

A 7x7cm area surrounding the motor hotspot was marked using the neuronavigation software to provide consistent map boundaries. One hundred and fifty TMS pulses were delivered at a 4 s interstimulus interval within the grid boundaries with special attention paid to regions surrounding the hotspot territory. Real time feedback of multi-muscle MEPs and neuronavigated coil position was used to maximize the map information obtained by increasing the density of points in excitable and the ‘hotspot’ region while giving less attention in far-away non-responsive areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Mapping procedures were conducted for both the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres.

                <title>TMS maps of cortical representation</title>
                <p id="Par30">Six individuals in the VR and 5 in the UC group met the inclusion criteria for TMS mapping. TMS maps of the cortical representation of five hand muscles (FDI, APB, ADM, FDS, EDC) were obtained bilaterally in these individuals. The maps representing the FDI muscle are presented here (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The ispilesional cortical area representing the FDI muscle in both treatment groups was reduced compared to the contralesional side at PRE. The ipsilesional TMS map area for the FDI muscle increased from PRE to POST and POST to 1M(significant for both study groups, at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for PRE to 1M) with a non-significant reduction in size from 1M to 6M for both groups. There was no difference between groups over time ipsilesionally. Contralesional area for the FDI muscle monotonically increased from PRE to 6M in the UC group. Conversely, in the VR group, contralesional area decreased from PRE to 1M and then increased from 1M to 6M.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of ipsilesional and contralesional TMS maps for the FDI muscle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12984_2019_563_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par31">The association between PRE to 1M changes in ipsilesional FDI area and PRE to 6M changes in Maximum Pinch Force and WMFT scores for both treatment groups was evaluated via scatter plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Of the four outcome measures, these two were chosen as the FDI muscle is required to pinch the index and thumb together (as measured by the Maximum Pinch Force test), and five of the fifteen WMFT items require FDI muscle usage. Statistical correlation analysis was not conducted due to the small sample sizes. PRE to 1M TMS induced map changes were chosen as we wanted to capture expansion during the enhanced period of neuroplasticity. PRE to 6M changes in outcomes were chosen as we wanted to evaluate the association between cortical reorganization during the critical, early period and long-term changes in impairment and behavior.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Association between change in 1M-PRE FDI area and change in 6M-PRE Pinch force and WMFT scores</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12984_2019_563_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par32">This feasibility study, initiated within 1 month post-stroke, was performed to aid in the development of a large scale RCT that we are currently conducting [(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT03569059)]. Specifically, we compared an additional 8 h of intensive VR/robotic based upper limb training to conventional therapy. There is enhanced neuroplasticity during this early time post-stroke which is proposed to interact with training and thus lead to enhanced recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, there have been contradictory results from studies evaluating additional therapy provided during this time. Our approach is distinguished from previous approaches in that it provides a unique combination of focused, high intensity, and progressive training that facilitates a repeatable trajectory. Specifically, this system provides 200–300 upper extremity movements per hour of training which has been proposed to enhance neuroplasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Based on this, we hypothesized that gains in upper limb impairment and behavior in our VR group would be greater than our UC group. We feel that the differences between the two groups in PRE to 6M change scores suggest that the hypothesis may be correct and warrants larger scale examination. Specifically, PRE to 6M change scores were significantly greater for the VR group for UEFMA scores [F(1,11) = 5.83, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.346], and Wrist AROM scores [F(1,9) = 5.342, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.372]. Notably, 6/7 of the VR subjects surpassed the MCID for the UEFMA during the training period compared to only 2/6 of the UC group. In this pilot set, improvements in PRE to 6M change scores were not siginifcantly different between groups for the WMFT, WMFT items performed, and Maximum Pinch Force. However, we were encouraged that the VR group could perform an average of 2 items more on the WMFT compared to the UC group from PRE to 6M. The ability to perform an item within 120 s at a post-test that a participant was previously unable to perform at baseline has been cited as a clinically meaningful change in persons with stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Current evidence indicates that ipsilesional M1 excitation may be important for functional improvement of the upper limb post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that enhanced long-term gains in impairment and behavior in the VR group would be associated with greater expansion in TMS based ipsilesional cortical hand representations. For the map representations, our results showed that at PRE, the cortical representation area for the FDI muscle in both groups was reduced on the ipsilesional side compared to the contralesional side. This decreased area representing the more affected hand before therapy reflects a reduced excitability of the motor cortex in the ipsilesional hemisphere that may be the result of the infarct itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Subsequently, in both groups, there was an increase in ipsilesional map size from PRE to POST, and again from POST to 1M, with a decrease thereafter. Boake et al. (2007) found a similar finding at PRE, as well as the pattern of enlargement in the ipsilesional hemisphere from PRE to POST. The reduction in area size from 1M to 6M may represent central focalization as movement stabilizes and recovery starts to plateau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In contrast to our hypothesis, there were no differences between the two groups in the pattern of change for the FDI muscle representation. Statistical correlations between ipsilesional map changes and long-term changes in outcomes were not possible at this time due to small sample sizes, however associations were less variable for both the WMFT and Maximum Pinch Force scores for the VR group compared to the UC group. Larger sample sizes from the RCT will allow for a more objective evaluation of these associations.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p id="Par34">We recognize that a limitation in presenting any feasibility work is a small sample size. This precluded our ability to perform statistical correlations between TMS map changes and clinical measures. Nonetheless, this data was invaluable to develop our current RCT. As an example, for the behavioral outcome WMFT, a power analysis using these results (with an alpha of 0.05 and an estimated power of 0.8) determined that a sample size of 25 subjects would be needed in each group to show a significant difference between groups in PRE to 6M change scores. Similar analyses, as well as the effect sizes from this data, were used to determine the sample sizes for the different study arms of the current RCT, and to justify an increase in the amount of additional hours of training provided from eight to ten. Another limitation of the study was that this was a non-randomized design. However, all baseline demographic and outcome measures were statistically similar between the two groups thus eliminating potential selection bias. Additionally, although highly precise equipment was used to measure Maximum Pinch Force and Wrist AROM, a formal assessement of the reliability of our measurement technique was not conducted. Thus our method for obtaining these values could potentially have some measurement error. That being said, the same person obtained these measures throughout and followed the same set protocol at each test session to improve measurement consistency. We also plan to formally evaluate these measurement techniques during the RCT. Lastly, TMS maps for more proximal arm muscles (wrist and elbow) were not obtained with the first few subjects. This limited our ability to adequately evaluate associations between UEFMA and Wrist AROM scores and proximal TMS based muscle representations. These limitations were also addressed during the development of the RCT. Barring these limitations, the data we present here nevertheless demonstrates feasibility of conducting this intervention and multiple outcome measures (impairment, behavioral, neurophysiological) in this relatively fragile patient population, and helps guide our predictions about future results.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par35">This feasibility study initiated in the acute and early sub-acute period post-stroke compared an additional 8 h of specialized and intensive VR/robotic training to conventional rehabilitation. Long-term gains in impairment reflected by UEFMA and Wrist AROM PRE to 6M change scores was enhanced in the VR group. These greater changes in the VR group were not paralleled with augmented changes in ipsilesional FDI muscle cortical organization that were unique to this group, as similar patterns of change were demonstrated in the UC group as well. Associations between PRE to 1M change scores in ipsilesional FDI area representation and PRE to 6M change scores for the WMFT and Maximum Pinch Force measures were less variable in the VR group.</p>
