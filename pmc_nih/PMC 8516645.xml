                <p id="Par1">Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are currently under development to treat and prevent HIV-1 infection. We performed a single-center, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, placebo-controlled trial of a single administration of the HIV-1 V3-glycan-specific antibody PGT121 at 3, 10 and 30 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> in HIV-uninfected adults and HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART), as well as a multicenter, open-label trial of one infusion of PGT121 at 30 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> in viremic HIV-infected adults not on ART (no. NCT02960581). The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and antiviral activity in viremic HIV-infected adults not on ART. The secondary endpoints were changes in anti-PGT121 antibody titers and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count, and development of HIV-1 sequence variations associated with PGT121 resistance. Among 48 participants enrolled, no treatment-related serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases or Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported. The most common reactions among PGT121 recipients were intravenous/injection site tenderness, pain and headache. Absolute and relative CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts did not change following PGT121 infusion in HIV-infected participants. Neutralizing anti-drug antibodies were not elicited. PGT121 reduced plasma HIV RNA levels by a median of 1.77 log in viremic participants, with a viral load nadir at a median of 8.5 days. Two individuals with low baseline viral loads experienced ART-free viral suppression for ≥168 days following antibody infusion, and rebound viruses in these individuals demonstrated full or partial PGT121 sensitivity. The trial met the prespecified endpoints. These data suggest that further investigation of the potential of antibody-based therapeutic strategies for long-term suppression of HIV is warranted, including in individuals off ART and with low viral load.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Human immunodeficiency virus-1-specific broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) that target the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein are currently under development as potential tools to treat and prevent HIV-1 infection. Several bNAbs have been tested to date in HIV-1-infected individuals, including the CD4-binding, site-specific antibodies VRC01, 3BNC117, VRC07-523LS and N6-LS, the V3-glycan-specific antibody 10–1074 and the V2-apex-specific antibodies PGDM1400 and CAP256-VRC26.25 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>). These bNAbs (alone or in combination) have been shown to decrease plasma HIV RNA levels by 1–2 log in viremic, HIV-1-infected participants not on ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In these studies, bNAb resistance emerged in nearly all treated participants who received monotherapy, but in two notable cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> the repeated administration of a combination of two bNAbs in the setting of viremia maintained viral suppression for 3 months without development of resistance to either antibody. bNAbs have also been shown to delay viral rebound in HIV-1-infected participants on ART who were undergoing analytical treatment interruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether a single bNAb given once can maintain viral suppression longer than 3 months without the development of resistance.</p>
              <p id="Par4">PGT121 is a monoclonal antibody isolated in 2011 from an African donor infected with HIV-1 subtype A, whose sera had demonstrated superior neutralization breadth and potency in an observational cohort, and so was considered an ‘elite neutralizer’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. PGT121 targets a V3-glycan-dependent site on HIV-1 Env<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par10">Thirteen HIV-infected participants not on ART were enrolled, all with a HIV-1 viral load at screening of between 100 and &lt;2,000 copies ml<sup>–1</sup> (low-viral-load group, <italic>n</italic> = 4) or between 2,000 and 100,000 copies ml<sup>–1</sup> (high-viral-load group, <italic>n</italic> = 9; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). HIV-1 pseudoviruses constructed from plasma single-genome amplification of circulating viruses were tested for bNAb sensitivity by TZM-bl assay at baseline, with 8 of 13 participants (61.5%) demonstrating full sensitivity to PGT121 at baseline (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), consistent with in vitro predictions of 59% sensitivity against 159 clade B viruses (CATNAP data; <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">Supplementary material</xref>). Of note, 6 of 13 participants demonstrated either complete or partial levels of resistance (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 1 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>) to at least two bNAbs of different epitope specificity at baseline, demonstrating the prevalence of multi-bNAb resistance during chronic infection (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par11">In the high-viral-load group, the median viral load at day 0 was 21,040 (interquartile range (IQR) = 9,660–28,990). Following a single IV infusion of PGT121 at 30 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), four participants with PGT121 sensitivity and high viral load at baseline showed a decrease in viral load of 1.28–2.14 log (median 1.77 log), with a viral load nadir at 7–10 days (median 8.5 days), before viral load increased back to baseline by day 28. Rebound viruses isolated at this time point demonstrated PGT121 resistance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The three participants with complete baseline PGT121 resistance had no change in viral load compared to baseline following PGT121 infusion, while participants with a mix of sensitive and relatively resistant viral variants had brief dips in viral load (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Notably, baseline virus sensitivity to PGT121 significantly correlated with the maximum drop in viral load observed following infusion (Kendall’s <italic>τ</italic> = −0.64, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0023), as well as with faster decline in viral load (Kendall’s <italic>τ</italic> = 0.60, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0092) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4a,c</xref>).

Following a single IV infusion of PGT121 at 30 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), all four participants had a decrease in viral load to &lt;40 copies ml<sup>–1</sup> (lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) of assay) by day 7.

                <title>Pathways to PGT121 resistance</title>
                <p id="Par14">There were several distinct viral evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of PGT121 resistance following treatment. Three participants (2305, 7190 and 2936) demonstrated selection of a single resistant sequence variant, which emerged in a single lineage from more diverse baseline sequences (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In these participants, loss of glycan N332 was associated with complete resistance to PGT121, consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For all other participants, PGT121 resistance was associated with more complex patterns of viral escape involving multiple resistance mutations (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref>–<xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) and multiple phylogenetic lineages (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Resistance was mainly conferred by removal of the glycan at 332 (mutations at 332 and/or 334) but, in a few cases, also by mutations at site 325 in the GDIR motif located within Env V3 loop positions 324–327, a region critical for binding to the coreceptor CCR5 (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>) as well as V3 glycan bNAbs, and a well-established PGT121 resistance site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For example in participants 2990 and 4236, PGT121-resistant viruses had Asn at 325 (D325N) and Lys at 325 (D325K), respectively, while retaining the glycan at N332. Rebound viruses from participants 6292 and 7190 showed resistance mutations at both 332/334 and 325. For participant 2319, a resistance pattern was observed where one amino acid change introduced a glycan at position N413 (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The close structural proximity to glycan N33220 suggests that this modification is a candidate for driving of PGT121 resistance.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Eleven (11) of the 13 viremic participants had evidence of recombination in rebound viruses and, in two of these, recombination was shown to impact the acquisition of resistance to PGT121. Participant 6292 had highly diverse resistance signatures following PGT121 treatment, with multiple escape variants in both the D325 site (D to N, E or K) and the glycosylation sequon at N332 (NIS to either DIS or NIN), and different combinations of resistance mutations at the two sites were found. Most of the complex resistance forms in this participant were recombinants (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Participant 2990 had a single resistance mutation that emerged after PGT121 treatment, D325N. All of the viruses sampled following treatment carried D325N and were identified as recombinants. These viruses were relatively diverse, suggesting that the resistance mutation was moving through the quasispecies via recombination (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par16">We sequenced viruses from the two patients with long-term, antibiotic-mediated suppression at very late time points after virus rebound, at day 252 and beyond (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). For participant 1536, some rebound viruses retained sensitivity to PGT121 while others were completely resistant; the phylogenetic tree suggests that the re-emerging sensitive forms were very closely related to a baseline lineage (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Viruses from participant 6113 were sensitive both before and after treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par17">While for most participants PGT121 resistance was accompanied by 10–1074 resistance, for participants 2990 and 2319, PGT121-resistant viruses remained highly sensitive to 10–1074 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Only one participant acquired resistance to a neutralizing antibody with an unrelated target, either PGDM1400 (a V2 antibody) or 3BNC117 (a CD4bs antibody), following administration of PGT121 (a V3 antibody) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Participant 2319 developed full resistance to PGDM1400, which was probably carried along when the virus selected for PGT121 resistance during treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par18">Building on previously established methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we developed a viral dynamic model for bNAb-mediated control of HIV-1 infection and fit it to viral load data from viremic patients in this study. Our model accurately fits the viral load data and makes predictions about the temporal dynamics of sensitive and resistant populations (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). For example, in some participants, such as 2305, 2936 and 2990, the model predicted that a resistant population pre-exists, drives viral load rebound back to baseline and persists as the dominant population until the end of the observation period at day 56 (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). For both long-term controllers, 1536 and 6113, the model predicts that both sensitive and resistant populations are exquisitely controlled by PGT121 initially, and that the loss of control is due to an increase in the resistant population as antibody pressure wanes. However, ultimately the resistant population is replaced by a PGT121-sensitive population, possibly due to the lower replicative fitness of the resistant population (note, replicative fitness of isolated viruses was not tested in this study). The replacement by PGT121-sensitive virus after decay of PGT121 in serum was also seen for patient 6292.</p>

To explore whether this potential vaccinal effect may have contributed to the long-term, antibiotic-mediated suppression observed for participants 6113 and 1536, we evaluated HIV-1-specific T-cell magnitude, breadth and functionality at baseline and at day 84.

Furthermore, no expansion of T-cell breadth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>)—as determined by the number of IFN-γ-secreting T cells recognizing peptide subpools across Gag and Pol proteins—was observed. We also investigated whether PGT121 had any immunomodulatory effect in the group of HIV-infected participants on ART with stably suppressed viral load (Group 2).

Notably, two out of four individuals with a low viral load at baseline demonstrated drug-free viral suppression for ≥168 days following a single infusion of PGT121. For these two participants, viral rebound occurred only when PGT121 was no longer detectable in serum, and their rebound viruses still demonstrated full or partial PGT121 sensitivity. ART-free viral load suppression ≥168 days has not previously been reported in the literature following one dose of an individual or combined bNAb treatment for HIV.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Consistent with previous studies, PGT121 monotherapy in 11 out of 13 HIV-infected viremic participants led to the emergence of PGT121 resistance and rebound back to baseline viral loads by day 28. Among the 12 individuals that displayed at least partial resistance to PGT121 following treatment, resistance could be readily explained in 11 by loss of the glycan at N332 (in seven participants), the loss of the D325 (two participants) or the loss of both N332 and D325 (two participants). In two participants (6292 and 2990), the loss of the D325 form was probably propagated due to recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). One participant (6113) had viruses that were sensitive to PGT121 both before and after treatment; this individual maintained drug-free viral suppression through their day 168 visit, and rebound was detected at their next visit on day 252. For this individual it is possible that resistance was never elicited, though it is also possible that resistant viruses might have emerged after day 168 but had already been replaced by a more fit form by the time sampling was performed at day 252.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The simultaneous emergence of many distinct forms of resistance suggests that these variants may have been present at baseline, either at a low frequency in circulating strains or in the latent reservoir, and selection imposed by the PGT121 antibody rapidly revealed the pre-existing complexity among posttreatment samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A hypothesis consistent with these data is that participants may have had a previous antibody response that targeted the V3 epitope region, the virus escaped, the antibody response waned and a more fit PGT121-sensitive form came to dominate the circulating virus quasispecies. These data, together with our observation that PGT121 resistance caused resistance to other bNAbs in only one out of 12 participants, underscore the importance of combining bNAbs that target distinct and nonoverlapping epitopes in future studies for HIV treatment or prevention.</p>
              <p id="Par23">While both PGT121 and 10–1074 bind to carbohydrate-dependent epitopes on V3, previous data suggested that PGT121 might have a higher threshold to resistance than 10–1074 due to more promiscuous binding to heterogeneous N-glycan compositions on HIV-1 envelope spikes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. We did not observe such a higher threshold for PGT121 in our study. Three participants (2305, 7190 and 2936) developed complete resistance to both PGT121 and 10–1074 associated with loss of glycan N332, and two participants (2990 and 2319) developed complete resistance to PGT121 but remained highly sensitive to 10–1074 (Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). These data suggest that there may be additional differences in the binding properties of these two antibodies that could account for varying resistance patterns in rebound viruses.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Of note, our analysis of pathways to resistance following PGT121 administration is limited by the fact that we were able to measure only those viruses that were found in the circulation at the specific time point of the blood-draw, and this sample probably does not represent the entirety of viral quasispecies present in the participant. Nevertheless, these are the viruses that dominate in peripheral blood pre- and post-bNAb treatment, driving the infection.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Previous studies have explored whether bNAb treatment for HIV may induce a so-called vaccinal effect, whereby the administration of the bNAb enhances host immune responses and leads to better viral control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To investigate this hypothesis, we investigated whether our two participants with long-term suppression had any change in their cellular immune responses. We found that there was no increase in magnitude, phenotype or activation and exhaustion status in either participant following bNAb administration. Our conclusion is that the long-term virologic suppression in these two participants is probably due to the exquisite potency of PGT121, even at levels below the limit of quantitation, coupled with the fact that both participants had low viral loads at baseline. PGT121 may have a higher barrier to resistance than other single bNAbs tested thus far, accounting for this long-term suppression, and/or participants with low viral load at baseline may have a limited number of pre-existing viral quasispecies at the time of PGT121 administration. It is also possible that other, unmeasured, immune responses, such as natural killer cell or complex humoral immune responses, may have exerted some immune-mediated control on viral replication that we were not able to detect.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Finally, our data demonstrate that PGT121 monoclonal antibody was safe and well tolerated in both HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals up to 30 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> IV, and at 3 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> SC in HIV-uninfected adults. The half-life of PGT121 was 22 and 14 days in HIV-uninfected and -infected participants, respectively. PGT121 did not appear to generate any functional anti-drug antibodies after a single dose, because no neutralizing anti-PGT121 antibodies were detected at the end of follow-up in any participant.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In summary, PGT121 was safe, well tolerated and had a brisk antiviral effect in viremic, HIV-1-infected participants whose viruses were sensitive to PGT121 at baseline. In two participants with low viral loads at baseline, a single administration of PGT121 was associated with long-term, Ab-mediated viral suppression for up to, and greater than, 6 months. Although the generalizability of our data is limited by our small sample size, they suggest that PGT121 should be tested further for its ability to maintain viral suppression in the setting of ART interruption, or to block HIV acquisition, particularly when used in combination with other bNAbs.</p>

Dose subgroups in Groups 1 and 2 were enrolled in parallel. Participants in each subgroup were identified by a unique study identification number and randomized according to the schedule prepared by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC, Emmes Company, LLC) before the start of the study. Participants were automatically assigned a specific allocation number as they were enrolled into the data entry system. An unblinding list (pharmacy list) was provided to the unblinded site pharmacist by the DCC. Study staff and participants were blinded to the allocation of IP. A site pharmacist was unblinded for preparation of the study product. Blinded participants were informed about their assignment (product/placebo) at study completion, once the data were locked. Groups 1 and 2 were unblinded separately after the last participant in the respective groups had completed study participation. Because PGT121 and placebo (saline) appeared identical in the infusion bag, no masking was required. The five participants in each subgroup were randomized at a ratio of four PGT121 recipients to one placebo recipient. At each dose level in Part 1, IP administration was separated by at least 24 h for each of the first three participants.

PGT121 concentrations were representative of three separate assays, where each sample was run in duplicate. The standard curve was PGT121 IgG mAb, titrated in assay diluent. The negative controls were CH58 (an irrelevant mAb) and blank beads. Samples with PGT121 concentrations of LLoQ &lt; 0.5 µg ml<sup>–1</sup> for HIV-uninfected participants, and 0.71 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> for HIV-infected participants, at a dilution of 1:50 were designated as 0.5 and 0.71 for plotting purposes for HIV-uninfected and -infected participants, respectively. Samples with PGT121 concentrations above the LLoQ at 1:50 dilution were further tested at various dilution factors to obtain median fluorescent intensity (MFI) in the linear range of the standard curve, and the resulting concentrations from the standard curve were averaged. Samples that were positive at or greater than the limit of detection with an MFI threefold over the preinfusion MFI with a PGT121 concentration lower than LLoQ were designated positive; samples with observed concentrations lower than the LLoQ were designated negative. (2) TZM-bl neutralization assay: the neutralizing actively of passively infused PGT121 was measured as a function of reduction in Tat-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter gene expression in TZM-bl cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Neutralization titers were measured in pre- and postinfusion immune sera against indicator viruses X2088_c9 and CNE30 (viruses sensitive to neutralization by PGT121) and MuLV (negative control virus). Titers ranged from a minimum of 1:20 to a maximum of 1:1,562,500, with values outside of this range considered censored. Serum concentrations of PGT121 were calculated for each indicator virus by multiplying the serum ID<sub>50</sub> titer at each time point with the median IC<sub>50</sub> titer of the PGT121 drug product for each respective virus. The median IC<sub>50</sub> titer of PGT121 against viruses X2088_c9 and CNE30 was determined by neutralization assays utilizing the clinical PGT121 drug product (Catalent, no. 1-FIN-2442), tested at a primary concentration of 10 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> with fivefold dilution series. Replicate assays were performed on multiple days by independent operators (<italic>n</italic> = 12 for each virus). All preinfusion serum samples from HIV-infected or -uninfected participants were shown to have no neutralizing activity against PGT121-specific indicator viruses X2088_c9 and CNE30.

In brief, test serum samples were first subjected to an acid-dissociation step in glycine-HCl acid buffer on a plate shaker for 1 h. Acid-treated samples were mixed (1:1) with a mastermix containing equimolar amounts (0.5 µg ml<sup>–1</sup>) of PGT121 covalently conjugated to biotin or ruthenium labels and incubation on a plate shaker overnight. After overnight incubation, samples were transferred to a 96-well functionalized streptavidin plate (Meso Scale Discovery) and shaken for 1 h on a plate shaker. The streptavidin plate was washed several times, Tris-based read buffer containing tripropylamine (TPA) was added and the presence of ADA bridging complexes detected on a MESO QuickPlex SQ-120 plate reader (Meso Scale Discovery). The ECL signal generated was proportional to the level of ADA bridging complexes captured in each sample.

The frequency of moderate or greater reactogenicity events was determined and compared between groups. The frequency of SAEs adjudged possibly, probably or related to the IP was determined. All AEs were analyzed and grouped by seriousness, severity and relationship to the IP (as judged by the investigator). An interim analysis of group data was carried out according to the study schema without unblinding the study to investigators or participants. At the end of the study, a full analysis was prepared. Unused and spurious data were listed separately and excluded from the statistical analysis. Missing data were excluded from the statistical analysis. (2) The sample size for PK analysis was four PGT121 and one placebo recipient, sufficient to provide information about the PK of PGT121. The data were fit to standard two-compartment population models using the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization estimation method in Monolix (v.2019R1, Lixoft SAS, 2019). Residual variability was estimated using an additive plus proportional error model, and models were performed separately by HIV infection status. Correlations between confidence interval (Cl) and volume of the central compartment (Vc) were significant (Pearson’s correlation coefficient <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) and were included in the models. Median-adjusted, log<sub>10</sub>-transformed weight was significantly correlated (Pearson’s correlation coefficient <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) with the volume of the peripheral compartment (Vp) in the HIV-uninfected model and with Vc and Cl in the HIV-infected model, and those relationships were also included in the models. Distribution and elimination half-lives were computed using the resulting model. AUC was estimated by calculating the integral of the predicted concentration time curve from infusion to infinity. Peak concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) was computed as the maximum observed concentration. Summary descriptive results of individual estimates of PK parameters, including AUC, <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and clearance results, are reported by dose cohort. Correlation between PK and reported safety and pharmacodynamic outcomes also explored parameters to examine exposure–effect relationships. (3) The frequency and levels of anti-PGT121 antibodies were calculated and tabulated. (4) The sample size for virologic analysis in Group 3A was nine participants. The primary outcome for this analysis was defined as change in log<sub>10</sub> viral load between Day 0 (day of infusion) and Day 7. No placebo participants were enrolled as part of this design. For the analysis of sample size and power, log<sub>10</sub> viral load differences from baseline for each participant were simulated from a normal distribution, with a standard deviation of 0.5. This value was chosen by examining a study of the antiretroviral drug raltegravir, which demonstrated a mean estimated standard deviation of the change in baseline of 0.47 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>). This is a conservative estimate, as the variability of viral loads near the lower range might be expected also to be lower. The statistical test performed was the signed-rank test, which incorporated the ‘shift’ parameter of −0.9 log<sub>10</sub>. An evaluation of potential harm (increased viral load) was also performed with the signed-rank test, which examined the null hypothesis of no change in viral load (a shift of 0 log<sub>10</sub> following IP administration) against the one-sided alternative hypothesis that viral load is increased following IP administration. Each efficacy test was performed at the level <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, and each test for harm was performed at the level 2<italic>α</italic> = 0.10, to provide additional sensitivity in detection of potential harm. (5) The sample size for antiviral activity in Group 3D was up to six participants. No efficacy endpoints were tested in Group 3D because participants were HIV infected with low viral loads at baseline (102–2 × 103 copies ml<sup>–1</sup>). Immunologic and virologic endpoints were determined as described in protocol v.8.0 section 4.1 (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary material</xref>).</p>

                <title>Viral neutralization sensitivity modeling</title>
                <p id="Par42">As shown previously, in vitro neutralization curves can be accurately modeled as Hill curves, using IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>80</sub> titers to fix the half-maximum and slope parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. When both IC<sub>50</sub> and IC<sub>80</sub> were within the concentrations tested, this procedure was used to calculate the percentage neutralization of a virus at a given PGT121 concentration. However, when IC<sub>50</sub> or IC<sub>80</sub> titers were outside the concentration ranges tested, we fit a Hill curve to the raw percentage neutralization versus concentration data. Curve fitting was done using absolute error minimization, utilizing the L-BFGS-B algorithm as implemented in the Python Scipy Optimize package: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-lbfgsb.html">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-lbfgsb.html</ext-link>. The instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP) was calculated as –log<sub>10</sub>(1.0 – <italic>f</italic>), where <italic>f</italic> is the fraction neutralized at a given bNAb concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Average IIP for baseline viruses in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">4</xref> was calculated as follows. First, for each participant, bNAb concentrations were extracted for 1 day following infusion up to the time point of minimum viral load. The former was to account for distribution of bNAb to tissues. Next, for each of these concentrations, IIP was calculated as above for each baseline virus for that participant, and the time-averaged IIP found by numerically integrating the IIP curve as a function of time, divided by integral of unity for the same time points. Simpson’s rule, as implemented in Scipy, was used for calculations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simpson.html">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simpson.html</ext-link>). These time-averaged IIP values for each baseline virus from each participant were averaged to determine the average IIP for each participant. The same procedure was followed to determine the average rebound virus IIP, as shown in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, with the exception of using PGT121 concentrations from the time of minimum viral load to that to rebound.</p>

                <title>Viral load decline and rebound characteristics</title>
                <p id="Par43">We used three characteristics of viral load trajectories in each participant to capture the antiviral efficacy of PGT121: (1) maximum viral load drop from baseline, (2) initial decline rate of viral load following infusion and (3) time to viral rebound. The calculation of the first characteristic was straightforward for all participants, except for four participants for whom the minimum viral load was below the lower limit of quantitation (LLoQ = 40 copies ml<sup>–1</sup>); for such participants the minimum viral load was assumed to be 40 copies ml<sup>–1</sup>. For the second characteristic, we calculated the average slope of log<sub>10</sub> viral load over time using the following strategy. For each participant, we first identified the time window of consistent viral load decline as that between minimum viral load and the earliest time point following infusion such that viral load consistently fell over time in this window. This strategy ensured that the early nonmonotonic behavior of viral load (as seen for participants 1536, 4236 and so on) would not impact calculation of decline rate. In case of multiple time points with minimum viral load, the earliest was chosen. For all time points in the window of viral load decline, the rate was calculated as the slope of log<sub>10</sub> viral load versus time curve. Slopes were calculated using a robust linear regression algorithm, the Theil-Sen estimator as implemented in Scipy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.theilslopes.html">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mstats.theilslopes.html</ext-link>), and time points with viral load below LLoQ were ignored. For two participants, 1536 and 4236, decline rates could not be determined due to the combination of highly nonlinear early viral load kinetics and the minimum viral load dropping below LLoQ; these participants are excluded from the data in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">3c,d</xref>. For two participants, 9372 and 5257, because viral loads did not decline sufficiently due to PGT121 resistance at baseline, the average slope of viral load for the first 10 days was used. The third characteristic was the time to rebound, for which we assumed that rebound or restoration of viremia is characterized by viral loads 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> below baseline preinfusion viremia, or higher. Thus, the time to rebound was calculated as that between infusion and the earliest time point that met the rebound viral load criterion.</p>

Left panels show the phylogenetic trees with leaves labeled according to the sensitive/resistant form they are carrying; in the middle panels the corresponding sequences (in the same order as the trees on the left) are each represented by a line, and recombinants display regions where recombination breakpoints likely occurred as rectangles (solid rectangles indicate statistically significant recombination breakpoints); corresponding neutralization data (IC50 and IC80) is shown on the right. In both study participants recombination has no impact at baseline as all forms are PGT121 sensitive. However, complex forms of resistance emerge at visit 7. In 6292, these involve D325 alone, N332 alone, and a combination of both. At visit 7, in 2 out of 2 recombination events between a sensitive and a resistant parental form, the resistant form is found in the recombinant, yet all visit 7 viruses are resistant. Either these mutations are occurring de novo on recombinant backbones, or they are resulting from recombination of parental forms that carry the mutation but have not been sampled. In 2990, recombination carries forward PGT121 resistant forms in 3 out of 3 events where the parental strains carry a sensitive and resistant form each. Of note, D325N does not confer 10–1074 resistance in 2990, neither does D325E in 6292. However, D325K, found in 6292, gives rise to resistance to both 10–1074 and PGT121.</p>

                        <p>Best fit of viral dynamic model (light blue line) to measured viral load data (blue asterisks) for 6 participants. PGT121 serum concentration is shown in solid red. Horizontal dotted line indicates the viral load limit of detection. Participants 2990,6292 and 2305 shown in the top row belong to the high viral load group, with the remaining patients belonging to the low viral load group. The model follows two populations of virus, PGT121 sensitive and PGT121 resistant, denoted by the purple and orange dashed lines, respectively, while the total viral load is a solid light blue line. The level of resistance is allowed to vary among participants. For 2305, 2936, 2990, 6292 and 6113 the resistant population is predicted to pre-exist at the indicated levels. For the long-term controller 6113 the pre-existing resistant virus is predicted to be partially sensitive to the antibody and after PGT121 administration its level quickly decreases below the x-axis and does not reappear until after day 100. For the other long-term controller 1536, the resistant population may pre-exist at a baseline level of 10<sup>–3</sup> copies/ml or lower or may arise by mutation. Loss of control in both 1536 and 6113 is predicted to occur due to a resurgence of resistant virus. For the periods of observation indicated, the resistant population is predicted to persist (2305, 2936 and 2990) or to be replaced by drug sensitive virus as the antibody concentration wanes in 6292 and the long-term controllers 1536 and 6113.</p>
