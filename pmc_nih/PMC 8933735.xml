              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Despite inconclusive evidence of its efficacy<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and little information on its risk, medical cannabis has surged in popularity. As of December 2021, approximately 12 countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and 36 US states and the District of Columbia have commercialized cannabis for medical use, making it accessible through the use of a medical marijuana card for myriad health conditions. Given the increasing prevalence of cannabis use for medical concerns, well-designed studies are needed to assess the effect of cannabis product use on target symptoms and associated adverse medical and psychiatric events, particularly the development of cannabis use disorder (CUD).</p>
              <p>Cannabis has been reported to improve pain, sleep, and anxiety and depressive symptoms<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and is commonly sought for these concerns.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> However, according to national data, 3 in 10 US adults who use cannabis develop CUD, with 23% developing severe CUD<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and often with a tolerance to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and withdrawal symptoms.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Data are lacking on whether the rates of addiction in adults with a medical marijuana card are similar to the rates in those who use cannabis for recreational purposes. In addition, cannabis use has been associated with psychotic and depressive disorders, mania, suicide, and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Thus, it is imperative to better understand both the benefits and potential risks of cannabis use for medical concerns in the current regulatory environment.</p>
              <p>We conducted a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of obtaining a medical marijuana card on target clinical and CUD symptoms in adults with a chief concern of chronic pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depressive symptoms. Participants were randomized to acquire a medical marijuana card immediately or to be placed on a waiting list to procure a card. We hypothesized modest improvements in pain and insomnia symptoms along with worsened CUD and depressive symptoms over 12 weeks in participants in the immediate card acquisition group.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This pragmatic, single-site, single-blind RCT was conducted in the Greater Boston area from July 1, 2017, to July 31, 2020, approximately 2 years after medical cannabis dispensaries began operating in Massachusetts. Study procedures (<xref rid="note-ZOI220094-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>) were approved by the Mass General Brigham Human Research Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants, and they received financial compensation for participation. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/" ext-link-type="uri">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Participants were recruited from clinical sites (eg, local Massachusetts General Hospital clinics) and from the community. Eligible participants were aged 18 to 65 years who sought medical marijuana to improve pain, insomnia, and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Daily cannabis use, CUD diagnosis at screening or baseline, cancer, psychosis, and current substance use disorders (except for mild or moderate alcohol use disorder and nicotine use disorder) were the criteria for exclusion. The eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI220094-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref> provides detailed inclusion criteria.</p>
              <sec id="H2-1-ZOI220094">
                <title>Randomization and Masking</title>
                <p>Participants were randomized to either the immediate card acquisition group or to the delayed card acquisition group (<xref rid="zoi220094f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In the immediate card acquisition group, participants were allowed to obtain a card immediately. In the delayed card acquisition group, participants were asked to wait 12 weeks to obtain a medical marijuana card. Participants from both groups could choose their cannabis products, dose, and frequency of use, thus allowing for a pragmatic evaluation of the effect of a medical marijuana card within the system in place for physician recommendation and product regulation and distribution.</p>

                <p>Randomization was stratified by sex, age (18-25 vs 26-65 years), and primary medical concern (pain, insomnia, or anxiety or depression). Because we expected that financial and logistical constraints might limit the procurement of a medical marijuana card, increasing the dropout rate in the immediate card acquisition group between randomization and the start of study procedures, we randomized participants 2:1 (immediate card acquisition group to delayed card acquisition group) in each stratum to generate groups that were approximately equal in size for analysis. Randomization was accomplished using a computer-generated random number sequence, which was created and executed by an independent statistician.</p>
                <p>Blinding of participants after group randomization was not possible because of the study design. Rater blinding is discussed in the eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI220094-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>.</p>

                <p>Sociodemographic information, medical history, and psychiatric diagnoses were collected at screening, before randomization, using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="zoi220094t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants in the immediate card acquisition group then obtained their cards, and all participants returned for in-person visits at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 12 after randomization as well as participated in a telephone visit at week 8 for an assessment of adverse events (AEs). Participants in the immediate card acquisition group were responsible for arranging for and paying the costs of obtaining a medical marijuana card and cannabis products. The trial did not provide or pay for the medical marijuana cards or cannabis products used by the participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>All participants who completed a baseline assessment and at least 1 postbaseline visit were included in the analysis. We used an evaluable population approach for the statistical analyses that included all participants in the delayed card acquisition group and all participants in the immediate card acquisition group who obtained a card and had 1 postbaseline assessment. Analyses used generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures for a given individual across the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes. The statistical model assumed a constant effect of a medical marijuana card over time (weeks 2, 4, and 12 visits), with baseline scores as a covariate. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for CUD diagnosis, and linear models were used for continuous outcomes to estimate the mean difference (MD) in symptom scores. All tests and CIs were 2 sided, and statistical significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> ≤ . 05 for the primary outcomes. We reported original<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and adjusted <italic>P</italic> values that were corrected for multiple comparisons.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Results of secondary or exploratory analyses were reported as point estimates with 95% CIs. Analyses were performed using R, version 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).</p>
                <p>We conducted 2 post hoc sensitivity analyses. First, owing to a substantial number of dropouts in the immediate card acquisition group (participants who did not obtain a card; 53 of 173 [30.6%]), we ran a multivariable logistic regression to test whether baseline characteristics (eg, age, sex, race and ethnicity [which were self-reported and included African American or Black; Asian; Hispanic; multiracial; Pacific Islander; White; or unknown, including missing race and ethnicity information], educational level, baseline level of cannabis use, primary concern, and symptom severity) were different in the immediate card acquisition group among participants who obtained a card vs those who did not. To test whether the probability of obtaining a card biased participants in both randomization groups, we calculated propensity scores for all participants using the logistic regression model (model run in the immediate card acquisition group and applied to both groups). We entered these weightings in the analyses of primary outcomes using generalized estimating equations by the inverse of this propensity score.</p>
                <p>Second, because all participants could choose a variety of cannabis products with input from licensed medical marijuana dispensaries or elsewhere, we conducted a modified per protocol sensitivity analysis that compared the primary outcomes in participants in the immediate card acquisition group whose urine samples at week 12 (end of the intervention) had detectable levels of THC, CBD, or metabolites with those of participants in the delayed card acquisition group without detectable levels of THC, CBD, or metabolites at week 12.</p>

                <p>As expected, the immediate card acquisition group reported significantly greater cannabis use throughout the intervention period than the delayed card acquisition group (likert scale difference: 2.44; 95% CI, 2.08-2.81; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref rid="zoi220094f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A and eFigure in <xref rid="note-ZOI220094-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).

                    <p>A, Cannabis use was assessed via a self-reported scale, which asked for frequency of cannabis use at each visit. There was a significant increase in use in the immediate card acquisition group vs the delayed card acquisition group (2.44; 95% CI, 2.08-2.81; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). B, Cannabis use disorder was defined as 2 or more CUD symptoms on an 11-point scale. The odds of developing CUD were 2.9-fold higher in the immediate card acquisition group vs the delayed card acquisition group (adjusted odds ratio, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.17-7.07; <italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this single-blind, pragmatic RCT involving people who sought cannabis products to improve insomnia, pain, or anxiety or depressive symptoms, participants in the immediate card acquisition group developed a greater number of CUD symptoms and had a higher incidence and greater severity of CUD diagnosis over the 12-week trial after obtaining a card compared with those in the delayed card acquisition group. Analyzed by chief concerns of pain, insomnia, and anxiety or depressive symptoms, participants in the immediate card acquisition group reported improved insomnia but no significant changes in pain severity and anxiety or depressive symptoms.</p>
              <p>This study indicated that obtaining a medical marijuana card and using cannabis products from a dispensary, with the required medical oversight, for medical concerns of pain, anxiety, or depressive symptoms increased the risk for developing CUD without significantly improving symptoms. The odds of developing CUD were almost 2.9-fold higher in the immediate card acquisition group than in the delayed card acquisition group. Epidemiologic surveys of recreational cannabis use found that 3 in 10 adults who use cannabis develop CUD,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> but it is unknown whether adults with a medical marijuana card would develop CUD at a lower rate than recreational users. In this trial, 17.1% of participants in the immediate card acquisition group developed a CUD diagnosis throughout the 12 weeks of study after acquiring a card. Although this incidence is lower than the 12-month incidence of CUD reported by Hasin et al,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> the current study assessed the onset of CUD after only 12 weeks of medical marijuana card ownership. Thus, further research is warranted with a longer follow-up of people who obtain a card to better understand CUD risk in this group. This trial showed that CUD can develop at a fast rate within the first 12 weeks of medical marijuana card ownership, suggesting that those with a card may develop CUD at a similar rate as those who use cannabis recreationally and that the motive for use (eg, medical) may not be protective. Although most cases of CUD onset in the trial were mild, with 2 to 4 symptoms, these symptoms developed over a short, 12-week initial exposure. The most commonly reported CUD symptoms were higher tolerance and continued use despite the recurrent physical or psychological problems caused or exacerbated by cannabis.</p>
              <p>Most of those who developed CUD sought a medical marijuana card for affective symptoms; 28.3% of participants in the immediate card acquisition group with a chief concern of anxiety or depression and 10.8% of participants in the delayed card acquisition group experienced CUD onset during the 12-week study. Thus, consistent with findings from epidemiologic studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> people with affective symptoms who have access to cannabis through medical marijuana cards may be particularly at risk of CUD onset. Cannabis use disorder frequently co-occurs with affective disorders, particularly depression.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Individuals with affective disorders have 3.9-fold (95% CI, 2.8-5.3) higher odds of meeting CUD diagnostic criteria,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and bidirectional associations between cannabis use and depression have been reported.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These data suggest that a medical marijuana card may pose a high risk or may even be contraindicated for people with affective disorders. This finding is important to replicate because depression has been reported as the third most common reason that people seek a medical marijuana card.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The finding of improved self-reported insomnia with a large effect size merits further study. The endocannabinoid system has been described as critical in regulation of the circadian sleep-wake cycle,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> including maintenance and promotion of sleep.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Although RCTs of cannabis for primary insomnia are lacking, small effects of cannabinoids on secondary sleep outcomes have been reported.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Those with a primary insomnia concern were unlikely to develop CUD, suggesting a potential clinical utility of cannabinoids for insomnia. Thus, further study of the effect of cannabinoids on people with primary insomnia is warranted, using objective measures and self-assessments of sleep, along with analysis of CUD symptoms over a period longer than this 12-week trial.</p>
              <p>Although pain, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were the common reasons cited for the use of cannabinoids, we detected no substantial benefit of a medical marijuana card for any of these outcomes. This null finding of medical marijuana card ownership on pain severity, pain interference, and pain catastrophizing is consistent with a recent systematic review and expert consensus recommendation against the use of any cannabinoids for chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Because preclinical studies have suggested that the endocannabinoid system, through CB1 and CB2 receptors, is a key regulator of pain sensation, these receptors remain potential targets for pain therapeutics.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220094r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> As such, mechanistic pain trials are warranted. We did observe an effect of medical marijuana card ownership on mental well-being and perceived stress that may be relevant to these health concerns. This finding deserves follow-up, and the potential risk of CUD should be weighed against the potential benefit to perceived stress and well-being. No AEs related to psychotic symptoms, mania, hypomania, or suicidal ideation or behavior were observed in the immediate card acquisition group during the trial.</p>
              <p>The findings of this trial may provide insight into the potential risks and benefits of a medical marijuana card for people seeking cannabis for medical concerns. Although the development of CUD may suggest the likelihood of future medical marijuana card ownership,<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> participants in this study did not have evidence of problematic cannabis use at baseline, and yet some participants developed CUD over the first 12 weeks of card ownership. Thus, clinicians and patients are advised to consider the risks of cannabis use, especially in those with affective disorders, who may be particularly susceptible to developing CUD. In many US states with medical marijuana laws, cannabis is approved for a variety of medical conditions, but little evidence of its efficacy is available. Thus, further study is needed to replicate and extend the findings of this trial, specifically the risks and benefits of cannabis use for specific medical conditions and the rate of CUD development over longer periods and under different health conditions, particularly mental health conditions. Such work can inform clinical decision-making on whether to initiate cannabis for specific medical concerns.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. We assessed the risks and benefits of medical marijuana card ownership among participants who chose from a variety of cannabis products at self-titrated doses and who were aided by community physicians who recommended cannabis products for pain, insomnia, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Therefore, we cannot comment on the pharmacological effects and risks or benefits of specific cannabinoids at specific doses for the health concerns we examined. Determination of the cannabinoid doses used is challenging in this circumstance.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We followed expert consensus guidelines<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> by using timeline follow-back methods to document the frequency of use, rather than quantity or potency, of cannabis, supplemented with sensitive assays of urine cannabinoids.<sup><xref rid="zoi220094r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Because there was no placebo cannabis and because all participants sought cannabis as a potential therapy for their symptoms, the trial design created bias toward a treatment effect that was attributable to expectancy, strengthening our confidence in the null findings for pain, depression, or anxiety symptoms. The inclusion criteria were based on self-reported symptoms and as such may not be generalizable to those with a formal diagnosis of primary insomnia, an anxiety disorder, or major depressive disorder. The study sample was relatively homogeneous in race and ethnicity and educational attainment. There was a high dropout rate in the immediate card acquisition group between randomization and baseline, reflecting the cost and administrative burden of obtaining a medical marijuana card. Although retention after randomization was higher in the delayed card acquisition group, retention from baseline was high in both groups.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this RCT, ownership of a medical marijuana card led to rapid onset and increased incidence and severity of CUD in some participants, particularly those with a chief concern of anxiety or depressive symptoms. The self-reported improvement in sleep quality warrants further study into the benefits of medical marijuana card ownership for insomnia and the risk of CUD.
