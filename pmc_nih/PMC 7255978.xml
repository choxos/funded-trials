                  <title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>This phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of anetumab ravtansine enrolled 148 adult patients with multiple solid tumor types. Ten dose-escalation cohorts of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (0.15-7.5 mg/kg) received anetumab ravtansine once every 3 weeks, and 6 expansion cohorts of patients with advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer or malignant mesothelioma received anetumab ravtansine at the maximum tolerated dose once every 3 weeks, 1.8 mg/kg once per week, and 2.2 mg/kg once per week.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Forty-five patients were enrolled across the 10 dose-escalation cohorts. The maximum tolerated dose of anetumab ravtansine was 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or 2.2 mg/kg once per week. Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the 6.5 mg/kg once-every-3-weeks, 35 in the 1.8 mg/kg once-per-week, and 36 in the 2.2 mg/kg once-per-week expansion cohorts. The most common drug-related adverse events were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and keratitis/keratopathy. There were no drug-related deaths. Anetumab ravtansine pharmacokinetics were dose proportional; the average half-life was 5.5 days. Among 148 patients with mesothelioma or ovarian, pancreatic, nonâ€“small-cell lung, and breast cancers, 1 had a complete response, 11 had partial responses, and 66 had stable disease. High levels of tumor mesothelin expression were detected in patients with clinical activity.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>Anetumab ravtansine exhibited a manageable safety and favorable pharmacokinetic profile with encouraging preliminary antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. The results allowed for the determination of recommended doses, schedules, and patient populations for anetumab ravtansine in phase II studies.</p>

              <p>Anetumab ravtansine (BAY 94-9343) is an antibodyâ€“drug conjugate (ADC) comprising a fully human immunoglobulin G1 anti-mesothelin monoclonal antibody conjugated to the maytansine derivative tubulin inhibitor DM4 through a reducible disulfide linker.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The drugâ€“antibody ratio of anetumab ravtansine is 3.2. After binding to mesothelin on tumor cells, anetumab ravtansine is internalized and the disulfide linker is cleaved, releasing DM4. DM4 subsequently binds to tubulin; this disrupts microtubule polymerization, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The release of DM4 into the tumor microenvironment leads to bystander killing of neighboring dividing cells.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Preclinical studies have shown that anetumab ravtansine was highly cytotoxic to mesothelin-expressing mesothelioma and pancreatic, nonâ€“small-cell lung, and ovarian cancer cell lines.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In vivo, anetumab ravtansine had robust antitumor activity in mesothelioma, pancreatic, and ovarian xenografts with mesothelin expression derived from patients with cancer<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>On the basis of these preclinical results of anetumab ravtansine, we initiated a comprehensive, to our knowledge first-in-human, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, activity, and immunogenicity of once every 3 weeks and once per week anetumab ravtansine administration in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing solid tumors.</p>

                <p>This was a phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study. The sample size of the dose-escalation phase was 45 patients, and it was conducted according to the traditional 3+3 model with modified Fibonacci schema (Data Supplement, online only). The anetumab ravtansine dose was escalated in 10 cohorts: 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. The dose, schedule (maximum tolerated dose [MTD] once every 3 weeks, 1.8 mg/kg once per week, or 2.2 mg/kg once per week), and antitumor activity were evaluated in 6 expansion cohorts (n = 103) of patients with mesothelioma (pleural and peritoneal) or ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (platinum-resistant or platinum-sensitive). Relapsed disease after â‰¤ 6 months and relapsed disease after &gt; 6 months after initial platinum-based chemotherapy were termed platinum resistant and platinum sensitive, respectively. The once-per-week dosing schedules were added after the establishment of the MTD for the once-every-3-weeks dosing schedule.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Eligible patients had advanced, metastatic, or recurrent solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. The study population was enriched with tumor types known to overexpress mesothelin. Additional inclusion criteria included age â‰¥ 18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, evaluable or measurable disease, and written informed consent. The once-every-3-weeks MTD expansion cohort enrolled patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer or mesothelioma only. For the once-per-week expansion cohorts, eligibility was restricted to patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer or epithelioid pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma. All patients in the once-per-week cohorts had confirmed mesothelin expression with a membrane intensity score of 2+ or 3+ on â‰¥ 30% of tumor cells on evaluation of fresh or archival tumor tissue by IHC. In the once-every-3-weeks cohorts, mesothelin expression was determined retrospectively in a similar manner. Full selection criteria are provided in the Data Supplement. The trial adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Anetumab ravtansine was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 (once every 3 weeks) or days 1, 8, and 15 (once per week) of each 21-day cycle. Patients continued treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of patient consent or from the study at the investigatorâ€™s discretion. Anetumab ravtansine dose-modification criteria are provided in the Data Supplement.</p>
                <p>Adverse events (AEs) were reported using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs version 4.0.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Tumor response was evaluated every 6 weeks until cycle 8, and every 12 weeks thereafter, on the basis of modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) in mesothelioma<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and RECIST version 1.1 in all other solid tumors.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                <p>In those patients in the once-every-3-weeks cohort who had archival or fresh tumor tissue samples available, mesothelin expression was evaluated retrospectively using the VENTANA MSLN (SP74) IHC assay. Tumors expressing mesothelin at any intensity were considered mesothelin positive. Tumors were considered to have high expression if mesothelin was detected at a 2+ or 3+ membrane intensity (0-3 scale) on â‰¥ 30% of viable tumor cells. Mesothelin expression on tumor cells was determined prospectively in the once-per-week expansion cohorts using IHC, and only those patients with high mesothelin expression were included. Plasma levels of soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP) at baseline (pretreatment) were determined by the MesoMark enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anetumab ravtansine recognizes an epitope present on SMRP; therefore, serial changes in SMRP levels over time during treatment were not measured.</p>
                <p>Antidrug antibody (ADA) titers and neutralizing antibody-positive status were determined on cycle 1 day 1 (predose) and day 8, then on day 1 of every even cycle, and at end-of-treatment and follow-up visits. Serial plasma samples for pharmacokinetic characterization were collected during cycles 1, 3, and 6, and every third cycle thereafter, for analysis of ADC, total antibody (ADC and cleaved free antibody), DM4 (toxophore), and DM4-Me (S-methyl metabolite of DM4) concentrations. Evaluation of plasma pharmacokinetic parameters was performed by noncompartmental analysis.</p>

                <p>The MTD of anetumab ravtansine was 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, with 1 of 6 patients in the escalation cohort experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT, asymptomatic grade 3 increase in aspartate aminotransferase). One of the 6 patients in the 5.5 mg/kg once-every-3-weeks dose-escalation cohort experienced 2 DLTs (grade 3 hypertension and hyponatremia). There were no DLTs at doses of 4.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or lower.

In addition, plasma concentrationâ€“time profiles of anetumab ravtansine did not significantly differ in patients treated with once-every-3-weeks or once-per-week dosing (Data Supplement). These results suggest that plasma drug levels of anetumab ravtansine are by themselves unlikely to account for the somewhat lower antitumor activity in patients with mesothelioma treated with once-per-week dosing.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this phase I study, anetumab ravtansine, a mesothelin-targeting ADC, was well tolerated, with manageable AEs and favorable pharmacokinetics, and had encouraging preliminary clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. The MTD and recommended dose for phase II trials of anetumab ravtansine as a single agent were determined to be 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or 2.2 mg/kg once per week.</p>
              <p>The most common drug-related AEs in patients treated with 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks or in the once-per-week expansion cohorts were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Ocular AEs (most commonly reported as keratitis, keratopathy, blurred vision, and dry eye) were manageable with mitigation strategies such as dose reductions, treatment delays, and the use of ocular lubricants or topical steroids. Similar strategies have been used to manage ocular AEs associated with other ADCs.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The visual impairment and corneal morphology changes found on the ophthalmologic examination either fully recovered within 2-9 weeks or showed a trend toward resolution at the last follow-up assessment. Ocular toxicity, keratitis/keratopathy in particular, seems to be a class effect of certain ADCs and has been observed with other ADCs using both maytansinoid and nonmaytansinoid toxophores (Data Supplement).<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Drug-related peripheral sensory neuropathy was seen in 32% of patients treated at 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, but only 1 case was grade 3 in severity. IRRs were also uncommon, occurring in only 4 patients (11%) at 6.5 mg/kg once every 3 weeks, 1 patient (3%) at 1.8 mg/kg once per week, and 2 patients (6%) at 2.2 mg/kg once per week. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, hematologic AEs, and IRRs have also been reported previously with other ADCs and microtubule inhibitor compounds.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In this study, the baseline plasma SMRP levels of patients were higher than the common diagnostic threshold for patients with pleural mesothelioma.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, while all patients who responded to treatment had high mesothelin expression, some patients with high mesothelin expression did not respond to treatment. All patients with PR and CR had at least 60% tumor mesothelin expression by IHC. These findings suggest that, although there is a positive trend in the correlation between mesothelin expression and antitumor activity, significance cannot be established on the basis of the preliminary data from this study. Currently, the phase Ib multi-indication basket study of anetumab ravtansine (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03102320">NCT03102320</ext-link>) is enrolling patients with different tumor types (triple-negative breast, pancreatic, thymic, lung, and gastric cancers) to evaluate antitumor activity in the context of tumor mesothelin expression.</p>
              <p>In summary, anetumab ravtansine is a novel anti-mesothelin ADC that was well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Common AEs were manageable with treatment interruptions or dose reductions. While this phase I study was not designed or statistically powered to assess clinical efficacy, preliminary antitumor activity was observed in patients with metastatic and refractory mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. As this phase I study was ongoing, topline results from a randomized phase II study in patients with pleural mesothelioma were presented and indicated that anetumab ravtansine was not superior to vinorelbine.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Additional subgroup analysis of this phase II study is in progress, including correlation of PFS and OS with tumor mesothelin expression and baseline SMRP levels. On the basis of all the findings from the phase I study of anetumab ravtansine, several additional clinical trials are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02751918">NCT02751918</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03455556">NCT03455556</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03126630">NCT03126630</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03102320">NCT03102320</ext-link>) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and activity of anetumab ravtansine as monotherapy or in combination with standard of care in a variety of mesothelin-expressing solid tumors. Anetumab ravtansine may also warrant future investigation in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia because a subset of these tumors has high mesothelin expression.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p>
