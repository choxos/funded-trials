                <p id="Par1">Devimistat is a TCA cycle inhibitor. A previously completed phase I study of devimistat in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML showed promising response rates. Here we report the results of a single arm phase II study (NCT02484391). The primary outcome of feasibility of maintenance devimistat following induction and consolidation with devimistat in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was not met, as maintenance devimistat was only administered in 2 of 21 responders. The secondary outcomes of response (CRâ+âCRi) and median survival were 44% (21/48) and 5.9 months respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities observed. An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat. These findings suggest that an age related decline in mitochondrial quality and autophagy may be associated with response to devimistat however this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts with proper trial design.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive malignancy with poor outcomes especially in patients 60 years of age or older. This is thought to be in part from increased resistance to chemotherapy in AML cells arising in an older host<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Treatment with induction chemotherapy results in the attainment of a complete remission (CR) rate of up to 80% in younger patients and 50â60% in older patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite these high remission rates relapse is common and once relapsed the attainment of a second remission is more difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Once relapsed the only curative treatment modality is an allogenic stem cell transplant. Patients in remission at the time of transplant have the highest long-term survival rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, treatments that produce high remission rates are particularly important. There is no standard salvage regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory AML and novel approaches are needed.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Metabolism is altered in cancer cells and attempts to leverage these differences into therapeutic strategies have been extensively studied (reviewed in refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). Unfortunately, the targeting of non-mutated metabolic enzymes has not yet yielded a clinically successful strategy. Devimistat (CPI-613) is a novel lipoate analog that mimics the catalytic intermediates of both pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) complexes. This results in stimulation of inhibitory regulatory processes causing simultaneous inhibition of both complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In early clinical trials in pancreatic cancer patients, the addition of devimistat resulted in impressive response rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> leading to a phase III clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Mitochondrial metabolism is a source of resistance in AML. Studies have shown an increased mitochondrial mass and an oxidative-phosphorylation gene expression signature in cytarabine-resistant AML cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, AML cells display a dose-dependent increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption when treated with chemotherapy, and this mitochondrial respiration is a source of resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In preclinical models, devimistat sensitized AML cells to chemotherapy and decreased mitochondrial respiration leading to a phase I study in relapsed and refractory AML patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In the previous phase I study, the maximally tolerated dose of devimistat when given in combination with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was 2500âmg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, there was no clear doseâresponse relationship observed. A single-arm phase II study was conducted of the combination of devimistat with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone followed by maintenance devimistat for relapsed or refractory AML patients. The primary endpoint for the trial was the feasibility of maintenance devimistat with the secondary endpoints of response, defined as the complete remission plus the complete remission rate with incomplete count recovery rates (CRâ+âCRi), median survival and toxicity profile. In an unplanned, post hoc analysis, the combined datasets from the phase I and II studies were analyzedto determine patient characteristics associated with an increased likelihood of response. In addition to the clinical endpoints of the phase II trial the current report details the results of this unplanned post hoc analysis that found a dose response in older but not younger patients and mechanistic studies showing devimistat induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitophagy, and a relationship between mitochondrial membrane potential and response to the chemotherapy sensitizing effects of devimistat.</p>

Briefly, 47 patients with relapsed or refractory AML and one patient with a relapsed granulocytic sarcoma were enrolled in study. The median age of the cohort was 64 years old. The median marrow blast involvement at the time of enrollment was 30%. Of the 48 patients enrolled, all but one of them received initial cytotoxic chemotherapy induction with 90% receiving 7â+â3 as initial treatment, 81% received study treatment as their first salvage, 13% received previous high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) based salvage, 27% prior hypomethylating agent and 4% of patients had received prior stem cell transplant. Disease status was refractory in 29% and relapsed in 71% of patients. For patients with a previous remission, the median duration of the first remission was 11.5 months.

One was lost to follow-up, three did not receive maintenance because of physician choice, five relapsed during consolidation and ten went on to allogeneic stem cell transplant. Of the two patients who started maintenance therapy one refused all consolidation therapy while the other completed two cycles of consolidation. Both patients relapsed prior to cycle 3 of maintenance. Therefore, the primary endpoint of the study was not met as none of the eligible patients completed three cycles of maintenance therapy. For the secondary outcome of response, all of the 48 patients were evaluable for response. The composite response rate was 44% with 15 complete remissions (CR) and 6 complete remissions with incomplete count recovery (CRi).

                <p id="Par9">Previous analysis of the activity of devimistat in combination with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone suggested that older and younger patients had similar outcomes in contrast to essentially all previous studies utilizing a cytotoxic backbone in AML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. To confirm this observation, an unplanned post hoc analysis of the combined data from the phases I and II for all 114 AML patients treated were completed. Median survival in all patients treated with devimistat was assessed by age. The KaplanâMeier curves for both age groups completely overlap with a median OS of 6.5 months in younger patients compared to 5.7 months in patients 60 years of age or older (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.5538, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). This data suggests a differential benefit of the addition of devimistat in older patients. In order to assess the comparative activity of the 1500 and 2000âmg/m<sup>2</sup> regimens the median survival of all patients treated with either dose of devimistat was analyzed. The combined demographics of these cohorts are summarized in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

When these cohorts were analyzed by age, patients younger than 60 showed no significant difference in survival between doses (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). While the number of patients over 60 was modest (23 treated with 2000âmg/m<sup>2</sup> and 19 treated with 1500âmg/m<sup>2</sup>), the two dose cohorts were well matched in median age, percentage of refractory patients, and cytogenetic risk.

                <title>RNA sequencing analysis</title>
                <p id="Par10">In order to assess underlying biological differences between older and younger patients, an RNA sequencing analysis of all available patient samples was conducted. There were 17 baseline bone marrow samples from the phase I study and an additional 8 samples from the phase II study with sufficient quality RNA for analysis. Since devimistat targets mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondria can be transferred from marrow stromal cells to AML cells when treated with chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> RNA from all mononuclear cells in the bone marrow were included in the analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational method that assess the degree of concordant expression of sets of genes in common biological pathways as a function of a predefined condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. When the RNA sequencing expression data of the samples was analyzed for gene sets with expression changes correlated to age there was a highly significant negative association between age and gene sets involved in mitochondrial biology. These included genes involved in cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, ATP synthesis coupled to electron transport, and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2AâE</xref>). Furthermore, this association was verified in a separate AML cohort with RNA sequencing data corresponding to 239 baseline bone marrow specimens annotated with patient age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). These findings demonstrate a significant age-related decline in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and assembly. To confirm and extend this result, Western blots of primary patient samples from several patients of different ages for members of the electron transport chain (ETC) was performed. Consistent with the RNAseq data there was a decrease in expression of ETC components in the older compared to younger samples (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3A, B</xref>). To further address if the age of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) that gives rise to AML effects mitochondrial function, HSCs from either fetal livers (Young) or retired breeders (Old) were transduced with MLL-ENL fusion gene and NRas<sup>G12D</sup> and the resulting AML grown out. The Young AML cell line demonstrated increased gene expression of several mitochondrial-associated genes, a significantly increased basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), more mitochondria, and a small but significant increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3CâE</xref>). To further extend these results MLL-ENL and NRas<sup>G12D</sup> leukemias were generated from HSCs from adolescent mice (6 weeks of age) or middle-aged mice (15 months of age) and mitochondrial content and MMP were assessed. Consistent with the previous data the adolescent-derived leukemia had a higher mitochondrial content and MMP (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3F</xref>). These data complement the expression data and support the hypothesis that AML arising from older HSCs have a less functional mitochondrial compartment.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Genes inversely correlated with patient age are enriched for mitochondrial functions.</title><p><bold>A</bold>â<bold>E</bold> RNA sequence data for 25 baseline bone marrow samples from the combined phase Iâ+âII cohorts were analyzed for gene expression patterns correlated with patient age.

                <title>Mitochondrial membrane potential and devimistat</title>
                <p id="Par11">The above data suggest that increased benefit from devimistat in older patients may be related to impaired mitochondrial function. MMP is an essential driver of mitochondrial ATP generating capacity and is predicted to be impaired based on the gene expression pathways that decreased with age and supported by the functional studies of AML arising from older HSCs (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Devimistat inhibits mitochondrial respiration in leukemia cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> but a direct effect on ATP production has not been established. To address this, AML cells were incubated with increasing amounts of devimistat for 6âh, and viability and ATP concentrations determined. ATP levels fell significantly upon incubation with devimistat (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). This suggests that AML cells with increased MMP and ATP generating capacity would be more resistant to devimistat. In order to study the relationship between MMP and devimistat response three genetically defined mouse models of AML with different baseline MMP were utilized (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The MFL2 cell line with the highest MMP had the least response to the addition of devimistat to doxorubicin (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). RN2 cells were in between in both measures (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) and RHRAS cells with the lowest MMP had the largest effect (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). These data suggest a correlation between MMP and effect of devimistat; however, to establish causality, the cell line with the highest MMP (MFL2) was treated with the clinically available complex one inhibitor metformin. Cells treated with metformin demonstrated a significant decline in MMP (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). The addition of metformin to doxorubicin and devimistat resulted in a significant increase in response compared to devimistat and doxorubicin alone (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). These data suggest that MMP is a source of resistance to devimistat. The ability of metformin to sensitize MFL2 cells to devimistat suggested the combination maybe synergistic. A combinatorial index (CI) is a mathematical model that quantifies the degree of synergy between two agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> where CI values below 1 are considered moderately synergistic and those below 0.7 are considered synergistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. There was significant synergy between devimistat and metformin with a CI value of 0.67 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>). In addition to its ETC inhibitory effects, metformin was recently shown to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of its anticancer activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To determine if metformin-induced ROS played a role in the observed synergy, we exposed AML cells to devimistat, metformin, or both and assessed mitochondrial ROS. Consistent with previous reports devimistat significantly induced mitochondrial ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). Metformin alone did not significantly increase mitochondrial ROS however; the combination of devimistat and metformin did increase mitochondrial ROS above devimistat alone (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4A</xref>). To determine if this excess ROS contributed to efficacy, AML cells were exposed to devimistat with and without metformin in the presence of the ROS scavenger n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). There was no attenuation of the cytotoxicity in the presence of NAC, in fact the addition NAC resulted in numerically lower viability though this did not reach significance (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4B</xref>). To confirm that NAC was attenuating ROS AML cells were incubated with devimistat, metformin, NAC, or the combination and mitochondrial ROS assessed. Surprisingly, NAC when added to devimistat and metformin actually significantly increased mitochondrial ROS compared to devimistat and metformin alone (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4C</xref>). To assess the ability of NAC to attenuate mitochondrial ROS not related to devimistat AML cells were treated with the protonophore Carbonyl cyanide-<italic>p</italic>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or devimistat with and without NAC and mitochondrial ROS assessed. Consistent with the previous result NAC significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in the presence of devimistat but significantly attenuated it with FCCP (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4D</xref>). This demonstrates the failure of NAC to rescue devimistat- and metformin-treated cells is not related to decreased mitochondrial ROS. To more directly test the relative roles of ETC activity and mitochondrial ROS in the activity of devimistat, AML cells were treated with devimistat with the complex III inhibitor antimycin A or the mitochondrial ROS-generating herbicide paraquat. Both antimycin A and paraquat significantly sensitized AML cells to devimistat (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4E, F</xref>) suggesting that both ETC inhibition and ROS generation can sensitize cells to devimistat. In addition, metformin did not significantly increase the sensitivity of the RHRAS cell line with the lowest MMP supporting an effect on ETC (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4G</xref>). As metformin is an approved agent for the treatment of diabetes allowing rapid translation, the in vivo activity of this combination was determined. Syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice were injected with MFL2 cells and upon engraftment treated with PBS, devimistat alone, metformin alone or combined with devimistat. Combination-treated mice had a modest but highly significant survival benefit when compared to controls or either treatment alone (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>). This survival benefit was similar in magnitude to the benefit of cytarabine and doxorubicin in previously published studies of this aggressive model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To confirm and extend these results, devimistat and metformin were tested alone and in combination in a PDX model derived from a 75-year-old patient. Consistent with the results from the syngeneic model there was a modest but significant benefit of the combination compared to either single agent alone (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4H</xref>). These data suggest that MMP is a source of resistance and mitochondrial ROS potentiates the effects of devimistat.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Activity of devimistat depends on baseline MMP.</title><p><bold>A</bold> ATP concentrations.

                <title>TCA cycle inhibition leads to increased mitochondrial turnover</title>
                <p id="Par12">The GSEA revealed electron transport chain assembly as significantly negatively associated with age (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>) suggesting that mitochondrial turnover may contribute to the response to devimistat. To determine if devimistat causes increased turnover of mitochondria, treated MFL2 cells were lysed and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were blotted for actin, and the mitochondrial proteins VDAC1 and TOM20 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Devimistat treatment resulted in a decrease of VDAC1 and TOM20 consistent with increased mitochondrial turnover. To determine if this effect is specific for TCA cycle inhibition, MFL2 cells deleted for the E1Î± subunit of PDH (<italic>Pdha1</italic>) by CRISPR/Cas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> were compared to control cells with a <italic>Rosa26</italic> targeted sgRNA. <italic>Pdha1</italic>-deleted cells had significantly lower levels of VDAC1 and TOM20 consistent with TCA cycle defects resulting in increased mitochondrial turnover (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). To determine if the decrease in mitochondrial-related proteins was accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, MFL2 cells were treated with devimistat and expression of several genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis assessed. Following devimistat treatment, significant increases in expression were seen with <italic>Tfam, Erra, Errg</italic>, and <italic>Nrf1</italic> (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

Consistent with this when human or murine AML cells were treated with doxycycline they became sensitized to devimistat (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4E, F</xref>). To rule out the effects of doxycycline on MMP, murine AML cells were treated with doxycycline, devimistat or both for 72âh and TMRM measured. There was no significant decrease in TMRM in cells treated with doxycycline (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

                <title>Autophagy and devimistat</title>
                <p id="Par13">The main mechanism of mitochondrial turnover utilizes mitochondrial fission followed by autophagic digestion in a pathway termed mitophagy. Mitochondrial fission requires Drp1 to convert larger mitochondria into smaller fragmented ones. To determine the importance of mitochondrial fission to TCA cycle inhibition, sensitivity to the Drp1inhibitor MDIVI-1 was assessed. <italic>Pdha1</italic>-deleted cells were significantly more sensitive to MDIVI-1 treatment compared to the <italic>Rosa26</italic> controls (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6A</xref>). This increased dependence on mitochondrial fission was also seen in devimistat-treated AML cells since they were more sensitive to MDIVI-1 (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6B</xref>). To extend these results, AML cells derived from primary patient samples were treated with devimistat and MDIVI-1 and assessed for viability. Consistent with the cell line models three of the four tested primary patient AML cells were significantly more sensitive to the combination than either agent alone (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6C</xref>). Having established AML cells have increased reliance on Drp1 mediated mitochondrial fission in response to TCA cycle inhibition, we next examined autophagy. To determine if devimistat induces autophagy, levels of the autophagic protein LC3-II, which helps to assemble the autophagosome, were monitored in leukemia cells treated with devimistat. Leukemia cells exposed to devimistat showed an accumulation of LC3-II indicative of autophagy induction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). In order to assess reliance on autophagy in response to TCA cycle inhibition, <italic>Pdha1</italic>-deleted cells and <italic>Rosa26</italic> control cells were treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Both mouse (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>) and human (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7A, B</xref>) <italic>Pdh1a</italic>-deleted cells showed increased sensitivity to chloroquine treatment compared to controls. In addition, AML cells treated with devimistat were more sensitive to chloroquine (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C, D</xref>). As chloroquine has multiple effects beyond inhibition of autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> a genetic approach was used to confirm the effect was specific to autophagy. The gene <italic>ATG5</italic> is involved in the elongation and closure of autophagic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Cells lacking <italic>ATG5</italic> are impaired in classical autophagy although independent autophagic mechanisms remain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. AML cells lacking the autophagy gene <italic>Atg5</italic> were generated and assessed for sensitivity to devimistat. Two independent clones deleted for <italic>Atg5</italic> demonstrated an increased sensitivity to devimistat compared to control cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). In addition, when <italic>Atg5</italic> deleted cells were treated with devimistat TOM20 and VDAC protein expression remained constant in contrast to autophagy competent cells (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref> and Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7C</xref>). This finding of preserved TOM20 and VDAC protein levels in cells that have a genetic impairment to autophagy is an orthotopic demonstration of the importance of autophagy in the devimistat induced mitochondrial turnover and further supports that devimistat induces mitophagy. Finally, primary patient-derived AML cells were treated with devimistat and chloroquine and assessed for viability. Primary patient samples were significantly more sensitive to the combination than either agent alone (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). These data taken together demonstrate that TCA cycle inhibition with devimistat induces autophagy-dependent mitochondrial turnover and that inhibition of either autophagy or mitochondrial fission sensitizes cells to devimistat.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Devimistat and mitophagy.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Western blot for the autophagy protein LC3B-II (LC3-II).

                <title>Mitochondrial Turnover in devimistat response is independent of PINK1 and Parkin</title>
                <p id="Par14">PINK1 and Parkin mediate the main pathway of removal of damage mitochondria. To examine if PINK and Parkin were involved in the devimistat-mediated mitochondrial turnover, AML cells expressing Parkin-mCherry fusion protein were treated with devimistat and stained with mitotracker-deep red. Confocal images revealed that devimistat-treated cells did not demonstrate punctate Parkin that co-localized to the mitochondria (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). In contrast, FCCP-treated cells did show punctate Parkin that co-localized with mitochondria consistent with this pathway being active (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). Since FCCP triggers mitophagy via loss of MMP we determined the effect of devimistat on MMP. AML cells treated with devimistat showed no decline in MMP up to 24âh post treatment (when mitochondrial turnover was detected, Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>) suggesting that changes in MMP are not responsible for devimistat induced mitochondrial turnover. As devimistat induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial ROS can trigger mitophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> we further examined mitochondrial ROS in devimistat-treated AML cells. Confirming the data in Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, devimistat significantly increased mitochondrial ROS in AML cells. In fact, devimistat induced mitochondrial ROS was far greater than that induced by 2âmM hydrogen peroxide (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). To extend this result, primary patient samples were treated with increasing amounts of devimistat and mitochondrial ROS assessed. As was seen in the cell line models, devimistat induced a robust increase in mitochondrial ROS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Intriguingly, the amount of mitochondrial ROS induced by devimistat increased with increasing age. Interestingly, mitochondrial turnover could be partially rescued by NAC, despite its effect of increasing mitochondrial ROS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). Taken together, our data support a model where devimistat triggers mitochondrial ROS and ultimately mitophagy in the PINK1/Parkin-independent pathway.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Devimistat induces mitophagy via mitochondrial ROS.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Immunofluorescence.

              <p id="Par15">The phase II study of devimistat in combination with mitoxantrone and HDAC in relapsed or refractory AML patients did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating the feasibility of maintenance devimistat. This was in part secondary to 48% (10/21) of responding patients leaving the study to pursue an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The secondary endpoints of overall remission rate and median survival at 44% and 5.9 months are consistent with other salvage regimens used in this population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. An important limitation to our study is that the age-related analysis was done post hoc and should therefore be considered hypothesis-generating only. In addition, the phase I and II studies were single-arm studies conducted at a single institution. The effect of the addition of devimistat to chemotherapy in older patients was assessed in the multicenter, randomized phase III trial, ARMADA 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, this trial was recently closed for futility. A detailed examination of the data from the trial is not yet available. The data presented here suggest that assessing differences in mitochondrial and autophagic gene expression from responders and non-responders will be crucial in determining if a subset of patients can be found that benefit.</p>
              <p id="Par16">AML is a disease of the elderly with a median onset of 68 years of age. Age is an important prognostic factor in AML with patients 60 years old or older having a much worse prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. This could be a reflection of the fact that normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) must survive for the entire human lifespan to provide the 200+ billion blood cells that are produced every day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Over time, repeated exposures to environmental carcinogens can select for those HSCs that are most resistant to DNA damage. One of the hallmarks of aging is the progressive loss of mitochondrial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The doseâresponse seen in older patients with devimistat may reflect this age-related decline in mitochondria quality and function. The respiratory chain of the mitochondria becomes less efficient as organisms, including humans, age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. AML arising in HSCs with declining mitochondria would have limited mitochondrial reserve and be more responsive to the combination of devimistat and chemotherapy. This is supported by the RNA sequence analysis showing a highly significant age-related decline in genes associated with mitochondria and the functional assays from AML induced in younger and older murine HSCs (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Consistent with this, AML cell lines with lower MMP were significantly more sensitive to the combination of devimistat and chemotherapy. This observation is also consistent with several previous studies showing chemotherapy resistance is driven by mitochondrial function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">The clinically available complex I inhibitor metformin lowered the MMP of a resistant cell line making it sensitive to devimistat and chemotherapy. Further, metformin and devimistat alone provided a survival advantage compared to chemotherapy in an aggressive AML syngeneic model. Metformin has previously been shown to sensitize AML cells to chemotherapy in preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, however, clinical benefit in AML patients taking metformin was not seen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, suggesting additional metabolic stress may be needed. The pairing of TCA cycle inhibition with complex I inhibition may represent such a strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par18">A significant negative correlation was seen in RNA sequence data of patient bone marrow with genes involved in electron transport assembly implicating mitochondrial turnover as a possible resistance mechanism. Cells with impaired TCA cycle function demonstrated a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins VDAC1 and TOM20 that was dependent on the autophagy protein ATG5 consistent with the induction of mitophagy. Interestingly, devimistat induced mitophagy was not from a decline in MMP. The ability of devimistat to generate mitochondrial ROS is consistent with previous studies in NSCLC cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Separate studies have demonstrated that ROS can induce mitophagy independently of MMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> however, that process involved the recruitment of Parkin. Devimistat-mediated mitophagy may be a ROS-dependent but Parkin-independent process not previously described. The ability of NAC to increase mitochondrial ROS has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> however the effects were seen shortly after NAC addition. How NAC is increasing mitochondrial ROS at 24âh in a devimistat-dependent manner is not clear. Additional studies will be needed to characterize this mechanism.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The age-related decline in mitochondrial quality leading to decreased MMP and increased sensitivity to devimistat combined with the age-related decline in autophagy make TCA cycle inhibition an ideal strategy to use in the treatment of older patients with cancer. Consistent with this are the results seen with devimistat in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Pancreatic cancer is also a disease of the elderly and the median age on that trial was 64. The in vivo results with metformin and devimistat results suggest a chemotherapy-free regimen could be translated to treat elderly patients. Such regimens have been tried with some success in B cell lymphomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and could be adapted to AML patients. Indeed, studies of elderly populations have shown a correlation between decreased mitochondrial respiratory capacity in blood cells and physical frailty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Thus, frail elderly patients who have the largest unmet medical need would be the most likely to benefit from this approach. Given the findings of decreased mitochondrial function in AML cells from older HSCs exploration of combined mitochondrial inhibition for the treatment of AML in the older patient is worthy of further exploration.</p>

Mice were monitored by bioluminescent imaging performed using an IVIS100 imaging system (Caliper LifeSciences, Hopkinton, MA). Mice were injected with 150âmg/kg D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO), anesthetized with isoflurane, and imaged for 2âmin. Devimistat with or without metformin was initiated upon detection of clear signals. For the PDX model, 8 week old sublethally irradiated (1âGy) NSGS mice (Jackson Laboratories) were injected with 5âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> cells. Three days following injection mice were started on treatment with devimistat, metformin, or both. Mice were treated with devimistat by oral gavage. Metformin was added to the drinking water at 5âmg/100âml. Animals were followed for survival. All mice utilized were female for ease of handling and to allow for housing of multiple animals per cage. Mice were kept up to five animals per cage. Mice were housed in a vivarium kept at 70Â° Fahrenheit and subjected to 12âh light/dark cycles.</p>
