                  <p>Clinically evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements taken with a Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) prism and a modified surface Goldmann prism examining measurement differences correlated to central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal hysteresis (CH) values.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A GAT and a modified surface GAT prism measured IOP on 243 unique eyes. The study design and methodology complied with International Standard Organization (ISO) tonometer evaluation guidelines, except the inclusion of thin (&lt;500 µm) and thick (&gt;600 µm) corneas. All eyes were randomised to IOP measurement by one of five standard Goldmann prisms and five modified prisms. Pressures were measured by six investigators, two times with each prism for a total of 1936 IOP measurements. Analysis included a multiple linear regression including CCT and CH correlation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The difference in IOP measurements of the standard and modified Goldmann prisms correlated well to CCT particularly in thin (&lt;500 µm) and thick (&gt;600 µm) corneas (R<sup>2</sup>=0.404, p=0.007). Corneal hysteresis (CH) also significantly correlated to the difference in prism measurements (R<sup>2</sup>=0.125, p=0.039). There was no significant overall mean IOP bias between the two prisms (+0.43 mm Hg in modified, p=0.19).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>The paired IOP measurement difference between GAT and a modified surface Goldmann replacement prism indicated a statistically significant correlation to CCT and CH. A simple modified replacement prism for any Goldmann-type tonometer may significantly improve IOP measurement accuracy by minimising corneal biomechanical errors associated with CCT and CH.</p>

              <p>The standard for measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) remains Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). Intraocular pressure is the clinical indicator in the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, which may lead to glaucoma. Furthermore, it is the only modifiable parameter in the treatment of glaucoma.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Errors in IOP measurement may result in potentially sight-threatening conditions.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Individual patient variability in corneal thickness, rigidity, curvature and corneal tear film has led to significant errors in GAT IOP measurement.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In addition, the corneal biomechanical differences incurred after LASIK surgery and present in children have also led to inaccuracies in GAT IOP measurement.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref>
</p>
              <p>IOP readings have been demonstrated to be underestimated in thin corneas and overestimated in thick corneas, respectively leading to a potential failure of diagnosis or over-diagnosis of glaucoma.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The preferred practice among eye care professionals has changed to consider low central corneal thickness (CCT) values as a risk factor for glaucoma comparison and progression.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> Standardisation corrections for the various other GAT IOP errors have been attempted in order to yield a comparable IOP between patients.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12</xref> The correction process in practice involves additional data collection and calculation leading to minimal clinical adoption. The IOP corrections by CCT nomograms alone are shown to be ineffective by themselves as a predictive model for glaucoma.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref>
</p>
              <p>A correcting applanation tonometry surface (CATS) tonometer prism is a Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) prism with a modified applanating surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) recently cleared the CATS tonometer prism for IOP measurement in existing Goldmann-type applanation tonometers. Alterations to the original GAT prism design include a sinusoidal curved modification of applanating surface with a compensatory increase in prism length.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Lengthening of the prism was required to maintain a zero average IOP bias between the GAT and CATS prisms over a large standard population. A zero average bias maintains long established GAT IOP bench marks (ie, borderline high at 21 mm Hg) and was required for clinical adoption as well as tonometer retrofitting without recalibration. The modified Goldmann (CATS) prism significantly decreases individual patient IOP error due to corneal biomechanical and tear-film properties. Improved IOP accuracy with the modified Goldmann (CATS) prism has been demonstrated in direct clinical GAT prism comparison and by surgically placed intracameral transducer pressure comparison.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref>

              <p>Any existing Goldmann measurement armature may be retrofitted with the modified (CATS) prism without recalibration. A clinician measures IOP using the same protocol and techniques as those currently employed in GAT measurement. A reduction in corneal biomechanical errors is achieved by partially matching the curvature of the tonometer surface to curvature of the cornea minimising the intracorneal stress during applanation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> This process minimises the contribution of total force on the prism face due to corneal deformation, measuring predominantly the IOP force.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The annular curvature away from the cornea simultaneously minimises the tear-film error.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 19</xref>
</p>
              <p>The present study was completed to evaluate the modified Goldmann (CATS) prism IOP accuracy compared with the reference GAT prism with known glaucoma risk factors such as CCT and CH in healthy subjects. Study design complies with Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff Tonometers—Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions as well as International Standards Organization (ISO) 8612:2009 standards.</p>

              <p>Enrolment included healthy subjects undergoing a series of IOP measurements with the modified (CATS) and standard GAT prisms. The design was a randomised, controlled, prospective, open-labelled, multicentre device comparison. Eligible subjects were screened, enrolled and evaluated according to the study protocol and were recruited from two sites in Arizona, USA. Participation in the study included subjects 18 years or older, meeting the protocol criteria, who provided written informed consent.</p>

                <p>Healthy adult subjects were enrolled into the study to include high-astigmatism and refractive errors, as well as high IOP. Specifically, both thin and thick corneas with a CCT &gt;600 µm and &lt;500 µm were included. The sample size was calculated at 70 eyes (of those in the thin and thick CCT range) based on statistically significant correlation probability from previous studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–18 20</xref>

                <title>Protocol</title>
                <p>Each enrolled subject received a standard ophthalmic examination from one of six investigators. CCT was measured by an assistant investigator with a Zeiss HD-OCT-5000 spectral domain ocular coherence tomographer (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Corneal topography was completed with a Zeiss Atlas model 9000 (Jena, Germany) using the central 3 mm diameter of the cornea for analysis in accordance with ANSI Z80.23. An Ocular Response Analyzer was used to measure corneal hysteresis (CH) (Reichert, Depew, New York, USA) according to its instruction for use. Each investigator was masked to the results of the assistant investigator’s results and were also masked to the randomised and alternated use of the CATS and reference GAT prism devices, chosen by a random number generator. Topical anaesthetic drops were applied prior to each measurement with fluorescein (fluorescein sodium and benoxinate hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.25%/0.4%; Bausch &amp; Lomb, Tampa, Florida, USA). A calibrated Haag-Streit model 900 applanation tonometer armature (Mason, Ohio, USA) was used to measure IOP with one of five cleaned and disinfected Haag-Streit reference GAT prisms and one of five CATS prisms. Pressure measurements were made two times with each GAT and CATS prism (one measurement consisted of averaged measurements at 180 and 90 degrees for astigmatism correction). Sequential measurements more than 2 mm Hg different required a third measurement. All three measurements were then averaged, if the third was within the range of the first two, otherwise the measurements were discarded.

                <p>The primary endpoint was CCT corrected accuracy of IOP measurement readings, as measured by applanation tonometry. The criteria for success was the difference in IOP readings between modified (CATS) and GAT demonstrating a statistically significant correlation to CCT in accordance with standard published Dresdner CCT correction. Using the modified (CATS) tonometer prism and the Goldmann tonometer (GAT) prism to measure IOP enrolment continued until a minimum of 70 eligible eyes were identified equally in the high CCT (&gt;600 µm) and low CCT (&lt;500 µm) cornea categories. The sample population from a previous sister study of 172 eyes, which was limited to corneas with nominal CCTs (between 500 µm and 600 µm), was included in the CCT correlation to ensure continuity across the spectrum of probable CCT values.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The study set of 173 eyes was run concurrently with the present study (70 eyes) using the identical protocol and clinical investigators.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>A significant reduction in modified Goldmann (CATS) prism’s sensitivity to CCT and CH was demonstrated in the clinical study when compared with the standard GAT prism. The results extend the narrow CCT correlation findings in the previously published, concurrently run study with limited CCT values between 500 and 600 µm.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>Additionally, the results verify published modified (CATS)/standard GAT prism comparisons including intracameral pressure differences between modified and standard GAT prism measurements correlated to CCT and CH.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–19</xref> There were no device failures nor adverse events. The modified (CATS) and GAT prisms showed no differences in measurement based on age, gender or IOP, but indicated a statistically significant correlation with the degree of astigmatism. The CATS prism has been shown to have a decreased sensitivity to corneal curvature which may be associated with the astigmatism correlation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>
</p>
              <p>Major sources of Goldmann IOP measurement error include individual patient variation in the rigidity of the cornea which is a function of both its CCT and intrinsic modulus of elasticity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11 12 17 21</xref> Additionally, patient variability in the corneal curvature and tear film contribute significantly to the error.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 19</xref> The CATS prism’s concave-convex applanation surface is a modelled iterative parametric solution to simultaneously minimise all four sources of error.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Both CCT and CH are recognised corneal biomechanical metrics associated with error in GAT IOP measurement.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 8–12 22 23</xref> Corneal hysteresis (CH) is a dynamic measurement of corneal energy absorption from an impulse force which has an indirect relationship to global corneal elasticity produced by CCT and the cornea’s modulus of elasticity.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The present study demonstrates a decreased sensitivity to variations in CH with the modified CATS compared with the GAT, which is likely reflective of CATS design minimising errors due to corneal biomechanical variability. Many studies have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo the correlation between CCT and CH to Goldmann IOP measurement error.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 17 21 24</xref> With respect to CCT, studies have produced GAT CCT correction algorithms which produce a more accurate GAT IOP when compared with true intracameral pressure.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12 17 21</xref> However, these CCT corrections have not demonstrated a more accurate predictive clinical model for primary open-angle glaucoma.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Presently, clinical evidence only indicates that low CCT and low CH values are risk factors for glaucoma progression.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14 24 25</xref> CCT is only one source of error and its correction alone is likely insufficient to correct GAT IOP producing a clinically effective predictive model for glaucoma.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 24 26</xref>
</p>
              <p>The present study presents evidence that a simple modified (CATS) replacement prism on any Goldmann-type tonometer may significantly improve the IOP measurement accuracy of a Goldmann tonometer. This advancement in Goldmann technology may further its use as the standard of care in the diagnosis and treatment of pressure-related diseases.</p>
              <p>Future studies will examine the modified (CATS) prism and standard GAT prism IOP measurements in problematic patient populations. For the same reasons that the modified (CATS) prism demonstrates decreased corneal biomechanical sensitivity, it will likely afford improved IOP accuracy in both paediatric and post-refractive surgery patients. Planned studies will be conducted on patients before and after LASIK refractive procedures as well as on paediatric patients comparing with intracameral pressure. These two populations comprise nearly 30% of the population.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 23</xref> Additional studies are underway examining the difference in CATS and GAT IOP measurement differences in patients with keratoconus before and after corneal cross-linking as well as examining paired IOP differences with the introduction of topical prostaglandin analogues for glaucoma. Changes in the difference in CATS and GAT IOP measurements may reflect changes in overall corneal elasticity.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
