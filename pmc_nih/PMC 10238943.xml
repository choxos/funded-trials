                  <p>Among 452 families invited to participate, 220 children were enrolled, and 162 children (mean [SD] age, 9.16 [1.99] years; 136 [84.0%] male) with confirmed autism were randomized, with 83 children receiving RDE first and 80 children receiving SADE first. Most children (94 children [58.0%]) had moderate autism severity. Children had significantly lower physiological stress during dental care in SADE compared with RDE (mean difference in skin conductance level, −1.22 [95% CI, −2.17 to −0.27] μS), suggesting decreased sympathetic activity and increased relaxation during SADE dental care. No significant differences were found in nonspecific skin conductance responses (mean difference, −0.30 [95% CI, −0.86 to 0.25] per min). Video-coded frequency and duration of behavioral distress (but not questionnaire) measures were significantly lower in SADE vs RDE (Cohen <italic>d</italic> = −0.84 to −1.19). Physiological stress was associated with behavioral distress during the dental cleaning (eg, nonspecific skin conductance responses associated with the Frankl Scale: β = −0.29; 95% CI, −0.39 to −0.19); age, IQ, and expressive communication moderated the intervention’s success. No participants withdrew due to adverse effects.</p>

The study was approved by the institutional review board at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) and University of Southern California. All parents or guardians of participants provided informed consent, and participants provided assent when possible.

Exclusionary criteria included current or scheduled orthodontic braces; using anticholinergic medication; sibling of enrolled participant; genetic, endocrine, or metabolic dysfunction (eg, Down syndrome); significant motor impairment (eg, cerebral palsy); significant oral condition (eg, cleft palate); or medical condition placing the child at increased risk in the study (eg, uncontrolled seizures).</p>
                <p>Families were recruited using a consecutive sampling strategy from an extensive network, including health clinics (eg, CHLA dental clinic), community service providers (eg, developmental disability service providers, resource fairs), therapy and behavioral clinics, patient referrals, parent support groups, social media, and the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>

                  <title>Intervention Dental Visits</title>
                  <p>Children participated in 2 routine dental cleanings approximately 6 months apart. Both cleanings were performed in a standard manner (oral examination, prophylaxis, fluoride) by second-year residents of a 2-year advanced pediatric dentistry program (provides didactic and clinical training required for the specialty) in the same private dental clinic room. Approximately 1 to 2 weeks before each dental visit, a tailored (eg, child sex, language, dental visit condition) social story was provided to participants; parents read it to their child several times to familiarize them with the upcoming dental visit (a copy may be requested from L.I.S.D).</p>
                  <p>The RDE (control) condition included no modifications. The SADE (experimental) condition included sensory-based modifications based on principles of Ayres sensory integration theory<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and multisensory environments.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> For the visual sensory domain, all overhead fluorescent lights and the dental operatory lamp were turned off and darkening curtains were applied to windows. A glasses-mounted headlight directed light into the child’s mouth (avoiding eyes), and slow-moving visual effects (ie, bubbles or fish scenes chosen by the child or parent) were projected onto the ceiling in the child’s visual field. For the auditory sensory domain, a playlist of calming music (eg, classical music with nature sounds) played in the room via a small speaker. Finally, for the tactile and deep pressure domain, a butterfly-shaped wrap,<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> weighted with a pediatric dental radiograph vest was used to apply deep tactile pressure stimuli to the child. The butterfly wrap fit around the dental chair, with the wings wrapping around the child from shoulders to ankles to provide a calming deep hug sensation.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> While all SADE modifications were intended to be calming, if the child or parent felt uncomfortable about some aspect of the procedure, study protocol dictated that it would be discontinued on request. An implementation checklist was used for both dental conditions to ensure fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Dental cleanings began in July 2016 and ended in April 2022; due to COVID-19 precautions, data collection was suspended March 2020 to January 2021. No changes in dental care protocols occurred during the study period. We examined visits before vs after COVID-19 as a potentially moderating variable.</p>

Although this study did not exhibit excessive loss to follow-up, we recognize the effect missing data can have on results and that even robust statistical methods cannot account for bias introduced by data not-missing-at-random. Therefore, multiple analytic methods were used to ensure that results did not differ materially by method. Methods included paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, linear mixed-effects regression, and linear mixed-effects regression with square root transformation, with all methods fully recognizing the correlation between within-individual observations. To account for missing data, mixed-effects regression models based on restricted maximum likelihood estimation (generally considered to be superior to multiple imputation in accounting for missing data) were used.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>

                  <title>Mediation Analyses</title>
                  <p>We proposed to test the hypothesis that a favorable difference in secondary outcomes (distress behavior, pain, sensory discomfort) between SADE and RDE was mediated by physiological stress (SCL or NS-SCR frequency). For physiological stress to mediate the difference between SADE and RDE outcomes, outcomes would need to differ for SADE vs RDE, and physiological stress would need to be associated with both SADE and RDE and the outcome. If there were no significant differences between SADE and RDE for most of the secondary outcomes (pain, sensory discomfort, behavioral distress measured by CDBRS), there would be no mediation of these outcomes. Nevertheless, understanding whether lack of association between the treatment and those outcomes was due to lack of association between the treatment and the mediators or lack of association between the mediators and the outcomes would be informative; such analyses used mixed-effects regression with adjustment for attained age and first and second clinic visit, with EDA values square-root transformed (eMethods in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>

Participants were a mean (SD) age of 9.16 (1.99) years, and most participants (136 participants [84.0%]) were male. There were 13 Asian participants (8.0%), 14 Black participants (8.6%), no American Indian participants, 1 Pacific Islander participant (0.6%), 124 White participants (76.5%), and 10 participants (6.2%) identified as more than 1 race; 117 participants (72.2%) were Hispanic and 45 participants (27.8%) were non-Hispanic. Most children (94 children [58.0%]) had moderate autism severity (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Most of the missing data in this study were due to participants not attending the second dental visit. Children who completed only 1 dental cleaning were demographically similar to those who completed 2 cleanings; only sensory overresponsivity was significantly different between the groups, with parents of the children receiving only 1 cleaning reporting significantly more overresponsivity compared with those completing both dental cleanings (mean [SD] SensOR score, 34.08 [15.48] vs 27.38 [13.54]; <italic>P</italic> = .03) (eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). No significant demographic differences were found between the children who completed 2 dental cleanings stratified by order of intervention condition (<xref rid="zoi230498t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Video-coded frequency and duration of behavioral distress were associated with treatment condition, so the mediating effect of physiological stress on this association was assessed. For all video-coded frequency and duration behavioral distress outcomes, the β estimate for treatment effect was lower when physiological anxiety was added to the model, indicating that it was mediating some portion of the treatment effect. However, the treatment effect remained highly significant for each outcome, suggesting that physiological anxiety did not fully explain the difference in outcomes due to treatment (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). For frequency of head movement, mouth movement, and whimper, cry, or scream, NS-SCR frequency was associated with outcome independent of treatment and SCL, while NS-SCR frequency was not associated with whimper, cry, or scream duration independent of treatment and SCL. SCL was not associated with any of the outcomes independent of treatment and NS-SCR frequency.</p>
                <p>Because the other questionnaire-based behavioral outcomes were not associated with treatment condition, we wanted to see whether the null association was due to a lack of association between behaviors and physiological stress. However, physiological stress and anxiety (measured via EDA), were found to be associated with behavioral distress and dental-related sensory discomfort (eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, dental cleaning SCL was significantly associated with behavioral distress (Anxiety and Cooperation scale: standardized β = 0.13 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.24]; Frankl scale: β = −0.11 [95% CI, −0.22 to −0.01]). Dental cleaning NS-SCR frequency was likewise significantly associated with behavioral distress (Anxiety and Cooperation scale: β = 0.32 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.42]; Frankl scale: β = −0.29 [95% CI, −0.39 to −0.19]; Children’s Dental Behavior Rating scale: β = 0.21 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32]; head movement frequency: β = 0.12 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.21]; mouth movement frequency: β = 0.21 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.32]; whimper, cry, or scream frequency: β = 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.22]) and dental-related sensory discomfort (β = 0.18 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.35]). In addition, baseline NS-SCR was associated with behavioral distress during the dental cleaning (Anxiety and Cooperation scale: β = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.25]; Children’s Dental Behavior Rating scale: β = 0.13 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.24]; head movement frequency: β = 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.19]; mouth movement frequency: β = 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.25]) and sensory discomfort (β = 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.42]).</p>

However, age, full-scale IQ, expressive communication, and sensory overresponsivity were significant effect moderators for behavioral distress, as measured by duration and frequency, suggesting that SADE was more efficacious in decreasing behavioral indicators of distress in younger children (ie, ages 6-9 years), as well as those with lower IQ, expressive communication, or sensory overresponsivity (eTable 5 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230498-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>This randomized crossover study found that dental cleanings performed in SADE elicited significantly lower sympathetic activation, as measured by SCL, compared with RDE throughout the entirety of the dental encounter, suggesting that children were more relaxed and less physiologically anxious during care in SADE. This finding supports previous studies reporting the efficacy of SADE to decrease a variety of physiological measures of stress and anxiety in smaller sample sizes of autistic children,<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> children with developmental disabilities,<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Although SCL and NS-SCRs are widely used in research as indicators of sympathetic activation, it should be noted that they are only moderately positively correlated<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and may measure different sympathetic constructs, with some research suggesting that SCL is more responsive to fear while NS-SCRs increase more in anger.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These nuanced differences in sympathetic arousal may explain why our results found significant decreases in SCL but not NS-SCR frequency when comparing conditions.</p>
              <p>Children in this study also exhibited significantly decreased overt behavioral distress indicators, as measured by frequency and duration of distress behavior, in SADE compared with RDE. This finding supports previous research indicating a positive behavioral impact of SADE.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> As uncooperative behavior is commonly reported as a barrier to care for autistic children,<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> use of SADE is a potential technique to support care and enhance successful experiences for this population.</p>
              <p>Although we found significant improvements in frequency and duration of distress behavior, there were no significant changes in the CDBRS, Frankl Scale, or Anxiety and Cooperation Scale. We hypothesize this may be due to a lack of sensitivity of these measures to assess change. A random measurement error can cause results that cluster around the true value but which are imprecise. For example, the Frankl and Anxiety and Cooperation scales are 4- and 6-point Likert Scales, respectively, and the CDBRS codes only a dichotomous presence or absence for distress variables. Although Kim et al<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> reported a significant decrease in uncooperative behavior for children with developmental disabilities in SADE compared with RDE using the Frankl Scale, they used a modified scoring rubric. The remaining studies that have reported behavior improvements in SADE vs RDE all used measurements of frequency, duration, or magnitude of distress behavior, similar to this study.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230498r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Similarly, there were no significant changes in child perception of pain and sensory discomfort, which we also believe may be due to a lack of sensitivity (6- and 3-point scales, respectively).</p>
              <p>EDA was significantly lower at baseline in SADE vs RDE, suggesting that simply lying in the sensory-adapted room prior to treatment elicited relaxation. EDA at baseline was also significantly associated with future sympathetic activation during the cleaning, overt distress behavior, and child-report of sensory discomfort. Therefore, these results support the potential impact of environmental factors on stress and relaxation immediately on entering the dental operatory and extending throughout the duration of the dental encounter.</p>
              <p>Similar to the findings of Kim et al,<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> no demographic variables of interest moderated the effect of SADE on physiological distress in our study, suggesting that SADE is equally efficacious in reducing sympathetic activation for autistic children regardless of demographic differences. However, as expected, age, IQ, and expressive communication were associated with moderating multiple measures of frequency and duration of behavioral distress; this is especially meaningful, since children with lower IQ or communication are less likely to respond to other approaches to reduce stress during medical procedures that rely more on verbal means. Although surprising, the absence of moderation due to child sensory overresponsivity, dental fear, or anxiety may be due to a lack of meaningful variation in these variables in our sample; perhaps once some minimal threshold of sensory overresponsivity, dental fear, or anxiety is met, SADE no longer differentially impacts care.</p>
              <p>The SADE approach is highly scalable, as it requires minimal training to implement, is easily portable, does not involve renovations, requires only 5 to 10 minutes to set up or remove, and incurs a 1-time cost of less than $6000. In practice settings, this equipment could remain set up indefinitely, with clinicians able to use (or not use) SADE adaptations for any given patient. One of the greatest challenges with implementation of newly developed interventions is the translation of research into practice. Due to the simplicity and high scalability of SADE, it has outstanding potential to be readily implemented into dental clinics nationwide. In fact, SADE has recently been added to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry’s best practices for behavioral guidance as a potential technique for dental patients with anxiety or special health care needs.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Future research should investigate the effectiveness of SADE to improve behavioral and physiological distress in autistic children in a multisite effectiveness trial, disentangle whether the individual components of SADE separately improve outcomes or whether SADE’s success is due to its application as a whole package; examine the possible long-term effects of SADE, determine the impact of SADE on the dental team, consider further tailoring of treatment based on child characteristics and interests, and identify other populations and medical procedures that may benefit from this approach.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has some limitations; however, implementing lessons learned from our pilot study enabled us to successfully avoid many in the execution of this study. First, despite our efforts to minimize the burden to study participation, our attrition rate was greater than anticipated, with 162 participants completing 1 dental cleaning and 138 participants completing 2, from the original 220 participants enrolled. Study features minimizing the potential effect of missing data included that participants with one dental cleaning were demographically similar to those with 2, any unmeasured participant characteristic associated with missing a dental visit would have been equally likely to have been randomized to SADE first as to RDE first, and use of statistical methods where data are missing completely at random is not required. Second, because our consecutive sampling strategy, our sex distribution reflects more closely the autism distribution reported in the community (1 girl to 4 boys). Future research should examine possible sex-specific differences for SADE, since there are documented health-related sex differences in the autistic population.<sup><xref rid="zoi230498r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Because this recruitment strategy only confirmed eligibility of those contacted by the team, we are unable to generalize results to potentially eligible participants who were not enrolled; this issue of generalizability could also apply to participants who attended only 1 dental cleaning. Third, due to the nature of our environmental modifications, it was not possible to blind all outcome measures. To address this, we ensured that at least 16% to 20% of videos were independently double-coded to improve accuracy and included blinded measures (EDA), which still yielded significant results. Fourth, although we believe a permanent SADE equipment set-up would not impact clinical workflow or turnover time between patients, this must be formally assessed in future research.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This randomized crossover trial is the first large-scale study, to our knowledge, to examine the efficacy of a SADE to improve dental care for autistic children. Findings support the use of SADE to significantly improve both physiological and behavioral distress in this population during routine dental cleanings. Use of SADE is relatively inexpensive, scalable, and easy to implement with minimal training.</p>
