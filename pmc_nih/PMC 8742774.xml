                <p>A noninvasive test to discriminate indolent prostate cancers from lethal ones would focus treatment where necessary while reducing overtreatment. We exploited the known activity of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as a chaperone critical for the function of numerous oncogenic drivers, including the androgen receptor and its variants, to detect aggressive prostate cancer. We linked a near-infrared fluorescing molecule to an HSP90 binding drug and demonstrated that this probe (designated HS196) was highly sensitive and specific for detecting implanted prostate cancer cell lines with greater uptake by more aggressive subtypes. In a phase I human study, systemically administered HS196 could be detected in malignant nodules within prostatectomy specimens. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified uptake of HS196 by malignant prostate epithelium from the peripheral zone (<italic toggle="yes">AMACR<sup>+</sup>ERG<sup>+</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup></italic> cells), including <italic toggle="yes">SYP<sup>+</sup></italic> neuroendocrine cells that are associated with therapeutic resistance and metastatic progression. A theranostic version of this molecule is under clinical testing.</p>

              <p>Screening for prostate cancer currently relies on serologic testing of PSA levels; however, many prostate cancers detected by rising PSA levels behave indolently (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>), and, thus, many patients undergo unnecessary biopsies and therapy. This highlights the need for a noninvasive modality to focus attention on early malignancies with more aggressive biological potential.</p>
              <p>Hallmarks of aggressive biological behavior such as rapid local invasion and distant spread require high levels of molecules that drive cellular growth and differentiation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>), many of which rely on the chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) for their proper conformation and function (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref>). Indeed, Hsp90 expression and behavior is often altered in poor-prognosis malignancies (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–14</xref>). Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> detection of Hsp90 could serve as a noninvasive method for identifying clinically aggressive malignancies. We demonstrated in preclinical models of breast cancer (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) that HSP90 could be used as an imaging target to identify breast cancers with aggressive phenotypes (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16, 17</xref>).</p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> molecular imaging frequently depends on radioactive probes that can be detected by SPECT or PET imagers. Hsp90-targeted PET imaging using <sup>124</sup>I-tethered Hsp90 inhibitor (PU-H71) was shown to detect various cancer types, including prostate and breast cancers, demonstrating tumor-selective accumulation and long retention of the radiotracer (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To avoid the complexities of nuclear medicine imaging, we linked a near-infrared (nIR) probe to an analogue of the Hsp90 ATP-binding domain inhibitor SNX-5422 (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 19</xref>). This Hsp90-targeting nIR probe, while capable of imaging all molecular subtypes of murine and human BC, was more effectively taken up by aggressive and highly metastatic clones (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For the current work, we developed a new Hsp90-targeting probe (HS196) linked to an nIR molecule that fluoresces at a longer wavelength, allowing imaging of deeper structures. We tested this probe in preclinical prostate models, developed a clinical-grade reagent, and performed a phase I dose escalation study to demonstrate safety and uptake in early prostate cancers. We found that this novel probe could discriminate indolent disease from aggressive—potentially reaching an unmet milestone in the diagnosis of life-threatening forms of prostate cancer.</p>

                <p>We have previously generated a series of Hsp90 inhibitors tethered to fluorophores to detect Hsp90 <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). One of these molecules, HS131, consists of an Hsp90 inhibitor tethered to a cyanine dye, which has an excitation wavelength of 640 nm and an emission wavelength of 680 nm. For the potential clinical application as an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging reagent, we aimed to achieve deeper tissue penetration and better visualization of malignant lesions, and thus developed a similar more soluble molecule, denoted HS196, with peak absorption at 790 nm and peak emission at 800 nm. To evaluate nonspecific dye uptake, HS199, an nIR dye lacking an Hsp90 binding moiety, was developed as a control molecule. The synthesis methods for HS196 and HS199 were similar to those reported previously for HS131 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The detailed HS196 synthesis method is shown in Supplementary Methods. Clinical-grade HS196 for use in the phase I clinical trial was produced by Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) and filled and finished by Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing. Toxicology studies were performed by Charles River Laboratories.</p>

                <p>For the imaging of tumors in mice, HS196 or HS199 (0.1–100 nmol) was dissolved in DMSO (20 μL per injection) and administered via tail vein. Mouse whole body images were taken over time using the LI-COR Pearl Trilogy imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences), whereas mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane. The 800-nm channel of the system was used for the detection of fluorescence signals of HS196 and HS199, and the fluorescence signals were analyzed using ImageStudio software (version 5.0.21, LI-COR). Selected regions of interest covering the tumor area were analyzed for fluorescence intensity and fluorescence intensity per area.

Plasma samples were stored at −80°C until the analysis. For the mouse PK study, tumor and several organs/tissues were collected at the same time points as blood and stored at −80°C along with plasma samples.

                <p>The clinical phase I clinical trial was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Code of Federal Regulations and guided by the ethical principles of the Belmont Report, under an FDA-approved Investigational New Drug Exemption and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03333031). Participants were recruited from medical, surgical, and urologic oncology clinics at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, and provided written informed consent under a protocol approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The protocol was originally written to enroll patients, age ≥18 years, with a diagnosis of (or suspected) solid malignancy, stages I–IV, for which surgery or biopsy was planned; however, early in the study, based on our preliminary data and interest of clinical collaborators, a decision was made to focus on prostate cancer patients who would be undergoing radical prostatectomies. All were required to have ECOG Performance Score 0 or 1, estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 months, and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. A safety study with the estimation of the maximum tolerated dose was performed by a dose escalation strategy referred to as EWOC (Escalation With Overdose Control). Toxicity was assessed using CTCAE version 4.0 toxicity criteria. The doses selected for each patient in the trial (in mg) was planned to be one of the following 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mg. No dose was skipped during a dose escalation. For this publication, the 7-mg dose was the last dose utilized. HS196 was administered as a single 5-mL slow intravenous push (1 mL per minute) over a maximum of 15 minutes followed by a saline flush. Administration of HS196 was required to occur within 36 hours prior to the scheduled start time for surgery to resect the malignancy. Tissue from the surgery as available was tested in the LI-COR Odyssey CLx for <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> imaging of tumors. Fluorescence images of gross specimens were generated using a hand-held Fluobeam device (Fluoptics). Slices of tumor were visualized with a NIR microscope. Standard-of-care MRI scans of the pelvis were obtained for review.</p>

A targeted cell recovery of 7,000 cells was used for each tumor sample. Gene-expression libraries were created for each sample. Generated cDNA and final GEX libraries were quality checked using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 at Duke Microbiome Core Facility and submitted to MedGenome Inc. for sequencing on a NovaSeq S4 instrument.

                <p>We previously reported HSP90-specific uptake of an HSP90-nIR conjugate (HS131) in a variety of breast cancers. For the current study, in order to allow greater penetration of the nIR energy for imaging deeper tumor, we produced a water-soluble imaging probe (called HS196) by linking the Hsp90 inhibitor to a different nIR dye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) with peak absorption at 790 nm and peak emission at 800 nm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). As a control, we also generated HS199, which consists of an inactive form of Hsp90 inhibitor unable to bind to Hsp90, linked to the same soluble nIR dye (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Because our previous studies with the HS131 were performed in breast cancer models, for the present study, we determined the dose that resulted in the optimal tumor to background fluorescence ratio for HS196 using an implanted breast cancer model. Following intravenous administration of HS196, the absolute fluorescence of HS196 from tumor and background increased as the dose increased (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), but the dose of HS196 that provided the optimal tumor to background fluorescence ratio was in the range of 10 to 25 nmol (Supplementary Fig. S1C), resulting in high and prolonged tumor uptake (Supplementary Fig. S1D) but minimal normal tissue uptake except for liver and kidney (Supplementary Fig. S1E).</p>

                <title>Uptake and retention of HS196 is enhanced in prostate cancer cells with more aggressive characteristics</title>
                <p>We previously demonstrated Hsp90-specific uptake of HS131, our prototype Hsp90-targetted probe, into more aggressive breast cancers in our prior work (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We therefore wished to determine whether similar observations would be made with other tumor types where more accurate diagnosis remains a challenge such as human prostate cancer. Using human prostate cancer cell lines, we demonstrated greater HS196 fluorescence intensity within the aggressive androgen receptor (AR)-negative, androgen-irresponsive prostate cancer cell line PC3 and moderately aggressive AR-negative, androgen-irresponsive cell line DU145, and least in the indolent androgen-responsive cell line LNCaP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). We also tested the HS196 uptake by the 22Rv1 cell line, which expresses constitutively active splice variants of AR (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26, 27</xref>), grows in an androgen-independent manner, and possesses features of clinically aggressive, therapy-resistant disease. When the two AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines, 22Rv1 and LNCaP, were compared, greater HS196 fluorescence intensity was demonstrated for the 22Rv1 tumors compared with the LNCaP tumors <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. These data indicate that HS196 selectively identifies aggressively behaving prostate cancers.</p>

                <title>Preclinical pharmacokinetics</title>
                <p>In tumor-bearing mice, the PK profile of plasma, tumor, and organs/tissue was investigated over 7 days. Detailed parameters of plasma PK analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S1. The plasma concentration/time profile reveals multiple processes with two main exponential decays (presumably distribution to tissues and elimination from the central compartment) responsible for 97% of the extrapolated initial concentration of HS196 within the first 8 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Importantly, we observed higher concentrations and longer retention of HS196 in tumor tissue compared with other major organs (e.g., brain, lung, liver, and kidney) and tissues (e.g., muscle, fat, and skin). HS196 concentrations begin exceeding other tissue concentrations within the first few hours and all tissues by 24 hours. These data support the feasibility of imaging with HS196 based on its tumor selectivity. Clearance was low (0.1 L/h/kg), i.e., 1.2% of total plasma cardiac output (∼8.6 L/h/kg in adult mouse; using average mouse hematocrit 41%; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Volume of distribution at steady state (<italic toggle="yes">V</italic><sub>ss</sub> = 0.265 L/kg; average from noncompartmental and compartmental modeling; Supplementary Table S1) was ∼6-fold higher than total plasma volume (∼0.046 L/kg in adult mouse; ref. <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), suggesting high distribution of HS196 to tissues, as proven by both fluorescence and LC/MS/MS measurements. Average mouse hematocrit (41%) was used for plasma volume calculations (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

Five had prostate cancer and one had a biliary malignancy. The doses received were 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 mg. One prostate cancer patient did not proceed to surgery due to medical issues unrelated to study drug administration. There were no adverse events referable to the HS196, except one patient reported dry eyes (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). PK analyses demonstrated dose proportionality of the HS196 in peripheral blood (Supplementary Fig. S2A).

Detailed parameters of plasma PK analysis are shown in Supplementary Table S2. As in the preclinical testing, there were multiple processes with two main exponential decays observed within first 4 hours. Average clearance was slightly lower than in mouse (0.07 L/h/kg), but considering a lower plasma cardiac output in human (∼2.7 L/h/kg; ref. <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), relative clearance is higher than in mouse (2.6% vs. 1.2%, respectively).

The LI-COR Odyssey was able to detect HS196 in tissue sections at sites of gross tumor. To confirm that fluorescence represented tissue uptake of HS196, samples from sites of tissue (prostate or liver) with fluorescence were analyzed for concentration of HS196. The concentration of HS196 was greater in the tissues with fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. S2C) following HS196 administration than samples without fluorescence.

                <p>Patient prostatectomy samples were disaggregated and HS196 positive and negative cells were sorted for single-cell RNA-seq analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Cells were clustered and cell types identified using canonical markers (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Multiple cell types were confirmed, including epithelial cells, stromal cells, and immune cells. To characterize the epithelial cells (<italic toggle="yes">EPCAM<sup>+</sup></italic>), this population was reclustered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), and gene expression within these 6 new clusters was evaluated. Gene-expression analysis clearly distinguishes them into cells from the transition/central (<italic toggle="yes">KRT13<sup>+</sup></italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SCGB1A1<sup>+</sup></italic>) and peripheral zones (<italic toggle="yes">KLK3<sup>+</sup></italic>) of the prostate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>; ref. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Interestingly, most of the <italic toggle="yes">EPCAM<sup>+</sup></italic> epithelial cells from the peripheral zone (clusters 1 and 4) were positively labeled with HS196 (98.5%), whereas the majority of HS196-negative epithelial cells were from the transition/central zone (clusters 2, 3, 5, and 6; 93.2%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Peripheral zone HS196<sup>+</sup> cells (clusters 1 and 4) showed high expression of known prostate tumor markers including <italic toggle="yes">TMPRSS2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AMACR</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERG</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">AR</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). In addition, a population of peripheral zone HS196<sup>+</sup> cells also expressed <italic toggle="yes">SYP</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ENO2</italic>, indicative of neuroendocrine cells, which have been linked to therapeutic resistance and progression of prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig. S4B; refs. <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34, 35</xref>). Importantly, <italic toggle="yes">AMACR<sup>+</sup> EPCAM<sup>+</sup></italic> prostate cancer cells were almost all HS196 positive (95.1%), showing the efficient labeling of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> cancer cells by HS196 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). A small population of <italic toggle="yes">AMACR<sup>+</sup></italic> HS196-positive cells were found in the transition zone, which may suggest multifocal occurrence of prostate cancer in the patient. <italic toggle="yes">EPCAM<sup>+</sup></italic> cells expressing <italic toggle="yes">SOX2 or MYC</italic>, key factors in inducing pluripotency in somatic cells and prostate cancer stem cells (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36, 37</xref>), were also positively labeled with HS196, suggesting the possible therapeutic intervention against prostate cancer stem cells via Hsp90-targeting strategies (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Gene-expression analysis identified remaining populations as basal epithelium (cluster 2), a mixture of hillock (<italic toggle="yes">KRT13<sup>+</sup></italic>), and club cells (<italic toggle="yes">SCGB1A1<sup>+</sup></italic>; clusters 3 and 6, both with high <italic toggle="yes">PSCA</italic>) and a noncanonical cluster of prostate epithelium (cluster 5; Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The detection of localized cancers relies on physical exam and anatomic imaging that have modest sensitivity and specificity and provide limited information about their potential biological behavior. Because biological behavior is frequently driven by aberrant signaling (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 5</xref>), we hypothesized that detection of a global marker of this signaling could identify those tumors most likely to progress. Heat shock proteins, such as Hsp90, are critical chaperones involved in proper folding and trafficking of a number of molecules including oncogenic proteins (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7–11</xref>). In prostate cancers, heat shock protein expression is associated with aggressive biology (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref>).</p>
              <p>We previously demonstrated that an nIR-linked HSP90 targeting drug (HS131) could identify the most aggressive breast cancers (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In order to develop a probe that could be imaged in deeper structures, we generated HS196, which consists of the same Hsp90 targeting drug linked to an nIR probe that fluoresces at a longer wavelength. We found that HS196 had a prolonged retention time within breast and prostate cancers in preclinical models, allowing imaging over an extended time period. In the human studies, HS196 was well tolerated with no significant toxicity and fluorescence could be detected in prostate cancers at both the cellular and tissue levels, demonstrating potential clinical utility for detecting <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> tumors and positive resection margins in real time during surgeries by using nIR imaging devices, such as Fluobeam.</p>
              <p>An important advantage of imaging HSP90 with small-molecule drugs is that the probe is not perfusion dependent, but rather depends on diffusion and specific binding, thus marking the cells with the highest Hsp90 expression. In our previous experience with HS131, we observed that surface expression of Hsp90 correlated with metastatic potential of breast cancer (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similarly, in prostate cancer, extracellular Hsp90 was shown to induce tumor growth, suppress E-cadherin, and initiate localized invasion dependent on EZH2 function (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and was expressed by aggressive phenotypes (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the current studies, HS196 uptake was observed in multiple models of prostate cancer, including the most aggressively growing prostate subtypes. Detectable tissue levels by both direct quantitative measurement (LC/MS/MS) and fluorescence imaging of clinical specimens confirmed HS196 uptake by prostate cancers that were clinically diagnosed by preoperative MR imaging. Further, the single-cell sorting and confocal microscopy studies confirmed that in humans the HS196 also binds to and is retained by tumor cells, including neuroendocrine cells of the prostate, which have been linked to therapeutic resistance and progression (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35, 41</xref>). This may also allow for earlier detection of neuroendocrine recurrence of prostate cancer, which is otherwise not identified by rising PSA. In fact, the PC-3 cell line, which demonstrated the greatest avidity for HS196 in our preclinical model, displays neuroendocrine differentiation (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p>
              <p>In summary, as observed previously with HS131, the nIR dye-tethered Hsp90 inhibitor HS196, which has utility for imaging deeper tumors and avoids the need for nuclear imaging, was able to detect multiple different subtypes of prostate cancer with the greatest uptake occurring in cancers with higher metastatic potential. Due to the rapid uptake and prolonged retention time of the HS196, it is feasible to administer it over a wide range of times before imaging, thus allowing for both conventional imaging and imaging during procedures such as surgery. Our next study is confirming the <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> fluorescence in humans undergoing biopsy of mammographically detected breast cancers.</p>
              <p>In addition to imaging of prostate cancer with an Hsp90-targeted strategy, Hsp90 has also been studied as a therapeutic target in a variety of cancers, including prostate cancer. Although Hsp90 inhibitors as a monotherapy showed limited antitumor efficacy in clinical studies due to their toxicities, preliminary experience suggests that combination strategies with chemotherapeutic reagents or other small-molecule inhibitors may have more activity (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 43–46</xref>). Furthermore, we have also developed a therapeutic version of our Hsp90-binding drug by replacing the near IR molecule with a photosensitizing molecule and demonstrating focal tumor destruction when laser light was applied (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Studies of this molecule (HS201) are opening shortly.</p>
