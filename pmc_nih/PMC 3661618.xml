              <abstract>
                <p>Obesity is associated with increased adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration, and rodent studies suggest that inflammatory factors produced by ATMs contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. However, a relationship between ATM content and insulin resistance has not been clearly established in humans. Since thiazolidinediones attenuate adipose tissue inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, we examined the temporal relationship of the effects of pioglitazone on these two parameters. The effect of 10 and 21 days of pioglitazone treatment on insulin sensitivity in 26 diabetic subjects was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Because chemoattractant factors, cytokines, and immune cells have been implicated in regulating the recruitment of ATMs, we studied their temporal relationship to changes in ATM content. Improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity was seen after 21 days of pioglitazone. We found early reductions in macrophage chemoattractant factors after only 10 days of pioglitazone, followed by a 69% reduction in ATM content at 21 days and reduced ATM activation at both time points. Although markers for dendritic cells and neutrophils were reduced at both time points, there were no significant changes in regulatory T cells. These results are consistent with an association between adipose macrophage content and systemic insulin resistance in humans.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Obesity is an important causal factor in the global diabetes epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Adipose tissue generates substantial amounts of proinflammatory molecules believed to contribute to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Obesity is associated with increased adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) infiltration in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Inflammatory cells, including macrophages, appear to be the main source of various fat-derived inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and many rodent models suggest that increased ATM content is associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, human studies have not universally shown a relationship between ATM content and insulin resistance, raising questions about the role of ATMs in the metabolic consequences of obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p>
            <p>Increased local production of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) appears to recruit circulating monocytes/macrophages through interaction with the MCP-1 receptor chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and MCP-1 expression is increased in human adipose tissue from obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Adipocytes in obesity also appear to express increased amounts of hyaluronan and its receptor CD44, thereby recruiting more monocytes into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In addition, a number of studies have suggested that regulatory T cells (Tregs) oppose recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages, thereby improving insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), although a recent study showed that Treg markers were paradoxically upregulated and correlated with inflammation in adipose tissue of obese human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, rodent studies suggest a role for additional adipose inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and dendritic cells, in macrophage recruitment and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p>
            <p>Therefore, many unanswered questions remain regarding the relationships among ATMs, chemoattractant factors, and insulin action in humans. Because thiazolidinediones have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and inflammatory factors in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and to reduce ATM content in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), we used pioglitazone to prospectively study the temporal sequence of its effects on hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, subcutaneous ATM content, chemoattractant factors, and immune cell populations. We conducted hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic pancreatic clamp studies along with adipose tissue biopsies after 10 and 21 days of pioglitazone treatment in individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p>

                <title>Human subjects.</title>
                <p>All studies and procedures were approved by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Before their enrollment in the study, informed, written consents were obtained from all subjects. A total of 26 adult volunteers with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the 10-day and/or the 21-day protocols. Three subjects participated in both the 21- and 10-day studies, with a wash-out period of at least 6 months between studies. Subjects with a history of medical conditions other than type 2 diabetes and well-controlled hypertension were excluded. Women who were of child-bearing age were allowed to participate provided that they had negative pregnancy test results within a week of the studies.</p>
                <p>Each subject was instructed to follow his or her usual diet and activity while participating in the studies. The subjects discontinued sulfonylureas and metformin for 3 days (the approximate half-life of a typical sulfonylurea, glyburide, is 10 h; the half-life of metformin is 18 h in blood) and long-acting insulin for 24 h before each clamp study. Subjects fasted overnight, but took their capsules on the morning of the study. Blood samples were collected before each study for lipid profile, plasma glucose, insulin, glycerol, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels.</p>

                <title>The 21-day pioglitazone studies.</title>
                <p>A total of 16 subjects participated in a pair of clamp studies after 45 mg/day of pioglitazone (Pio21d) and placebo (Plc21d) treatment for 21 days each. Each participant received the experimental agents in random order, in a double-blind fashion. There was a washout period of at least 3 weeks before they began taking the other experimental agent. Some clamp data from eight of these subjects were reported previously. Adipose tissue biopsies were performed during the final 30 min of the clamp studies under local anesthesia, as described below.</p>
                <p>To examine the effects of 21 days of pioglitazone on hepatic and peripheral insulin action, we used 6-h “stepped” hyperinsulinemic clamp studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The subjects were admitted the night before the study. After establishing intravenous access, insulin infusions (Novolin Regular) were begun at 3:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> and were adjusted according to hourly plasma glucose measurements to gradually attain euglycemia. At 7:30 <sc>a.m.</sc> the next day, an additional intravenous cannula was inserted in the opposite arm for blood sampling, and “stepped” hyperinsulinemic clamps were performed, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p>

Glucose fluxes were measured by infusing tritiated glucose. Somatostatin was infused for the entirety of the clamp to inhibit pancreatic hormone secretion, with concomitant replacement of glucagon and growth hormone (GH). Basal insulin infusion rates (- - -) were established for the first 2 h, and rates were then increased by 20 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min to reproduce 2 h of physiologic hyperinsulinemia, the “low insulin” step of the clamp (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="1843i01.jpg"/></inline-formula>).

                <p>Briefly, a primed-continuous infusion of high-performance liquid chromatography-purified [3-<sup>3</sup>H]glucose (bolus 21.6 μCi for 5 min; continuous infusion of 0.15 μCi/min) was initiated at <italic>t</italic> = 0 min to quantify glucose turnover. To reduce interstudy variability, individualized basal insulin replacement rates were established from 0 to 120 min by means of variable rates of insulin infusion to keep plasma glucose levels at ∼90 mg/dL without the need for glucose infusion. Insulin infusion rates were then increased by 20 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min above these basal rates to reproduce physiologic hyperinsulinemia (“low insulin” step of the clamp) from 120 to 240 min. Infusion rates were then further increased by 150 mU/m<sup>2</sup>/min above the basal rate for the final 2 h of the studies (“high insulin” step of the clamp). All experiments consisted of 360-min somatostatin (250 μg/h) infusions with replacement of glucoregulatory hormones (glucagon 1 ng/kg/min; growth hormone 3 ng/kg/min) to maintain fixed levels of these hormones throughout.</p>
                <p>Plasma glucose was measured every 5 to 10 min and maintained at euglycemia (∼90 mg/dL) by a variable infusion of [3<sup>-3</sup>H]glucose-enriched 20% dextrose. Blood samples were collected every 15 to 60 min to measure plasma insulin, C-peptide, FFA, glycerol, and [3<sup>-3</sup>H]glucose. All infusions were stopped at <italic>t</italic> = 360 min. The subjects were then given a standard meal, and plasma glucose concentrations were monitored for an additional 60 min. Dextrose infusion was continued for ∼30 min after completion of the clamp to avoid hypoglycemia.</p>

                <title>The 10-day pioglitazone studies.</title>
                <p>A total of 13 subjects underwent adipose tissue biopsies and/or clamp studies at baseline (B10d) and after 45 mg/day (Pio10d) pioglitazone treatment for 10 days. Six of these 13 subjects participated in 3-h hyperinsulinemic clamp studies before and after pioglitazone treatment, with adipose tissue biopsies performed during the last 30 min of the clamp study. These shorter studies were conducted to reduce inconvenience to the subjects because the 21-day studies had already demonstrated that pioglitazone improved hepatic and peripheral insulin action. These 3-h clamp studies used insulin infusion rates previously used to examine insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p>

                <title>Effects of pioglitazone on adipose tissue inflammatory markers and macrophage activation.</title>
                <p>Adipose tissue in obese subjects has been shown to contain increased numbers of classically activated (M1) macrophages, a major source of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1b, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are associated with increased production of arginase-1 and IL-10 and may provide protection from obesity and insulin resistance, at least in part via peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We therefore examined multiple markers of inflammation and macrophage activation in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). After 10 days of pioglitazone treatment, gene expression of IL-6 and IL-1b was decreased in whole fat, with a downward trend in TNF-α. There was no change in expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) after this duration of treatment. However, all of these markers were decreased in whole fat after 21 days of pioglitazone. ATM activation was also significantly reduced after 10 and 21 days of pioglitazone treatment, as shown by the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS. Interestingly, after 21 days of pioglitazone, expression of arginase-1 and IL-10 increased significantly in ATMs, consistent with a shift toward the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, pioglitazone induced an ∼65% reduction in the quantity of cells with positive fluorescence for iNOS and CD68, indicating a substantial reduction in the amount of iNOS produced by macrophages in adipose tissue. Of note, the more pronounced decrease in inflammatory markers at 21 days corresponds with an observed reduction in ATM content at 21 days.</p>

Furthermore, the content of FOXP3+ cells in adipose tissue, as analyzed by IHC, did not differ with treatment of any duration.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>To explore the relationship between adipose inflammation and insulin resistance in humans, we designed studies examining early effects of treatment with the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone on insulin action, macrophage chemoattractants, and adipose inflammatory cell content in subjects with type 2 diabetes. PPAR-γ is a nuclear receptor that regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism and is known for its insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In humans, these receptors are most highly expressed in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) but are also present in other cells types, including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). After 21 days of pioglitazone treatment, a substantial decrease in macrophage content coincided with improved hepatic and peripheral insulin action. Although no significant changes were seen in macrophage content or insulin action after 10 days of pioglitazone, significant decreases in whole fat macrophage chemoattractant factors and their receptors, neutrophils, and dendritic cells at 10 days preceded the subsequent reduction in ATM content at 21 days. Conversely, there were no changes in FOXP3 or CD25 expression at 10 or 21 days, suggesting that changes in Tregs were not responsible for the observed changes in macrophage content.</p>
              <p>Of note, consistent data are lacking to substantiate a relationship between ATM content and insulin sensitivity in humans. Cancello et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) reported significant improvements in fasting glucose and insulin levels and in the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index 3 months after gastric bypass surgery in obese subjects, in association with an ∼18% decrease in body weight. The number of subcutaneous ATMs was ∼20% higher in obese subjects, and drastic postoperative weight loss resulted in a significant decrease (∼11%) in macrophage number. Expression of a number of factors involved in macrophage attraction was also higher in the obese subjects and significantly decreased after surgery. In addition, Makkonen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) reported an inverse correlation between whole-body insulin sensitivity (M value) and adipose tissue expression of CD68 in overweight and obese humans.</p>
              <p>By contrast, Tam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) reported that 28 days of feeding a high-fat diet to healthy individuals failed to increase the numbers of ATMs, T cells, and circulating immune cells, or expression of their surface activation markers, despite an 11% decrease in insulin sensitivity as measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. That the subjects in this study group had only a modest weight gain (&lt;3 kg) may explain the lack of increase in ATM content and MCP-1 expression, whereas the decreased insulin sensitivity may have been explained by a significant increase in liver fat content. Finally, a study of nondiabetic Pima Indians found that subcutaneous ATM content did not correlate with insulin action independent of adiposity, although subjects had a fairly wide range of BMI and different relationships may have applied in the overweight versus morbidly obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our studies assess the effects of pioglitazone on macrophage content, chemoattractant factors, cytokine expression, and immune cell activation at an early point in the treatment course, before glucose levels are affected and before decreases in adipose macrophage content become significant. This allows us to carefully study early factors that could contribute to the ultimate ∼70% drop in macrophage content after 21 days. After only 10 days, pioglitazone therapy resulted in decreased expression of macrophage chemoattractant factors in whole fat, including MCP-1, hyaluronan, and the hyaluronan receptor CD44, as well as decreased expression of the MCP-1 receptor CCR2 in macrophages.</p>
              <p>These studies also examined whether pioglitazone could affect activation of macrophages in adipose tissue. Indeed, after only 10 days of pioglitazone treatment, ATM activation was significantly reduced in adipose tissue of subjects with type 2 diabetes, as demonstrated by reductions in expression of iNOS, IL-1b, and IL-6. In addition, pioglitazone affected the quantity of iNOS associated with ATMs after 21 days of treatment, as quantified by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, whereas reductions in markers of adipose tissue activation were already observed after 10 days of pioglitazone, a shift toward the alternatively activated M2 phenotype was noted subsequently at 21 days. Given the likelihood that classically and alternatively activated macrophages represent a continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), we have expressed our results in terms of degrees of inflammatory activation.</p>
              <p>In addition to macrophages and adipocytes, T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells have recently received attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). High-fat feeding in mice causes early infiltration of neutrophils into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and dendritic cells have also been implicated in the development of obesity-associated inflammation by inducing macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have shown that CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are both increased in obese adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and may recruit and assist ATMs in promoting inflammation and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). In our studies, significant decreases in neutrophil and dendritic cell markers were observed at 10 and 21 days, but there was no effect on Treg content, suggesting that decreases in regulatory T-cell content are not required for the changes in macrophages observed with pioglitazone treatment. Consistent with our inability to demonstrate a negative association between Tregs and ATM infiltration in humans, Zeyda et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) reported that Tregs were significantly elevated in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of morbidly obese subjects compared with lean control subjects. This does not exclude the possibility that Tregs play a role in the regulation of macrophages in fat.</p>
              <p>To conclude, these are the first studies in humans to demonstrate a temporal relationship between ATM content and insulin sensitivity. Our studies confirm that improved insulin sensitivity is evident after only 21 days of pioglitazone treatment in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This effect may be at least partly mediated by decreased ATM content. Given the effects of pioglitazone on ATM chemoattractant factor expression, it is likely that the decrease in adipose macrophage content is mediated by decreased chemoattractant production. We also showed decreased expression of inflammatory markers of ATM activation, along with decreases in adipose tissue neutrophils and dendritic cells, although adipose Treg content did not change. Thus, results from this early time point of PPAR-γ activation provide further insights into mechanisms of macrophage recruitment in adipose tissue in humans. These extensive studies highlight the important role of macrophage chemoattractants and multiple inflammatory cells in adipose tissue inflammation and strongly suggest a role for ATMs in the metabolic consequences of obesity in humans.</p>
