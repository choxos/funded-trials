              <abstract>
                <p>Oral activated charcoal (OAC), a potent adsorbent with no systemic absorption, has been used for centuries to treat poisoning. Recent studies have suggested its potential efficacy in protecting the colonic microbiota against detrimental effects of antibiotics. In a dose-finding safety and feasibility clinical trial, 12 healthy volunteers not receiving antibiotics drank 4 different preparations made of 2 possible OAC doses (12 or 25 grams) mixed in 2 possible solutions (water or apple juice), 3 days a week for 2 weeks. Pre- and post-OAC stool samples underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and exact amplicon sequence variants were used to characterize the colonic microbiota. The preferred preparation was 12 grams of OAC in apple juice, with excellent safety and tolerability. OAC did not influence the gut microbiota in our healthy volunteers. These findings provide the critical preliminary data for future trials of OAC in patients receiving antibiotics.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Antibiotics represent a major cause of disruptions to the gut microbiota, leading to adverse consequences with global burden including <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of the strategies that have been used to prevent antibiotic-related gut dysbiosis include judicious use of antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and selective luminal antibiotic degraders [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Activated charcoal is a potent adsorbent powder made from superheated, high-surface area, porous particles of organic material. The large surface area of activated charcoal is covered with a carbon-based network, allowing prompt adsorbance of chemicals. Because orally administered activated charcoal (OAC) is not systemically absorbed but can reduce the absorption of chemicals from the gastrointestinal lumen, it has been used for the treatment of poisoning for approximately two centuries [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As an over-the-counter product, OAC is also used for gas-related symptoms and a tooth whitener. Doses between 12 and 100 grams are frequently used in clinical practice. A slurry is produced by mixing the OAC power with water, sometimes flavored with juice to improve compliance. OAC-associated side effects are uncommon and are mostly limited to gastrointestinal symptoms such as fullness, nausea, and vomiting [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two studies suggested that OAC may protect the gut microbiota by sequestering antibiotic residues in the lower gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0269986.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>The objectives of the present study were to determine (<italic toggle="yes">i</italic>) the preferred solution and a well-tolerated dose of OAC in healthy adults not receiving antibiotics and (<italic toggle="yes">ii</italic>) the effect of OAC on the gut microbiota in the absence of any medications. In the absence of prior data, we perceived these two pieces of knowledge to be the critical first steps towards planned clinical trials testing the efficacy of OAC in preventing antibiotic-related dysbiosis. In addition, although OAC is often used as an over-the-counter anti-gas treatment [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], its mechanism of action is unclear. We explored, via objective (<italic toggle="yes">ii</italic>), whether the reported anti-gas effect of OAC is mediated by specific microbiota changes.</p>

                <title>Clinical trial</title>
                <p>We enrolled 12 healthy volunteers (8 men and 4 women) to a single-center, interventional, dose-finding protocol (registration number in ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04204772; FDA IND: 143937; <bold><xref rid="pone.0269986.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="pone.0269986.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref></bold>). Study enrollment occurred in November 2020. Inclusion criteria were: age &gt; 18 years, and no use of prescription medications within a month prior to consent. Exclusion criteria were: gastrointestinal symptoms within a month prior to consent, planned endoscopic procedure within a month after completing the study, known allergy to OAC, and sexually active women unwilling or unable to use non-oral forms of contraception. Eleven of these volunteers also consented to a local stool sample collection study (IRB approval number: STUDY00003519) where the donors could choose to provide one or more samples at arbitrary intervals. Both protocols were approved by the University of Minnesota IRB and ethics committee. All participants provided written informed consent.</p>

                    <p>Twelve healthy volunteers were enrolled in a single-arm interventional clinical trial. No subject was lost to follow up. One subject was taken off study after dose 3 because of dose measurement error; data from this subject were used for microbiome analysis, but not for determining the preferred charcoal preparation. Another subject discontinued participation after dose 5 because of throat discomfort. No subject was lost to follow up.</p>

                <p>OAC was purchased from Spectrum Chemical MFG Corp (New Brunswick, NJ; catalogue number CA131) and stored at room temperature. Microbial Limits Test by Pace Analytical Life Sciences, LLC (Oakdale, MN) determined that the total anaerobic microbial count and combined yeast and molds count were both &lt;100 CFU/gram. Two doses (12 and 25 grams) and 2 solutions (water and commercially available apple juice) were used to make 4 possible preparations of charcoal. We designate these 4 preparations as W12 (12 grams of OAC in water), W25, J12 (12 grams of OAC in apple juice), and J25. The amount of OAC was predetermined, but participants could ask for more or less water or juice with each drink. Treatment assignments were predetermined using a balanced incomplete block design, where each participant received the same preparation in week 1 and switched to a different preparation in week 2. Participants presented to our facility in the morning of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for 2 consecutive weeks, drank their OAC preparation, and were observed for 15 minutes after each drink. After each drink, the participants filled out a paper survey including a 5-point scale of their overall experience (scale: 1 = worst experience, 5 = best experience) since the previous OAC drink and a free-text field where the participants described their experience. Participants were contacted by phone on Thursday and Friday of weeks 1 and 2 and interim adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.5.0). Participants received a $100 gift card as compensation on their last day of participation.</p>
                <p>The participants who co-enrolled on both studies were asked to collect a stool sample on the weekend preceding dose 1 of OAC (pre-OAC sample) and another sample on the following weekend (prior to dose 4 of OAC; post-OAC sample). Stool samples were collected in 95% ethanol-filled sterile tubes and stored at -80°C.</p>

                <p>DNA was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified on an Illumina MiSeq platform (2 x 300 paired-end mode) by the University of Minnesota Genomics Center [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Adaptor trimming was done in QIIME 2 using SHI7 [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the resulting demultiplexed fastq files were used as input to DADA2 [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred from amplicon data using the <italic toggle="yes">dada2</italic> package v1.18.0 in R 3.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). For filtering, we used DADA2 default parameters (PHRED score threshold of 2, maximum number of expected errors of 2 for both forward and reverse reads) and truncation lengths of 240 and 160 for forward and reverse reads, respectively. De-replication, de-noising, merging, and chimera removal were done using DADA2 default parameters. Taxonomic assignment was done according to the naive Bayesian classifier method implemented within DADA2 and using the SILVA non-redundant v138.1 training set [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The ASV table was merged with clinical metadata into a phyloseq object for downstream analysis in R.

Ordination was visualized using principal component analysis of the distance matrix. An adonis test with 999 permutations was used to determine the partitioning of the distance matrix among sources of variation (subjects and pre- vs. post-OAC) [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differential abundance analysis was performed on the genus-collapsed dataset using the aldex2 package in R, which used clr-transformed posterior distributions generated from 128 Dirichlet Monte-Carlo simulations [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Differentially abundant genera were identified by the aldex.ttest function in paired mode, with effect size determined by the aldex.effect function.

              <p>The treatment was safe. One subject opted to come off study after dose 5 because of a transient uncomfortable feeling in her throat after each drink; she was not given the very last drink. Another subject (preparation W12) was taken off the study after dose 3 because of an OAC dose measurement error that did not allow ascertainment of the actual dose received. AEs were all grade 1 and included abdominal fullness/bloating in 4 (33%) subjects, abdominal pain in 4 (33%) subjects, nausea in 2 (17%) subjects, constipation in 2 (17%) subjects, and diarrhea in 1 (8%) subject.

The OAC preparation with the highest rating was J12, with a mean (SD) of 4.9 (0.2) across 3-day blocks. This was followed by J25 (mean rating 4.4, SD 0.6), W12 (mean rating 4.0, SD 0.8), and W25 (mean rating 3.5, SD 0.9). The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference relative to J12 was (-1.3, 0.2) for J25, (-1.6, -0.1) for W12, and (-2.0, -0.8) for W25. As these intervals are predominantly negative, with minimal to no overlap with zero, we concluded that J12 was the preferred preparation.</p>

              <p>The pre-OAC sample from one subject had a disproportionately low depth (~3.5-fold lower than the next lowest depth sample) with poor coverage (~25%) and was deleted. Because our pre/post comparisons were paired, the post-OAC sample from the same subject was also deleted. This resulted in 20 samples with a median depth of 31,359 reads per sample (range: 21,561–85,586). 19,494 ASVs were assigned to 168 genera. The distribution of the most abundant genera among samples is shown in <bold><xref rid="pone.0269986.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>. Microbiota composition was highly subject-specific (explaining 76% of total microbiota variation; adonis <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with little contribution by whether the sample was pre- vs. post-OAC (explaining only 2% of total microbiota variation, adonis <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.33)(<bold><xref rid="pone.0269986.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref></bold>).

              <p>Together, these findings indicate no independent effect on the gut microbiome by two weeks (6 doses) of OAC. Therefore, gut microbiota changes after consuming OAC in patients receiving antibiotics in future trials would be due to the adsorbent effect of OAC on antibiotics rather than a direct effect on the microbiota. In addition, the often reported improvement in gas-related symptoms after using over-the-counter OAC by individuals not receiving antibiotics cannot be attributed to microbiota changes.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In conclusion, we found 12 grams of OAC mixed with apple juice to be a suitable preparation of charcoal for future use in non-poisoning investigations. This preparation was safe and tolerable, and its administration was feasible. Apple juice mitigated the somewhat uncomfortable sensation that OAC created in the mouth and throat. This was likely the main reason for higher ratings obtained with apple juice than water. It is possible for other types of juice to have the same effect. We did not identify a direct effect by OAC on the gut microbiota in the absence of antibiotics.</p>
              <p>In patients receiving intravenous antibiotics, OAC in the form of a solution as used in this study may be an easy, safe, and effective approach to protect the gut microbiome against the fraction of the antibiotics that reach the intestinal lumen (<italic toggle="yes">e</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>., via bile or direct transport). For patients receiving oral antibiotics, however, this strategy is not ideal because OAC can impair the absorption of antibiotics and reduce their desired systemic effect. Similarly, OAC would not be appropriate for patients on other essential oral medications that can be adsorbed by OAC. A potential patient who could benefit from OAC is someone requiring peri-procedural intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis for a non-gastrointestinal surgical procedure. <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection is a dysbiosis-related complication in these patients, and our findings here provide the critical preliminary data supporting a clinical trial of OAC in such patients [<xref rid="pone.0269986.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0269986.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. While we found a tolerable dose and palatable solution of OAC, therapeutic efficacy in patients may be higher at higher doses, and for patients receiving only one dose of OAC, palatability may not be as critical. The dose/solution identified in the present study should therefore be considered as a start point for future efficacy trials in patients.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: A dose-finding safety and feasibility clinical trial was conducted in which 12 healthy volunteers drank 4 different preparations (2 OAC doses and 2 solutions). Pre- and post-OAC stool samples were gene sequenced. The preferred preparation was 12 gram of OAC in apple juice which demonstrated safety and tolerability.</p>
              <p>Minor revisions:</p>
              <p>1- Indicate the date range subjects were enrolled in the study.</p>
              <p>2- Page 6: In addition to stating the frequencies of AEs, provide the corresponding percentages.</p>
              <p>3- Indicate if AEs were collected according to standard methods, i.e. CTCAE.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study nicely shows that OAC can be made palatable and does not appear to adversely affect the microbiome when dosed intermittently at low levels.</p>
              <p>I agree that the low dose OAC with apple juice was liked by the most patients, but medicine doesn’t always have to be taste nice and an equally important question to be answered later is what is the correct dose for preventing antibiotic microbiome effects? It could be 12g, it could be 25g it could be more. What they actually showed is that lower dose OAC is more palatable and mixed with apple juice is more palatable. They This should be described in the results and acknowledged in the discussion. They also subsequently say the most likely scenario for this treatments use would be in surgical patients on IV antibiotics, where presumably the OAC therapy would only be needed 1-3 times at most. Maybe not so big a deal how nice it tastes.</p>
              <p>The microbiome data is nice and very clearly shows that within an individual the OAC made no great difference. But this was in 12 people minus the dropout. Not really enough to say conclusively that OAC does not exert its anti-bloating effects by altering the microbiome.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: PONE_21_16930 A Dose-Finding Safety and Feasibility Study of Oral Activated Charcoal and its Effects on the Gut Microbiota in Healthy Volunteers not Receiving Antibiotics</p>
              <p>This is an interesting manuscript describing the dose and feasibility of OAC on the gut microbiota. It is not really an RCT given that only one arm is present and only before and after samples are used and compared within individuals. It is however, important information before the start of RCTs with antibiotics and OAC. I only have a few comments.</p>

              <p>2. It would be good to have a table with some of the characteristics for the participants e.g. gender, age, BMI. This could also be added as text.</p>
              <p>3. The methods seem to suggest that the gut microbiota samples after were obtained prior to dose 4, the results suggest that the results were obtained after the two weeks (6 doses). Please check and make consistent.</p>
              <p>4. Was the increased palatability of the OAC in apple juice due to masking of the taste? Would it therefore be possible to dissolve the OAC in other types of juices or other flavoured drinks as well?</p>

              <p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback. Changes in the text are highlighted in yellow. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1</p>
              <p>Comment: Indicate the date range subjects were enrolled in the study.</p>
              <p>Response: Enrollment occurred in Nov 2020. This was added to the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Comment: Page 6: In addition to stating the frequencies of AEs, provide the corresponding percentages.</p>
              <p>Response: This information was added to the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Comment: Indicate if AEs were collected according to standard methods, i.e. CTCAE.</p>
              <p>Response: AEs were collected according to CTCAE v.5.0. This is highlighted in the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>Comment: This study nicely shows that OAC can be made palatable and does not appear to adversely affect the microbiome when dosed intermittently at low levels. I agree that the low dose OAC with apple juice was liked by the most patients, but medicine doesn’t always have to taste nice and an equally important question to be answered later is what is the correct dose for preventing antibiotic microbiome effects? It could be 12g, it could be 25g, it could be more. What they actually showed is that lower dose OAC is more palatable and mixed with apple juice is more palatable. This should be described in the results and acknowledged in the discussion. They also subsequently say the most likely scenario for this treatment's use would be in surgical patients on IV antibiotics, where presumably the OAC therapy would only be needed 1-3 times at most. Maybe not so big a deal how nice it tastes.</p>
              <p>Response: We agree. To conduct the future trial in surgical patients, we needed a pilot study to get some idea about an appropriate dose/solution, understanding that it might not be the best choice. This information did not exist before this pilot study. Factors that could influence the optimal choice included palatability, potential side effects, feasibility, and compliance. However, as the reviewer correctly pointed out, a therapeutic effect may occur at various doses (not just the one we found as preferred among the tested options) and palatability of the solution may not be critical when consumed only once or a few times. We have added these to the revised manuscript (Introduction and Discussion) and changed “the preferred” to “a suitable” in the beginning of Discussion. </p>
              <p>Comment: The microbiome data is nice and very clearly shows that within an individual the OAC made no great difference. But this was in 12 people minus the dropout. Not really enough to say conclusively that OAC does not exert its anti-bloating effects by altering the microbiome.</p>
              <p>Response: This is a valid point. All we can say is that this study did not identify an effect on the microbiome. We have adjusted the language in the revision. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3</p>
              <p>This is an interesting manuscript describing the dose and feasibility of OAC on the gut microbiota. It is not really an RCT given that only one arm is present and only before and after samples are used and compared within individuals. It is however, important information before the start of RCTs with antibiotics and OAC. I only have a few comments.</p>
              <p>Comment: Consort diagram: would it be possible to add to the consort diagram the breakdown of people receiving the different amounts and the loss to follow-up for each of these?</p>
              <p>Response: This information was added to the consent diagram. </p>
              <p>Comment: It would be good to have a table with some of the characteristics for the participants e.g. gender, age, BMI. This could also be added as text.</p>
              <p>Response: Unfortunately, we did not collect age and BMI. Gender was added to the revised manuscript in the text. </p>
              <p>Comment: The methods seem to suggest that the gut microbiota samples after were obtained prior to dose 4, the results suggest that the results were obtained after the two weeks (6 doses). Please check and make consistent.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this clarifying question. Samples were indeed collected at baseline and after the first week (block 1), prior to dose 4. The study was designed like this because each subject went through 2 blocks, each with a different dose and solution. We would have not been able to attribute the information obtained from post-week 2 samples to week 1 vs. week 2 preparation, so we did not collect an end-of-study sample. The reason subjects went through block 2 was clinical (to assess AEs and tolerability). In the revised manuscript, we added a sentence in the beginning of Statistical Analysis which clarifies that our notation “post-OAC” refers to the pre-dose 4 sample. </p>
              <p>Comment: Was the increased palatability of the OAC in apple juice due to masking of the taste? Would it therefore be possible to dissolve the OAC in other types of juices or other flavoured drinks as well?</p>
              <p>Response: OAC does not have any taste, but creates a somewhat uncomfortable sensation in the mouth/throat which was mitigated by dissolving it in the juice. We did not test other types of juice, but it is very possible that they would have the same effect as apple juice. We added this possibility in the revised manuscript (Conclusions, 1st paragraph). </p>
              <p>Comment: How many doses do the authors think people should take when they receive IV prophylactic antibiotics in conjunction with procedures in order to protect the gut microbiota?</p>
              <p>Response: This is a very good question that only a trial in patients would be able to answer with certainty. We speculate that 1 dose would be enough but this definitely needs to be tested in a trial. To avoid conveying a premature message to the readers, we did not make a speculation in the manuscript. In the last paragraph of the revised manuscript, we briefly discuss this.</p>
