                <title>PURPOSE</title>
                <p>Programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway inhibitors have not been prospectively evaluated in patients with nonâ€“clear cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC). The phase II KEYNOTE-427 study (cohort B) was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in advanced nccRCC.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>METHODS</title>
                  <p>Patients with histologically confirmed, measurable (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) nccRCC and no prior systemic therapy received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for â‰¤ 24 months. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Among enrolled patients (N = 165), 71.5% had confirmed papillary, 12.7% had chromophobe, and 15.8% had unclassified RCC histology. Most patients (67.9%) had intermediate or poor International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk status and tumors with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) â‰¥ 1 (61.8%). The median time from enrollment to database cutoff was 31.5 months (range, 22.7-38.8). In all patients, the ORR was 26.7%. The median duration of response was 29.0 months; 59.7% of responses lasted â‰¥ 12 months. The ORR by CPS â‰¥ 1 and CPS &lt; 1 status was 35.3% and 12.1%, respectively. The ORR by histology was 28.8% for papillary, 9.5% for chromophobe, and 30.8% for unclassified. Overall, the median progression-free survival was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 5.6); the 24-month rate was 18.6%. The median overall survival was 28.9 months (95% CI, 24.3 months to not reached); the 24-month rate was 58.4%. Overall, 69.7% of patients reported treatment-related adverse events, most commonly pruritus (20.0%) and hypothyroidism (14.5%). Two deaths were treatment related (pneumonitis and cardiac arrest).</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSION</title>
                  <p>First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy showed promising antitumor activity in nccRCC. The safety profile was similar to that observed in other tumor types.</p>

              <p>Cytokine-based immunotherapies such as interleukin 2 and interferon Î± were beneficial in only a small group of patients with RCC and showed virtually no activity in patients with nccRCC.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> As understanding of the role of immune evasion in RCC has improved, more recent treatment approaches for patients with advanced RCC have used immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the programmed death 1 (PD-1) and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyteâ€“associated antigen (CTLA-4) pathways. Therefore, it was likely that there was therapeutic potential in inhibiting the PD-1 pathway in patients with nccRCC. The phase II KEYNOTE-427 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02853344">NCT02853344</ext-link>) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab as monotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with advanced ccRCC (cohort A) and patients with advanced nccRCC (cohort B). Analysis of cohort A showed that pembrolizumab monotherapy has considerable antitumor activity in previously untreated patients with ccRCC.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Herein, we present the results of pembrolizumab monotherapy in previously untreated patients with nccRCC (cohort B).</p>

Patients enrolled in the study were administered intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a total treatment duration of 24 months (maximum of 35 doses). The primary objective was to estimate ORR per RECIST, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) in patients with nccRCC.</p>
                <p>The Protocol and its amendments were approved by the appropriate institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site. The trial was conducted per Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Patient Characteristics</title>
                <p>Eligible patients were â‰¥ 18 years with newly diagnosed or recurrent stage IV nccRCC as determined by the investigator and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. Diagnosis of nccRCC was retrospectively confirmed by central pathology review. Subtype histology of nccRCC was determined by central pathology review. Patients must not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease and must have maintained a Karnofsky performance status score â‰¥ 70 within 10 days before initiating treatment. Prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy for RCC was allowed if it was completed more than 12 months before allocation and if it did not include a PD-1 pathway blocker.

                <title>Study Assessments</title>
                <p>The primary end point was ORR, per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR. Secondary end points were duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR; defined as the sum of complete responders, partial responders, and patients with stable disease lasting â‰¥ 6 months), progression-free survival (PFS; defined as the time from first day of study treatment to first documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever occurred first), overall survival (OS; defined as the time from first day of study treatment to time of death) per RECIST v1.1 by BICR, and safety and tolerability. Exploratory end points were ORR, DOR, and DCR in relation to (1) histology, (2) International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk status, (3) programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS), and (4) sarcomatoid differentiation.</p>
                <p>Tumor imaging was performed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Imaging assessments were performed at week 12, then every 6 weeks until week 54, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Baseline bone imaging was necessary for confirmation of complete response (CR) and was performed at screening and at weeks 18, 30, 42, and 54, and then every 24 weeks thereafter. Response was assessed according to RECIST v1.1 based on BICR.</p>
                <p>Assessment of PD-L1 expression and sarcomatoid differentiation is described in the Data Supplement.</p>
                <p>Safety was monitored throughout the study and for 30 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab and graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. Any adverse events (AEs) associated with pembrolizumab exposure with immunologic etiology were recorded as immune-mediated AEs. Patients were monitored for any serious AEs and immune-mediated AEs for up to 90 days after study completion.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>ORR was calculated as the proportion of patients in the analysis population who experienced CR or partial response (PR). The 95% CIs were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method based on binomial distribution. The Kaplan-Meier method for censored data was used to estimate OS, PFS, and DOR from the date of the first exposure to pembrolizumab to the database cutoff date. The DOR analysis population included all responders. No statistical adjustments were performed for multiple comparisons.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The single-arm, phase II KEYNOTE-427 study is the first and largest interventional clinical study conducted in a cohort of patients with previously untreated advanced nccRCC. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy showed promising antitumor activity (ORR = 26.7%) in the overall nccRCC population, consistent results across IMDC risk groups, and promising activity in selected patient subgroups with tumors with high PD-L1 expression, papillary or unclassified histology, and sarcomatoid differentiation. The median DOR was 29.0 months, with most patients achieving a response for â‰¥ 12 months. The median PFS was 4.2 months, the median OS was 28.9 months, and the 24-month OS rate was 58.4%. These findings are consistent with those of other studies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, both as monotherapy and in combination treatment.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The results of the current study show that pembrolizumab monotherapy provides durable antitumor activity in untreated patients with nccRCC. Furthermore, the confirmation of an nccRCC diagnosis by central pathology in KEYNOTE-427 provides confidence in our results, given the histologic diversity of these cancers.</p>
              <p>Because the focus of RCC clinical trials of targeted systemic therapies has predominantly been on patients with ccRCC, the NCCN kidney cancer guidelines indicate that enrollment in clinical trials is the preferred strategy for patients with nccRCC.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Current standard-of-care systemic treatment options recommended by NCCN guidelines for patients with nccRCC include sunitinib, everolimus, and cabozantinib.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The phase II ASPEN and ESPN trials were conducted to assess efficacy and safety of sunitinib versus everolimus in patients with nccRCC, and recommendations were primarily based on the results of the primary end point of PFS.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Notably, nccRCC histology in ASPEN and ESPN was not confirmed by central pathology review. Tumor response was evaluated as a secondary end point in both trials. In the ASPEN trial, the ORR was 18% (PR, n = 9) in the sunitinib arm and 9% (CR, n = 2; PR, n = 4) in the everolimus arm.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In the ESPN trial, the ORR was 9% (PR, n = 3) with first-line sunitinib and 3% (PR, n = 1) with first-line everolimus.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Despite guideline recommendations for these regimens, the results of these approaches demonstrate that more effective treatment options for nccRCC are needed.</p>
              <p>The safety profile of pembrolizumab monotherapy in this study is generally consistent with what has been observed in other tumor types.<sup><xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Overall, 69.7% of patients reported treatment-related AEs of any grade and 17% reported treatment-related AEs of grade 3-5. The most reported immune-mediated AEs were hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, colitis, and hepatitis, consistent with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Two of the eight deaths that occurred in the study were considered related to treatment (pneumonitis and cardiac arrest). Although rare, serious and potentially fatal cases of pneumonitis and cardiotoxicity can occur with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The antitumor activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy was also demonstrated across key patient subgroups. ORR in the overall nccRCC population was similar to ORRs in the favorable and intermediate or poor IMDC risk groups, suggesting that antitumor activity was generally consistent across IMDC risk categories. When evaluated by RCC histology, ORRs were higher for patients with papillary and unclassified RCC than for patients with chromophobe RCC. This result is similar to that reported in a retrospective analysis of nivolumab in nccRCC, in which the highest response rate was observed in patients with unclassified histology, followed by papillary and chromophobe RCC.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although there were few patients in this study with chromophobe RCC (n = 21) to draw meaningful conclusions, it is unclear why these patients seem to have a poorer response with anti-PD-1 therapies because this histologic subtype is traditionally associated with better survival than other RCC subtypes.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Given the rarity of chromophobe histology, the majority of studies are retrospective with substantial heterogeneity; therefore, there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for patients with chromophobe histology.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The effectiveness of pembrolizumab might also be influenced by PD-L1 status. Despite differing methodologies (eg, choice of antibody) and positivity thresholds (eg, â‰¥ 5% positivity), PD-L1 expression has been reported in 11%-20% of samples from patients with nccRCC.<sup><xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>-<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Following the same methodology as used in this study, PD-L1 expression, defined as CPS â‰¥ 1, in the KEYNOTE-426 and KEYNOTE-427 cohort A studies was reported in 47% and 60% of patients with ccRCC, respectively.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Although responses in this study were observed in patients with CPS â‰¥ 1 and those with CPS &lt; 1, the ORR was three times higher in patients with CPS â‰¥ 1 (35.3%) than in those with CPS &lt; 1 (12.1%). The results of this study also showed relatively high response rates in patients with sarcomatoid differentiation (ORR, 42.1%). Recently reported results of ongoing studies suggest that sarcomatoid differentiation and DNA and RNA analyses of the tumor microenvironment may play a role in predicting response to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Data from the current study suggest that sarcomatoid differentiation may be a histologic biomarker for response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with nccRCC, as was observed in patients with ccRCC.</p>
              <p>The current study has several limitations. First, the single-arm study design limits comparisons of response rate and survival outcomes with currently recommended regimens. Second, the heterogeneity of the nccRCC patient population makes subgroup analyses difficult to identify which patients achieve the greatest benefit. Furthermore, despite central pathology review, we were unable to subgroup patients into papillary type I and type II.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, pembrolizumab monotherapy showed promising antitumor activity and survival for patients with nccRCC. The safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab monotherapy are consistent with those reported in previous studies. Given the lack of established therapy for nccRCC and favorable ORR relative to VEGF and mTOR therapies, pembrolizumab monotherapy may be a potential treatment option for nccRCC. Additional studies to evaluate antitumor activity of immune checkpoint blockade coupled with studies to validate tissue-based biomarkers of response will better elucidate the role of pembrolizumab treatment in nccRCC.</p>
