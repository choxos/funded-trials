              <abstract>
                <p>Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged <italic>in vitro</italic> and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including 18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain (NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing 3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation that becomes detectable <italic>in vivo</italic> with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.</p>

                <p>Mutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2 variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Although SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification was initially slow as the virus spread around the world [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the extent and implications of intra-individual virus evolution during COVID-19 are still being explored. Close genetic relationships among single-person SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences do not rule out intra-individual evolution because virus burden and transmissibility peak shortly after acquisition [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], before the development of adaptive immune responses that could select transmissible virus variants. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been detected in people with compromised immunity, with shifts in virus consensus sequences noted during prolonged shedding [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In early infection, however, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences has not routinely demonstrated directional genetic change. Sites in the virus genome showing significant intra-individual variation have been found in cross-sectional data [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with one study linking the number of variant sites to disease severity at the time of study [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nonetheless, studies in clinically diverse cohorts have found that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and minor variants [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] remain stable in most people over time. These findings would suggest that immune responses against transmitted virus strains should continue to target replicating viruses throughout the course of each individual’s infection.</p>
              <p>An important obstacle to understanding intra-individual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is that standard sequencing and analytical procedures yield a single consensus sequence for each sample, rather than multiple sequences representing virus quasispecies diversity. Standard procedures typically either amplify virus RNA in fragments spanning the genome or produce meta-transcriptome libraries of fragments from the entire sample [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], followed by short-read deep sequencing, read alignment or assembly, and virus genome consensus determination. These approaches readily cover nearly the entire 30-kilobase length of the SARS-CoV-2 genome for samples from hundreds or thousands of people at a time, helping to define inter-individual virus variation on a global scale [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, combined amplification from multiple genomes and the “shotgun” sequencing of long regions in small fragments can both disrupt genetic linkage and prevent error correction at the level of individual haplotypes. Analysis of intra-individual variation within resulting data is thus largely limited to the detection of genome positions at which variation occurs at levels exceeding the background arising from sample preparation and sequencing errors. As a result, standard methods could miss important patterns of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 diversity and evolution due to insufficient discrimination of true signal from technical noise.</p>
              <p>In this report we use a single-genome amplification and sequencing (SGS) approach to investigate the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from people with COVID-19. Our approach is conceptually similar to conventional SGS procedures, which amplify single molecules at limiting dilution for Sanger sequencing [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, to obtain a broad view of the SARS-CoV-2 variant pool, we developed a high-throughput SGS (HT-SGS) strategy employing long-read deep sequencing of the surface protein gene region from large numbers of individual virus genomes. Our results demonstrate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants under host immune pressure during acute infection.</p>

                <title>Validation of HT-SGS for SARS-CoV-2 surface protein gene sequencing</title>
                <p>We developed an HT-SGS approach for sequencing individual virus RNA genomes within each sample across the spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), and membrane (M) protein genes. This approach employs unique molecular identifier (UMI) tags added to the virus genome complementary DNA (cDNA) during reverse transcription (RT; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s001">S1</xref>), and incorporates several layers of error correction in a custom bioinformatic pipeline (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2</xref>). These include (i) consensus formation from reads with matching UMIs to remove PCR errors and those sequencing errors not addressed by circular consensus sequence (CCS) correction [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], (ii) initial removal of UMI bins with outlying low read counts by inflection point filtering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), (iii) network-based filtering to exclude false UMI bins arising from PCR or sequencing errors in the UMI (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>), and (iv) stringent removal of UMI bins with low read counts by knee point filtering (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Errors occurring during the RT step are then addressed by (v) flagging unique and potentially spurious insertions/deletions (indels) and other rare mutations by variant calling, for reversion to the sample consensus, and (vi) exclusion of sequence haplotypes occurring in only 1 UMI bin (i.e., unique SGS).</p>

                    <title>Overview of HT-SGS data generation and analysis.</title>
                    <p>(A) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) is reverse-transcribed to include an 8-nucleotide unique molecular identifier (UMI; multicolored bar), followed by PCR amplification and Pacific Biosciences single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the 6.1-kilobase region encompassing spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), and membrane (M) protein genes. After quality control and trimming, sequence reads are compiled into bins that share a UMI sequence, and bins with low read counts are removed according to the inflection point of the read count distribution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Presumptive false bins arising from errors in the UMI are then identified and removed by the network adjacency method, followed by further removal of bins with the lowest read counts using a more conservative knee point cutoff (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Variant calling is then used to identify presumptive erroneous mutations based on rarity and pattern (ex., single-base insertions adjacent to homopolymers), and these are reverted to the sample consensus. Finally, SGS that correspond to haplotypes occurring only once in each sample are excluded (not pictured). (B) To validate data generation and analysis procedures, clonal RNAs transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> from USA/WA-1 and double mutant sequences were mixed at varying ratios and subjected to HT-SGS. Results are described in Results and <xref rid="ppat.1009431.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>To validate our method, we applied it to clonal RNA transcripts representing the USA/WA-1 sequence (wt) or a double-mutant (2M) sequence that included two scrambled 20-base sections at the ends of the target region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Using UMI bin consensus sequences obtained after knee point filtering, we calculated error rates of 0.00024/base for the wt target and 0.00025/base for the 2M target. No inter-template recombinants were detected. Putative errors included both single-nucleotide substitutions and short indels, and likely represented a combination of RT, PCR, and sequencing errors as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription errors and plasmid mutations. After a completed analysis including variant calling, rare mutation reversion, and exclusion of unique SGS, we found that all remaining sequences exactly matched their corresponding references, with quantitative recovery of the two targets from a dilution series (<xref rid="ppat.1009431.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results support the high accuracy of our data generation and analytical approach.</p>

                <title>HT-SGS analysis of a cultured clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2</title>
                <p>To begin evaluating intra-sample diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we applied our HT-SGS process to a 4<sup>th</sup>-passage Vero cell culture of the WA-1 reference clinical isolate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, the consensus of all HT-SGS sequences from this sample exactly matched the WA-1 reference sequence, consistent with the high accuracy of the method. However, data analysis at the single-genome level revealed 18 unique SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes detected in between 3 and 174 individual virus genomes per haplotype, with each single-genome consensus supported by &gt;500 sequence reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). More than half (57.6%) of all SGS differed from the reference consensus sequence at one or more nucleotide positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). All 17 mutations detected in variant virus genomes were non-synonymous, suggesting selective pressure on the virus. Structurally, mutations were clustered almost exclusively in the spike NTD and furin cleavage site regions. The NTD mutations included 9 distinct single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 2 distinct insertions that added positively-charged or removed negatively-charged amino acid residues at the NTD outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>), consistent with observed selection patterns in other virus envelope proteins during cell culture adaptation [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Mutations in the area of the furin cleavage site included 3 SNVs and one deletion of 12 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>), and were consistent with mutations observed in this region after <italic>in vitro</italic> passage in other studies [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The remaining 2 mutations encoded a T307I substitution in spike, linked with R682L at the furin cleavage site, and a T7I substitution in the M gene found both in isolation and linked with 2 different spike NTD mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can accumulate considerable genetic diversity, as revealed by analysis of HT-SGS data at the single-genome level.</p>

                    <p>(A) Haplotype diagrams (left) depicting SARS-CoV-2 SGS detected in a 4<sup>th</sup>-passage Vero cell culture of the WA-1 reference clinical isolate. Spike NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), and furin cleavage site (F) regions are shaded grey, with remaining regions of spike in white. Pink tick marks illustrate mutations relative to the sample consensus sequence. Amino acid changes corresponding to these mutations are shown in sequence alignment form (middle), with the percentage of all SGS in the sample matching each haplotype shown in the bar graph (right). The grey bar in the graph indicates the haplotype that matches the sample consensus sequence; variant haplotypes with at least 1 mismatch to sample consensus are in pink. (B) Read counts of each UMI bin for which the SARS-CoV-2 sequence matched each of 18 different haplotypes in Vero cell culture of the WA-1 clinical isolate. Bars indicate median read counts among bins. (C) Mapping of detected spike gene mutations on the trimer structure. Two protomers of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (PDB ID: 6zge) are shown in surface representation and colored light blue and wheat, respectively. The third protomer is shown in cartoon representation with the NTD region colored in bright green. NTD mutations as well as T307I and H655Y are shown in red and the furin cleavage site mutations are in brown. The molecular structures were prepared with PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org">https://pymol.org</ext-link>).</p>

                <title>HT-SGS performance in direct <italic>ex vivo</italic> sequencing of SARS-CoV-2</title>
                <p>We anticipated that, compared to high-quality RNA preparations from cultured virus, human respiratory samples would contain variable levels of intact SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and that contaminants and inhibitors of steps in the HT-SGS process might also be present. We therefore evaluated the performance of HT-SGS using upper respiratory samples from 7 people with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Using droplet-digital reverse-transcription PCR (ddRT-PCR) to quantify two regions within the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, we detected virus loads in these samples ranging from 314 to &gt;3 million RNA copies/mL. By comparison, our recovery of cDNA encompassing the S, E, and M gene region in HT-SGS was considerably lower (<xref rid="ppat.1009431.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This discrepancy was consistent with multiple differences between the two measurements, including the presence of subgenomic RNAs containing ddRT-PCR target but lacking intact HT-SGS target sequences; lower efficiency of cDNA synthesis across our 6.1-kilobase HT-SGS target region than across short ddRT-PCR targets; and some degree of RNA degradation preferentially affecting HT-SGS. Similarly, SGS yields ranged from 8.8% to 26.0% of input cDNA copy numbers (<xref rid="ppat.1009431.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), likely due to a combination of cDNA degradation and loss; failure of some cDNA molecules to amplify during PCR; and highly stringent read count cutoffs that we employed in the bioinformatic analysis in an effort to ensure accuracy of all reported sequences. Despite these considerations, however, yields at each step of the process were correlated with sample virus loads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), with recovery of between 12 and 1,276 single-genome consensus sequences for the samples studied (<xref rid="ppat.1009431.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, although we sequenced these samples to a high depth (7,499–462,919 raw reads/sample), we observed that detection of distinct virus haplotypes was highly reproducible in random subsamples down to a level of 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This indicates that multiple samples can be combined in individual HT-SGS runs while still achieving sufficient sequencing depth for minor variant detection.</p>

                <p>Because the mutations we detected in cultured virus resembled those described for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses during culture adaptation, we interpreted the extensive diversity observed as evidence of virus diversification <italic>in vitro</italic> rather than in the source patient. We therefore analyzed the diversity of HT-SGS sequences obtained from the 7 study participants in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s005">S1 Table</xref>. In samples taken between 8 and 17 days since the onset of clinical illness (each representing the earliest available sample for the individual), we detected only a single virus haplotype in participants 1, 2, and 6 (range of SGS counts, 31-1276/participant) and 2–3 haplotypes in each of the remaining 4 participants (range of SGS counts, 13-1210/participant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In addition, we noted no clear structural signature among the 7 mutations that defined intra-individual variant haplotypes, with 1 SNV in the downstream region of the spike gene, 4 SNVs in the non-structural ORF3 and ORF6 genes, and 2 synonymous SNVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Overall, therefore, cross-sectional HT-SGS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 7 individuals was notable for relative sequence homogeneity, as compared to results from cultured virus.</p>

                <p>To reconcile the extensive diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes <italic>in vitro</italic> with the lesser diversity detected in <italic>ex vivo</italic> samples, we hypothesized a relationship between virus diversity and host antibody responses arising after the establishment of infection. To investigate this, we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) to analyze antibody profiles in participants from whom longitudinal serum samples were available (i.e., participants 1 and 3). In these individuals, we observed a marked rise in autologous serum binding to spike protein between the earliest available timepoint (participant 1, day 9 and participant 3, day 17) and later timepoints (participant 1, days 16 and 19 and participant 3, day 27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The increase in total serum binding to spike was 6.2-fold between days 12 and 16 in participant 1 and 5.75-fold between days 17 and 27 in participant 3. Using monoclonal antibody (mAb) competition to map domain-specific responses, we detected serum binding to NTD, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2 domain in both participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We also observed a continued increase in serum binding not competed by any tested mAb panel in participant 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, days 16 and 19, grey bars), suggesting progressive broadening of the binding response. Taken together, these findings indicated that samples with low levels of SARS-CoV-2 variation had been taken before full development of circulating antibody responses to the virus spike.</p>

                <title>Intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution during acute infection</title>
                <p>We next investigated the relationship between mounting spike-directed antibody responses and the levels and sequences of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions from participant 1. We found that the burden of SARS-CoV-2 RNA declined substantially but irregularly between days 9 and 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Between days 9 and 13, virus RNA declined by nearly 4 orders of magnitude, from 2.83 x 10<sup>6</sup> (N2)– 3.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> (N1) copies/mL to 3.14 x 10<sup>2</sup> (N1)– 3.86 x 10<sup>2</sup> (N2) copies/mL. However, virus RNA subsequently increased to 1.11 x 10<sup>4</sup> (N2)– 1.35 x 10<sup>4</sup> (N1) copies/mL on day 15, before declining again on day 17. This pattern was associated with the emergence of 2 minor variant SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes on day 11 and 4 minor variant haplotypes on day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Strikingly, these variants together bore 3 independent non-synonymous mutations within a single NTD epitope. On day 11, a C-to-T transition causing an H-to-Y change at amino acid residue 146 was found in 10/882 (1.1%) genomes sequenced. After a low virus RNA burden on day 13 with detection of only the consensus virus variant, sequencing on day 15 revealed deletions of either residues 141-144LGVY or residue 144Y alone. These mutations were found in 3 different haplotypes that accounted for 70/284 (26.1%) genomes sequenced on day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, bar graph). Structural modeling onto the spike trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) indicated that these mutations were located in a supersite of vulnerability targeted by potent neutralizing antibody 4A8 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], where similar mutations have been observed in case reports of persistent infections [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and a larger study of recurrently deleted regions [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, we performed additional serum antibody mapping studies with this mAb and found that before the NTD mutations had emerged in autologous viruses, autologous serum antibodies against NTD predominantly recognized the 4A8 epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1009431.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated a close temporal relationship between the development of SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD-specific antibodies in serum, the independent emergence of multiple mutations in a region of the NTD targeted by these antibodies, and a transient delay in virus clearance.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Here we developed and validated a novel method that accurately sequences the 6.1-kilobase SARS-CoV-2 surface protein gene region from large numbers of individual virus genomes. Using this method, we analyzed virus genetic diversity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in respiratory secretions from people with COVID-19. In contrast to <italic>in vitro</italic> passaged viruses, which exhibited extensive diversity fitting patterns associated with culture adaptation [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we initially found relatively low intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 diversity <italic>ex vivo</italic>. These results appeared consistent with the slow evolution among worldwide virus sequences during the early months of the pandemic [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nevertheless, our relatively homogeneous cross-sectional sequencing findings in people with COVID-19 were not due entirely to intrinsic limitations on SARS-CoV-2 diversity. Instead, longitudinal analysis during the second and early third weeks of illness in one person revealed a transient increase in virus burden and multiple new virus variants in which 3 different mutations in an epitope of the spike NTD had arisen independently. The mutated epitope was previously shown to be a neutralizing antibody target [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and was identified herein as a major target for antibodies in the autologous serum. Our results therefore suggest selection of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants by mounting antibody responses in the acute setting.</p>
              <p>Mutational evasion of adaptive immune responses by SARS-CoV-2 during acute COVID-19 has not been clearly documented previously. This relationship may have been overlooked in part due to the emphasis on tracking new mutations on a global scale, with a predominance of cross-sectional rather than longitudinal analyses of infected individuals. The early peak of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions may also favor high-quality data acquisition in very early infection, leading to overrepresentation of individuals in whom virus populations have not yet been subjected to adaptive immune pressure. Another important consideration is the sequencing method used. Our method was specifically developed for high-throughput analysis of single virus RNA molecules, and incorporates several layers of error correction that aid in distinguishing true variation from technical errors. This allowed groups of important virus variants to be detected even though each variant individually accounted for a small proportion of all sequences in each sample. Finally, we cannot rule out that our distinctive findings might relate to our longitudinal study participant’s history of stem cell transplantation. It is possible that immune suppression can lead to higher levels of virus replication and thus an unusually rapid accumulation of “total-body” virus diversity <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, we noted that our longitudinal participant was no longer receiving immune suppressive medication at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and measurements of virus burden in respiratory secretions were consistent with previous studies in immunocompetent participants [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Wider application of our combined virological and immunological approach in diverse clinical cohorts will aid in defining circumstances under which SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants may emerge under immune-mediated pressure.</p>
              <p>It is important to emphasize that our bioinformatic strategy in this study prioritized the accuracy of reported variants over attempts to interpret very rare, potentially spurious sequences. Because the sensitivity of SGS depends in part on the number of genomes analyzed in each sample, future HT-SGS studies can achieve higher sensitivity for uncommon variants by preparing larger quantities of sample, by further optimizing virus RNA yield, integrity, and downstream processing efficiency, and by analyzing anatomic sites outside the upper respiratory tract that could harbor genetically distinct virus subpopulations [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. More fundamentally, however, rare variant detection in our HT-SGS process is limited by the intrinsic error rate of the RT step. Based on a frequency estimate of approximately 0.00007 error/base [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we anticipated that RT errors would introduce at least one incorrect base into every 2–3 sequences from our chosen target region in this study. These considerations motivated our use of variant calling, rare mutation reversion, and unique SGS exclusion, which together were sufficient to exclude low-frequency technical errors in validation studies while preserving key variants from <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> virus populations. Nevertheless, this strategy also excludes any real mutations occurring at or below the RT error rate threshold, and thus does not reliably preserve randomly-generated variants that have not undergone a degree of selective expansion. Methodological refinements or new approaches that address this challenge may lead to important insights about the virus mutation rate in future studies.</p>
              <p>Tracking intra-individual virus evolution is of great interest in understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and treatment. As our longitudinal study participant recovered clinically, spike variants detected by HT-SGS were replaced by unmutated sequences even though the variant sequences might have avoided neutralization by 4A8-like antibodies <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was likely due to a broadly-targeted antiviral response, including innate defenses, antiviral T cells, and multiple antibody specificities, each potentially with distinct kinetics during the transition from acute infection to convalescence. The absence of spike RBD variants in our longitudinal sequencing despite strong RBD-directed serum binding suggests limitations on SARS-CoV-2 escape from polyclonal responses, perhaps especially in genome regions less tolerant of indel mutations [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, recent findings made with spike variants from second wave pandemic spread demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can sometimes overcome genetic barriers to broader immune escape [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At the same time, the diversity of clinical outcomes in COVID-19 may relate in part to control of the virus, with slower virologic clearance linked to disease severity [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It will be important to examine whether this reflects a “tipping point” in early infection at which SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity can occasionally allow sustained replication through the evasion of immune recognition. Immunity induced by prior infection, vaccination, or passive immunization could reduce the potential for escape by controlling initial levels of virus replication quickly. Our results also emphasize that early antiviral therapy or combinations of antivirals with distinct targets could have markedly higher virologic efficacy than monotherapy administered later in the disease course.</p>

                <p>Nasopharygneal or oropharyngeal swab fluids were thawed and centrifuged at 1,150 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at room temperature to pellet cells and debris. Supernatants were transferred to separate tubes, and supernatant and pellet fractions were processed in parallel, although SGS derived from these two fractions were subsequently found to be similar and were thus pooled for each sample in the final analysis. Nucleic acids were extracted from supernatants and pellets using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (52906, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
                <p>Sample RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (18090010, ThermoFisher Scientific) using an RT primer binding within the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 gene (TCTCCATTGGTTGCTCTTCATCT, WA-1 reference positions 27,357–27,379). The RT primer also included an 8-base UMI (NNNNNNNN) and an outer reverse primer binding site for PCR amplification (CCGCTCCGTCCGACGACTCACTATA; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Virus cDNA was treated with proteinase K for 25 min at 55°C with continuous shaking to remove residual protein [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], followed by purification with a 2.2:1 volumetric ratio of RNAClean XP solid phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads (A63987, Beckman Coulter). Copy numbers of resulting cDNAs were determined by limiting-dilution PCR using fluorescence-assisted clonal amplification (FCA) [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and a gene-specific primer pair detecting a region upstream of the S gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Subsequently, cDNA molecules were amplified using the Advantage 2 PCR kit (639206, Takara Bio) with initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 sec, annealing at 64°C for 30 sec, and extension at 68°C for 7 min, followed by one final extension at 68°C for 10 min. Each PCR reaction was run in a 20 μL volume with final primer concentration of 400 nM. Primers included the outer reverse primer and one of two different forward primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s006">S2 Table</xref>). Amplified DNA was quantified on a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermofisher Scientific) and analyzed by electrophoresis with precast 1% agarose gel (Embi Tec) or the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit (5067–4626, Agilent). Amplified DNA products spanning the 6.1-kilobase virion surface protein gene region of SARS-CoV-2 with single-genome UMI-based tagging were incorporated into sequencing libraries using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (100-938-900, Pacific Biosciences) and Barcoded Overhang Adapters (101-629-000, Pacific Biosciences) to enable sample multiplexing. Libraries were prepared for sequencing by primer annealing and polymerase binding using the Sequel II Binding Kit 2.0 and Int Ctrl 1.0 (101-842-900, Pacific Biosciences), and were sequenced by single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing using a Sequel II system 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) with a 30-hour movie time under circular consensus sequencing (CCS) mode.</p>

                <p>Circular consensus sequences (CCS) were generated from SMRT sequencing data with minimum predicted accuracy of 0.99 and minimum number of passes of 3 in Pacific Biosciences SMRT Link (v8.0) using Arrow modeling framework [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. CCS reads were then demultiplexed using Pacific Biosciences barcode demultiplexer (lima) to identify barcode sequences. The resulting FASTA files were reoriented into 5’-3’ direction using the <italic>usearch -orient</italic> command in USEARCH (v8.1.1861) [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Cutadapt (v2.7) [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was used to trim forward and reverse primers. Length filtering was performed to remove reads shorter than 90% or longer than 130% of the reference sequence length. Appropriately-sized reads were then binned using 8-base UMI sequences. The read count in each UMI bin was plotted against the rank of that UMI bin (on log scale) within the sample, and the inflection point (i.e., point of concavity change) was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). UMI bins with read counts lower than the inflection point were discarded, leaving UMI bins with higher counts. Cutadapt (v2.7) was used to remove the RT primer and UMI sequences from each UMI bin consensus to obtain the SARS-CoV-2 insert sequence for that bin. Consensus sequences were generated for each bin using the <italic>usearch-cluster_fast</italic> command based on 99% identity to obtain high-confidence single-molecule sequences. Consensus sequences were then analyzed by searching the BLAST nt database, and non-coronavirus sequences thus identified were discarded.</p>

                <title>Determining SGS in HT-SGS data</title>
                <p>The probability that two independent UMI sequences differ by a single nucleotide substitution (i.e., have an edit distance of 1 base) can be estimated using binomial distribution with parameters <italic>n</italic> = 8 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.75, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of independent UMI bases and <italic>p</italic> is the probability that a base differs between two UMIs. Therefore, the probability of any two independent UMIs having edit distance one is <italic>B</italic>(8,.75, 1) = 3.6<italic>E</italic>−4. Hence, it is appropriate to assume that two UMI sequences having edit distance 1 could represent a scenario where one of the UMIs is derived from the other through PCR and/or sequencing error. To identify and remove potential false UMI bins, we utilized a UMI network method [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this network, each UMI sequence is represented by a node. Given two distinct nodes <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> with read counts <italic>n<sub>a</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic>, respectively (assume <italic>n<sub>a</sub></italic>≥<italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic>), <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are connected by an edge if they have edit distance 1 and satisfy the following count criterion: <italic>n<sub>a</sub></italic>≥2<italic>n<sub>b</sub></italic>–1. To resolve the network formed above, we applied the <italic>adjacency</italic> method [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. According to this method, the node with the largest count was selected and all connected nodes were removed. Next, the node with the second largest count was selected and all connected nodes were removed. This process was repeated until no more edges remained in the network. The <italic>adjacency</italic> method allowed resolution of a complex network to a single node. To further reduce the likelihood of including false UMI bins in downstream analysis, we combined our network adjacency approach with a knee point (i.e., point of maximum curvature) filter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) to ensure that UMIs with large total counts were preserved. Inflection and knee points can both be considered as separations between the high- and low-count UMI bins, and both depend on the shape of the count distribution. The knee point is more conservative in comparison to the inflection point. We used the knee rather than the inflection point at this stage in order to provide a more stringent threshold for removing false bins. To identify virus haplotypes defined by the data, we took the consensus sequences of all UMI bins and collapsed non-unique sequences. We considered the unique sequences bearing different combination of mutations as individual haplotypes. Finally, we manually inspected alignments of remaining UMI bin consensus sequences and removed any sequence that represented a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype observed in only one UMI bin for the sample in which it was found.</p>

We also note that, in the event of a UMI collision between two distinct sequences, the clustering and consensus formation for each UMI bin described above and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1009431.s002">S2 Fig</xref> results in preservation of the sequence cluster with higher read abundance and removal of the sequence cluster with lower read abundance.</p>

                <p>Despite high single molecule read accuracy (&gt;99.9%) of Pacific Bioscience HiFi reads, some sequencing errors–particularly small indels–may persist in the reads after applying CCS read correction. These errors and those that may arise during conversion of RNA to cDNA may not be identified by our extensive UMI-based error correction method. To distinguish such errors from real biological variation, we used ‘Map Long reads to reference’ tool in ‘Long read support’ plugin in the CLC Genomics Workbench v.20.0.4 (GWB) with default settings. This tool utilizes Minimap2 to map long reads [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We used the WA-1 reference sequence (GenBank accession: MN985325.1) as a reference during mapping. We employed the Low Frequency variant caller in the GWB with the following settings:

                <title>Analysis of serum antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein</title>
                <p>Domain-specific antibody competition assays using a His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ectodomain containing 2 proline stabilization mutations (S-2P) [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were performed using a fortéBio Octet HTX instrument and His1K (anti-penta His) biosensors at 30°C with agitation set to 1,000 rpm. Biosensors were first equilibrated for 600 seconds in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-BSA). Purified S-2P (10 μg/mL in PBS-BSA) was immobilized on equilibrated His1K sensors for 600 s. S-2P protein loading onto to the sensors was between 0.9 and 1.3 nm shift. Following S-2P immobilization, biosensors were equilibrated in PBS-BSA for 60 s. S-2P coated biosensors were submerged in either S-2P binding-domain specific competitor monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or negative control antibody, each at 10 μg/mL in PBS-BSA, for 600 s. At 600 s, the binding of all S-2P binding antibodies was saturating. Competitor mAbs were divided into three separate groups, each targeting a binding domain of S-2P: RBD, NTD, and S2 domain. Monoclonal antibodies included were composed of human IgG RBD-specific antibodies LY-CoV-555 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], S309 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], CR3022 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and CB6 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], NTD-specific antibodies S652-118 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], 4–8 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and 4A8 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and S2-specific antibody S652-112 [<xref rid="ppat.1009431.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Following saturating competitor mAb association, biosensors were equilibrated in PBS-BSA for 60 s and then submerged in serum samples diluted 100-fold in PBS-BSA for 3600 s. Raw sensorgrams datapoints were aligned to Y (nm) = 0 in at the beginning of the second association phase. Competition and serum shift were analyzed when the serum samples reached saturation (4001.2 s). Pie charts depict each binding domain’s relative contribution to the overall serum antibody binding to S-2P, as determined by percent competition. Percent competition (% C) of serum antibody binding to S-2P by competitor mAb groups was calculated using the following formula: % C = [1 –(shift nm value at 4001.2 s in presence of competitor mAb)/(shift nm value at 4001.2 s in presence of negative control antibody)]*100.

              <p>
                <bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Ko et al. develop a new method for sequencing single virus genomes with long-read technology and apply it to a cell culture adapted virus and to 7 clinical SARS-CoV2 samples. The sequencing method developed in this manuscript seems quite useful, with the clear benefit of enabling haplotype resolution and mutation linkage. The authors also present an interesting case of within-host evolution that is correlated to antibody development. This is of particular interest now and provides a useful contribution to the discussion of the role of immune-compromised hosts to SARS-CoV2 evolution. Overall, I think that the authors conclusions and findings are reasonable and interesting, and that the method could be quite useful. However, some of the results are currently difficult to interpret without some additional controls to validate the sequencing method for its robustness across viral RNA input copies and total number of output single consensus genomes. I suggest some specific controls that I think would be useful for clarifying these points, as well as some points in the Methods that could be further clarified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Ko et al. provide a timely report about sequence diversity in the Spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. They analyze both virus that has been grown in tissue culture and virus isolated from the respiratory tract from infected people. There is a critical need to follow Spike protein evolution both within and between people as this could lead to new strains that could escape the anticipated protection that will be provided by the current vaccines. The authors improve on existing sequencing approaches by using an SGS approach but at higher per-specimen sampling than is typically done, and this is done over a relatively large region of the genome (wedding the deep part of "deep sequencing" with SGS accuracy for sampling individual genomes). What has seemed like an obvious approach of using a UMI with PacBio long read technology has been difficult due to the high error rate of PacBio which makes it hard to accurately identify the UMI. Overcoming this problem will be a welcome addition to the field. The number of long reads one can get from a sample is limited by the number of long cDNA molecules that RT can generate (i.e. the number of templates), in this case 6.1 kb. The relatively high titers of SARS-CoV-2 samples conveniently overcomes this limitation by providing a larger number of starting RNA templates. The paper does an elegant job of linking the antibody response to longitudinal changes in the Spike protein sequence and antibody escape in one case but a case that is very informative.</p>
              <p>This is an important piece of work. I have only a few technical questions. The biology in the paper is on mark addressing important questions.</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>
                <bold>Part II – Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p>
              <p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Major comments:</p>
              <p>1. The authors document very reasonable and extensive bioinformatic controls for sequence quality, UMI consolidation, and consensus genome calling. However, the authors have not directly performed validation experiments that benchmark a. this method’s intrinsic error rate on a sample with no variation or b. its ability to correctly characterize within-host haplotype frequencies across various RNA input quantities and read counts. In my opinion, the authors need to perform some additional validation experiments to address these concerns. To address point a, the authors should perform a simple validation experiment in which the authors sequence a clonal RNA transcript and report the number of detected haplotypes and their frequencies. This would provide a raw error rate of their method, and provide a more direct way of measuring the error rate of their RT and PCR protocols than by relying on the variant calling and error correction method described in the Methods. Suggestions for addressing point b are below in comments 2 and 3.</p>
              <p>2. Given the known sensitivity of within-host variant detection to input RNA copies, the authors should report in a table somewhere in the main text the number of RNA copies in each sample that is sequenced.</p>
              <p>3. In the authors sequencing results, there is a wide range of the number of total single-genome consensus sequences generated for each sample. While in some samples the number is reasonably high &gt;1000), in patients 6 and 7 and patient 1 on days 13 and 17, the total number of single genomes is quite low. The sequencing results from these samples are quite difficult to interpret as is. It seems to me that greater single genome consensus sequences should provide higher resolution of within-host haplotype frequencies, and I would guess that samples with higher viral RNA contents generally produce more single genome consensus sequences. However, these points are not made explicit and the authors have not designated a cutoff for either a viral load necessary for this method to be successful or for a number of successfully sequenced single genome consensus sequences for this method to accurately represent the within-host diversity of the sample. These values will be quite important for readers who may be interested in applying this new method, and are also important for interpreting the results shown in the paper. I would suggest that following revisions and control experiments, or something that accomplishes similar goals:</p>
              <p>a. The authors should discuss in the text whether the number of single genome consensus sequences is correlated to the viral load of the original sample. A plot showing this relationship would be helpful. This is particularly important because the authors remark throughout the paper that their method can be used to characterize thousands of individual viral genomes, but they only ever report, at maximum, ~1200 single genomes for a given sample.</p>
              <p>b. The authors could perform some sort of serial dilution experiment in which a known variant haplotype is spiked into a wild type, clonal RNA at some frequency, and then serial dilutions are generated and sequenced. This would provide important information about how to interpret haplotype frequencies derived from low copy number samples. I realize that this is bit more work, but it would provide information that would be quite useful. Alternatively, if the authors can perform some sort of experiment that clarifies the relationship between viral load and Method accuracy, that would be great.</p>
              <p>c. The authors should assess in some way how the total number of unique single genome consensus sequences impacts haplotype detection. This could be accomplished bioinformatically by randomly subsampling down one of their samples with &gt;1000 single genome consensus sequences to varying degrees, and comparing the output. This sort of information would be really helpful for interpreting the haplotype results for the samples with very low numbers of single genome consensus sequences.</p>
              <p>While all three of these experiments may not be absolutely necessary, I do think that these questions should be addressed in some way in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>

                <bold>Part III – Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold>
              </p>
              <p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Minor comments and points of clarification:</p>
              <p>1. In the Methods, the authors report using 1000 cDNA input copies into the PCR reaction. This point was not clear to me. The authors are able to generate &gt;1000 unique single genome consensus sequences for some samples, despite only using 1000 cDNA input copies. How is this possible? Is this just pipetting error? Why did the authors choose to limit their input to 1000 cDNA copies? The authors state multiple times in the manuscript that their method is designed to sequence thousands of individual viral genomes, but it seems that by limiting the copy numbers that they are by definition restricting their sequencing to ~1000 copies. The authors should clarify this in the text.</p>
              <p>2. If possible, I would find it very helpful to see a calculation of: given the number of input RNA molecules, what is the probability that 2 different RNAs get labelled with the same UMI? Alternatively, how much in excess is the UMI vs the RNA? Some sense for this would be helpful.</p>
              <p>3. On lines 211-216, the authors discuss the amount of virus in patient 1 as comparable to other, acutely infected patients, but do not discuss the duration of shedding. While the viral load is certainly important for within-host viral evolution, the duration of shedding is also critical given that it determines whether within-host viral replication is still occurring at the time of antibody development. The authors should acknowledge this and perhaps could cite some literature describing within-host evolution during prolonged infections.</p>
              <p>4. The description of the node collapsing and adjacency method could be clarified a bit. It sounds to me like what is happening is that you connect UMIs that are separated by 1 and meet this number criteria and then you collapse them all into 1. Is that right? It is also not immediately clear to me what the difference between the knee point and inflection point is. The authors could add a sentence in the Methods to describe this for readers who may not be familiar with this.</p>
              <p>5. It is not clear to me exactly when the variant calling correction is implemented. Is this done on the consensus sequences of each UMI bin? Or is this done on the raw reads themselves?</p>
              <p>6. On line 263: “Supernatants were transferred to separate tubes, and supernatant and pellet fractions were processed in parallel, although single-genome sequences derived from these two fractions were subsequently found to be similar and were thus pooled for each sample in the final analysis.” Do the authors mean that the pellets and supernatants were combined for one particular set of samples, or that the reads were combined later? Were pellets and supernatants initially separated to compare within-host variants in genomic RNA vs. cell-associated RNA?</p>
              <p>7. On line 304, what is the “log rank of that UMI bin within the sample”? I had assumed initially that the log rank was just an ordered list of UMIs, ordered by read count, but was unsure. Also, is Figure S2 showing the results for the WA-1 BEI sample or some other sample?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: 1. The genomes appear to contain mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms with but maybe some examples of polymorphisms in two different genes. To get at the issue of recombination during PCR (which always happens) it would be good to be clear whether or not the linkage is perfect in the sequenced genomes or whether there has been any scrambling of the markers between genomes. Scrambling could have occurred in vivo or during PCR, but an absence of scrambling would indicate that it didn't happen during PCR. It still happens during PCR but the ability to build a consensus sequence for each template masks those events.</p>
              <p>2. Since cDNA synthesis has poor processivity it would be interesting to know how many genome sequences are obtained as a function of copies of RNA used in the initial cDNA reaction, i.e. what is the efficiency of template utilization in this sequencing approach?</p>
              <p>3. RT has a reported incorporation error rate of 1 in 10,000 nucleotides during cDNA synthesis (I believe listed in the manufacturers information). This would mean that every second genome would have an RT error incorporated. In this scenario a pool of identical RNA sequences would have the occasional difference due to RT during cDNA synthesis and still have its own UMI tag so artificial diversity. However, it seems that the authors are looking at homogeneous populations that defy this presumption. One way to address this question is to look at the same population twice. If the low level diversity is the result of RT error then it should not be reproducible. If it is real then it will repeat (given sufficient sampling). This is an important question both for the technique and for understanding true low level diversity in these viral populations.</p>
