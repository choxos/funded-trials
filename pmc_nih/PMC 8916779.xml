                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Non-antiviral therapeutic options are required for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. CD24Fc is an immunomodulator with potential to reduce the exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injuries. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD24Fc in hospitalised adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen support.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study at nine medical centres in the USA. Hospitalised patients (age ≥18 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were receiving oxygen support and standard of care were randomly assigned (1:1) by site-stratified block randomisation to receive a single intravenous infusion of CD24Fc 480 mg or placebo. The study funder, investigators, and patients were masked to treatment group assignment. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement over 28 days, defined as time that elapsed between a baseline National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ordinal scale score of 2–4 and reaching a score of 5 or higher or hospital discharge. The prespecified primary interim analysis was done when 146 participants reached the time to clinical improvement endpoint. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population. This study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04317040" id="interrefs20">NCT04317040</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 24 and Sept 22, 2020, 243 hospitalised patients were assessed for eligibility and 234 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive CD24Fc (n=116) or placebo (n=118). The prespecified interim analysis was done when 146 participants reached the time to clinical improvement endpoint among 197 randomised participants. In the interim analysis, the 28-day clinical improvement rate was 82% (81 of 99) for CD24Fc versus 66% (65 of 98) for placebo; median time to clinical improvement was 6·0 days (95% CI 5·0–8·0) in the CD24Fc group versus 10·0 days (7·0–15·0) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·61, 95% CI 1·16–2·23; log-rank p=0·0028, which crossed the prespecified efficacy boundary [α=0·0147]). 37 participants were randomly assigned after the interim analysis data cutoff date; among the 234 randomised participants, median time to clinical improvement was 6·0 days (95% CI 5·0–9·0) in the CD24Fc group versus 10·5 days (7·0–15·0) in the placebo group (HR 1·40, 95% CI 1·02–1·92; log-rank p=0·037). The proportion of participants with disease progression within 28 days was 19% (22 of 116) in the CD24Fc group versus 31% (36 of 118) in the placebo group (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·33–0·95; unadjusted p=0·031). The incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar in both groups. No treatment-related adverse events were observed.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>CD24Fc is generally well tolerated and accelerates clinical improvement of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen support. These data suggest that targeting inflammation in response to tissue injuries might provide a therapeutic option for patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

              <p id="para10">COVID-19 is characterised by a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild influenza-like illness (eg, cough, myalgia, fatigue, low-grade fever, headache, and diarrhoea) to severe disease including viral pneumonia (eg, dyspnoea and hypoxaemia) that can rapidly progress to critical illness involving acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulopathy, shock, multiorgan failure, and death.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although the exact mechanism underlying the pathobiology of severe COVID-19 is not known, viral replication causes necroptosis of lung epithelial cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Neighbouring pneumocytes and resident macrophages recognise components released from the necroptotic cells and inflammatory cytokines and initiate a hyperinflammatory signalling cascade resulting in the uncontrolled production and release of cytokines or chemokines (otherwise known as a cytokine storm), including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor α, and interferon γ.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para130">We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at nine medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants were hospitalised adults (age ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR, who were requiring oxygen support (oxygen saturations &lt;94%). Initially, the protocol specified that eligible participants included adults with COVID-19 and a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) 8-point ordinal scale (NIAID-OS) score of 3 (ie, receiving non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen) or 4 (ie, receiving supplemental oxygen), regardless of acute respiratory distress syndrome. After the event number required for interim analysis was reached, the protocol was amended to also allow the enrolment of participants with critical COVID-19, defined by an NIAID-OS score of 2 (ie, receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) if intubation occurred within 7 days from randomisation.</p>
                <p id="para140">Exclusion criteria were previous enrolment in a CD24Fc clinical trial, women who were pregnant or breastfeeding, and patients with severe liver disease (Child-Pugh score C or aspartate aminotransferase more than five times the upper limit of normal) or renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min or receiving renal replacement therapy).</p>
                <p id="para150">The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a central institutional review board (Western Institutional Review Board, Seattle, WA, USA) and accepted by the institutional review board at each study centre. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol, protocol amendments, Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before enrolment. The protocol is included in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 10–99</xref>).</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para160">Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intravenous infusion of either CD24Fc 480 mg or placebo over 60 min on day 1. The study drug and placebo were diluted to 100 mL with normal saline by local hospital pharmacists. The study funder, investigators, and patients were masked to treatment group assignment. In addition to the assigned treatment, all participants received the standard of care and other experimental therapeutics at the treating physician's discretion following local institutional guidelines for COVID-19 treatment. Randomisation was stratified by study site. The block randomisation schedule, with a block size of four, was produced by a computerised random list generator and was securely provided to trained, unmasked pharmacists at each site.</p>

                <p id="para170">The protocol-specified primary outcome was the time to sustained clinical improvement in COVID-19 disease status from randomisation (day 1) to day 29, defined as the time that elapsed between a baseline NIAID-OS score of 2–4 and a score of 5 or higher (ie, not requiring supplemental oxygen, based on oxygen saturation threshold of 93%) without a drop in score to less than 5zthin 28 days. The clinical status of each participant was evaluated by the treating physician through day 29 using the NIAID-OS (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04280705" id="interrefs80">NCT04280705</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs90">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> entry on March 20, 2020, by the NIAID ACTT-1 Study Team; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 13–17</xref>). Participants who were discharged from hospital before day 29 were interviewed by telephone or telemedicine weekly (plus or minus 3 days). The date when the participant showed sustained clinical improvement with an NIAID-OS score of 5 or higher or hospital discharge date, whichever came first, was used as the date of clinical improvement. If the participant was rehospitalised for respiratory distress, a record of rehospitalisation with oxygen therapy was used to modify the clinical improvement date. The new time to clinical improvement was modified to the time from randomisation to the last improvement to a NIAID-OS score of 5 or higher or the last date of hospital discharge, whichever came first.</p>
                <p id="para180">Prespecified key secondary outcomes reported herein were the proportion of participants who had died or had respiratory failure (ie, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, ECMO, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen devices) by day 29, time to hospital discharge, hospital discharge without readmission, time to intubation, time to disease progression (ie, time to progression from NIAID-OS score of 3 or 4 to 1 or 2, or from 2 to 1, from randomisation to day 28), and all-cause mortality (at days 15 and 29).</p>
                <p id="para190">Other secondary endpoints, including proportion of participants with clinical relapse (ie, return to oxygen support for at least 1 day after initial recovery within 28 days after treatment), conversion rate of clinical status on days 8 and 15 (ie, proportion of participants who changed from NIAID-OS score of 2–4 to 5 or higher within 28 days after randomisation), and duration of hospitalisation were not reported in the manuscript as their effects are integrated into the primary endpoint analysis.</p>
                <p id="para200">The general safety and tolerability profile of CD24Fc was assessed by monitoring adverse events (grade 3–5) during the 28-day treatment period and comparing the incidences of specific adverse events by system organ classes in both treatment groups. The study investigators rated the severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and relatedness (possibly, probably, or definitely related to study medication) of each adverse event.</p>

                <p id="para210">The primary endpoint was assessed in the intention-to-treat population and was analysed according to the treatment assigned at randomisation, regardless of the actual treatment received. For the analysis of the primary endpoint (time to clinical improvement), all participants without clinical improvement or who died within 28 days were censored on the day 29 visit.</p>
                <p id="para220">The sample size of the trial was determined on the basis of the analysis of the primary endpoint. A total of 208 events in the intention-to-treat population would provide 80% power with a two-sided significance level of 0·05 to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·54 for time to clinical improvement with CD24Fc versus placebo, assuming the median time to clinical recovery was 7·14 days in the CD24Fc group and 11·00 days in the placebo group, using a log-rank test. The assumption of median time to clinical recovery of 11·00 days in the placebo group in this study is consistent with reported outcomes seen in previous studies in patients receiving remdesivir.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> An interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of time to clinical improvement was prespecified to occur when 146 participants reached the time to clinical improvement endpoint (70% of the planned 208 total events), with a two-sided α level of 0·0147 (ie, the predefined stopping boundary) computed by Lan-DeMets function approximating the O'Brien-Fleming boundary.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>

                <p id="para230">Subgroups of patients with baseline NIAID-OS score of either 2–4 or 3–4 and those who received or did not receive standard-of-care concomitant therapies were assessed for clinical improvement. The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves for the primary analysis of time to event endpoints and was used to compute related p values. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probability of sustained clinical improvement, as well as to calculate the median time from randomisation to clinical improvement for each group. The Brookmeyer-Crowley method was used to construct the 95% CIs for the medians. HRs and 95% CIs were estimated by the Cox proportional hazard model.</p>
                <p id="para240">All participants enrolled and randomised before the final database lock date (Jan 31, 2021) were included for a supportive analysis of the time to clinical improvement endpoint and for all efficacy analyses of secondary endpoints.</p>
                <p id="para250">For the analysis of the secondary endpoints using proportions, Fisher's exact test was used to test differences in the proportions who died or had respiratory failure between the treatment groups and for the all-cause mortality endpoint. The log-rank test was used to compare the time to disease progression between the two groups. Analyses of secondary endpoints were exploratory, not adjusted for multiplicity, and their associated p values were considered nominal. All randomised participants who received at least one dose of study therapy (as-treated population) were included in the safety analyses.</p>

Five participants were not dosed because they became ineligible before dosing (two participants in the CD24Fc group, three in the placebo group). Data from all randomised participants who were enrolled before the interim analysis cutoff date (Aug 21, 2020) were included in the interim primary analysis of time to clinical improvement (n=197). After the interim analysis cutoff date, the study entry criteria were modified to allow enrolment of participants with critical COVID-19 disease (ie, NIAID-OS score of 2, receiving mechanical ventilation or ECMO). 37 participants were enrolled after the interim analysis cutoff date (17 participants in the CD24Fc group and 20 in the placebo group) until the final database lock date (ie, enrolled between Aug 21, 2020, and the end of enrolment on Sept 22, 2020); of these, three participants in the CD24Fc group and one in the placebo group had an NIAID-OS score of 2 at study entry. Two additional participants were enrolled and randomly assigned in error; these participants were not included in the intention-to-treat population as they were determined to be ineligible in hindsight.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para410">This study showed that, among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who were requiring oxygen support, the administration of a single intravenous infusion of CD24Fc 480 mg led to robust, significant, and sustained improvements in time to clinical improvement compared with placebo over the 28-day period after treatment.</p>
              <p id="para420">When time to clinical improvement was analysed by NIAID-OS score at baseline, the magnitude of the between-group difference in response was numerically larger in the subgroup of participants with less severe disease at baseline (ie, NIAID-OS score of 4 <italic>vs</italic> NIAID-OS score of 3), which suggests that CD24Fc is more effective when administered early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Beneficial effects of CD24Fc on clinical status at day 28 were seen across all other subgroups examined, including by age, race, and sex. Taken together, the results from this study show that CD24Fc substantially and meaningfully improved time to clinical improvement, based on either reduction of oxygen support or hospitalisation duration, compared with placebo in hospitalised participants with COVID-19 who had varied baseline demographics.</p>
              <p id="para430">During the course of this study, use of remdesivir, systemic corticosteroids, or convalescent plasma therapy, or a combination thereof, became more widespread for the treatment of COVID-19, due to positive signals reported in the medical literature and emergency use authorisations issued by the FDA.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Most participants in this study (95%) received at least one concomitant COVID-19 therapy during the randomised treatment period, and dexamethasone and remdesivir were the most common. The benefit of CD24Fc versus placebo on time to clinical improvement was observed across subgroups of participants receiving many standard-of-care therapies. These findings suggest that CD24Fc could be a beneficial addition to the treatment armamentarium in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, leading to reduced hospital stays and improved clinical status. A limitation of this study was that convalescent plasma therapy was considered as part of standard of care during the enrolment period, before randomised studies with convalescent plasma therapy failed to show efficacy in patients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para440">In addition to beneficial effects on time to clinical improvement, secondary analyses showed that treatment with CD24Fc also reduced the likelihood of disease progression, defined by death or need for invasive mechanical ventilation, by 44% compared with placebo, and shortened the time to hospital discharge by 3·5 days. Consistent with the reduced rate of intubation in the CD24Fc group, there was a numerical reduction in death and respiratory failure in the CD24Fc group compared with placebo at day 29 (22% <italic>vs</italic> 28%, respectively) that did not reach significance. The between-group differences in all-cause mortality by day 29 were –2% (p=0·75) in the overall population and –12% (p=0·030) in patients requiring intubation (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). No apparent benefit with respect to survival at 4 weeks was seen in this study, which might be due to the small sample size or short observation period. These results should be considered exploratory in nature because adjustments for multiple comparisons were not prespecified in the study protocol.</p>
              <p id="para450">The overall adverse event profiles were similar in the CD24Fc and placebo groups. The incidences and types of adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and serious adverse events were generally similar across the treatment groups. The adverse events observed were consistent with a population of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The most frequently observed adverse events in both treatment groups were in the system organ class of respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The incidences of anaemia-related adverse events were higher in the CD24Fc group than in the placebo group, but none were considered related to study treatment. Consistent with the beneficial effect of CD24Fc on clinical improvement, the incidence of respiratory failure-related adverse events was numerically higher in the placebo group than in the CD24Fc group.</p>
              <p id="para460">Previous studies with IL-6 receptor antagonists have shown mixed results with respect to improvements in clinical recovery and delayed disease progression in hospitalised patients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> By comparison, this study showed that CD24Fc accelerates clinical recovery and reduces disease progression among hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The observed effects on clinical status observed in this trial are likely to be due to the novel mechanism of action of CD24Fc that suppresses production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and decreases inflammation in multiple tissues, including the lungs.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Through interactions with Siglec-G in mice and Siglec-10 in humans, CD24 functions as an innate immune checkpoint surveillance molecule that suppresses activation of NF-κB caused by tissue injury—namely, danger-associated molecular patterns such as HMGB1 and HSP70/90.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This pathway might be defective in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as Siglec-10 has been shown to be selectively downregulated in lung tissue in patients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Exogenous HMGB1 also induces the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The broad impact of CD24Fc on inflammation in patients with COVID-19, as described elsewhere,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> is consistent with this notion.</p>
              <p id="para470">We did our primary analysis in the intention-to-treat population as this is the standard approach, although there are some potential drawbacks of this approach that have been described previously.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> After the prespecified interim analysis, this study was stopped on the basis of the efficacy criteria for stopping enrolment being met. Although this resulted in a small patient population, the robust results in both primary and secondary outcomes, as well as in subgroup analyses, are supportive of the prespecified stopping point being correctly designed into the trial to provide a reliable measure of treatment effect. An additional independent trial would be valuable to confirm the clinical benefit found in this study and could be designed with a longer study duration and the power to evaluate survival benefits. Because this study enrolled very few patients who were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, the effect of CD24Fc in these patients requires further study. Finally, as the trial was conducted in 2020, the effect of CD24Fc against more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants has not been tested. However, as CD24Fc targets the host immune system, its therapeutic activity would be less likely to be affected by viral mutations.</p>
              <p id="para480">Treatment with CD24Fc significantly accelerated clinical improvement. It also reduced disease progression and shortened the length of hospital stay among participants with COVID-19 receiving oxygen support. CD24Fc had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile compared with placebo.</p>

                <p>CD24Fc has been acquired by Merck &amp; Co (Kenilworth, NJ, USA). OncoImmune (Rockville, MD, USA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co, funded this trial, with partial support from a grant from the National Cancer Institute (R44CA246991-02S1), provided the trial drugs, and collaborated with the academic authors and consultants on the trial design as well as the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. ClinSmart (Newtown, PA, USA) conducted the trial according to the protocol and collected the data. A data and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety and efficacy data with assistance from an unmasked statistical team at Edetek (Princeton, NJ, USA). The statisticians at Edetek analysed the data with assistance from Merck &amp; Co (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) and OncoImmune. All authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. We thank Amy O Johnson-Levonas, Jennifer Rotonda, and Michele McColgan, employees of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp (Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA), a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co, for their assistance with editing and preparing this paper for publication.</p>
