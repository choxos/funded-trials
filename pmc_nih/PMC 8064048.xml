                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p><italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> is a parasitic helminth that causes urogenital pathology. The impact of urogenital schistosomiasis during pregnancy on birth outcomes and child growth is poorly understood.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s0101">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Risk factors for urogenital schistosomiasis were characterized among 4437 pregnant women enrolled in a cluster-randomized community-based trial in rural Zimbabwe. Infection was defined via urine microscopy (≥1 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> egg) and urinalysis (hematuria). Associations between infection and pregnancy outcomes were assessed in case-control analyses using conditional logistic regression. The association of maternal infection with birthweight and length-for-age Z scores (LAZ) at 1 and 18 months of age were assessed using generalized estimating equations.</p>

                <sec id="s0102">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Urogenital schistosomiasis (egg positive and/or hematuria positive) was detected in 26.8% of pregnant women. Risk factors significantly associated with infection were maternal age, education, marital status, and religion; household drinking water source and latrine; study region; and season. Urogenital schistosomiasis was not significantly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm, and small-for-gestational age), birthweight, neonatal death, or LAZ.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Including pregnant women in antihelminthic treatment programs would benefit a large number of women in rural Zimbabwe. However, clearance of the low-intensity infections that predominate in this context is unlikely to have additive benefits for pregnancy outcomes or child growth.</p>

            <p>Urogenital schistosomiasis is a highly prevalent disease in sub-Saharan Africa caused by <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> parasites. Infection is transmitted by freshwater-dwelling larval schistosomes, which penetrate the skin, migrate, and mature into long-lived adult worms residing in urogenital blood vessels. Adult worm pairs continuously produce eggs, which pass from blood to urine for excretion. Ongoing egg deposition drives chronic tissue damage, which can progress to renal and urogenital dysfunction if untreated [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Microscopic detection of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> eggs in urine is diagnostic of urogenital schistosomiasis, which can also be identified indirectly via hematuria [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>]. Adult worms can be cleared by the antihelminthic drug praziquantel; however, treatment does not clear immature parasites nor prevent reinfection [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Repeated exposure to new infections, which is common in endemic communities reliant on unprotected water sources, can drive high-intensity infections associated with more severe pathology [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. International guidelines advocate for improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) provision and practice uptake as a means of controlling schistosomiasis [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
            <p>Schistosome prevalence and infection intensity peak in school-age children, the predominant target of epidemiological evaluation and mass drug administration programs (MDA) [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Much less is known about the risk factors for urogenital schistosomiasis among pregnant women. An estimated 40 million reproductive-age women are currently infected and 10 million African women per year have schistosomiasis during pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Female genital schistosomiasis, which affects approximately 16 million women [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], includes active infections and genital pathology that persists posttreatment [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends inclusion of pregnant women in MDA [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite evidence from retrospective studies and randomized controlled trials that praziquantel treatment during pregnancy safely and effectively improves maternal health without adverse effects on the fetus [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>], pregnant women continue to be excluded from schistosomiasis control programs in several countries [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], including Zimbabwe. It is hypothesized that schistosomiasis during pregnancy could lead to adverse birth outcomes and negatively impact child growth in early life [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are associated with life-long health deficits [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The prevalence of preterm birth in Zimbabwe is among the highest in the world [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and 35% of children in rural Zimbabwe are stunted by 18 months of age [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; it is unclear whether in utero exposure to urogenital schistosomiasis contributes to these conditions.</p>
            <p>We surveyed urogenital schistosomiasis among pregnant women in rural Zimbabwe, assessed risk factors for infection, and monitored pregnancy outcomes, neonatal deaths, birthweight, and child linear growth. We hypothesized that maternal schistosomiasis would be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, low birthweight, and child stunting.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Setting</title>
                <p>SHINE was a cluster-randomized community-based 2 × 2 factorial trial testing the independent and combined effects of a household WASH intervention and an infant and young child feeding (IYCF) intervention on child linear growth and hemoglobin at 18 months of age [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; primary trial results are reported elsewhere [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study area comprised 2 rural districts of Midlands province, Zimbabwe (Shurugwi and Chirumanzu), which had high <italic>S. haematobium</italic> prevalence but low <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (intestinal schistosomiasis) and soil-transmitted helminth prevalence among school-age children [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Districts were divided into 212 clusters, defined as the catchment area of 1–4 village health workers employed by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care, which were randomized into 4 study arms (standard of care [SOC], IYCF, WASH, and IYCF + WASH). SHINE created 4 study offices (hubs): Mvuma and St Theresa in Chirumanzu district and Shurugwi town and Tongogara in Shurugwi district. National MDA provided praziquantel and albendazole to 5–15 year olds annually, in accordance with national guidelines.</p>
                <p>Rainfall and temperature for each cluster were extracted from raster maps (October–March for rainfall and January–December for temperature; 1983–2015) obtained after kriging interpolation using 47 Zimbabwean weather stations.</p>

                <p>Between 22 November 2012 and 27 March 2015, village health workers identified pregnancies through prospective surveillance; eligible women were permanent residents in the districts, confirmed pregnant, and provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>Research nurses made home visits at baseline (approximately 2 weeks after mothers provided consent), 32 weeks’ gestation, and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum to assess maternal and household characteristics and trial outcomes. Date of last menstrual period, height, weight, midupper arm circumference, hemoglobin concentrations (Hemocue), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status (rapid test algorithm Determine HIV-1/2 [Alere International Ltd] followed by INSTI HIV-1/2 [bioLytical Laboratories Inc.] if positive) and urogenital symptoms (questionnaire administered by research nurses) were determined at baseline. HIV-positive women were urged to seek immediate antenatal care for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. All participants with baseline parasitology data were included in urogenital schistosomiasis risk factor analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Selection of women for inclusion in assessment of risk factors for urogenital schistosomiasis during pregnancy and its impact on birth outcomes and child growth. In total, 212 clusters were randomized, 53 in each of the 4 trial arms (SOC, IYCF, WASH, and IYCF + WASH). After randomisation, 1 cluster was excluded because it was in an urban area, 1 was excluded because the village health workers covering it mainly had clients outside the study area, and 2 more were merged on the basis of subsequent data for village health worker coverage, leaving 210 clusters from the original randomisation. Three new cluster designations were created because of anomalies in the original mapping. For 2 of these clusters, the trial group was clear; the third contained areas that were in 2 trial groups, and was assigned to the under-represented group, resulting in 53 clusters in each group. All these changes occurred before enrolment began. When enrolment was completed, there was 1 cluster (SOC) in which no women were enrolled, leaving a total of 211 clusters available for analysis. Infant follow-up was lower at the 1-month than the 18-month visit due to cultural practice for women (especially primiparous) to return to their parental home during the perinatal period. Mothers of infants with 1-month LAZ were, on average, 1.5 years older and had higher parity than mothers of infants with missing data; no other meaningful differences were observed [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Of the 564 mother-infant dyads missing 18-month infant length, 146 were miscarriages, 86 stillbirths, 116 neonatal deaths, and 100 postnatal deaths (78 infant deaths, 11 child deaths, 7 deaths with unknown date of death, 2 deaths with unknown date of birth, and 2 deaths after 18 months).

                <p>Fetal losses were reported to the study team. A narrative of the event was obtained by a research nurse and reviewed by a senior research nurse and the study physician. Based on the date of last menstrual period, fetal loss &lt;28 gestational weeks was classified as miscarriage and fetal loss &gt;28 gestational weeks as stillbirth.</p>
                <p>For liveborn infants, delivery details and birthweight were transcribed from health facility records. SHINE provided Tanita BD-590 infant scales (Arlington Heights) to all 43 health institutions in the study area and trained staff in their use. Infants &lt;2500 g were classified as low birthweight according to international standards [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Gestational age (GA) at delivery was calculated from the date of the mother’s last menstrual period. Preterm was defined as a liveborn infant with GA &lt;37 completed weeks. Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as birthweight &lt;10th centile and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) as birthweight <italic>&gt;</italic>10th centile [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Infants were categorized as SGA/term, SGA/preterm, AGA/term, and AGA/preterm. Neonatal deaths, defined as liveborn infants who died within 28 days of birth, were identified by village health workers/research nurses and reported to the study physician. Child length was compared to WHO growth standards to calculate length-for-age Z score (LAZ) and identify stunting (LAZ ≤ −2) [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Infants born to mothers with singleton pregnancies with known outcome and baseline parasitology were included in anthropometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

                <title>Case-Control Studies of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes and Neonatal Deaths</title>
                <p>Case-control analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between schistosomiasis during pregnancy and each adverse pregnancy outcome and neonatal death. Women who had singleton pregnancies with known outcome, known HIV status, known GA, and available baseline parasitology were eligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For miscarriage, we used 1:2 incidence density sampling to select 1 woman who miscarried (case) and 2 women with the same HIV status, SHINE arm, and GA at baseline (±2 weeks) who did not miscarry by the gestational week of the case event (controls). We used a similar sampling approach for stillbirth, matching 1 woman who experienced fetal loss (case) to 2 women with the same HIV status, SHINE arm, GA at baseline (±2 weeks), and infant sex who did not have a stillbirth by the gestational week of the case event (controls). Controls were selected with replacement so that a single control could be matched to more than 1 case and could also become a case later. For neonatal deaths, we selected 1 woman whose liveborn infant died &lt;28 days postpartum (case) and 2 women whose liveborn infant had not died by the time of the case event (controls), matched on maternal HIV status, SHINE arm, infant sex, and GA at baseline (±2 weeks). For SGA and preterm outcomes, we pooled the 3 case groups (SGA/term, AGA/preterm, and SGA/preterm), and matched AGA/term controls based on maternal HIV status, SHINE arm, infant sex, and GA at baseline (±2 weeks) until we had ≥1.73 times the number of controls in the largest case group. This was based on a group matching approach, ensuring that the minimum number of unique controls exceeded the largest case group by √k (k = number of case groups, 3).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Urogenital schistosomiasis was categorized into 3 diagnostic definitions: (1) <italic>S. haematobium</italic> egg-positive; (2) hematuria-positive; and (3) egg-positive and/or hematuria-positive. Cluster-adjusted <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> tests and 2-sided <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess the relationship between schistosomiasis and categorical and continuous variables, respectively.</p>
                <p>Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression with a logit link to estimate odds ratios and exchangeable correlation structure was used to model the relationship between egg or hematuria status and possible risk factors for infection identified from the literature. Because risk factors and infection were assessed at baseline, prior to SHINE interventions, analyses were not adjusted for SHINE arm. To accommodate the high frequency of egg-negative participants (89.4%), zero-inflated negative binomial regression (ZINB) was used to model the association between possible risk factors for infection and infection intensity. Variables significantly associated with egg and/or hematuria status at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .25 were entered into multivariable GEE. Variables were entered into multivariable ZINB using the same criteria.</p>
                <p>For case-control studies, separate conditional logistic regression models were used to model the association between schistosomiasis status and each adverse outcome. Models were adjusted for variables associated with both schistosomiasis and the outcome at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .1; models for miscarriage, SGA/term, and SGA/preterm were adjusted for maternal age; models for stillbirth were adjusted for SHINE hub; and models for neonatal death and AGA/preterm were unadjusted. Separate unadjusted models were run for schistosome infection intensity and hematuria severity.</p>
                <p>GEE population-averaged models accounting for clustering were used to model relationships between schistosomiasis and birthweight and 1-month and 18-month LAZ, and separately with the odds of low birthweight and 1-month and 18-month stunting.

                <p>Of 5280 pregnant women enrolled in SHINE, 4437 with a median of 12.14 weeks’ gestation (interquartile range, 9.43–16.29) at baseline were included in this study (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of these, 471 (10.6%) were egg-positive. Of the egg-positive women, 426 (90.4%) had low-intensity, 38 (8.1%) had high-intensity, and 7 (1.5%) had unknown-intensity infections. Of the 4298 women who also had urinalysis data, 1048 (24.4%) were hematuria-positive. Of the hematuria-positive women, 394 had trace (37.6%), 101 had small/+ (9.6%), 279 had moderate/++ (26.6%), and 274 had large/+++ hematuria (26.1%). Of the egg-positive women with urinalysis data, 79.0% were also hematuria-positive; women with more severe hematuria had higher infection intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The distribution of egg-positive and hematuria-positive women by study cluster and enrolment month is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Overall, 1155 out of 4308 women (26.8%) with urinalysis data and/or who were egg-positive (ie, could be classified as infected without urinalysis data) had 1 or both indicators of urogenital schistosomiasis. More egg-positive women (33.3% of egg-positive vs 18.7% of egg-negative; <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup>, 54.0; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and hematuria-positive women (33.5% of hematuria-positive vs 16.1% hematuria-negative; <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup>, 147.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) had detectable leukocytes in their urine indicative of urogenital inflammation. Urogenital symptoms were infrequent; however, significantly higher proportions of egg-positive and/or hematuria-positive women reported lower abdominal pain and hemoglobin levels were significantly lower among hematuria-positive and egg-positive and/or hematuria-positive women (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).

Limited access to household WASH at baseline was associated with greater odds of being egg-positive (no improved drinking water) and hematuria-positive (no improved latrine and no improved drinking water; <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Women recruited from Shurugwi hub had significantly higher odds of being egg-positive and hematuria-positive than women from Mvuma (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We identified a high prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis among pregnant women in rural Zimbabwe, via <italic>S. haematobium</italic> eggs in urine (10.6%), hematuria (24.4%), or both/either indicator (26.8%). Infections were predominantly low intensity, trace-to-moderate hematuria, and without urogenital symptoms. Infection was associated with younger age, fewer years of education, poor WASH access, religious practice, region, and season of recruitment, consistent with other demographic groups in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite the substantial morbidity associated with chronic schistosomiasis [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], infection status during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal death, low birthweight, or child stunting.</p>
              <p>Hematuria was included in our definition of urogenital schistosomiasis to reflect the single urine sample available per participant, the low sensitivity of urine microscopy for low-intensity infections, which were predominant in our cohort, and female genital schistosomiasis pathology due to encystment of eggs in tissues [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both eggs and hematuria have established validity for detection of urogenital schistosomiasis in endemic areas [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], although hematuria can result from alternative causes [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The association between hematuria and urogenital schistosomiasis is supported in our cohort by the geographical overlap between egg-positive and hematuria-positive prevalence, and higher infection intensities among women with more severe hematuria.</p>
              <p>Existing data on <italic>S. haematobium</italic> epidemiology in Zimbabwe primarily come from school-age children [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We demonstrate that pregnant women share similar risk factors for schistosomiasis, despite the high percentage of Zimbabwean women with awareness of transmission and prevention methods [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Maternal age was significantly associated with schistosomiasis; younger women had greater odds of being egg positive or hematuria positive, consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30–32</xref>]. A convex age-prevalence and age-infection intensity relationship is typical in schistosome-endemic communities, with infections accumulated in early life, peaking in childhood, and declining with age thereafter [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The age-related decline in infection could be driven by development of immune-mediated resistance [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], increasing years of education [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and/or changes in physiology [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and water contact behavior [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>]. For example, younger women tend to have more water contacts than older women [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and a higher percentage of older women are aware of schistosomiasis [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Consistent with household WASH influencing transmission, odds of being infected were higher among women without an improved latrine or improved drinking water. Apostolic Christians, known for using unprotected water sources during religious practices [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], were more likely to be infected than other Christian groups. Women recruited in the dry season had greater odds of being hematuria positive than those recruited during the rainy season; however, because schistosomes are long lived, the season of initial infection could not be ascertained. Before MDA, Midlands province was in the highest prevalence and intensity categories for <italic>S. haematobium</italic> infection among school-age children in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We show that urogenital schistosomiasis prevalence is also high among pregnant women in Midlands province, and Shurugwi district in particular. Women from Shurugwi hub had the highest odds of infection; however, egg-positive women from Shurugwi hub had lower infection intensities than egg-positive women from Mvuma. Such regional differences may be explained by prioritization of Shurugwi for MDA among school children, as advocated by 2014 surveys [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and/or development of immunity to new infections at a younger age in Shurugwi driven by higher local exposure rates [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>Urogenital inflammation due to schistosomiasis has been hypothesized to drive adverse birth outcomes [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, we did not find evidence that schistosomiasis status affected adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal death, birthweight, or LAZ. Consistent with our data, being <italic>S. haematobium</italic> egg positive was not associated with preterm among Gabonese women; in contrast, infection was significantly associated with low birthweight [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Infection prevalence was similar in the 2 cohorts (9% vs 10.6% egg positive); however, differences in the association between schistosomiasis and birthweight may reflect distinct <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria prevalences (a risk factor for low birthweight [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), study designs, and diagnostic approaches. Prior studies of <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic> identified negative associations between being egg positive during pregnancy and birthweight [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the former study only recruited women with severe urogenital symptoms and the latter lacked adjustment for baseline case-control differences [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our study builds on insights from existing studies with a considerably larger cohort of women and more comprehensive adjustment for confounders and is among the first to assess the relationship between hematuria and birth outcomes.</p>
              <p>International guidelines recommend praziquantel treatment during pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which reduces schistosome-driven morbidity and mortality for women [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Over a quarter of the pregnant women we tested had urogenital schistosomiasis, supporting their inclusion in national MDA. However, we did not identify an association between schistosomiasis and child health outcomes. Our data suggest that praziquantel treatment during pregnancy may not have additive benefits on pregnancy outcomes and child growth, at least in regions such as rural Zimbabwe where maternal infections are predominantly low intensity and associated with trace-to-moderate hematuria and few urogenital symptoms. This is supported by randomized controlled trials of praziquantel treatment among pregnant women for <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and <italic>S. japonicum</italic> after the first trimester [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; infection clearance was effective and safe for women without a negative impact on their infants, but did not improve birth outcomes or birthweight relative to placebo [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Trials of praziquantel treatment earlier during pregnancy and in regions, such as Zimbabwe, predominantly affected by urogenital rather than intestinal schistosomiasis, could add to the existing body of evidence supporting treatment of schistosomiasis during pregnancy. Praziquantel treatment among cohorts of pregnant women with higher-intensity infections could plausibly have a greater impact on birth outcomes and child growth and/or alternative child health benefits to those that we assessed.</p>
              <p>The strengths of our study were its large cohort size, comprehensive multivariable risk factor analysis, case-control matching for adverse birth outcomes with adjustment for confounders, child growth follow-up, and 3 diagnostic definitions for infection. Limitations included a single baseline urine sample during early pregnancy, which may have reduced diagnostic sensitivity and missed infections in later pregnancy [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; potential interobserver microscopy differences between hubs; lack of maternal praziquantel treatment history and prepregnancy maternal weight, a predictor of adverse birth outcomes and stunting; no female genital schistosomiasis examination [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; and, although we present supplementary analyses of associations between infection intensity or hematuria severity, pregnancy outcomes and child growth using available data, these are underpowered.</p>
              <p>Adverse birth outcomes and child growth deficits are very common in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our data show conclusively that, at least for women with low-intensity infections, urogenital schistosomiasis status during pregnancy is not associated with these outcomes. Although our data do not argue against the health benefits of praziquantel treatment for pregnant women, they suggest that treating low-intensity urogenital schistosomiasis is unlikely to avert adverse birth outcomes, neonatal death, low birthweight, or child stunting.</p>
