                <sec>
                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Diet and the gut microbiome have a complex interaction that generates metabolites with an unclear effect on lethal prostate cancer risk. Identification of modifiable risk factors for lethal prostate cancer is challenging given the long natural history of this disease and difficulty of prospectively identifying lethal cancers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Mass spectrometry was performed on baseline serum samples collected from 173 lethal prostate cancer cases and 519 controls enrolled in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening trial. Baseline serum levels of choline, carnitine, betaine, Î³-butyrobetaine, crotonobetaine, phenylacetylglutamine, hippuric acid, and p-cresol sulfate were quantified and analyzed by quartile. Conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis associated analyte levels with lethal prostate cancer incidence after adjusting for body mass index and PSA. The Cochranâ€“Armitage test evaluated analyte level trends across quartiles.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Relative to those in the first quartile, cases with the highest baseline levels of choline (Q4 OR: 2.19; 95% CI, 1.23â€“3.90; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-trend: 0.005) and betaine (Q4 OR: 1.86; 95% CI, 1.05â€“3.30; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-trend: 0.11) exhibited increased odds of developing lethal prostate cancer. Higher baseline serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine (Q4 OR: 2.55; 95% CI, 1.40â€“4.64; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-trend: 0.003), a gut microbiome metabolite of phenylalanine with adrenergic activity, were also associated with lethal prostate cancer.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Baseline serum levels of one-carbon methyl donors and adrenergic compounds resulting from human and gut microbiotaâ€“mediated metabolism are associated with increased lethal prostate cancer risk.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Impact:</title>
                  <p>Dietary composition, circulating metabolite levels, and downstream signaling pathways may represent modifiable risk factors associated with incident lethal prostate cancer. Beta-adrenergic blockade represents an additional target for oncologic risk reduction.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Epidemiologic research has linked Western diets (rich in energy, red meat, high-fat dairy, and processed foods) with an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1, 2</xref>). This finding is exemplified by ecological studies demonstrating increased risk among immigrant populations that adopt Western dietary patterns following relocation (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3â€“5</xref>). Other large-scale studies have also demonstrated that egg, poultry, and red meat consumption enhances the risk of developing advanced or lethal prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6, 7</xref>). Notably, these animal products are enriched in choline, which has been independently associated with increased prostate cancer incidence and mortality (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>).</p>
              <p>The gut microbiome plays a critical role in generating compounds that circulate within their human hosts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; refs. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>). One such pathway centers on the generation of trimethylamine (TMA) via the gut-microbiota-mediated metabolism of betaine compounds (including Î³-butyrobetaine and crotonobetaine), choline, and carnitine. TMA is subsequently oxidized in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a physiologically active compound known to activate inflammatory pathways and alter cholesterol metabolism (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>). Higher serum levels of TMAO have been linked to colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14â€“17</xref>). Although higher levels of TMAO were associated with an aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis in the alpha-tocopherol beta-carotene (ATBC) cancer prevention trial, it is unknown how TMAO levels affect prostate cancer mortality (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>

              <p>Amino acid metabolites that result from a combination of host and gut microbiome metabolism have also been associated with human disease. For example, hippuric acid, p-cresol sulfate, and phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln) have each been linked with CVD (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19â€“21</xref>). Interestingly, PAGln was found to activate various Î±- and Î²-adrenergic receptors, providing a novel mechanism through which these metabolites exert their physiologic effects (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). These metabolites have not been studied clinically with regard to prostate cancer outcomes.</p>
              <p>Given that TMAO precursors have been associated with prostate cancer risk, we sought to investigate how alterations in the gut microbiotaâ€“dependent metabolism of choline, carnitine, and other TMA precursors affect lethal prostate cancer risk. We also aimed to study whether amino acid derivatives previously associated with CVD influence the risk of prostate cancer mortality. Therefore, we conducted a nested caseâ€“control study in which baseline levels of these nutrients and metabolites were measured in prediagnostic serum samples obtained through the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. We hypothesized that higher baseline levels of choline, carnitine, TMAO, and PAGln are associated with an increased risk of incident lethal prostate cancer.</p>

                <title>PLCO cohort</title>
                <p>The PLCO cancer screening trial was a large, population-based, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate effects of cancer screening in men and women between the ages of 55 and 74 (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Between November 1993 and July 2001, ten screening centers in the United States enrolled 76,685 men, who were randomized to an intervention arm or a control arm. Men in the intervention arm received screening for prostate cancer via PSA and digital rectal exam for the first six years of the trial and were followed for at least seven years thereafter. Trial data were collected through December 2009 and included baseline blood sample collection (prior to cancer diagnosis), demographic information, and screening results. The primary endpoint of this trial was cancer-specific mortality, though multiple secondary endpoints related to cancer screening and morbidity were examined. Through 2015, data were collected on participant deaths via administration of the Annual Study Update questionnaire, by physician or family report, or by performing National Death Index Plus searches. A Death Review Process was subsequently performed to evaluate participant deaths and determine if a PLCO cancer was responsible (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>

                <title>Nested caseâ€“control study design</title>
                <p>We used a nested caseâ€“control design. Baseline serum specimens from 173 lethal prostate cancer cases and 519 controls without lethal prostate cancer were analyzed. Samples were collected from men assigned to the intervention arm of the PLCO trial not previously diagnosed with prostate cancer. The 173 cases represent all prostate cancer deaths in the intervention arm for which prediagnostic samples were available. The controls include men never diagnosed with prostate cancer and those diagnosed with prostate cancer who did not expire within the observation period of the trial. Metastatic events were not considered to be lethal events, unless the patient was determined to have died from a prostate cancerâ€“specific cause during the observation period of the study. Cases and controls were defined in this fashion to identify risk factors that predispose patients to aggressive prostate cancer that may require earlier and more definitive intervention.</p>
                <p>At the time of death, cases were matched at a 1:3 ratio with randomly selected controls in the corresponding risk set on the basis of race, age (within 2 years), time of baseline blood draw (within 6 months), and enrollment date (within 1 year). This study was designed to identify potential drivers of lethal disease, hence the focus on lethal prostate cancer using strict risk-set sampling.</p>
                <p>Serum levels of choline, carnitine, betaine, Î³-butyrobetaine, crotonobetaine, TMAO, PAGln, hippuric acid, and p-cresol sulfate levels were quantified from a single baseline measurement of analyte levels from apparently healthy subjects who were then prospectively followed for incident development of prostate cancer. Study approval was obtained from the NCI and Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board following a competitive application and peer review process.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The impact of diet, the gut microbiome, and host metabolism on human disease has become increasingly evident (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this nested caseâ€“control study, we show that men with higher levels of choline, betaine, or PAGln have approximately double the odds (relative to Q1) of being later diagnosed with incident lethal prostate cancer. Although previous studies have associated choline, TMAO, or both with oncologic risk, this study is the first to associate an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer with metabolites with gut microbiomeâ€“related metabolites (e.g., PAGln) and their precursors (e.g., choline and betaine; refs. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 15, 18</xref>). Interestingly, our study differed from the results of the ATBC cancer prevention trial, which associated higher levels of TMAO with a diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>The significant association of high serum concentrations of PAGln with lethal prostate cancer is intriguing. PAGln is a gut microbiotaâ€“dependent metabolite of dietary phenylalanine, an amino acid consumed via dietary protein (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Phenylalanine is released by digestive proteases and may be converted to PAGln by anaerobic microorganisms in the large intestine (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Nemet and colleagues used both genetic and pharmacologic studies to demonstrate that this gut microbiotaâ€“derived metabolite signals in hosts through multiple adrenergic receptors (Î±2A, Î±2B, and Î²2 adrenergic receptors) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In both cellular systems and animal models, numerous cardiovascular-associated effects promoted by PAGln were shown to be attenuated by beta blockers. It is therefore highly relevant that sympathetic signaling, specifically through the Î²2 adrenergic receptor, has been shown to increase prostate cancer aggressiveness by dysregulating apoptosis, enhancing cell migration, augmenting metastatic potential, and accelerating the epithelialâ€“mesenchymal transition observed in some tumors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis examining 16,825 patients associated beta-blocker use with lower prostate cancerâ€“specific mortality (HR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77â€“0.95; ref. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that inhibition of PAGln-driven sympathetic signaling among subjects with higher PAGln levels may account for this interesting clinical observation. Additional investigation is necessary to understand how PAGln elevations modulate lethal prostate cancer risk and whether beta-blocker therapy attenuates PAGln-driven adrenergic hyperstimulation.</p>
              <p>One of the more striking findings of the present study is that baseline levels of choline and betaine predicted heightened incident risk of lethal prostate cancer, suggesting that this elevation in oncologic risk is independent of gut microbiomeâ€“related metabolism. A prior report associated increased choline intake with greater lethal prostate cancer risk, whereas a previous nested caseâ€“control study linked higher levels of serum choline with increased odds of any (lethal or nonlethal) prostate cancer diagnosis (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>). Choline may be implicated in oncogenesis given that it serves as a structural component of various phospholipids, making this nutrient essential for maintenance of the cell membrane and cancer growth (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Specifically, phosphatidylcholine may be metabolized to signaling molecules, including phosphocholine and diacylglycerol, that transduce mitogenic commands for cell growth (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Choline metabolism has also been observed to be dysregulated in prostate cancer, particularly when choline kinase, an enzyme that facilitates the rate-limiting step in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, is overexpressed (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These alterations in choline metabolism are particularly relevant, given the clinical utility of using <sup>11</sup>C-choline and <sup>18</sup>F-choline PET imaging to restage prostate cancer with heightened malignant potential (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p>
              <p>Serum elevations in the choline oxidation product, betaine, were also associated with lethal prostate cancer. Betaine serves as a methyl donor in pathways that yield <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>-adenosylmethionine, a substrate that mediates DNA and histone methylation (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Though our study is the first to positively associate elevated baseline betaine levels with incident lethal prostate cancer, other research evaluating dietary intake concluded that greater betaine consumption offers protection from lethal prostate cancer (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Interestingly, meta-organismal (involving both bacteria and host) betaine and choline metabolism has been shown to alter global DNA methylation patterns, induce epigenetic changes, and even influence behavior in offspring in rodent models (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Though it is presently unknown whether betaine and choline metabolism induces oncogenic changes in host prostate tissue that result in lethal prostate cancer development, this possibility should be considered. Further investigation is necessary to assess how choline, betaine, and other one-carbon methyl donors affect gene regulation in lethal prostate cancer carcinogenesis.</p>
              <p>The discovery that choline, betaine, and PAGln are independently associated with increased risk of lethal prostate cancer has potential implications for prostate cancer risk modification and screening. If confirmed in independent clinical studies, men with elevated levels of these analytes may consider dietary or pharmacologic risk reduction strategies that modulate meta-organismal choline, betaine, or phenylalanine metabolism. It would also follow that prospective studies might investigate whether assessment of choline, betaine, and PAGln levels help identify patients for whom earlier initiation of PSA screening might be warranted. A large portion of patients with lethal prostate cancer in this study had GS 7 disease, suggesting levels of these analytes could be considered when weighing eligibility for active surveillance in intermediate-risk patients.</p>
              <p>This study had several limitations. As an association-based clinical study, this work cannot demonstrate a causal connection between analytes and lethal prostate cancer risk. Additionally, these findings should be considered to be hypothesis-generating until they can be validated by an additional set of baseline serum samples prospectively collected from patients followed closely for the development of lethal prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Biorepository Network and NCI Early Detection Research Network could potentially be accessed for validation purposes. Our reliance on a single baseline measurement of targeted nutrients and metabolites could be considered another weakness, given that dietary patterns, lifestyle, and composition of the gut microbiome may not remain static over time. However, similarly designed studies have also associated prediagnostic levels of TMA pathway metabolites with overtly recognizable diseases such as colorectal cancer and CVD (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14, 17</xref>). Evaluating baseline blood levels of metabolites before incident development of lethal prostate cancer was a strength, as was the nested caseâ€“control design that permitted robust control of time-dependent exposures through strict risk-set sampling.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>Baseline serum elevations in choline and betaine are associated with incident lethal prostate cancer independent of other nutrients and metabolites in the TMAO pathway when adjusted for PSA and BMI. This association was also shown with higher circulating levels PAGln, a phenylalanine metabolite resulting from gut microbiota metabolism that signals via adrenergic receptors. These findings collectively suggest that diet and the meta-organismal metabolism of choline, betaine, and phenylalanine warrant further study in relation to lethal prostate cancer development.</p>
