                <p id="Par1">Contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies have been shown to be an effective binocular treatment for amblyopia in the laboratory. Yet, at-home therapy is a more practical approach. In a randomized clinical trial, we compared dichoptic movies, streamed at-home on a handheld 3D-enabled game console, versus patching as amblyopia treatment. Sixty-five amblyopic children (3–7 years; 20/32–125) were randomly assigned to one of two parallel arms, binocular treatment (3 movies/week) or patching (14 h/week). The primary outcome, change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the 2-week visit was completed by 28 and 30, respectively. After the primary outcome, both groups of children had the option to complete up to 6 weeks of binocular treatment. At the 2-week primary outcome visit, BCVA had improved in the movie (0.07 ± 0.02 logMAR; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and patching (0.06 ± 0.01 logMAR; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) groups. There was no significant difference between groups (CI<sub>95</sub>%: − 0.02 to 0.04; <italic>p</italic> = .48). Visual acuity improved in both groups with binocular treatment up to 6 weeks (0.15 and 0.18 logMAR improvement, respectively). This novel, at-home, binocular movie treatment improved amblyopic eye BCVA after 2 weeks (similar to patching), with additional improvement up to 6 weeks. Repeated binocular visual experience with contrast-rebalanced binocular movies provides an additional treatment option for amblyopia.</p>

            <p id="Par3">In prospective single-arm studies, contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies have been used as an effective treatment for children aged 4 to 12 years with amblyopia. With as little as 9 h of viewing time, mean improvement of visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes was 1.5 to 2.0 lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. While these laboratory studies provided proof-of-principle data for the treatment approach, at-home treatment is a more practical alternative. More recently, both a single arm study and a randomized clinical trial allowed children to view cloud-based movie content at home using a head-mounted display (a commercially available smartphone in a virtual reality headset) with reduced fellow eye contrast, reporting a mean visual acuity improvement of 1.5 − 1.8 lines within 12 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, head-mounted displays are difficult to use by preschool children because of their size and weight, as well as the visual isolation imposed during wear. Additionally, while there is an objective log time during which movies were streamed, the headset makes it impossible for a parent to periodically check whether the child has their eyes open while the movies are playing.</p>
            <p id="Par4">There is evidence that younger children (≤ 7 years) are more responsive to amblyopia treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, including treatment with contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Here, we explored an alternative approach to at-home amblyopia treatment in younger children with contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies. In a randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of viewing cloud-based contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies on a handheld device in children aged 3 to 7 years compared with standard-of-care patching treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>

                <p id="Par6">Children aged 3 to 7 years who were diagnosed by pediatric eye specialists as having amblyopia due to strabismus, anisometropia, or both (combined mechanism) were eligible. Inclusion criteria were: (1) amblyopic eye visual acuity of 0.2 to 0.8 logMAR; (2) fellow eye visual acuity of − 0.1 to 0.2 logMAR; (3) interocular visual acuity difference of ≥ 0.2 logMAR; (4) anisometropia or corrected strabismus (&lt; 5pd); (5) wearing glasses for at least 8 weeks with no change in <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">visual acuity</xref> over two visits; and (6) must be able to see the full movie screen (both amblyopic and fellow eye components) with fellow eye contrast set to 20%. Exclusion criteria were: (1) prematurity of 8 weeks or more; (2) coexisting ocular or systemic disease; (3) developmental delay; and (4) significant ocular misalignment (≥ 5 pd). Diagnoses, alignment, prior treatment, and visual acuity for visits prior to enrollment were extracted from the referring doctor’s medical records.</p>

                <p id="Par7">This study was a randomized clinical trial (parallel group design). At the baseline visit, eligibility was ascertained and vision assessments were conducted. Children were randomly assigned to watch contrast-rebalanced dichoptic animated movies (experimental treatment) or to patch the fellow eye 2 h/day every day (standard-of-care amblyopia treatment) for 2 weeks. The 2-week time point was chosen for the primary outcome based on our pilot studies of contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and our randomized treatment trial of contrast-rebalanced dichoptic games<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Randomization was performed through the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.org">www.randomization.org</ext-link> with a coded distribution of a 1:1 ratio, with blocks of 12 allocations. Investigators had access to the randomization assignment, which was sealed in a numbered envelope, only after the child was enrolled. At the 2-week primary outcome visit, children in the patching group crossed over to the dichoptic animated movie group and all participants were asked to return for a secondary outcome visit vision assessment at 4 weeks. Families had the option to continue with the dichoptic movies for a total of 6 weeks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All children returned for a secondary outcome visit at 4 weeks. After that, children in the dichoptic movie group had the option to continue an additional 2 weeks and children who were initially in the patching group had the option to continue with movies for an additional 4 weeks (up to 6 weeks of movies for both groups). Children who continued had follow-up visits with vision assessments every 2 weeks (14 ± 3 days).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2022_8010_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par8">Eighteen popular animated feature films were modified using custom MATLAB software to allow dichoptic presentation on a New Nintendo 3DS XL platform (Nintendo Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), which was loaned to the child for the duration of the study so that movies could be watched at home. This Nintendo device allowed for dichoptic viewing without the need for anaglyphic, polarized, or shutter glasses or a VR headset. The movies had the same design as in our recent prospective study of contrast-rebalanced movies in which children came into the laboratory to watch movies on a passive 3D display<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Briefly, odd lines in the Nintendo 3D display were visible to one eye, and even lines were visible to the other eye. A patterned image mask composed of irregularly shaped blobs was multiplied with the images seen by the amblyopic eye, and the inverse patterned mask was multiplied with the images seen by the fellow eye, so that different parts of the display were seen by each eye. Blobs of the movie seen by the amblyopic eye always had high contrast (100%), whereas the complementary blobs seen by the fellow eye had reduced contrast. Because the blobs had Gaussian edges, the edges of the blobs overlapped and were seen by both eyes with differing contrasts, preventing any significant rivalry. The shape and location of the blobs were varied dynamically every 10 s. Fellow eye contrast started at 20% for the first movie and incremented by 10% for each subsequent movie (i.e., 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 29%, …). Movies were uploaded to our Amazon Web Services (AWS; Seattle, WA, USA) streaming service in two-week packets, each containing 6 movies that preserved the order of fellow eye contrasts from low to high.</p>

During their visit, we provided a link on their loaned Nintendo for the set of 6 movies that should be watched during the next two weeks. Movie names were numbered on the Nintendo device, in order by fellow eye contrast, and the family was instructed that the movies should be viewed in that order at home with the date recorded on a paper log sheet. The log sheet had pictures of the title frames from each of the 6 movies with a space next to each for the parent to write in the date it was watched. Fellow eye contrast of movies 1–6 incremented from 20 to 32% during the first 2 weeks, movies 7–12 incremented from 35 to 57% during weeks 3 and 4 and, finally, movies 13–18 incremented from 63 to 100% if children participated in the optional weeks 5 and 6. Children assigned to the patching arm were supplied with patches and asked to patch two hours per day for two weeks. At the 2-week visit, children were loaned a Nintendo and began watching movies, starting with 20% fellow eye contrast for the next two weeks, and had the option of completing up to 6 weeks of movies.</p>

              <p id="Par21">Both the contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movie and patching groups had clinically significant improvement in amblyopic eye BCVA at the 2-week primary outcome visit, with a similar amount of improvement in each group. In these young children, contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies are as effective as patching. Therefore, dichoptic movies could offer a break from patching without stalling progress or risking recurrence, and thus provide a second option for children who are or have become noncompliant with patching. The mean BCVA improvement at the 2-week visit was modest at 0.07 logMAR, but continued visual acuity improvement was observed with use of contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies for 6 weeks, for a mean improvement of 0.15 − 0.18 logMAR. After 6 weeks of viewing contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies at home, 29% of children in the dichoptic movie group had ≤ 0.1 logMAR (≤ 1 line) interocular difference in <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">visual acuity</xref> (recovered). These results are similar to those reported in a recent randomized trial of 4- to 7-year-old using a head-mounted display to view dichoptic movie content at-home as a treatment for amblyopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Additionally, a modest improvement in stereoacuity was observed in the dichoptic movie group at the primary outcome and 4-week visit. Reports of stereoacuity improvements with other dichoptic therapies for amblyopia in children are variable, with some reporting improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and others reporting no change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

This could reflect better adherence to binocular treatment in the setting of a randomized clinical trial than adherence to patching prior to enrollment or, alternatively, may result from individual differences in treatment efficacy of binocular versus patching treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Less BCVA improvement was seen with this at-home contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movie treatment than we previously reported for supervised use of the same movies in-lab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This may have been a consequence of broader inclusion criterion, which included children with baseline amblyopic eye visual acuity of 0.2 logMAR. Including milder amblyopia in the at-home study may have allowed less room for visual acuity improvement than in the in-lab study. The at-home study also included a much smaller proportion of children with baseline amblyopic eye visual acuity of &gt; 0.7 logMAR than the in-lab study (12% vs 30%), further limiting the maximum amount of improvement that could be observed. Other factors that may have contributed to differences between the two studies include attention to the movies in-lab compared to at-home and the better quality of the larger passive LG Electronics (Englewood, NJ, USA) monitor used in-lab compared to the image of the handheld Nintendo device used for at-home viewing.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Because children had stable baseline BCVA for the 1-month period prior to enrollment and randomization even though most were patching, it was surprising to observe BCVA improvement in the group randomized to patching at the primary outcome visit. It is possible that patching adherence was poor just prior to enrollment and may have improved as a result of participation in a randomized clinical trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Without objective compliance data, it is not possible to attribute the response to patching solely to an improvement in treatment adherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Potential advantages of the contrast re-balanced dichoptic movies used here are at-home therapy, movie content appropriate for 3- to 7-year-old children, requirement for only 4.5 h per week of treatment time, no need for a headset or polarizing glasses, and excellent adherence. Potential disadvantages are increased screen time relative to patching, need for a passive 3D screen and access to wi-fi, and the requirement to focus solely on the movie (patching can be accomplished while the child is engaged in other activities).</p>
              <p id="Par26">Strengths of the study include randomization, spectacle adaptation period of ≥ 8 weeks prior to enrollment, no requirement for polarizing glasses or a headset to view dichoptic movies, and engaging movies that supported excellent adherence. In addition, while contrast re-balanced games have been shown to be effective as an amblyopia treatment for children aged 4 years and older<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, the games are somewhat complex and can be challenging for children aged &lt; 6 years. Dichoptic movies and videos, then, may provide an advantage over games in ease of use for the youngest children who may benefit from early treatment of amblyopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Use of a 3D display to separate images for each eye, rather than a head-mounted VR headset, may provide advantages for young children who find the headsets uncomfortable due to their size and weight size and weight, and may dislike the visual isolation imposed during wear. Additionally, headset wear makes it impossible for parents to watch the movie with their child or even check whether their child has their eyes open while the movies are playing.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Limitations of the study include the short duration of randomly assigned treatment (2 weeks), followed by a crossover. Nonetheless, groups had continuing gains in BCVA throughout their 6–8 weeks in the study and the gains in BCVA were comparable to those reported for young children in randomized clinical trials of patching and binocular games that included a spectacle adaptation period of ≥ 8 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Another limitation of the study is the use of three different visual acuity tests. While most participants were tested using the ATS-HOTV protocol, 7 of the youngest participants were tested with Allen pictures, which may overestimate visual acuity compared to letter optotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and 16 of the oldest participants were tested with the E-ETDRS protocol, which may have a slight bias toward worse performance of amblyopic eyes than ATS-HOTV in children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Regardless, the same visual acuity test was repeated at each child’s visit, allowing determination of changes in BCVA relative to baseline. A limitation of presenting contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies on a handheld device is that any particular hardware may become obsolete in a few years. Nonetheless, there are many potential devices for presenting dichoptic movies. For this study we chose to use an inexpensive device familiar to children, the New Nintendo 3DS XL, but the same approach could be easily transferred to other hardware platforms. Another limitation is the lack of objective monitoring of adherence for both patching and the movie treatment, instead, relying on parental written logs in this study. This limitation is typical of randomized clinical trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed treatments rather than their efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Overall, this novel, at-home, binocular movie treatment was effective in improving amblyopic eye BCVA, with additional improvements observed with up to 6 weeks of treatment. Repeated binocular visual experience with contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies provides an additional treatment option for amblyopia.</p>
