              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There are no currently available effective Food and Drug Administrationâapproved oral treatments for COVID-19. Although novel therapeutics are being developed, repurposing known safe and accessible medications with promise for COVID-19 could facilitate more rapid introduction into clinical practice. Niclosamide, an anthelmintic discovered in 1958,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> works by blocking sugar uptake by the parasitic worm. It is on the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicines List, which includes the safest and most effective medicines needed in health systems. The wholesale cost of this drug is approximately $0.24 USD for a course of treatment.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Shortly after the SARS outbreak in China, niclosamide was found to inhibit SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV, in vitro<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and in vivo.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> More recently, niclosamide was shown to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, the strain responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating 40-fold increased potency compared with remdesivir in vitro.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There are several proposed antiviral mechanisms of action of niclosamide against COVID-19. Niclosamide has been reported to neutralize endolysosomal pH, preventing cell entry of pH-dependent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Niclosamide also has been suggested to inhibit RNA viruses at a postentry stage, during viral RNA replication.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> More recently, niclosamide was shown to prevent viral replication via the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinâmediated cell fusion.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition to its anthelmintic and antiviral properties, niclosamide has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and promise for respiratory illness,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> including bronchodilator activity in a mouse model of asthma.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Niclosamide has been repurposed for use in multiple clinical trials for cancer therapy<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and is tolerated in patients who have cancer and are immunocompromised.</p>
              <p>Although absorbed systemically, niclosamide is concentrated in the gastrointestinal tract. Nearly 30% of patients with COVID-19 present gastrointestinal symptoms alone,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> highlighting the potential importance of the intestine in SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. In a 2020 study<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> evaluating clinical samples from 74 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, there were 39 individuals with stool samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Fecal viral shedding continued as long as 5 weeks after the last detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory samples, suggesting that the gastrointestinal tract may serve as a viral reservoir and allow for prolonged COVID-19 infection and potentially transmission.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Prevention of COVID-19 by vaccines is crucial, but active, as well as passive immunity are limited by the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Given the reported antiviral mechanism of action of niclosamide against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> we hypothesized that niclosamide would prevent viral replication in the clinically relevant outcome of viral shedding from respiratory and intestinal routes and that this decrease in viral burden could attenuate symptomatic COVID-19. We conducted a phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the effects of niclosamide on viral clearance and duration of symptoms among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.</p>

                <p>The trial was powered for the primary end point. We estimated that including 40 participants in each group would achieve 89% power, with a 2-sided Î± level of .05, to detect a between-group difference in oropharyngeal viral clearance at day 3 of 35%, assuming that 15% of participants in the placebo group and 50% of participants in the niclosamide group would have cleared on day 3. We defined viral clearance as the first day a participantâs sample result was negative, provided that no subsequent sample results were positive. We estimated the cumulative probability of clearance in randomization groups using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The restricted mean time to clearance was defined as the area under the viral clearanceâfree survival curve. This takes censored observations into account and is not based only on participants who achieved clearance.</p>
                <p>For the primary end point of oropharyngeal viral clearance and the secondary end point of fecal viral clearance, we compared clearance probabilities at day 3 and day 14 between groups using Ï<sup>2</sup> tests based on the log of âlog transformation for the survival function.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> We also compared restricted mean times to viral clearance up to day 14 for oropharyngeal viral clearance and day 21 for fecal viral clearance.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
                <p>We evaluated time to symptom resolution for participants who reported at least 1 ongoing or new symptom at day 1. Symptom resolution was defined as the first day that all symptoms reported at day 1 had resolved. We compared restricted mean survival times to symptom resolution up to day 30.</p>
                <p>In prespecified subgroup analyses, we compared viral clearance and time to symptom resolution between niclosamide and placebo groups among participants with body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) scores in the reference range (ie, BMIâ&lt;â25) and overweight scores (ie, BMIââ¥â25). In post-hoc subgroup analyses, we compared viral clearance and time to symptom resolution between niclosamide and placebo groups among participants with and without fecal shedding. All participants had a positive PCR test by oropharyngeal sample as part of the inclusion criteria. We defined individuals with double shedding as participants who also had at least 1 positive fecal sample at any time during the trial.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trialâs primary end point, 66.7% of participants in the niclosamide group had oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 clearance at day 3 vs 55.9% of participants in the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>â=â.37). That this end point was not significantly different between groups may be explained by the large percentage of participants with relatively low viral loads who cleared virus from respiratory tissues by day 3, regardless of treatment group.</p>
              <p>Tests for SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal and fecal samples showed that the virus persists longer in the feces, as previously reported.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In post-hoc analysis, we identified a subset of 29 of 65 participants who shed SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal and fecal samples, designated as having double shedding. At baseline, individuals with fecal shedding had increased viral loads compared with participants without fecal shedding, designated as having single shedding. Individuals with fecal shedding took longer to achieve oropharyngeal clearance than those without fecal shedding. Increased viral load has been associated with increased level of disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It is plausible that participants with fecal shedding had increased overall viral loads, which may be related to their increased disease severity compared with individuals without fecal shedding. Niclosamide had a minimal effect among patients without fecal shedding, who cleared SARS-CoV-2 relatively quickly. There was a decreased time to oropharyngeal clearance among patients with fecal shedding and a shorter time to resolution of symptoms with niclosamide compared with placebo overall (12.01 days vs 14.61 days), with a greater difference among patients with fecal shedding (10.54 days vs 15.41 days); however, these differences were not statistically significant. The niclosamide-associated decrease in symptoms was related to oropharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 among patients with ENT or respiratory symptoms. There was no difference between treatment groups in non-ENT, nonrespiratory symptoms, such as those affecting the central nervous system, those affecting musculoskeletal tissues, or general fever or chills. This may suggest that niclosamide primarily exerts an effect via viral clearance from the respiratory tract, which deserves further investigation.</p>
              <p>Our study enrolled outpatients who did not require hospitalization (1 participant, who was in the placebo group, progressed to severe disease). However, some participants were at increased risk for severe COVID-19, including those with BMI at 25 or more.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the niclosamide group, these individualsâ symptoms resolved in a mean time of 11.57 (95% CI, 6.92 to 16.23) days vs 16.46 (95% CI, 10.94 to 21.98) days in the placebo group, which was not a statistically significant difference.</p>
              <p>A goal of this study was to understand the potential effects of niclosamide on fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. Oropharyngeal tissues and the intestine are established reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2. Examining viral loads from both sites may help to better estimate total viral burden, compared with standard oropharyngeal assessment alone. Across all participants in our study, the mean time to fecal SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 6.12 (95% CI, 3.51 to 8.73) days in the niclosamide group and 5.77 (95% CI, 3.3 to 8.23) days in the placebo group. Among patients with fecal shedding, mean time to fecal viral clearance in the niclosamide group was 13.21 (95% CI, 9.75 to 16.68) days vs 11.70 (95% CI, 8.47 to 14.93) days in the placebo group. These differences were not statistically significant. The principal mode by which people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is through exposure to respiratory secretions carrying infectious virus, which can occur via inhalation or deposition of respiratory droplets on mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eye.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The fecal-oral route has been postulated as well,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> but the retention of infectivity by fecally shed virus has been debated.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Previous studies have found large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in fecal samples from patients with COVID-19, potentially related to virus material produced in the airways being swallowed.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal tract has also been reported.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Our study used PCR-based analysis of cycle threshold values, often cited as the criterion standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 since the methodâs authorization in February 2020<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>; however, viral plaque-forming assays would be a more direct measurement of infectious virions.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>Future studies could be conducted to investigate if this fecal shedding is directly reflective of transmissibility or suggestive of oropharyngeal clearing of SARS-CoV-2 via the swallowing of virus-containing secretions and ultimate excretion in fecal samples, given that has been reported with similar respiratory viruses.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study has several limitations. There was a precipitous and persistent decrease in the rate of COVID-19 diagnoses in spring and summer 2021 that decreased our enrollment pool. Additionally, as vaccination rates rose, our predetermined exclusion criteria of individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 limited those available for enrollment. An additional limitation of this study is the underenrollment of African American and Hispanic participants, given that these populations may be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Another limitation is that because this study was conducted remotely, drug blood levels were not available. We used the maximum conventional dose of niclosamide prescribed for dwarf worm infestation.<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Although the concentration required to achieve antiviral activity based on previous niclosamide studies<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> is approximately 0.5 Î¼M, which corresponds to 0.164 Î¼g/mL, we do not know if participants achieved sufficient systemic drug concentration in our study. In a 2018 clinical trial to test efficacy of niclosamide as an antimetastatic therapy,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi211243r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> clinicians found that upon oral intake, niclosamide Cmax plasma level peaked at a median (range) of 0.665 (0.429-0.848) Î¼g/ml, suggesting that oral administration should be sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 production. Efficacy of niclosamide may be further enhanced by direct delivery through the respiratory tract as an inhaled medication. Given that niclosamide is historically well-tolerated, using the standard dosing regimen for parasitic treatment applications, future drug escalation studies should be considered to maximize antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
                <p>Additionally, we cannot extrapolate our findings to patients with severe COVID-19. Although vaccines are still the first line of defense against COVID-19 given that they prevent progression to severe COVID-19 disease and death,<sup><xref rid="zoi211243r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> niclosamide may warrant further investigation in a wider range of patients.</p>
