                <p id="Par1"><italic>BRAFV600E</italic> alterations are prevalent across multiple tumors. Here we present final efficacy and safety results of a phase 2 basket trial of dabrafenib (BRAF kinase inhibitor) plus trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in eight cohorts of patients with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-mutated advanced rare cancers: anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (<italic>n</italic> = 36), biliary tract cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 43), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (<italic>n</italic> = 1), adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (<italic>n</italic> = 3), low-grade glioma (<italic>n</italic> = 13), high-grade glioma (<italic>n</italic> = 45), hairy cell leukemia (<italic>n</italic> = 55) and multiple myeloma (<italic>n</italic> = 19). The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed overall response rate in these cohorts was 56%, 53%, 0%, 67%, 54%, 33%, 89% and 50%, respectively. Secondary endpoints were median duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Median DoR was 14.4 months, 8.9 months, not reached, 7.7 months, not reached, 31.2 months, not reached and 11.1 months, respectively. Median PFS was 6.7 months, 9.0 months, not reached, not evaluable, 9.5 months, 5.5 months, not evaluable and 6.3 months, respectively. Median OS was 14.5 months, 13.5 months, not reached, 21.8 months, not evaluable, 17.6 months, not evaluable and 33.9 months, respectively. The most frequent (≥20% of patients) treatment-related adverse events were pyrexia (40.8%), fatigue (25.7%), chills (25.7%), nausea (23.8%) and rash (20.4%). The encouraging tumor-agnostic activity of dabrafenib plus trametinib suggests that this could be a promising treatment approach for some patients with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-mutated advanced rare cancers.

              <p id="Par3">The <italic>RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK</italic> pathway (also called the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway) is important in cancer biology. The role of this pathway has been described in cellular proliferation, migration, survival, angiogenesis and cell cycle regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Alterations in B-Raf proto-oncogene (<italic>BRAF</italic>), a serine/threonine kinase, can constitutively activate the pathway, and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations are seen in various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The most common <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation is the <italic>V600E</italic> mutation with substitution of valine (V) to glutamic acid (E) at position 600 of the amino acid sequence caused by transversion T → A at nucleotide 1799 (T1799A).</p>
              <p id="Par4"><italic>BRAF</italic> mutations are detected in ~7–15% of all cancers, and the most common locus of the mutation is at position V600. The mutation is seen in diverse cancers, including hairy cell leukemia (HCL, 79–100%), melanomas (40–70%), papillary thyroid cancers (45%), ovarian cancers (35%), cholangiocarcinomas (5–7%), multiple myeloma (MM, 4%) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs, 1–3%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. <italic>BRAFV600</italic> mutations are also seen in rare and very rare cancers, such as gliomas, sarcomas, gastric and esophageal cancer, neuroendocrine cancer and ampullary cancer, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Genome-driven treatment options/agnostic treatments are evolving in oncology with advances in tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, rearranged during transfection receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and the treatment of tumors with high microsatellite instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or tumor mutation burden (TMB &gt; 10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Dabrafenib selectively inhibits the mutated <italic>BRAF</italic> kinase, and trametinib shows a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibition of <italic>MEK</italic>1 and <italic>MEK</italic>2 activation and kinase activity. The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib blocks oncogenic MAPK pathway signaling, inhibits growth and survival of <italic>BRAFV600</italic>-mutant cells and enhances anti-tumor activity versus either agent alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. This combination therapy is approved for use in the so-called <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> anchor tumor types, namely metastatic melanoma, melanoma in adjuvant setting, NSCLC and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, beyond these cancers, as <italic>BRAFV600</italic> mutations are prevalent in a long list of tumor types (&gt;40 tumor types)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, there continued to be an unmet need for treatment of rare cancers in adults and children with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations where limited or no effective treatment options existed. These tumors lead to substantial burden and mortality in the relapsed or refractory settings.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an accelerated approval to dabrafenib (Tafinlar) plus trametinib (Mekinist) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with a <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutation. The combination was approved for patients aged 6 years and older in whom the tumors progressed after prior treatment and who had no alternative treatment options. This approval was supported by the meaningful efficacy and safety for the combination in the Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) and National Cancer Institute-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02465060">NCT02465060</ext-link>) studies in adults and a study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02124772">NCT02124772</ext-link>) in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors. This was the first approval for a tumor-agnostic <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>MEK</italic> inhibitor combination approach and was a considerable advance in precision medicine.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The ROAR study was designed to assess the activity and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-mutated rare cancers. Based on the discretion of the treating physician and according to the local available standards of care, these cancers did not have any satisfactory treatment options. Rare cancer types included in the study were ATC, biliary tract cancer (BTC), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), adenocarcinoma of the small intestine (ASI), low-grade (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 or grade 2) glioma (LGG), high-grade (WHO grade 3 or grade 4) glioma (HGG), non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs)/non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs), HCL and MM. We previously published interim results for the ATC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, BTC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, LGG and HGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and HCL cohorts (data cutoff dates: 26 August 2016 to 25 July 2018)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Here we report the final results of the ROAR study for all cancer cohorts that were part of the study (data cutoff date: 10 December 2021). We also discuss multiple non-melanoma cancer studies showing evidence of the actionability of <italic>BRAF</italic> beyond anchor type cancers.</p>

              <p id="Par9">Patients received oral dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and oral trametinib (2 mg once daily) on a continuous dosing schedule until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or death. Across all cohorts, the median duration of exposure to dabrafenib and trametinib was 12.5 months (range, 1–82 months) and 12.0 months (range, 1–84 months), respectively. Two-thirds of the patients received dabrafenib (66%) and trametinib (65%) for more than 6 months. The median daily dose of dabrafenib and trametinib was 282.1 mg (range, 16.9–315.5 mg) and 1.9 mg (range, 0.6–2 mg), respectively (a daily dose of 450 mg dabrafenib was administered in eight patients). A total of 111 patients (54%) died; 31% withdrew from the study due to the sponsor’s decision to terminate the study; and 13% withdrew consent. The most common reason for study treatment discontinuation was progressive disease (dabrafenib: 60%; trametinib: 59%) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

              <p id="Par10">The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) (see the section of study endpoints in <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). As a supportive analysis defined in the study protocol, ORR was also assessed centrally by independent radiology review for the ATC, BTC, ASI, LGG and HGG cohorts. This helped to corroborate the results for ORR by investigator assessment. Concordance rates were determined for the best response by the investigator-assessed rates and those determined by independent radiology assessment. The ORR was ≥50% across all cohorts except the HGG cohort (ORR &gt; 30%).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par22">To our knowledge, ROAR is the first prospective study of a combination treatment approach with <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>MEK</italic> inhibitors in patients with advanced rare cancers harboring the <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutation. The ROAR study demonstrated pan-cancer activity of the <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>MEK</italic> inhibitor combination in 21 histologies. We adopted a basket design for this study where tumors expressing the same driver mutation (that is, <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>) were grouped and treated as a single disease entity. A similar multi-cohort basket design was used in the VE-BASKET study that evaluated the efficacy of vemurafenib monotherapy in patients (<italic>n</italic> = 172) with any <italic>BRAFV600</italic> mutation-positive cancers (26 unique cancer types) other than melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer and HCL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. After the initiation of the ROAR study, the NCI initiated the MATCH study in which dabrafenib plus trametinib was tested in various <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-mutated solid and hematological malignancies.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The ROAR study included patients with advanced disease, and all patients had received pre-treatment with standard-of-care therapies. This reduced the risk of observing an inflated ORR. In this study, we deployed an adaptive design for ORR with a Bayesian hierarchical model to increase the power to identify clinically meaningful outcomes. This helped to identify cohorts that could be further expanded and allowed for multiple interim data evaluations to determine if a histologic cohort should discontinue enrollment early due to success or futility. The ATC, BTC, HGG and HCL cohorts were stopped early for efficacy, and an expansion cohort was opened for each of these cohorts. None of the cohorts was stopped early due to futility. Additional strengths of the study design included the analysis of ORR with standard frequentist estimates for each of the cohorts and an independent radiology review for solid tumor cohorts.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In line with available evidence in earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib in this study showed clinically meaningful outcomes in a diverse set of rare cancers with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations and had a manageable safety profile. There was consistency in ORR by an independent radiology review and in the investigator-assessed responses in the solid tumor cohorts.</p>
              <p id="Par25">The ROAR study supports a tumor-agnostic approach to <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> inhibition due to the inclusion of diverse cancer cohorts including hematological malignancies. The results of this study formed the basis of the FDA approval of dabrafenib plus trametinib for unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations. This emphasizes the utility of targeting tumor genomics in clinical practice for the treatment of rare cancers.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The results of the ROAR study further corroborate those of subprotocol H (EAY131-H) of the NCI-MATCH platform trial, which included 35 patients (primary efficacy analysis in 29 patients) with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-positive cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and central nervous system (CNS, <italic>n</italic> = 5), myeloma (<italic>n</italic> = 1), gynecological cancers (<italic>n</italic> = 6), adenocarcinoma of the lung (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and ameloblastoma of the mandible (<italic>n</italic> = 1). The NCI-MATCH study reported an ORR of 38% (90% CI: 22.9, 54.9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) with dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with <italic>BRAF V600E/D/R/K</italic> mutation-positive solid tumors, lymphomas or MM whose disease had progressed on at least one standard therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Similar results for ORR were observed in the tumor cohorts in our study. Cancers such as histiocytic sarcoma of the brain and ameloblastoma, which are very rare and have no defined standard of care, have shown benefit with dabrafenib plus trametinib in the NCI-MATCH study.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The median DoR in included tumor cohorts in our study ranged from 31.2 months to NR and was higher when compared to the DoR reported in the NCI-MATCH study, which was 25.1 months (90% CI: 12.8, NR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par31">In general, <italic>BRAFV600</italic> inhibitors lack meaningful efficacy in colorectal cancer, and this appears to be a unique case<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The suboptimal MAPK signaling with dabrafenib plus trametinib in colorectal cancer may be explained by an epigenetic mechanism including the utilization of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling to maintain <italic>BRAF-MEK-ERK</italic> signaling in the face of <italic>BRAF</italic> inhibition. The same mechanism has not been described in another cancer to date. In <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutated papillary thyroid cancer and differentiated thyroid cancer, a similar mechanism did not impact the clinical efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par32">There is an unmet need in the management of rare cancers with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations that currently have limited or no treatment options, and dabrafenib plus trametinib can help to address this need. Results from the ROAR study have supported the FDA approval for dabrafenib (Tafinlar) plus trametinib (Mekinist) in rare advanced solid cancers with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations. This approval opens up access to patients with rare cancers with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations who otherwise may not have access to this valuable treatment. This is key to advancing clinical research in rare cancers and enabling evidence-based clinical practice in the management of these cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Similarly to other studies, such as ProTarget (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04341181">NCT04341181</ext-link>), IMPRESS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04817956">NCT04817956</ext-link>) and MEGALiT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04185831">NCT04185831</ext-link>), the ROAR study is an endeavor to define actionable genomic targets to help advance management and provide equal treatment opportunities in the management of cancers, including rare cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib 2 mg once daily was well tolerated in this study, with a clinically acceptable incidence of AEs, dose interruptions and treatment discontinuations. Across all cohorts, the observed safety profile of this combination was consistent with the known safety profile in approved indications of <italic>BRAFV600</italic> mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, NSCLC and ATC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. No new safety signals were identified.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The most frequently reported AEs across all cohorts were pyrexia (54.9%), fatigue (42.2%) and nausea (41.7%). The other AEs noted during the study were largely consistent with what is expected in pre-treated populations with cancer and that could be attributed to the cancer type in a cohort. For example, sepsis was seen in three patients with BTC, and a higher incidence of headache was reported in glioma cohorts. Similarly, a higher incidence of hematological abnormalities was seen in hematological cohorts, even though the incidence of such abnormalities was low.</p>
              <p id="Par35">This study has some limitations. It has a non-randomized, single-arm design (per histology). Given the rarity of the tumor types included in the study, it is challenging to design a randomized study for the included cohorts. Although the study collected data for quality of life, these data were not available for most patients. When available, these data were highly variable and did not provide interpretable results. This study did not assess the heterogeneity of the <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations. Further studies may be planned to correlate the efficacy of therapy with the degree of <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutation heterogeneity. Due to inclusion of diverse tumor cohorts, there was heterogeneity in patient characteristics. Therefore, the study did not assess the impact of baseline characteristics, previous treatment or any other factors on response to treatment. However, the correlation of patient characteristics with response to treatment has been reported in some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par36">In conclusion, combination treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib showed meaningful clinical activity in patients with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-mutated rare cancers and was approved in the United States as a therapeutic option in patients with advanced, rare solid tumors with <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations. In clinical practice, testing for <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutations can help to improve outcomes by providing a targeted treatment option for patients with rare cancers and limited treatment options. Furthermore, genetic testing and tumor profiling should be introduced early in the management plan to promptly identify those patients who may be eligible for <italic>BRAFV600E</italic>-targeted treatment. In addition to the previously treated cancers in this study, future studies could evaluate the combination treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib in treatment-naive <italic>BRAFV600E</italic> mutation-positive cancers.</p>

                  <p id="Par55">The primary endpoint of ORR was also analyzed using the frequentist methodology (point estimates and 95% CIs) including patients from the primary and expansion cohorts. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of this study design under various ORR distributions across cohorts, accounting for power, type I error, ORR estimation and probability of halting at an interim analysis. With similar treatment effects across all cohorts, this design would maintain 84–98% power and a type I error rate ≤0.04; power ranges from 55% to 90% and type I error from 0.03 to 0.14 if treatment effect varies across histologic subtypes.</p>
                  <p id="Par56">The efficacy evaluable population was defined as all enrolled patients, regardless of whether or not treatment was administered, and encompassed all patients enrolled in both the primary and expansion cohorts for a given histological cancer subtype. Evaluable patients included those who had progressive disease, had initiated new anti-cancer treatment, had withdrawn consent, had died, had stable disease for at least 6 weeks after the first dose day or had at least two post-baseline disease assessments (other than not evaluable).</p>
                  <p id="Par57">PFS, DoR and OS were analyzed for the combined primary and expansion cohorts using the Kaplan–Meier methodology, with 95% CIs for median and milestone estimates constructed using the Brookmeyer–Crowley method with a complementary log–log transformation of the survivor function; 95% CIs were used for uncertainty estimates and were investigator assessed. Patients with an unknown or missing response were treated as non-responders and were included in the denominator when calculating the percentage. Time-to-event secondary endpoints were right censored if the event was not observed during the study follow-up.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">The independent radiology review was done as a supportive analysis in the ATC, BTC, ASI, LGG and HGG cohorts. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints based on independent reviewer assessment were summarized in the same way as the best response based on investigator assessment. An assessment of the concordance between the investigator-assessed response and independent reviewer-assessed response was performed. In addition, waterfall plots were generated for best confirmed response based on investigator and independent assessment.</p>
                  <p id="Par59">The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of dabrafenib or trametinib. Safety data were summarized descriptively by histology and across all cohorts. Incidence of deaths and primary cause of death were summarized. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety and activity results from interim analyses at regular intervals and provided recommendations to the sponsor.</p>
