                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Nonhygienic products for managing menstruation are reported to cause reproductive tract infections. Menstrual cups are a potential solution. We assessed whether menstrual cups would reduce bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal microbiome (VMB), and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as studies have not evaluated this.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomized controlled trial was performed in 96 Kenyan secondary schools, randomized (1:1:1:1) to control, menstrual cup, cash transfer, or menstrual cup plus cash transfer. This substudy assessing the impact of menstrual cups on BV, VMB, and STIs, included 6 schools from the control (3) and menstrual cup only (3) groups, both receiving BV and STI testing and treatment at each visit. Self-collected vaginal swabs were used to measure VMB (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing), BV (Nugent score), and STIs. STIs were a composite of <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (nucleic acid amplification test) and <italic toggle="yes">Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (rapid immunochromatographic assay). Participants were not masked and were followed for 30 months. The primary outcome was diagnosis of BV; secondary outcomes were VMB and STIs. Intention-to-treat blinded analyses used mixed effects generalized linear regressions, with random effects term for school. The study was conducted between May 2, 2018, and February 7, 2021. A total of 436 participants were included: 213 cup, 223 control. There were 289 BV diagnoses: 162 among control participants and 127 among intervention participants (odds ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.98]; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.038). The occurrence of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus crispatus–</italic>dominated VMB was higher among cup group participants (odds ratio 1.37 [95% CI 1.06 to 1.75]), as was the mean relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> (3.95% [95% CI 1.92 to 5.99]). There was no effect of intervention on STIs (relative risk 0.82 [95% CI 0.50 to 1.35]). The primary limitations of this study were insufficient power for subgroup analyses, and generalizability of findings to nonschool and other global settings.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adolescent girls and young women account for more than 60% of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with an estimated 750 new infections occurring daily [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In western Kenya, HIV prevalence among 15- to 19-year-old adolescent girls is estimated at 3.8%, rising to 9.5% among young women aged 20 to 24 years old [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic runs parallel to the HIV epidemic, with prevalences of chlamydia and gonorrhea among adolescents and young adults ranging from 7% to 17% [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects 20% to 50% of the general population of women in SSA and Kenya [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and increases the risk of HIV acquisition 1.6-fold, accounting for up to 15% of HIV infections worldwide given its high prevalence [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For adolescent girls, the HIV/STI epidemic overlaps with broader reproductive health concerns such as high risk of teenage pregnancy, with poor maternal outcomes, and higher risk of school dropout.</p>
              <p>Good menstrual hygiene management (MHM) includes using clean materials to absorb or collect menstrual blood, along with adequate education, sanitation facilities, and a conducive environment [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Lack of MHM materials can cause adolescent girls to miss school [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and may place them at risk for coercive sex [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To address this intersection of lack of menstrual materials and increased risk of sexual exposures, a cluster randomized study of 644 girls aged 14 to 16 years old compared the effect of provision of reusable menstrual cups to controls provided puberty and hygiene training. After 1 year, girls receiving menstrual cups had a 35% lower prevalence of BV (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.034) and a 52% lower prevalence of STIs (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.039) compared to controls [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During menses, the structure of the vaginal microbiome (VMB) (collection of microorganisms in the vagina) often shifts toward lower relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> species and an increase in <italic toggle="yes">Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, with increased detection of BV [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A prior study demonstrated that menstrual cup use was not associated with vaginal microflora destabilization during menses [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which may explain the observed beneficial effect of menstrual cups on BV and STIs.</p>
              <p>Menstrual cup use may hold promise as a multipurpose tool for BV and STI risk reduction by maintaining a <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus-</italic>dominated VMB. Our objective was to study the effects of menstrual cup use on the VMB, BV, and STIs in a longitudinal analysis nested within a cluster randomized controlled trial of 4,400 secondary school girls aged 14 to 25 in Siaya County, Kenya. We hypothesized menstrual cups would lead to increase in <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> and reduced BV and STIs.</p>

                <title>Study setting, design, and participants</title>
                <p>Cups and Community Health (CaCHe, pronounced “Cash-Ay”) was a prospective analysis of secondary school girls in Siaya County, Kenya, nested within the CCG trial (<ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT03051789; <xref rid="pmed.1004258.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>) [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
                <p>The CCG trial was an open-label, 4-arm, school-cluster randomized controlled superiority trial. Schools were allocated into 4 arms (1,1,1,1) via block randomization: (1) provision of menstrual cups with training on safe cup use and care; (2) conditional cash transfer (CCT) based on ≥80% school attendance in previous term; (3) menstrual cup and CCT; and (4) usual practice. All girls received puberty and hygiene education. Girls in control and cup only arms received hand wash soap. Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the interventions (menstrual cups and cash transfer). For the CaCHe study, nested within the CCG trial, we aimed to enroll 20% of girls in the cup only and control arms of the CCG trial. Because CCG was randomized, with participants in 2 of the 4 arms included in CaCHe, it would not have been feasible, ethical, or statistically necessary to again randomize rather than maintain the randomized groups. The cup and control participants under CaCHe differed from CCG in that they all received BV and STI testing and treatment; thus, the comparison was cups plus BV and STI testing and treatment versus control plus STI testing and treatment. All cups and control schools for CaCHe were enrolled in one of the 5 wards of Rarieda subcounty. There were 16 schools screened for inclusion in Rarieda, 4 of which were excluded due to small size. Of the 12 schools, 3 schools were randomized into each arm of the CCG trial, leading to the 3 menstrual cup arm schools and 3 control arms included in CaCHe. Eligibility for CaCHe mirrored eligibility for CCG: attendance at a participating school, being a resident of the study area, provision of assent and parental/guardian consent, and girls had to report established menses (≥3 times). Girls were excluded at baseline if they declared pregnancy (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1), had not reached menarche (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4), or were under age 14 (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2) (<xref rid="pmed.1004258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. Participant flow diagram). Four participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2 in the control arm; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2 in the menstrual cup arm) did not provide specimens for BV, VMB, or STI testing subsequent to baseline and are not included in outcome analyses. After baseline, follow-up visits occurred every 6 months through 30 months, with the 24-month visit (to have taken place April through June 2020) not conducted due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The cancelled 24-month visit was agreed upon by the Principal Investigator and all Co-Investigators, and aligned with IRB and ethical review requirements. Missed visits are identified in <xref rid="pmed.1004258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> under “loss-to-follow-up”; the number of participants with missed visit at any time point ranged from 8 to 22 in the intervention arm and from 4 to 20 in the control arm. All participants with “missed visit” were included in analyses (only those <italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 4 with no measurement of outcome over follow-up were excluded, as described above).</p>

                <p>Participants self-completed a tablet-based survey in their language of choice (English or DhoLuo) to obtain sociodemographic information and to assess MHM and sexual practices. Study nurses and counsellors trained in research and survey administration provided assistance as needed. Sociodemographic data included age and detailed socioeconomic measures. Socioeconomic status (SES) was measured using questions from the health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) household survey. The SES score was constructed using the absolute index method [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and quintiles were dichotomized as quintiles 1 to 2 and quintiles 3 to 5. School-level WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) was assessed as a score ranging 0 to 3, reflecting 1 point each for direct observation of the following: any water for handwashing, soap, and acceptable girl-to-latrine ratio (0 to 30 girls per latrine) for latrines that were clean, without offensive smell, without holes in walls, and with door, roof, and stable floor [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A series of questions assessed whether girls were sexually active, and whether they were forced or threatened to have sex (referred to as coerced sex), or whether they were given money, items, or favors in exchange for sex (referred to as transactional sex). Although current pregnancy was an exclusion criterion in eligibility assessment, 3 girls who did not declare pregnancy at eligibility screening reported being pregnant after enrolment and were maintained in analyses (1 in control arm, 2 in cups arm).</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>CaCHe was designed to estimate the effect of menstrual cups on girls’ risk of BV as the primary outcome, with an anticipated cumulative event rate of 30% to 40% among controls occurring over 30 months. In a design of 6 repeated measurements having AR (1) covariance structure, correlation between observations on the same subject ranging 0.25 to 0.4, and accounting for 20% loss to follow-up, group sample sizes of 220 in cup arm and 220 in control arm would achieve &gt;80% power to detect 25% reduced relative prevalence of BV for the cup arm compared to control arm when BV prevalence is 30%, and 97% power when prevalence is 40% (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.05 two-sided test, 2 proportions in a repeated measures design; PASS v15).</p>

                <p>As detailed previously, randomization assignments were computer generated by the trial statisticians, using SAS (version 9.3), with blinded arm allocation achieved through community randomization ceremonies [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Participants were informed of group allocation on screening day, after which time masking the assignment was not possible. Due to the nature of the intervention, research assistants collecting specimens were not masked. Lab staff in Kenya and the United States were masked as specimens were received with only study numbers.</p>

                <title>Specimen collection</title>
                <p>At baseline and each follow-up visit, girls were asked to take self-collected vaginal swabs. The first swab obtained was for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (microbiome) using the OMNIgene vaginal (OMR-130, DNA Genotek, Ontario, Canada). A cotton tipped swab was collected to test for BV. The third swab was collected for detection of <italic toggle="yes">Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> (CT) and <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (NG) using the Cepheid GeneXpert Vaginal/Endocervical Specimen Collection Kit. The fourth swab collected was used for detection of <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> (TV) using rayon tipped swabs. Participants were instructed verbally and with visual aids on how to collect the swabs, as detailed elsewhere [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nurses and research assistants prepared smears for BV immediately after collection. Swabs for amplicon sequencing, CT/NG, and TV were immediately placed on ice packs in coolers for transport to the lab in Kisumu. Upon receipt at the lab, specimens for amplicon sequencing were placed at −80°C until shipment to Chicago for processing.</p>

                <title>Detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections</title>
                <p>At baseline, swabs for CT/NG were shipped weekly for processing at the University of Nairobi Institute for Tropical and Infectious Diseases; from the 12-month visit, onward swabs for CT/NG were processed in Kisumu at Nyanza Reproductive Health Society. All swabs for TV and BV were processed in Kisumu at Nyanza Reproductive Health Society for the duration of the study. Following manufacturer protocol, vaginal swabs were tested for CT/NG using the GeneXpert (Cepheid, Sunnydale, California, United States). Swabs for TV were processed immediately upon receipt using the OSOM TV antigen detection assay (Sekisui, Lexington, MA, US). Air-dried smears were Gram stained and evaluated according to Nugent’s criteria within 48 hours of receipt; a score of 7 to 10 was defined as BV [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For quality control, each slide was confirmed by a second technician, with discrepancies adjudicated via discussion between the 2 technicians prior to reporting. Fingerstick whole blood collected in EDTA tubes were tested for HIV according to Kenyan national guidelines. HIV–positive girls were linked to care. CT, NG, and TV were treated following Kenyan national guidelines. BV was treated with 2 g of tinidazole once daily for 2 days, for lower occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms, likely higher adherence, and equivalent efficacy to longer duration regimens or other topical or oral antimicrobials [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

                <p>DNA extraction and PCR amplification of microbial 16S rRNA genes employed a two-stage PCR protocol using primers 341F and 806R (V3-V4 variable region) [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument, implementing V3 chemistry (600 cycles).

Subsequently, a biological observation matrix (BIOM) was generated at the lowest taxonomic level identifiable.

                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was BV, dichotomized as positive (Nugent score 7 to 10) versus negative (Nugent score 0 to 6). Participants in whom treatment for BV was not documented at baseline (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 1) or subsequent visits (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) were excluded from further analysis as it would be unknown whether subsequent infections represented new infections (<xref rid="pmed.1004258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Those with documented antibiotic treatment were maintained in analyses (i.e., could have multiple infections contributing to analysis; <xref rid="pmed.1004258.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were fitted to allow for the hierarchical structure of the study, with missing at random assumption for complete case data. The GLMM with binomial distribution and logit link function included treatment arm as fixed effect, and participant and cluster as random effects, to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with odds ratios providing an average estimate across all time points. We estimated odds ratios for BV rather than relative risks given the relatively low efficacy of antibiotic treatment of BV, with failure in up to 50% at 6 months [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We applied robust variance estimate due to the small number of clusters (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 6). Baseline BV and STI status were part of the longitudinal data, and, therefore, estimations account for baseline BV and STI status in both the crude and multivariable adjusted models.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) VMB CST, dichotomized as CST-I (<italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> dominated) versus other CST (CST-II, CST-III, CST-IV, CST-V); (2) relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> (continuous); and (3) incident STI, dichotomized as positive (composite of infection with CT, NG, and/or TV) versus negative for all three. For analysis of CST, while CST-II (<italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">jesenii</italic> dominated) and CST-V (<italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> dominated) are generally not associated with adverse outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], they comprised a small proportion of observations and as defined a priori, the desired outcome was CST-I. Methods for analyzing CST-I followed those as described for BV. The GLMM with Gaussian distribution was applied for analysis of relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic>, including treatment arm as fixed effect, and participant and cluster as random effects, with 95% confidence intervals estimated via robust variance estimate. We estimated relative risk of STI given the high efficacy of antibiotic treatment for CT and NG [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The GLMM with Poisson distribution was applied for analysis of STI (as log binomial did not converge), following methods specified as above. Participants with documented antibiotic treatment for BV or STI detected at baseline or follow-up visits could contribute multiple infections (<xref rid="pmed.1004258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1004258.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Tables); one participant for whom baseline STI treatment was not documented was excluded from incidence analyses.</p>

                <p>Adjusted ITT analyses were performed on the primary and secondary outcomes. Baseline a priori confounders were specified as follows: school WASH score, HIV status, age, ever sexually active, and SES. At baseline, few participants were HIV infected (<italic toggle="yes">n =</italic> 7), and due to sparsity, we did not adjust for this. ITT subgroup analyses were performed for the primary outcome (BV). The a priori specified subgroup variables were baseline values of the following: age, ever sexually active, SES, WASH score, coerced sex, transactional sex, and STI status. Subgroup analyses are presented visually as coefficient plots with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</p>

                <p>The 24-month endline visit was scheduled to take place April through June 2020 but did not occur due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the statistical analysis plan was updated so that the primary analysis included the 30-month visit, and sensitivity analysis was limited to 18 months of follow-up (i.e., prior to the COVID-19 pandemic). STI testing was to take place at annual visits (baseline, 12 months, and 24 months) but took place at 30 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyses are conducted through 30 months (i.e., there is no sensitivity analysis of STI outcome).</p>

              <p>We randomized 3 schools to the menstrual cups only arm, and 3 schools to the control arm (<xref rid="pmed.1004258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>. Participant flow diagram). Recruitment took place March through April 2018, with enrollment May through June 2018. Among 442 eligible girls, 6 declined: 1 parent declined consent, and 5 minors declined assent after parent consented. Baseline characteristics were similar by study arm in relation to age, SES score, and sexual activity (<xref rid="pmed.1004258.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">N =</italic> 223 control arm, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 213 menstrual cup arm), but with large imbalance in WASH scores, being higher among participants in the control schools. Baseline STI and CST were similar between groups, and BV was somewhat increased among control arm participants. Participants were median 16.9 years of age (IQR 16.1 to 17.9), with 11.2% having BV and 9.9% with any STI. Follow-up visits occurred as planned with follow-up of &gt;90% of enrolled participants at each study visit.</p>

              <p>In this prospective analysis nested within a cluster randomized controlled trial, we observed via ITT analysis that secondary schoolgirls allocated to schools receiving the menstrual cup with BV and STI testing and treatment had a 26% lower odds of BV, 37% increased odds of having optimal VMB CST (CST-I), and 3.95% increased relative abundance of <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic>, compared with controls without cups, who also had BV and STI testing and treatment. Effect sizes did not vary when adjusting for a priori specified confounders. We observed a statistically significant lower incidence of STI for participants in the menstrual cup arm only when adjusted for confounders. Sensitivity analyses restricted to pre-COVID data through 18 months of follow-up observed relative increases in CST-I and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> that were similar to associations demonstrated through 30 months of follow-up. This suggests that the effect of menstrual cups on VMB was not altered during the COVID-19 pandemic time period (i.e., the 30-month visit), despite overall increasing prevalence of BV and STIs.</p>
              <p>Destabilization of the vaginal microbiome composition during menses is well documented, with increases in <italic toggle="yes">G</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> and decreases in <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is biologic plausibility for menstrual cups supporting an optimal VMB composition and preventing destabilization. Increased iron levels during menses are favorable to <italic toggle="yes">G</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a major pathobiant in BV [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Because blood is collected inside the menstrual cup, there is limited blood flow in the vaginal vault. Additionally, the vaginal pH increases during menses [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], due to decreases in acidifying <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacilli</italic> during menses and also because blood pH is typically around 7. Among 406 women observed over 3 menstrual cycles of menstrual cup use, North and colleagues observed no changes in vaginal pH, appearance of vulva or cervix (e.g., ectopy, friable, other abnormal), or detection of <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic>, yeast cells, or <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a subset of 44 women in this study, colposcopy conducted at baseline, 2 to 3 months, and 5 to 6 months yielded no change in inflammation, abrasion, punctuation, acetowhite findings, or topography. In these same women, there was no change in colonization detected via culture for <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus</italic> spp., <italic toggle="yes">G</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">vaginalis</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacteroides</italic> spp., or <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic>. Our findings build on these studies, showing that menstrual cup use can benefit the VMB and reduce BV, measured using sensitive molecular methods, in the setting of a rigorous cluster randomized controlled study design.</p>
              <p>Poor-quality MHM products have been associated with reproductive tract infections. The mechanisms are biological and behavioral. Unsanitary cloths, disposable pads used beyond their recommended time, or reusable pads that are not sufficiently washed and dried are associated with increased reports of vaginal discharge, reproductive tract infections, and urinary tract infection symptoms [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; this may occur from direct transfer of bacteria or the occlusive environment. Additionally, adolescent girls and young women with insufficient access to MHM products may be vulnerable to transactional sex to obtain these materials. In Phillips-Howard’s household study of 3,418 menstruating girls and women aged 13 to 29 years in the same area of western Kenya as our present study, 10% of 15-year-olds reported they exchanged sex for sanitary pads [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We observed that crude point estimates for BV, CST-I, and <italic toggle="yes">L</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">crispatus</italic> associated with the menstrual cups arm were unchanged when adjusted for baseline age, SES, WASH score, and sexual activity, suggesting the mechanism by which menstrual cups conferred benefit in our sample was independent of these sociobehavioral factors.</p>
              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused the 24-month endline visit to be delayed, thus introducing potential confounding and bias. We observed substantial increases in BV and STI at the 30-month visit (i.e., including time during the COVID-19 pandemic), and we also observed meaningful and statistically significant benefits conferred to VMB composition and against BV occurrence through 18 months of follow-up time, occurring completely prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect sizes were similar between data including the 30-month visit and data excluding the 30-month visit, suggesting lack of confounding. After trial end, all participants have received menstrual cups and follow-up is ongoing to 72 months. This extended follow-up will enable us to observe whether the changes associated with menstrual cups vary by changes in sexual activity (such as number of sexual partners, condom use, and coerced and transactional sex) and a greater cumulative incidence and prevalence of past STIs and BV.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Nesting our study of menstrual cups and the effect on BV, the VMB, and STIs within the CCG cluster randomized controlled trial with ITT analyses minimized confounding and selection bias and maximized efficient use of resources. We did not directly measure the hypothesized mechanisms by which menstrual cups may benefit the VMB; specifically, we did not intensely measure the VMB composition, bacterial load, or vaginal pH across the menstrual phases by MHM product. While infeasible in our setting, future studies should examine these mechanisms as they may lead to development of other interventions that benefit the VMB. Our future analyses will evaluate the microbiome of menstrual cup specimens obtained in this study, to determine correlation to host microbiome and detection of putative pathogens. Condom use and number of sex partners may have differed between groups, but as these questions were answered only by the subset of participants reporting sexual activity, we could not adjust for these potential confounders. It is possible certain users may benefit differentially from menstrual cup use, but the study was not powered for such subgroup analyses, and we refrain from interpretation; potential differences must be assessed in future scaled assessments of menstrual cup impact on BV and STIs. We believe our findings generalize to adolescent girls attending secondary schools, and results for those who are not in school or in different global regions are unknown. We note both in the cup arm and in the control arm, participants underwent BV and STI testing and treatment at scheduled study visits. Though both arms were tested and treated equivalently for BV and STIs, we treated BV (Nugent score 7 to 10) regardless of symptoms due to lack of correlation with diagnosis [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and this is not standard of care for BV, and, therefore, results may not generalize to those not screened or treated for BV.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>These results generated from a randomized study design suggest beneficial effects of menstrual cups on the composition of the VMB and reduction in BV. This evidence should be used in the development and implementation of MHM programs. In tandem with cost-effectiveness and reduced environmental impacts [<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1004258.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], beneficial impact on reproductive tract health supports menstrual cups as a priority menstrual product in MHM programs.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Mehta,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "The effect of menstrual cups on the vaginal microbiome, Bacterial vaginosis, and sexually transmitted infections: results of a nested cohort study within a cluster randomized controlled trial" (PMEDICINE-D-22-03601R1) for review by PLOS Medicine. Your paper was evaluated by a senior editor and discussed among all the editors here. </p>
              <p>Your article was also evaluated by an academic editor and three independent reviewers. I am afraid that the reviewers raised a number of substantial concerns about the paper. After discussion among the editorial team, I am sorry to say that we have decided not to consider it further for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The reviews are included below or at the following link: [LINK]. I hope that you find them constructive. </p>
              <p>I am sorry that I cannot be more positive on this occasion. I hope you appreciate the reasons for this decision, and will consider PLOS Medicine for other submissions in the future. </p>
              <p>Best wishes,</p>

              <p>Reviewer Notes:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Statistical review</p>
              <p>This paper reports a substudy of a cluster randomised trial that examines whether menstrual cups reduce the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis. The authors demonstrate that there is a significant reduction in the primary analysis.</p>
              <p>Generally the study used appropriate methods and was reported well. I have some comments below:</p>
              <p>1. Abstract + results page 14: I would recommend providing the p-values for the secondary outcomes in addition to the CIs.</p>
              <p>2. Page 8, sample size calculation: is the 25% reduced prevalence in absolute terms (i.e. from 30% to 5%) or in relative terms? Was any clustering effect allowed for?</p>
              <p>3. Statistical methods: the follow-up rate was generally quite high, but it would be good to mention what assumptions about missing data were made (i.e. that the analysis model allowed for missing at random patterns of missingness).</p>
              <p>4. Statistical methods: can the authors provide some intuition about how to interpret the estimated odds ratio - is this basically an average across all time points?</p>
              <p>5. Page 14: I feel that the text should point out that the multivariable adjusted model for the primary outcome no longer was significant (especially as the authors highlight a secondary endpoint becoming significant with the adjustment).</p>
              <p>James Wason</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This manuscript presents the results of a cohort study nested within a randomized trial examining the effect of menstrual cups compared to usual care on bacterial vaginosis in a population of adolescent girls and young women. The authors conclude that menstrual cups benefitted adolescents by reducing BV and increasing lactobacillus crispatus relative abundance. There are some critical analytical problems that lead me to seriously question the primary findings. In addition, the authors discuss the findings as though they are derived from a RCT. The net effect is that they make strong statements about the benefits of the menstrual cup based on findings that do not seem justified by the data presented.</p>
              <p>Major Comments</p>
              <p>1) Methods state that "All girls with Nugent score 7-10 were treated due to lack of correlation of reported symptoms with BV." This rationale does not justify treating asymptomatic BV - the only indication for treatment of asymptomatic BV is in women who are pregnant and have a history of preterm birth. Even this indication is currently being questioned. Equally importantly, the decision to treat all BV in this cohort means that the comparison groups were actually menstrual cup plus regular screening and treatment of BV versus regular screening and treatment of BV. It does not really address the question of whether menstrual cup alone reduces BV in a realistic setting where only symptomatic BV is treated.</p>
              <p>2) The results state that baseline BV, STI, and CST were similar between groups. This is not true for BV, the primary outcome of the trial. In fact, the BV prevalence in the control arm was 13.5% (30/223) while the prevalence of BV was 8.9% (19/213) in the cup arm. By a quick calculation, this appears to yield an odds ratio of 0.66 for BV in the cup versus control arm prior to the intervention - bigger than the effect seen later in the study. Since the authors describe this as a cohort study, it seems like they should adjust for this baseline difference in the primary outcome variable. Instead, the analysis was conducted as though this was an RCT. Even if you consider it to be a small cluster RCT with too few clusters, it would be important to adjust for a baseline difference if the randomization did not result in similar rates of the outcome in the two arms.</p>
              <p>3) Discussion states, "Our findings build on these studies, showing that menstrual cup use can benefit the vaginal microbiome and reduce BV, measured using sensitive molecular methods, in the setting of a rigorous cluster randomized design." This is misleading - the analysis presented in this paper is a cohort (or a cRCT with too few clusters), and did not account for an important baseline difference in the outcome.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Mehta and colleagues used data from a cluster randomized trial conducted among secondary schools in Kenya to evaluate the effect of menstrual cup use, versus normal menstrual management practices, on BV, the vaginal microbiome, and STI. Their data indicate that individuals attending schools randomized to receive menstrual cups had 24% reduced odds of BV and 37% higher odds of L. crispatus-dominated microbiota. These novel findings warrant replication in additional populations, but they suggest provision/promotion of menstrual cups may be a relatively easy-to-implement intervention to improve vaginal microbiota composition and reduce BV. Overall, the manuscript is well written and clear. I'll share some suggestions with the goal of improving reader experience and the dissemination of these important and exciting findings.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>1. In the Methods, please provide details on Gram stain and Nugent score quality control and quality assurance measures. With BV assessed by Nugent score as the primary outcome, understanding the efforts taken to reduce inter-observer variation and improve accuracy in Nugent scoring is essential to evaluating the validity of the findings.</p>
              <p>2. In the Methods, antibiotic-use-related inclusion and exclusion criteria are unclear and presented/described differently in several places (lines 164-165, 193-196, 211-214). The rationale for these criteria is also unclear. Please more clearly describe the criteria and why they were used (I think to allow for repeat outcomes following antibiotic-mediated BV/STI clearance?), and please include all relevant information together in one place.</p>
              <p>3. A figure depicting participants' baseline and end-of-follow-up microbiota composition (e.g. stacked bar plot, heatmap), indicating whether participants attended schools in the menstrual cup versus control arm, and indicating presence of BV and STI would be very helpful in conveying the microbial context of the trial and its findings. Please consider including such a figure.</p>
              <p>4. The first paragraph of the Results seems to undersell/under-report some of the differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention arms. It is somewhat subjective what constitutes a small vs. large difference, but here are some comments from the text I'd suggest reconsidering/revising: </p>
              <p>a. "some imbalance in…school WASH score" (line 247) implies minor differences. However, about half of menstrual cup schools had a score of 0 compared to about a quarter of control arm schools. </p>
              <p>b. "Baseline BV…were similar" (line 248). Similar proportions of participants had Nugent score 0-3 at baseline; however, the prevalence of Nugent score 4-6 was two-fold higher in menstrual cup schools, and the prevalence of Nugent score 7-10 was about 1.5-fold higher in control arm schools.</p>
              <p>c. Among ever-sexually-active participants, condomless sex/never using condoms was 2-fold higher among menstrual cup schools. This may be worth mentioning in the text. </p>
              <p>5. I think the subgroup analysis stratified by history of transactional sex deserves more attention in the discussion (because its exciting)! The BV OR was substantially lower in magnitude among those reporting a history of transactional sex than among those reporting never engaging in transactional sex. Neither OR is significant, and the CI for those reporting transactional sex is wide, so it will be important to not over interpret these findings. That said, this difference and the data suggesting a potentially stronger protective effect among those who do report history of transactional sex directly speak to one of the hypothesized sociobehavioral mechanisms by which menstrual cup use may reduce BV and improve vaginal health - that menstrual cups eliminate (at least one) cause/motivation to engage in transactional sex, which is to be able to afford/acquire menstrual management materials.</p>
              <p>6. Not reporting data on either baseline menstrual management practices or follow-up adherence to menstrual cup use among those attending menstrual cup schools are important limitations that should be discussed. Alternatively, if these data are available, please include them in the descriptive statistics.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>1. The hypothesis that menstrual cup use may reduce reliance on transactional sex to afford/acquire menstrual management materials (lines 62-63) should be explicitly stated earlier in the introduction.</p>
              <p>2. The language used to describe socioeconomic status categories (line 110) is stigmatizing, especially considering you refer to both categories as "poor." I would recommend using more a quantitative description (e.g. just referring to the cutpoint between quintiles 2 and 3). Please also be sure to use the same language to describe these categories in the Methods, Table 1, and Figure 3.</p>
              <p>3. Please clarify whether the "water for handwashing" component of the WASH score (line 112) refers to clean water or any water.</p>
              <p>4. Throughout the methods, please provide the version number for all software used.</p>
              <p>5. Please describe the design of study follow-up in the text of the Methods (e.g. the number and timing of follow-up visits).</p>
              <p>6. In lines 153-155, the order and timing of which institutes received and processed swabs for BV and STI detection is unclear. Please revise.</p>
              <p>7. Please state the cutpoints/strata for subgroup analyses in the Methods (lines 224-226).</p>
              <p>8. Results paragraph in lines 271-277 should refer to Table 3.</p>
              <p>9. There are a few places that would benefit from additional references:</p>
              <p>a. Line 324 - more than one reference should be provided as microbiota destabilization during menses is, as you state, well documented.</p>
              <p>b. Line 327 - please provide a reference(s) for iron being favorable to Gardnerella and a primary/original research reference for Gardnerella being a major BV pathobiont (not just a review).</p>
              <p>c. Lines 342-345 - again, please provide primary/original research reference(s) for poor quality menstrual management materials being associated with adverse outcomes.</p>
              <p>10. It is important to note that these findings may not be generalizable to individuals attending secondary school in regions other than East Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, especially considering typical menstrual management practices are often "passed down" matrilineally and likely differ between global regions.</p>
              <p>11. Please place the menstrual cup arm and control arm columns in the same order in Table 1, Table 2, and Supplemental Table 2.</p>
              <p>12. In Figure 3, please include axis tick marks and labels for ORs &lt;1. Please also clarify in the caption whether a non-linear scale has been applied to the x axis.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #4: This is a well-conducted study on an important topic to improve vaginal health in adolescent girls and young women in a setting with high HIV and STI burden. The study appears to be rigorous in its rationale, design, and analysis. I have only minor revisions and suggestions regarding the analysis.</p>
              <p>1. Is it worth carrying out another sensitivity analysis that leaves out BV-intermediate? Lumping BV intermediate in with BV negative could be diluting the effects, especially given the L. crispatus finding is statistically stronger. Perhaps BV negative could be compared to BV positive, or BV positive and intermediate together to BV negative. A lot of the BV intermediate could be <ext-link xlink:href="http://L.iners" ext-link-type="uri">L.iners</ext-link> dominated.</p>
              <p>2. There is analysis of the absolute abundance of L.crispatus. It would be of interest to know what the menstrual cup is doing to overall bacterial load, in addition to relative abdunance.</p>
              <p>3. Should relative abundance of L.crispatus vs <ext-link xlink:href="http://L.iners" ext-link-type="uri">L.iners</ext-link> vs non-lacto be considered?</p>
              <p>4. The authors could specify the number and intervals of visits in the design. At the end of the methods and in the figures, this appears to be 6-monthly, but the number of observations per participant is an important aspect of the study. </p>
              <p>5. the difference in unadjusted vs adjusted STI effect is puzzling. Why do the 95% CI vary so widely (wide in unadjusted but narrower in adjusted, with a similar effect size?) Similarly, the 95% CI for the BV effect are narrow in unadjusted but quite wide in the adjusted, despite similar effect sizes for menstrual cups vs BV - it would be useful to know what the key variables are that are changing these outcomes so dramatically. </p>
              <p>6. Were any interaction analyses considered for Fig3? Even if non-significant these could be worth reporting, given some of the differences between strata.</p>
              <p>7. There is no comment in the discussion on cost-effectiveness versus effect size- do these results favour scaling up this intervention? Would the increasing availability of reusable cups favour their widespread distribution? While its clearly beyond scope to do this analysis here, some speculation re: future directions would be useful.</p>

              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>Please respond to the comments from Reviewers 2 and 3. </p>
              <p>Did your sub-study have its own associated prospective protocol or analysis plan (separate from the trial protocol available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7594-3" ext-link-type="uri">https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-7594-3</ext-link>)? The trial protocol and CT registry contain little to no information regarding the present sub-study, and it is difficult to determine how much of the study was pre-specified based on the information currently available.</p>
              <p>Please confirm whether the primary results of the trial have been published.</p>
              <p>As your trial had to undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances, please complete the CONSERVE-CONSORT checklist and provide in your Supporting Information.</p>
              <p>When completing the checklist, please use section and paragraph numbers, rather than page numbers.</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you to the authors for addressing my previous comments well. I have no further issues to raise.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The revised paper has the same issues as the earlier submission.</p>
              <p>1) Asymptomatic women with a Nugent score &gt;=7 do not have a disease. There is no study showing any benefit to treating women (or adolescents) in this scenario. Regardless of what the study team thought, this is not the standard of care. I can understand that if the IRB were presented with the information that it was a disease, they would want it treated. If instead the IRB understood that there is no benefit to treatment of asymptomatic women with a vaginal gram stain score &gt;=7, I suspect they would have felt differently. </p>
              <p>2) Because the research team's approach to handling asymptomatic women with a Nugent score &gt;=7 this is clearly a deviation from the standard of care, I think this needs to be clearly stated in the paper.</p>
              <p>3) It is true that both arms were tested and treated equally for BV, but the response that this does not introduce bias misses the point. It is a problem with generalizability. The study did not test menstrual cup versus no menstrual cup. Instead, it tested regular screening and treatment for BV (regardless of symptoms) versus regular screening and treatment of BV plus a menstrual cup. It is not possible to generalize that the effect on BV would be the same in the absence of regular screening and treatment of BV in both arms. I think that for the paper to be publishable, it would need to</p>
              <p>a. Clearly explain the two arms as: (1) cup plus screening and treatment of BV versus (2) screening and treatment of BV</p>
              <p>b. In the discussion, clearly note that it may or may not be possible to generalize these findings to a population that is not receiving regular screening and treatment for both asymptomatic and symptomatic BV. I.e. without doing the study, you cannot assume that menstrual cups alone would have the same effect. It might be greater or less than the effect observed in this trial.</p>
              <p>4) I'm puzzled by the authors response about randomization, given that the title of the study presents it as a nested cohort study within a cluster-randomized trial. The title appears to present it as a cohort. I actually agree that the randomization remains valid, so it may be the title that is the problem. Of course it would not make sense to re-randomize. However, it is a very small cRCT - I would still like to see the findings adjusted for the baseline difference in BV. I'm not sure what the authors' response about this means - that BV at baseline is included in the baseline stream.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Mehta and colleagues' revised manuscript and response to reviewers sufficiently addressed my comments from my prior review, with one minor exception (first comment below). I also include a few comments related to minor typos I saw in the text that are important for the science and can be fixed quickly.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>Thank you for your response to my prior comment about baseline BV being different between the arms. Even though you adjust for baseline BV, please revise the text (line 289 in clean, 296 in track changes) to not say that baseline BV was similar/reflect the difference between arms. </p>
              <p>Line 211 in clean, 213 in track changes - "Quality and primer trimmed" should read "Quality filtered and primer trimmed" or something along those lines.</p>
              <p>Make sure to reference Table 4 in Adjusted, Sub-group, and Sensitivity Analyses subsection of results.</p>
              <p>The crude BV OR in table 3 is 0.76, but in the text it's 0.74. Please correct as needed.</p>

              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>In my first two reviews, I restricted my comments to the most serious problems with the study design. I did not try to make a comprehensive listing of things that would need to be changed for publication, as I wasn't recommending a resubmission. In its current form, I still do not think the paper should be published.</p>
              <p>The authors clearly want this to be the seminal paper that shows that menstrual cups reduce BV and increase Lactobacillus concentrations. This is evident from their statements at the end of the abstract, in the author summary, and the conclusion. For example, the conclusion states, "These results generated from a randomized study design provide strong evidence for beneficial effects of menstrual cups on the composition of the vaginal microbiome and reduction of BV." I appreciate that the authors have added the statement, in the limitations, that the results may not be generalizable because screening and treatment for BV is not standard of care. However, the fact that participants were screened and treated for BV means that the conclusions, as written, are not well supported by the data. The paper is written as though it is a comparison of menstrual cups versus no menstrual cups, rather than a comparison of menstrual cups plus screening and treatment for BV vs. screening and treatment for BV.</p>
              <p>My summary of the conclusions, looking at the same data, is that in a study of screening and treatment for BV plus menstrual cups vs. screening and treatment of BV alone, the arm receiving screening and treatment of BV plus menstrual cups had lower BV and higher Lactobacillus crispatus. As screening and treatment of BV in asymptomatic women with a vaginal Gram stain score &gt;=7 is not recommended and would not be a realistic intervention for scale up in this setting, the findings point to the need for a trial comparing menstrual cups to no menstrual cups to determine whether the menstrual cup alone is a beneficial intervention. The finding in the paper is interesting, but the authors are over-selling it as a definitive study showing the benefit of menstrual cups - this paper doesn't do that. As it stands, the abstract, author summary, first paragraph of the discussion, and conclusion, in addition to most of the body text, obscure rather than illuminate what the study really examined, what it can teach us, and what it cannot.</p>
              <p>Major Comments:</p>
              <p>1) On lines 207-208, and again on lines 433-434, the authors explain that girls with a Nugent score of 7-10 were treated due to lack of correlation of reported symptoms with BV. The statement that symptoms don't correlate with Gram stain score is true, but irrelevant, since treatment in this situation is not recommended. This should be removed.</p>
              <p>2) Throughout the paper, including abstract, author statement, and body text, the authors should make it clear what the actual intervention and control conditions were, rather than trying to obscure this and use a single statement in the limitations. Understanding this study design issue is critical to understanding the results - and the need for a definitive trial of cup vs. no cup.</p>

Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
