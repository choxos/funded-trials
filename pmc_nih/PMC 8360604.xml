                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Global mortality attributable to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurs in more than 36 million people annually with 80% of these deaths occurring in resource limited countries. Among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA) studies have reported higher prevalence’s of NCDs compared to the general population but most studies do report a narrow range of NCDs commonly hypertension, diabetes and neoplasms and not all. In addition, there is limited reporting, integration of systematic screening and treatment for all NCDs among PLHA attending care, suggesting the NCD burden among PLHA is likely an underestimate. Little is known about factors facilitating or hindering integration of the care and treatment of NCDs within HIV care and treatment clinics (CTCs) in Tanzania.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To explore the perceptions of PLHA and health workers on factors facilitate or hinder the recognition and integration of care for NCDs within CTCs in Dar es Salaam.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec003">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Inductive content analysis of transcripts from 41 in-depth interviews were conducted with 5 CTC managers (CTC Managers), 9 healthcare providers (DHCP) and 27 people living with HIV (PLHA) attending CTCs and with co-morbid NCDs.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Four themes emerged; the current situation of services available for care and treatment of NCDs among PLHA in CTCs, experiences of PLHA with co-morbid NCDs with access to care and treatment services for NCDs, facilitators of integrating care and treatment of NCDs within CTCs and perceived barriers for accessing and integration of care and treatment of NCDs within CTCs.</p>

                <sec id="sec005">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>There was a positive attitude among PLHA and healthcare workers towards integration of NCD services within CTC services. This was enhanced by perceived benefits inherent to the services. Factors hindering integration of NCD care and services included; limited and inconsistent supplies such as screening equipment, medications; insufficient awareness of NCDs within PLHA; lack of adequate training of healthcare workers on management of NCD and treatment costs and payment systems.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) kill more than 36 million people each year with 80% of these deaths occurring in resource limited countries [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Data published in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], shows that the NCDs are becoming a significant cause of poor health globally, including in resource limited countries, except sub-Saharan Africa, where NCDs are second to the disease burden of HIV/AIDS. A large proportion of reported NCD deaths and chronic illnesses are reported to be caused by cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and metabolic and digestive disorders such as diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Among people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA) in LMICs, the prevalence of NCDs is higher (range 29%-44%) compared to that in the general population (15%-25%) [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, limited reporting and integration of systematic screening and treatment for NCDs using standard guidelines at primary care levels of health services occurs in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; the NCD burden is thus likely to be underestimated among PLHA. In health care settings in Kenya the prevalence of NCDs among PLHA is reported as 11.5% with hypertension being the most common; however the diagnosis and recording of identified persons with hypertension in patients’ records was as low as 4.9% [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, cervical cancer, depression, and diabetes in PLHA in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, showed estimates (or range) of 21.1%; 1.3%-1.7%; 24.4% and 1.3–1.8% respectively. The estimated rates for risk factors of NCD such as low high-density lipoproteins (52.3%), hypertriglyceridemia (27.2%), obesity 7.8% and elevated low-density (23.2%) were also reported [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of the less frequently diagnosed neurocognitive impairment (NCI) among PLWHA in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) may be higher than expected; a systematic review shows prevalence of NCIs among PLHA from seven SSA countries was 6.5 times higher in PLHA compared to in persons without HIV [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The same study showed reduction in NCI prevalence, before (43%), compared to six months after (30%) initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) initiation [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These evidences suggest an importance of screening and managing NCDs within care and treatment services provided for PLHA.</p>
              <p>Over the past several decades, improvements in health care have led to a decrease in mortality in both the general population and persons living with HIV and AIDS [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and an increase in life expectancy in resource limited countries [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, are particular health burdens for resource limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; very limited data are available on the epidemiology, natural history and pathogenesis of co-morbid NCDs in the contexts of care for these infectious diseases.</p>
              <p>Similar to other LMIC, a very limited number of studies have explored the burden of NCD among PLHA in Tanzania. Amongst PLHA in urban Tanzania the prevalence of hypertension (high blood pressure, defined as a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and diabetes (defined according to WHO criteria) was 26%and 4.2% respectively [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Furthermore, with regard to NCDs burden it is important to consider factors that facilitate or hinder integration of HIV care services within CTC. A literature review conducted by Haregu et al. looking into policies and models for NCD integration within HIV clinics revealed evidence related to diseases progress, clinical, and management issues [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this study the author identified models of integration centered to Problem, People, Process and Patient [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another study conducted in African countries identified a limited model in Tanzania for integration in the Reproductive Child Health Clinics among women who present for cervical cancer screening. In this Model 1 represented NCD services integrated into centers originally providing HIV care where by women who tested positive were referred to CTC [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>This study will be the first in Tanzania to describe from the perspectives of PLHA and health care providers the perceptions on factors facilitate or hinder the recognition and integration of care for NCDs within CTCs in Dar es Salaam.</p>

                <title>Observations</title>
                <p>A 5 days an announced onsite check-list guided observation (1 day per site) at the 5 CTCs was conducted by MDH CQI nurses from different districts. The observation was done for the 1<sup>st</sup> 20–40 patients who arrived at CTCs for routine care.</p>
                <p>A total of 130 PLHA were observed for the 5 CTCs. The nurses observed their NCD screening services they received during the visit as well as checked on the pharmacy for the availability of NCD medications. Each site was observed by a CQI nurse from a different district nurse.</p>
                <sec id="sec009">
                  <title>Study design</title>
                  <p>We conducted a descriptive qualitative study which included in-depth interviews and onsite checklist guided observation, in order to obtain a better understanding of the perspectives of PLHA and health care workers on the integration of care for non-communicable diseases within HIV care services. We used purposive sampling to select experienced CTC direct health care providers (DHCP), CTC managers and PLHA who were documented to have a co-morbid NCD, who would be most knowledgeable about NCD services in CTCs and be able to contribute key information to inform our study objectives. We selected and interviewed 27 PLHA, nine DHCP, and five CTC managers.</p>

                  <title>Data collection tools</title>
                  <p>Semi-structured interview guides were developed to collect information from PLHA, DHCP and CTC manager participants. We prepared In-depth interview guides based on current literature on the recognition and integration of care for NCDs within CTC. The guides comprised of open-ended questions and probes were developed by the first author and shared to research assistants for increasing the depth of the information provided. The inputs given were incorporated for improvement. Piloting of the tools were done among other PLHA not included in this study to explore their experiences with NCDs services (screening, diagnosis treatment) and factors facilitate or hinder integration of care within CTC. This gave us insight on the truly perspectives on NCD integrations and so helped to formulate more relevant questions. The guides also probed for capacity of health care workers to care for PLHA experience when providing NCD services for PLHA within the context of CTCs and sought recommendations for improving the integration of NCDs services within CTCs. Interview guides were modified depending on the new information emerged during data collection and analysis. Observations were also conducted in each of the five study sites by experienced and trained health care quality improvement nurses not linked to the CTC. The observation check list collected information on NCD screening tests done in routine CTC visit, and availability of/stock of NCD drugs at CTCs.</p>

                  <title>Study setting</title>
                  <p>The study was conducted in 5 large CTCs located within the five district referral hospitals in Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania. The selected CTCs served a district wide catchment, and serves a large population of PLHA defined as providing services for 120 to 200 PLHA per day. The site selections allowed for attaining the desired sample within the study time, as well as inclusion of a diverse sample of study participants from across all the five districts of the Dar es Salaam region. We recruited adults PLHA with co-existing NCD (aged 18 years and above) who were enrolled and receiving ART services and health care workers (DHCP) who are directly involved in providing routine HIV care and treatment services at CTCs including nurses and doctors and who had been working in CTC for a minimum of 3 months.</p>
                  <p>This study excluded PLHA aged less than 18 years, too ill to participate in the IDI, newly employed CTC managers and DHCP. Socio-demographic information including, age and gender, were collected from all types of informants, while for DHCPs and CTC managers, information was also collected on their qualifications, job titles, and duration of providing health care services since graduating as health professionals.</p>

                  <title>Data collection procedures</title>
                  <p>Data collection was done with six (6) research assistants who received a refresh training on qualitative data collection. The research assistants had a mix of pre-graduate diplomas in health and social science para professional field (n = 3) postgraduate degree in Public health (n = 1) and undergraduate degrees in the social sciences or Law (n = 2) fields. All RAs also were up to date on research ethics certification (FHI360 certification course). All RAs had prior experiences collecting qualitative data. For this study the training of RAs was overseen by (HST, SH, SM. and MG). The gender distribution of RAs was five female and one male. A saturation point was reached when a total of forty-one (41) interviews were conducted. Twenty-seven (27) interviews with PLHA, 9 DHCP and 5 CTC managers which lasted about 50, 40 and 35 minutes respectively. None of the RAs had contact with the participants before conducting the first interview. Permission to audio-record interviews was requested and all participants agreed to interviews being recorded. All interviews were conducted within the facilities and measures taken to ensure privacy and that informed written consent was provided by all study participants. Upon completion of each field data collection session for both the in-depth interviews and the observations, narrative data transcription was done on the same day sent to the central study team which included the study PI and co-investigators. All audio-records of the data were uploaded to password protected computers to which the PI and co-investigator’s had access, and this provided an additional layer of quality assurance that transcripts were reflective verbatim of each interview session. Feedback sessions with interviewers also discussed probing skills for gaining greater understanding of the meaning behind participant responses to ensure improvements in depth of information provided in subsequent interviews. All interviews were conducted in Swahili.</p>

                  <title>Data analysis</title>
                  <p>Data coding was done using the NVIVO software version 8 [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Coding refers to the breaking down of narrative data into small units of words called codes [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We analyzed the qualitative data based on a content thematic approach [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where by, firstly the transcripts were read several times to obtain a sense of a whole and identifying the meaning units. That means the short sections of the transcripts seems to be meaningful and that relate to our research questions and objectives. Secondly the formulated meaning units were then condensed in short summary forms as indicated by Graneheim and Lundman [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as condensed meaning units. Thirdly the condensed meaning units, codes were abstracted further and developed codes and preliminary groups, categories were developed. Then categories which refer high level of abstraction and still indicate the manifest of transcripts. Lastly the constant comparison between categories and the rest of the material themes were constructed and reflected the latent content of the text (Graneheim and Lundman [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Coding was conducted with the Kiswahili transcripts to remain close to the text. Codes were then translated into English to develop categories and themes. All the researchers are native Swahili speakers. See <xref rid="pone.0254436.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for more clarification.</p>

                <p>A total of 130 PLHA were observed from the 5 CTCs. Each site was observed by a continuous quality improvement (CQI) nurse from a different district. Weight is the most commonly measured parameter for all the PLHA during routine CTC visits; and is assessed in all patients regardless of the type of visit (new patients or follow up patient). However, none of CTCs assessed height consistently or estimated the BMI for PLHA observed. Heights are taken for patients who are seen for the first time only and none used the height results to calculate and estimate BMI during our observation. None of the CTCs conducted clinic based random blood sugar tests during our observation. Only one out of the five hospitals routinely measured patients of blood pressures but only when the patient was suspected by the clinician to have an elevated blood pressure.</p>

                  <title>Theme 1: Current situation of availability of care and treatment services for NCDs among PLHA in CTCs</title>
                  <p>This theme included one category of referrals from CTCs to NCD clinics outside the CTC or CTC staff providing prescriptions for NCD medications to be purchased by patients. From the accounts of DHCPs, a substantial number of PLHA with co-morbid NCDs were attended at CTCs, however care and treatment for their NCDs was not provided within the CTCs as narrated by a DHCP in the following quote, <italic toggle="yes">“We receive many patients with hypertension here at the CTC</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">about 30 patients per week or roughly 7–8 patients a day but we don’t provide care for NCDs here</italic> (at the CTC)<italic toggle="yes">” (DHCP F</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">41 years)</italic>.</p>
                  <p>The practices of making patient referrals to NCD clinics outside the CTC or writing prescriptions for NCDs medications at the CTC for patients to purchase was a subtheme indicating how CTCs address the challenge of managing PLHAs with co-morbid NCDs. Both DHCP and CTC managers admitted that treatment services for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were not available at CTCs, but were offered from separate NCD clinics which are located either within the same hospital or in other public hospitals. At times a prescription is written at the CTC for patients to purchase NCD medications outside the clinic as exemplified by the following quotation; “<italic toggle="yes">Yes</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Here</italic> (at CTC) <italic toggle="yes">we screen for NCDs</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Once we discover a patient with hypertension</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we refer them to the NCD clinic within this hospital or at times at other hospitals</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">so they attend a different clinic depending on the NCD for their NCD management for instance at the hypertension or the diabetes clinic” (DHCP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">25 years)</italic>. The system used in the CTCs to refer patients with NCDs for services was described as strong because it was based on the type and severity of the NCDs PLHA presented with. DHCPs narrated how the referral system works, and I quote:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“Yes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">our referral system is good</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We either refer</italic> (PLHA) <italic toggle="yes">to the specialist or physician depending on their diagnosis and the severity of the NCD</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">If it happens that they</italic> (PLHA) <italic toggle="yes">come here when the condition (NCD) is already severe we refer them to specialists at the Muhimbili National Hospital</italic>.

                  <title>Theme 2: Experiences with accessing care and treatment services for NCDs of PLHA with co-morbid NCDs</title>
                  <p>This theme covered four categories that focus on accessing care for NCDs a) within the same hospital where a CTC is located, b) a hospital outside the hospital where the CTC is located, c) using self-care practices and d) from centers close to home. These forms of access to NCD care were described to be practiced for various reasons, including convenience and to minimize costs; faith as well as religious beliefs were used by PLHA who cannot afford the costs of their NCD care. These participant attitudes towards their NCD care were influenced by their individual experiences and life situations. In this theme the PLHAs shared their experiences of using allopathic or alternative health systems for treatment of their NCDs.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Accessing care for NCDs within the same hospital where a CTC is located</italic>. The majority of PLHA participants stated that NCD services are offered outside the CTC. Even when the diagnosis of the NCD was made at the CTCs they would be transferred to specific NCD clinics within the facility for their NCD care as demonstrated by the following quote:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>
                      <italic toggle="yes">“At the CTC clinic they said I have to be treated at a different place, not the CTC but at another NCD clinic in the hospital or at any other hospital, because at the CTC they only deal with the ARVs (Patient, F, 52 years)</italic>
                    </p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Accessing NCD treatment from a hospital external to the one where the CTC is located</italic>. In some cases, participants accessed NCD services at a facility that was external to the hospital in which their CTC is located and to some PLHA. When this was reported, PLHA found this to be acceptable, mainly because the NCD services they were referred to were offered at no cost to them. The measures that CTC staff take to seek affordable NCD services for PLHA with NCD comorbidities is illustrated in the following quote:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“<italic toggle="yes">I received a call from a nurse who works at my CTC in Temeke and she instructed me to go to the Hindu Mandal Hospital</italic> (A private hospital) <italic toggle="yes">where I received treatment for my high blood pressure for free</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Until now I haven’t paid anything although I am getting good services there</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">The problem is the distance</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but the care is free</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">That’s fair</italic> (Patient, F, 52 years)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Referrals would also be made to public hospitals with specialized services, whereby referral to a secondary level hospital may lead to referral to a tertiary level hospital; requiring several steps in negotiating access to NCD services on the part of the patient as noted in the following quotation:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>
                      <italic toggle="yes">“It was a long time ago when I started the treatment of ARVs at the CTC. I was not feeling okay and felt pain in the shoulder and breast. Then I was advised to go for testing at Mwananyamala and I was referred to Muhimbili after getting the results. Then I was told my heart had expanded and I started attending the clinic there. The doctor wrote laboratory test that I should do (Patient, F, 65 years)”</italic>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Self-care and attending for NCD care at nearby centers close to home for convenience and to minimize costs</italic>. Patients used several strategies to ensure some access to NCD services given available resources. For example, to minimize transport costs, many patients reported relying on accessing facilities close to home and making decisions themselves about medication use for managing there NCDs. These strategies often circumvent the need for the more expensive close monitoring of treatment progress as elaborated by the following quotations.</p>
                  <disp-quote>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Faith and religious beliefs used by PLHA who cannot afford the costs for their NCD care</italic>. PLHA with co-morbid NCDs with inability to afford NCDs treatment costs described their dependency on God as a cure for the NCD as narrated in the following example:</p>

                  <title>Theme 3: Factors that could potentially facilitate the integration of NCD care in CTCs</title>
                  <p>Two categories were included in the third theme. These describe potential enablers of NCD integration like the availability of national guidelines on management of NCDs among PLHA in CTCs and the positive attitudes of DHCP about integrating NCDs within CTC clinics.</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Availability of national guidelines on management of NCDs in PLHA at CTCs</italic>. The DHCP from the CTCs mentioned that they have the national guidelines which help them in providing NCD services accordingly as elaborated in the following quote;</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“We are using the guidelines from the Ministry of Health; everything is explained there on how to manage different NCDs among PLHA</italic>. (DHCP, F, 41 years)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Positive attitudes of DHCP about integrating NCDs within CTC clinics</italic>. The DHCP and CTC managers felt the need to integrate NCD care within CTC services for reasons based on their experiences with the current lack of integrated care. They noted the advantages to patients in terms of their time, reduced challenges related to navigating their NCD care at different clinics/locations, and reduced out of pocket costs for their NCD care, which unlike ART services is not fully subsidized by the government. These sentiments of providers of CTC managers and DHCP are exemplified by the following quotes:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>“<italic toggle="yes">if we can offer NCD services</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">patients will receive treatment for two conditions in one place</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It will also help in reducing costs to patients</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">if NCD services will be offered for free</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">You know currently</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">if the patient does not have money to pay for services provided at the NCD clinic</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they are not provided with services for free</italic>. (DHCP, F, 28 years)</p>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“If NCD and HIV services were to be provided under one roof</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it would decrease the stress to the patient of moving from clinic to clinic</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Also</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it will increase adherence to care because as they move from clinic to clinic</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they get tired and even decide not to attend the NCD clinic</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">At times they</italic> (patients) <italic toggle="yes">have reported to us that after attending their CTC clinic for ART</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">when they then go to NCD clinics they find the clinic working hours have ended and clinics already closed</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">thus they miss the NCD services</italic> (on the day of referral)” (DHCP, F, 39 years)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Another CTC manager also explained, “<italic toggle="yes">In fact</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it would be better to integrate NCD care into CTC services to reduce the hassle for patients</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We get a patient who tells you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">“doctor please hurry up</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I want to go to my NCD clinic today I have a diabetes clinic</italic> (to attend). <italic toggle="yes">If we were to have diabetes tests here and if we were able to check their blood pressure here</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">then they would be treated right here and we would be able to monitor their progress</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">except for those who perhaps have complex conditions that would need referral to specialists</italic> (CTC Manager, F, 51 years)</p>

                  <title>Theme 4: Perceived barriers to the provision of integrated services for PLHA with co-morbid NCDs within CTCs</title>
                  <p>Eight categories were included in the fourth theme. These were barriers described as potential hindrances to integrating NCD care within CTCs by direct health care providers (DHCP) and CTC managers including; a) resource limitations b) both absence and inconsistency in supplies, c) lack of priority given to recognition and treatment of NCDs in CTCs, d) missing electronic payment systems for NCD care in CTCs e) long distances travelled by patients to access care and f) need for NCD recognition and g) NCD treatment refresher course as well as h) ongoing staff training:</p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Resources limitations in terms of medication stocking</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">data documentation systems and availability of screening tools for NCD care within CTCs</italic>. The hospital systems are not currently designed to facilitate management of NCDs within CTCs. Hospitals do stock NCD medications but do not allocate to CTCs, nor do continuous medical education programmes include regularly training and supporting CTC staff to provide NCD care, as exemplified by the following quotations:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>
                      <italic toggle="yes">“There is no medicine for treating NCDs at the CTCs therefore you may find a patient who is living with HIV and also suffering from high blood pressure or diabetes but cannot get service at the CTC for these co-morbidities and must schedule another time to attend the NCD clinic because that’s how the hospital is structured, (CTC Manager, F, 37 years)</italic>
                    </p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Limited and inconsistent supplies for existing NCD screening instruments in CTCs</italic>. CTC managers noted that though some NCD screening tools were available in their CTCs, there was inconsistent availability of supplies necessary to use these tools. These common challenges, are exemplified by the following quotations, “<italic toggle="yes">Yes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">instruments like BP machines</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">blood sugar testing machines</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Yah</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we have them</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">We have weighing scales as well</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">The biggest challenge is inconsistent supplies for us to be able to use them</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">for example accessing blood sugar testing strips and machine is a problem here</italic>., <italic toggle="yes">CTC Manager</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">50 years)</italic></p>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Less priority given to NCD care at CTCs and less awareness of PLHA about NCDs</italic>. The CTC managers felt that patients and DHCP at CTCs expect services available at CTCs to only be the provision of a narrow range of HIV care and ARV treatments for PLHA. Other diseases are not looked upon as a priority by both DHCP and patients as narrated by one DHCP in the following quotation, “<italic toggle="yes">I think NCDs are not given priority here</italic> [at CTC] <italic toggle="yes">and even the patients we treat do not give priority to their NCDs care they tend to demand more of the ARVs refill services than care for their NCDs</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">It is simply because the CTCs do not prioritize such diseases and there is nothing special</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we (DHCP) are doing to ensure PLHA understand and demand for NCDs services here</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">Even if screening services for hypertension and random glucose are available it is easy for PLHA to just collect their ARVs without noticing that such services exist</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">(DHCP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">36 years)</italic></p>
                  <p>This DHCP quotes, is supported by PLHA descriptions of their challenges of not knowing about their NCDs such as hypertension, how it is treated as well as how to access NCD care. When medications are given to them, they may not have clarity about what medication should be used for what condition. This is exemplified by these concerned patient’s quotes:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>
                      <italic toggle="yes">“Mmhm! Firstly, for us PLHA with high blood pressure, we do not understand the blood pressure medications, they (DHCP) mix our medications and do not tell us what medication treats what, they just prescribe them silently and they (DHCP) do not help to make us understand better we just take them. At times friends will tell us those don’t work, use this other one. You see and we are not sure what to do. We need them to tell us more. (Patient, F, 60 years)</italic>
                    </p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Lack of regular training of CTC HCP on NCDs management</italic>. A DHCP mentioned that, it’s a long time since they received NCD management training, and when they did, it was a short training course. She felt a need for refresher training courses for providers as noted in the following quotation:</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes">“I manage NCD patients using the knowledge I got from college</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">As I told you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I am an assistant medical officer so I was taught in college… this is not enough; it is good we get updates because it has been a while since I went to school and treatments have changed</italic>.

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">Treatment costs for NCDs may be prohibitive</italic>. The DHCPs noted that costs for NCD care are currently a major challenge for many PLHA with co-morbid NCDs. They expressed a concern that currently, at the NCD clinics, diagnosis and treatment is expensive; in addition to a registration fee, patients pay for laboratory and other investigation costs, as well as for treatment.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Key findings of narrative data from all participants are presented in four themes including; the current situation of services available for care and treatment of NCDs among PLHA in CTCs; experiences of PLHA with co-morbid NCDs in accessing services for NCDs; potential facilitators for NCDs integrated services within CTCs and perceived barriers for accessing and integrating NCD services within CTCs. Most participants noted the limited presence of NCD integrated services within HIV CTCs, and all expressed a need for integrating diagnosis and treatment of NCDs within CTCs. Some authors have outlined the importance of bundling HIV and NCD services within HIV CTC including having adequate treatment adherence supports for improved quality of life, close monitoring of biomarkers that may be predictive of the development of NCDs and provision of psychosocial supports Haregu et al. (2015) [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The WHO, through its health system straightening programme, also highlights a number of benefits associated with integrated NCD services in HIV care and treatment service platforms, including improved health and longevity and reductions in the NCDs burden through early screening and treatment [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our findings show PLHA with co-morbid NCDs, experience the current model of access to NCD services as occurring outside the HIV services platform. This approach may risk poor continuity of care and patient progress, as well as patient time constraints when navigating between and within the NCD and HIV service platforms, especially in facilities that do not house both these service platforms. Most patient participant narratives indicated a need for NCD treatments within CTC, and awareness of the advantages of such integration for their health and wellbeing. Studies show that if NCDs are diagnosed early, there is a greater opportunity for reducing NCD associated complications [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This may only be possible if resources at CTCs allow for routine NCD screening, diagnosis, treatments and related documentation. According to the UNAIDS Second Meeting of the WHO Global Coordination Mechanism, integrated NCD services on HIV service platforms can result into better screening, treatment and cure for NCDs [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Tanzania Strategic and Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCD 2016–2020 has highlighted the importance of shifting from curative to prevention and control measure [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This can only be achieved through clearer guidelines for comprehensive routine screening, diagnosis and early treatment on relevant health services platforms.</p>
              <p>A number of factors that may facilitate integration of NCD services with in CTC emerged from the narrative data, ranging from the availability of national guidelines for the management of NCDs among PLHA to positive attitudes among PLHA and DHCP towards integrated services. The availability of guidelines for the management of major NCDs in in primary health care facilities in African countries is low and only reported at 17% [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is similar to healthcare’s narrations in the interviews where they acknowledged the availability of guidelines for the management of major NCD such as hypertension and diabetes, while routine screening being behind. The positive attitudes among PLHA and DHCP participants towards integration of NCD services within CTC were in part a result of the perceived advantages in terms of perceived reduction in PLHA time when utilizing health services and the potential for them reducing out-of-pocket health care costs.</p>
              <p>Among the reported factors that may hinder integration of NCD within CTC were: Resource limitations in terms of medication stocking for treatment of NCDs, access to NCD data documentation systems and availability of screening tools and point of care aids for NCD care within CTCs. Similar findings on limited or no NCD medical products or supplies in HIV health care services have been reported by Lamptey P., et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both the observation checklist and healthcare provider accounts suggested either limited or inconsistent supplies for screening of existing NCDs in CTCs. This was also reported by Mpondo et al. [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], where authors questioned the level of preparedness for NCD diagnosis and treatment in lower level public hospitals. We also found that continuing medical education offered to CTC staff did not include screening, diagnosis and management of co-morbid NCDs, reported by DHCP informants. Poor training of staffs for NCD management has also been reported by other research teams in Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0254436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Other structural factors such as treatment costs and hospital payment systems may also hamper integration of NCD care within CTC services. Our findings show that while |CTC services for PLHA are currently provided at no costs to patients (i.e., fully subsidized by the government), facilitating access to and affordability of services to the user. However, this is not the case for NCD services, and the Tanzania Strategic and Action Plan for Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) 2016–2020, highlights lack of funding as a major implementation challenge [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The absence of fully subsidized NCD services, is evidenced by the existence of a reported cost-share system, where patients are expected to pay out-off pocket expenses as contributions for some NCD services they receive, for example medications and laboratory investigations. The Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013–2020 stipulates a need for support at a national level to enable access to NCD drugs, as an approach for the prevention of heart attacks and stroke [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Future studies in Tanzania may need to explore more cost-effective ways of purchasing NCD drugs (e.g. bulk purchase) [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and conducting routine NCD relevant laboratory investigations (e.g. use of high through put laboratory equipment) [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study strengths</title>
                <p>This study provides an overview of the experiences of PLHA, healthcare providers and CTC managers and direct health care providers in the integration of NCD services within the HIV treatment services platform and the barriers and potential facilitators of such integration. Inductive content analysis of transcripts with the support of illustrative quotations from study participants provide a better understanding of the current integration status and barriers to implementation that perhaps need to be addressed. Analysis of narrative information derived from three different types of informant strengthens the validity of the study findings [<xref rid="pone.0254436.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p>The use of the data from the five large CTC in Dar es Salaam may not have been a representative of the all PLHA, as CTCs with lower patient volume, may have used alternative strategies to support PLHA with NCD co-morbidity. However, the findings do provide a general overview on the experiences of the majority of PLHA with NCD co-morbidities, their attitudes towards integrating HIV and NCD services, and perceived barriers to such integration of services platform. Conducting IDs interviews at the clinic settings, where the participants receive their care/services may have also influenced them towards giving socially acceptable answers to the interview questions. The researchers mitigated this bias by asking open-ended questions, so that to make participants respond in a way that is not socially desirable.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>There was a positive attitude among PLHA and healthcare workers towards integration of NCD services within CTC. This was attributed by the perceived benefits associated with the integration of NCD services under one clinic, i.e. NCD services for individuals who are known to have NCD prefers to receive the care with in CTC where they receive their ART services, however the series were no rooved within the CTC. Due to financial challenges PLHA to access transport, they have decided to receive their services at the nearby health care facilities. However, there were number of factors which may impede NCD integration care and services including; limited and inconsistent supplies such as screening equipment, medications; insufficient awareness of NCD within PLHA; lack of adequate training to healthcare workers on management of NCD and treatment costs and payment system.</p>

              <title>Recommendations</title>
              <p>Integration of NCD care and services with in CTC is very important approach in order to curb the morbidity and mortality related to NCD complications. Government and stakeholders jointly deal with the challenges which hinders integration of NCD care and services within CTC so that screening and management of NCDs among PLHA’s opportunity are not missed.</p>

              </p>
              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: N/A</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>

              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Thanks for considering PLOS ONE for your submission.</p>
              <p>I have noted points that I would like to share about your submitted work:</p>
              <p>1. The submission contains many writing mistakes (typos, sentence structure issues e.g. run on sentences) (I recommend using english writing aid tools), consistency would help (checklist was written in many different ways)</p>
              <p>2. The short title is still long I recommend making it shorter</p>
              <p>3. Key words need to be revised and modified to facilitate the chance of locating your work if it gets published</p>
              <p>4. I do not agree with including too many subheadings/subtitles as you have done with every section in introduction, try to provide coherent paragraphs , instead.</p>
              <p>5. Providing numbers for lines would have made my job and yours easier to track my comments.</p>
              <p>6. The second sentence in third paragraph in the introduction needs a reference.</p>
              <p>7. The ART abbreviation was not defined at first mention</p>
              <p>8. Regarding study design, I did not find the primary assumptions from authors. I think this would raise the issue of personal bias while producing useful data from study participants, which may lead to biased hypothesis representing the phenomenon of interest.</p>
              <p>9. I think some of your eligibility and exclusion criteria are redundant.</p>
              <p>10. Both sections of sampling approach and study settings include same information (redundant)</p>
              <p>11. I recommend that you include further details about the development of the guide of semistructured interviews.</p>
              <p>12. Data analysis section includes some of the results , and it lacks the inductive content analysis process of analysis. More details describing the analysis is needed to show the link between extracted data and your reported results.</p>
              <p>13. I recommend that you include further details about the open coding/grouping steps and category creation and abstraction processes.</p>
              <p>14. I would like to see better organization by providing a conceptual model with your identified categories to give a meaningful sense of describing the selected phenomenon to increase readers understanding and help in generating knowledge.</p>
              <p>15. I would suggest to provide names or headings of higher order categories given your driven content characteristic words.</p>
              <p>16. Providing Tables/figures including well labeled sub-categories and generic categories and main categories would be helpful</p>
              <p>Thank you</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting qualitative study that aimed to explore the perceptions of HIV patients and healthcare workers on facilitators or barriers of the recognition and integration of care for non-communicable diseases within treatment clinics.</p>
              <p>Overall, the paper is well written however, it a bit lengthy and both the introduction and the methods can be reduced.</p>
              <p>- I enjoyed how the authors narrated the quotes in the results, however, I cannot see the benefit from table 3. It would be easier to limit the examples on themes in one place. I prefer to keep them in the results section and take out table 3.</p>
              <p>- i recommend to move Onsite checklist-based observation findings to the prior to the results of thematic analysis.</p>

              <p> I have visited the link for guidance and now files meet the requirements of the PLOS ONE’s style </p>
              <p>When reporting the results of qualitative research, we suggest consulting the COREQ guidelines: <ext-link xlink:href="http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349" ext-link-type="uri">http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349</ext-link>. In this case, please consider including more information on the number of interviewers, their training and characteristics; and please provide the interview guide used. </p>
              <p>Research assistants were trained. The research assistants had a mix of pre-graduate diplomas in health and social science para professional field (n=3) postgraduate degree in Public health (n=1) and undergraduate degrees in the social sciences or Law (n=2) fields. All RAs also were up to date on research ethics certification (FHI360 certification course). Find attached interview guides in the supplementary files. See Page 7.</p>
              <p>In the Methods section, please provide additional information regarding the interview guide development process, including the theories or frameworks which were employed. </p>
              <p>Information regarding development of interview guide has been added including framework. See Page 5-6</p>
              <p>Please include in your Methods section (or in Supplementary Information files) the participating hospitals/institutions. </p>
              <p>We have added…five major CTC namely,</p>

              <p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p>
              <p>Comments to the Author </p>
              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes </p>
              <p>Thank you for our comment, we have now improved more on conclusion to make it appropriately based on the data presented in the manuscript. See page 24</p>
              <p>(Thank you for the comment)</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: N/A</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: N/A </p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No </p>
              <p>All interviews transcripts and checklists have been provided in the supplementary files.</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes </p>
              <p>Thank you for the comment, the manuscript now has been reviewed with professional language reviewer and grammatical errors have been checked and corrected) See page 1 to the end</p>
              <p>(Thank you for the compliment)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1 Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>Thanks for considering PLOS ONE for your submission.</p>
              <p>I have noted points that I would like to share about your submitted work:</p>
              <p>1. The submission contains many writing mistakes (typos, sentence structure issues e.g. run on sentences) (I recommend using English writing aid tools), consistency would help (checklist was written in many different ways). </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment, we have now sent the work to language reviewer and now the typos, sentence structures and use of English aid writing tools have been used to support writing) See page 1 to the end (1-27)</p>
              <p>2.The short title is still long I recommend making it shorter. Thank you for the comment, we have now made a shorter title and make it shorter. Now it reads as" Factors Hindering Integration of Care for Non-Communicable Diseases within CTCs"</p>
              <p>3. Key words need to be revised and modified to facilitate the chance of locating your work if it gets published Thank you for the comment. We have now modified and revised the key words and now it reads Integration, Non-Communicable Disease, Qualitative, Tanzania, PLHA, Clinic and Treatment Centre, Hypertension, Diabetes.</p>
              <p>4. I do not agree with including too many subheadings/subtitles as you have done with every section in introduction, try to provide coherent paragraphs, instead. </p>
              <p>Thank you for the comment we have now reduced the subtitles in every section and provided coherent paragraphs. The retained subtitles are for helping a reader to follow through See pages 1 to end (1-27)</p>
              <p>5. Providing numbers for lines would have made my job and yours easier to track my comments.</p>
              <p>(Thank you for the comment, we have now inserted line numbers to make our job easier. See page 1 to the end)</p>
              <p>6. The second sentence in third paragraph in the introduction needs a reference </p>
              <p>Reference inserted. See Page 3-4</p>
              <p>7. The ART abbreviation was not defined at first mention </p>
              <p>Thank you for the comment, we have now defined the ART abbreviation when first mentioned. See page 4)</p>
              <p>8. Regarding study design, I did not find the primary assumptions from authors. I think this would raise the issue of personal bias while producing useful data from study participants, which may lead to biased hypothesis representing the phenomenon of interest. </p>
              <p>Thank you for the comment, we have now added a sentence…We prepared In-depth interview guides based on current literature on the recognition and integration of care for NCDs within CTC and trustworthiness section as an assumption to show authenticity of the design and quality of data. See page 10</p>
              <p>9. I think some of your eligibility and exclusion criteria are redundant. Removed…in the targeted 5 district referral hospital</p>
              <p>Removed....and facility/ CTC heads also known as CTC in charge.</p>
              <p>Removed… who were not receiving ART</p>
              <p>Deleted or did not provide signed informed consent as well as PLHA newly enrolled to </p>
              <p>Deleted. those not directly involved with caring for PLHA and newly employed</p>
              <p>We have merged this section into Study setting as per COREQ checklist See Page 6.</p>
              <p>10. Both sections of sampling approach and study settings include same information (redundant). Thank you for the comment we have now removed sampling approach section and we have recasted study settings section to be more focus and avoid redundancy. See Page 6-7.</p>
              <p>11. I recommend that you include further details about the development of the guide of semi structured interviews. Thank you for the comment, we have now added section data collection tools and we have included information on the development of the interview guide. Refer page 5-6</p>
              <p>12. Data analysis section includes some of the results, and it lacks the inductive content analysis process of analysis. More details describing the analysis is needed to show the link between extracted data and your reported results. Thank you for the comment, we have now recasted the data analysis section and put more description of analysis showing the link between the extracted data analysis and reported results) See page 8</p>
              <p>13. I recommend that you include further details about the open coding/grouping steps and category creation and abstraction processes (Thank you for the comment, we have now recasted the data analysis section and put more description of analysis showing the link between the extracted data and analysis and reported results and put example of analysis See Table 1) See page 8 where the changes of analysis section has been done</p>
              <p>14. I would like to see better organisation by providing a conceptual model with your identified categories to give a meaningful sense of describing the selected phenomenon to increase readers understanding and help in generating knowledge. </p>
              <p>Conceptual model has been included. See uploaded figure 1</p>
              <p>15. I would suggest to provide names or headings of higher order categories given your driven content characteristic words. (We have decided to provide themes which is more of abstraction level from the analysis we therefore suggest for maintaining those headings) See page 12-20.</p>
              <p>16. Providing Tables/figures including well labeled sub-categories and generic categories and main categories would be helpful.</p>
              <p>We have formulated a table showing some of the theme and categories (Refer Table 1) and figure of summary of results. See page 8 &amp; 12</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2 Overall, the paper is well written however, it a bit lengthy and both the introduction and the methods can be reduced. We have reduced some of the repeating quotes and merged some of the subtitle</p>
              <p>We now have 27 pages from 35 pages </p>
              <p>I enjoyed how the authors narrated the quotes in the results, however, I cannot see the benefit from table 3. It would be easier to limit the examples on themes in one place. I prefer to keep them in the results section and take out table </p>
              <p>We have removed Table 3 in the results section. See page 9</p>
              <p>i recommend to move Onsite checklist-based observation findings to the prior to the results of thematic analysis. </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment</p>
              <p>We have now moved Onsite checklist-based observation findings before IDIs results. See Page 9 &amp; 10</p>
              <p>in table 1: I am not sure if you are meant to say "hypertension" instead of "hypotension"</p>
              <p>The word hypotension has been changed to hypertension. Please check Table 2. See page 10</p>
              <p>in table 1: please check the (%) they do not add up for example: </p>
              <p>Male 4(14.8%)</p>
              <p>Female 23(85.1%)</p>
              <p>total is not 100%</p>
              <p>same for</p>
              <p>Business 16(59.2%)</p>
              <p>Employed 1(3.7%)</p>
              <p>Unemployed 10(37.0%) Checked and corrected</p>
              <p>Male 4(14.8%)</p>
              <p>Female 23(85.2%)</p>
              <p>Business 16(59.3%)</p>
              <p>Employed 1(3.7%)</p>
              <p>Unemployed 10(37.0%)</p>
              <p>See Page 10</p>
              <p>in table 1: ulcers! what kind of ulcers? Ulcers represent all types of ulcers See page 10</p>
              <p>I am not sure if table 4 is needed, the summarized results in the Onsite checklist-based observation findings in the results section can be sufficient. </p>
              <p>We have removed table 4 (Refer page 26 &amp; 27)</p>
              <p>Limitations: there are more limitations to be discussed related to the use of qualitative analyses. </p>
              <p>Thank you for this comment</p>
              <p>We have now added another limitation related to study setting.. Conducting IDs interviews at the clinic settings, where the participants receive their care/services may have also influenced them towards giving socially acceptable answers to the interview questions. The researchers mitigated this bias by asking open-ended questions, so that to make participants respond in a way that is not socially desirable. See page 23 &amp; 24</p>
              <p>there are few grammatical errors such as " what facilitates or hinder" We have checked for grammatical errors See page 1 to end (27).</p>

              <p>2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
