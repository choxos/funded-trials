                <p id="Par1">In a prior study, topiramate reduced heavy drinking among individuals who sought to reduce their drinking, with the effect moderated by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2832407) in <italic>GRIK1</italic>, which encodes the kainate GluK1 receptor subunit (Kranzler et al. 2014). The present study sought to replicate prospectively the effect of topiramate and rs2832407 in patients with DSM-5 alcohol use disorder (AUD) who sought to reduce or stop their drinking. We stratified the randomization on genotype (rs2832407*C-allele homozygotes vs. A-allele carriers) and assigned 170 European-American participants (71.2% male) to receive 12 weeks of treatment with topiramate (<italic>N</italic>  = 85), at a maximal daily dosage of 200 mg, or matching placebo (<italic>N</italic> = 85). At each of nine treatment visits participants received brief counseling to reduce drinking and increase abstinent days. We hypothesized that topiramate-treated patients with the rs2832407*CC genotype would reduce heavy drinking days (HDDs) more than the other three groups. The rate of treatment completion was 91.8% in both groups. The mean number of HDDs per week in the placebo group was 1.67 (95% CI = (1.29, 2.16), <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) times greater than in the topiramate group, which was confirmed by the topiramate group’s significantly greater reduction in the concentration of the liver enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase and lower alcohol-related problems score. There was no significant difference in topiramate’s effect on HDDs between genotype groups. Although consistent with other studies showing a reduction in heavy drinking with topiramate treatment, the prior finding of a moderating effect of rs2832407 genotype was not replicated in this prospective trial.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Heavy drinking is common in the United States: in 2018, 6.6% of adults reported heavy alcohol use (consuming five or more drinks for males or four or more drinks for females on five or more days during the preceding month) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. From 2006 to 2010, there were ~88,000 annual alcohol-associated deaths in the US, 9.8% of all US deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite these risks, only a small fraction of heavy drinkers in the population receive any kind of alcohol treatment, with medications particularly underutilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">One of the medications that has been studied for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) is topiramate. In the most comprehensive meta-analysis of effects of topiramate on alcohol consumption to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the drug was associated with clinically significant effects (Hedges <italic>g</italic> &gt; 0.4) on promoting abstinence and reducing heavy drinking and smaller effects (Hedges <italic>g</italic> &gt; 0.3) on reducing γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) concentration and alcohol craving.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Topiramate is an antagonist of kainate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], where it is most potent and selective for receptors containing the GluK1 subunit (encoded by <italic>GRIK1)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <italic>GRIK1</italic> to the risk of alcohol dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Of the seven SNPs examined only rs2832407, a C-to-A non-coding substitution, was significantly associated with alcohol dependence. In a subsequent randomized, controlled trial (RCT), we found that individuals homozygous for the rs2832407*C allele reduced their heavy drinking significantly more than A-allele carriers treated with topiramate or placebo-treated subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], though in that study the randomization was not stratified by genotype.</p>
              <p id="Par5">To validate both the pharmacogenetic findings and the efficacy of the 200 mg/d dosage, we conducted an RCT in a larger sample using a prospective pharmacogenetic design, in which C-allele homozygotes and A-allele carriers were randomized separately to receive topiramate or placebo for 12 weeks of treatment. We hypothesized that topiramate-treated patients would show a greater reduction in heavy drinking days (HDDs) than the placebo group and that rs2832407 would moderate this effect.</p>

                <title>Overview</title>
                <p id="Par6">The study was a parallel-groups, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate in heavy drinkers, all of whom received medical management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a brief psychosocial intervention weekly for the first six weeks and then biweekly for six weeks. Patients were randomly assigned equally to treatment groups by staff who were not involved in providing treatment, using a random allocation stratified on rs2832407 genotype provided by the statistician. Double-blind treatment conditions were maintained throughout the study. Raters were trained in the reliable use of all assessments. The study included a 2-week pre-treatment assessment period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 1-week medication taper period.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p id="Par7">Inclusion criteria were age 18–70; self-identified European ancestry; a weekly average of ≥24 standard drinks (men) or ≥18 standard drinks (women), which exceed empirically-based moderate drinking limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; a current DSM-5 diagnosis of AUD; a goal of either stopping drinking or reducing their drinking; ability to read English minimally at an 8<sup>th</sup> grade level; no gross evidence of cognitive impairment; and willingness to provide written, informed consent to participate and to name someone who could be contacted to locate the patient if he or she could not be reached. In addition, women of childbearing potential had to be nonlactating, practicing a reliable method of birth control, and provide a negative urine pregnancy test at the screening and randomization visits.</p>
                <p id="Par8">Prospective patients were excluded based on the presence of a current, clinically significant physical disease or abnormality on medical history, physical examination, or routine laboratory evaluation; a history of nephrolithiasis, glaucoma, or hypersensitivity to topiramate; treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors or dolutegravir; a serious psychiatric illness (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe or psychotic major depression, panic disorder, borderline or antisocial personality disorder, organic mood or mental disorders, eating disorder, or imminent suicide or violence risk) or current treatment with a psychotropic medication or one aimed at reducing drinking; a current DSM-IV diagnosis of non-nicotine drug dependence; a urine drug screen positive for opioids, cocaine, benzodiazepine, barbiturates, or amphetamines; or a clinical presentation that was judged by a physician to require abstinence from alcohol for safety reasons (e.g., current gastritis, a recent or past history of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms).</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="Par9">The study was conducted from December 29, 2014 through August 1, 2019 at the University of Pennsylvania Treatment Research Center (Penn; <italic>n</italic> = 164) and the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center (CMCVAMC; <italic>n</italic> = 6), which corresponded to the duration of funding. The institutional review board at each site approved the study protocol. Patients gave written informed consent to participate and were paid to complete research assessments and return study medication bottles for capsule counts.</p>
                <p id="Par10">At Penn, subjects were recruited through media advertisements and at the CMCVAMC through clinician referrals and the screening of medical records. All potentially eligible participants underwent an initial 20-min telephone screening interview. Eligible candidates were seen for an in-person visit, where they gave written, informed consent to participate and underwent a medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, a urine drug screen, and pregnancy testing and gave a blood sample for DNA extraction and genotyping.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Using data from our prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we estimated that a sample size of 188 would provide power &gt;0.80 for a two-sided test at <italic>α</italic> = 0.05. We screened 320 prospective participants in person and randomly assigned 170 (121 men, 71.2%) to treatment with topiramate or placebo. A CONSORT diagram (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) shows the reasons that 150 potential participants were excluded.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Prior to randomization, patients completed questionnaires and research interviews administered by a trained research evaluator. A study physician reviewed the study design and potential adverse events with all patients and answered any questions that they had. A nurse then delivered the first medical management session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and dispensed study medication. A separate block randomization scheme at each of the two sites balanced the medication groups within strata defined by genotype group (CC vs. AA/AC) and treatment goal (Reduce vs. Abstain), and these variables were included as factors in all analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Following treatment initiation, patients were seen weekly for six weeks to gradually increase the dosage of medication, followed by three biweekly treatment visits. At each visit, we measured the patient’s breath alcohol concentration, weight, and vital signs; patients completed questionnaires; and the nurse elicited information on concurrent medications, emergent adverse events, and protocol adherence, and delivered the medical management intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients were also interviewed to assess their drinking and medication usage since the last visit and the nurse compared self-reported adherence to the number of capsules returned, seeking to resolve any discrepancies with the patient. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, patients again completed questionnaires and were interviewed by the research nurse, the research evaluator, and the study physician.</p>

The initial session, which lasted 45 min, included a review of the results of the initial evaluation, A Guide to Sensible Drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the rationale for pharmacotherapy. Subsequent sessions lasted 20–30 min, at which the nurse assessed the patient’s drinking and medication adherence through capsule counts and made recommendations on both. Based on guidelines for non-hazardous drinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], men were advised to consume no more than three standard drinks per day and 12 standard drinks per week and women no more than two drinks per day and eight drinks per week. Patients whose goal was abstinence were counseled to avoid drinking completely. We audiotaped sessions and reviewed a sample of them and provided feedback to the three nurses to ensure consistency in their delivery of the counseling.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par42">In this study, we replicated the finding that topiramate at a maximal daily dosage of 200 mg is efficacious in reducing heavy drinking in patients seeking either to reduce their drinking or become abstinent from alcohol. Findings for both GGT concentration, a biomarker of heavy drinking, and the Short Index of Problems score, which measures alcohol-related problems, corroborated the self-reported drinking data. The effects of topiramate in the present study were similar to those reported by us in our previous placebo-controlled trial of topiramate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and of a magnitude similar to the effect size in a meta-analysis of topiramate treatment trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In contrast to a key finding in our prior study, however, here the moderating effect of rs2832407 on topiramate’s efficacy, although in the hypothesized direction, was not statistically significant. Despite the absence of a pharmacogenetic effect, there was a reduction in the topiramate group of 1–2 HDDs/week. This effect was about 50% greater than in the placebo group and is clinically important, as the frequency of heavy drinking is correlated with a variety of alcohol-related negative consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, the findings reported here support the use of topiramate as a first-line treatment for AUD.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Based on these findings, it is possible that the pharmacogenetic effect seen in the prior study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was due to chance. The selection of a single SNP as a potential moderator was based on its association with AUD in a large case-control study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, the SNP has not been identified in any genome-wide association studies of AUD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], suggesting that the initial finding may have been spurious. Of note, however, is that the moderating effect of rs2832407 in the present study though not statistically significant, was in the hypothesized direction, raising the possibility that the effect size in the initial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] was overestimated and the current study was underpowered to detect it. In this event, a larger study could show a significant interaction effect. A potential effect supporting this interpretation was seen when we repeated the analyses using a 3-level genotype variable, which yielded a non-significant, trend-level moderating effect on topiramate’s reduction of HDDs. However, randomization in the study was stratified by A/A + A/C versus C/C genotypes, so the comparisons of topiramate within the three-level genotype variable are not protected by randomization.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Although treatment response is partially genetically determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], it is a complex trait and thus is influenced by multiple genetic variants of small effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Despite evidence that statistical power is enhanced in the study of treatment‐relevant variants relative to disease-related ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], it may be unduly optimistic to expect that a single, non-coding SNP could serve clinically as a moderator of treatment response, particularly if the effect is a pharmacodynamic one. Pharmacokinetic effects of single gene variants, particularly gene deletions and duplications, on both treatment outcome and adverse effects, have been observed, for example in treating major depression with an antidepressant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, these variants are structural, often involving the deletion or duplication of a gene, and are more readily linked to metabolic effects on drug exposure than non-coding SNPs such as rs2832407.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Future efforts to identify genetic moderators of pharmacotherapy response in AUD should focus on genome-wide analyses. Because such efforts require large samples of patients treated with a specific medication, the time and expense for which can be prohibitive, an electronic health record approach may be required. Such an approach was used to examine the effects of gabapentin on alcohol consumption using repeated measurements of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This approach could be paired with genome-wide genotype data in a sample such as that in the Million Veteran Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to identify variants, which could be tested individually or as polygenic risk scores in prospective RCTs.</p>
