                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Chagas disease, caused by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is endemic in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US and Europe. We have shown TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 antigens elicit protective immunity to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in mice and dogs. Herein, we investigated antigenicity of the recombinant proteins in humans to determine their potential utility for the development of next generation diagnostics for screening of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and Chagas disease.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and Results</title>
                  <p>Sera samples from inhabitants of the endemic areas of Argentina-Bolivia and Mexico-Guatemala were analyzed in 1<sup>st</sup>-phase for anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> antibody response by traditional serology tests; and in 2<sup>nd</sup>-phase for antibody response to the recombinant antigens (individually or mixed) by an ELISA. We noted similar antibody response to candidate antigens in sera samples from inhabitants of Argentina and Mexico (n = 175). The IgG antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 (individually) and TcG<sub>mix</sub> were present in 62–71%, 65–78% and 72–82%, and 89–93% of the subjects, respectively, identified to be seropositive by traditional serology. Recombinant TcG1- (93.6%), TcG2- (96%), TcG4- (94.6%) and TcG<sub>mix</sub>- (98%) based ELISA exhibited significantly higher specificity compared to that noted for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigote-based ELISA (77.8%) in diagnosing <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-infection and avoiding cross-reactivity to <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. No significant correlation was noted in the sera levels of antibody response and clinical severity of Chagas disease in seropositive subjects.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>

                <p>Chagas disease is the most common cause of congestive heart failure related deaths among young adults in the endemic areas of South and Central America and Mexico. Diagnosis and treatment of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection has remained difficult and challenging after 100 years of its identification. In &gt;95% of human cases, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection remains undiagnosed until several years later when chronic evolution of progressive disease results in clinical symptoms associated with cardiac damage. Diagnosis generally depends on the measurement of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>–specific antibodies that can result in false positives. A conclusive diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection thus often requires multiple serological tests, in combination with epidemiological data and clinical symptoms. In this study, we investigated the antibody response to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 in clinically characterized chagasic patients. These antigens were identified as vaccine candidates and shown to elicit protective immunity to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and Chagas disease in experimental animals. Our data show the serology test developed using the TcG<sub>mix</sub> (multiplex ELISA) is a significantly better alternative to epimastigote extracts currently used in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> serodiagnosis or the trypomastigote lysate used in this study for comparison purposes.</p>

              <p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, transmitted by blood-sucking triatomines, causes Chagas disease, which is a health threat for an estimated 10 million people, living mostly in Latin America. More than 25 million people are at risk of the disease <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Schmunis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Increasing travel and immigration has also brought <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection into non-endemic countries, e.g., the U.S., Spain and Australia, where natural transmission is absent or very low. The congenital and transfusion- or organ transplantation-related transmissions are becoming recognized as significant threats in recent decades <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Munoz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Diagnosis and treatment of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection has remained difficult and challenging after 100 years of its identification. This is because the acute infection, in general produces mild clinical symptoms, e.g., fever, dyspnea, local swelling at the site of infection, that are infrequently reported <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Machado1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As a result, acute exposure when detection of blood parasitemia and treatment is possible, remain largely unnoticed. Only those who develop severe acute myocarditis or when an outbreak of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection occurs may receive early diagnosis and therapeutic treatment <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Rassi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>
<xref rid="pntd.0002018-Nagajyothi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In &gt;95% of human cases, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection remains undiagnosed until several years later when chronic evolution of progressive disease results in clinical symptoms associated with cardiac damage. A conclusive diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection then often requires multiple serological tests, in combination with epidemiological data and clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, after complicated diagnosis, no vaccines or therapies are available to treat the chronically infected individuals.</p>
              <p>We have, previously, employed an unbiased computational/bioinformatics approach for screening the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> sequence database and identification of potential vaccine candidates <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A strategic analysis of the sequence database led to selection of 71 candidates that were unique to <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Of these, eight candidates (TcG1, TcG2, TcG3, TcG4, TcG5, TcG6, TcG7, and TcG8) were selected for their ability to induce agglutinating antibody response in mice <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Further studies indicated TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 were maximally immunogenic because these were recognized by IgGs in infected mice and dogs (reviewed in <xref rid="pntd.0002018-VazquezChagoyan1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>), by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in infected mice <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and elicited type I cytokines (e.g. IFN-γ) in mice and dogs <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Immunization with candidate antigens as a DNA vaccine provided a degree of protective immunity (TcG2 = TcG4&gt;TcG1) that substantially controlled acute parasitemia after challenge infection in mice and dogs <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-AparicioBurgos1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The delivery of candidate antigens as heterologous prime/boost vaccines further enhanced the protective efficacy, evidenced by &gt;80% control of acute parasitemia and tissue parasite burden and associated inflammation in heart and skeletal tissue <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In this study, we investigated the antibody response to the three candidate antigens (TcG1, TcG2, TcG4) in clinically characterized chagasic patients. Our objectives were to evaluate the antigenicity of the candidate antigens in humans and determine their utility in generation of improved diagnostics for screening of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and disease. Our data demonstrate that the candidate antigens are recognized by antibody responses in chagasic patients from two distinct study sites where diverse strains of the circulating parasites were reported. Further, a multiplex assay consisting of the mixture of the three antigens was highly sensitive and specific in diagnosing <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in human patients.</p>

                <p>Human sera samples used in this study were obtained from Salta Argentina (located at the border of Bolivia) and Chiapas Mexico (located on the border of Guatemala) that are known to be endemic for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission and human infection. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Universidad Nacional de Salta (UNSa), Argentina, and the Universidad Autónoma de Chiapas, Mexico. All sera samples obtained for the study were analyzed for <italic>T. cruzi-</italic>specific antibodies by commercially available kits. Those positive by ≥ two tests were considered seropositive (+ve) and those negative for these tests were considered as seronegative (−ve). All samples were decoded and de-identified before they were provided for research purposes. Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.</p>
                <p>In Argentina, all individuals were clinically characterized, and venous blood samples were collected to obtain plasma or serum. Clinical data included medical history, physical examination and subjective complaint of frequency and severity of exertional dyspnea, electrocardiography (12-lead at rest and 3-lead with exercise) to reveal cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities and transthoracic echocardiogram to obtain objective information regarding the left ventricular (LV) contractile function. Chest X-ray was used to assess cardiomegaly (cardio-thoracic ratio&gt;0.5). Seronegative and physically healthy subjects exhibiting no history or clinical symptoms of heart disease were used as controls. Seropositive chagasic patients were classified according to clinical exam as follows: Group 0: no echocardiography abnormalities, no left ventricular dilatations, and ≥70% ejection fraction (EF) indicating preserved systolic function, Group I: negligible to minor EKG alterations, EF: 55–70%, no indication of heart involvement; Group II: a degree of heart involvement with systolic dysfunction (EF: 40–55%); and Group III: moderate to severe systolic dysfunction (EF≤40%), left ventricular dilatation (diastolic diameter ≥57 mm), and/or potential signs of congestive heart failure.</p>
                <p>In Mexico, human sera samples were collected within the framework of a research project on emerging zoonotic diseases conducted jointly by several institutions, including Chiapas State University (UNACH), Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), Chiapas Health Institute (ISECH) and UTMB at Galveston <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Dhiman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

                <p>Based upon the above analysis, we created sera pools for 2<sup>nd</sup> phase screening. Briefly, from Chiapas Mexico, a seropositive pool (n = 65) and a seronegative pool (n = 34) was included in the 2<sup>nd</sup> phase. From Salta Argentina, sera and plasma samples collected in year 2009 (seropositive, n = 65; seronegative, n = 20) and year 2010 (seropositive, n = 45; seronegative, n = 20) were included. All blood samples positive for <italic>T. cruzi-specific</italic> antibodies from Salta Argentina were analyzed for <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection by two PCR approaches. Briefly, total DNA was extracted from blood samples with a phenol-chloroform mixture, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 20 µl of TE buffer. A PCR reaction was performed using 1 µl isolated DNA with primer pairs (<named-content content-type="gene">5′-GTGGGGGAGGGGCGT-TCT-3′</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5′-ATTTTACACCAACCCCCAGTT-3</named-content>) that specifically amplify 120 base pair product from the conserved region of <italic>Leishmania</italic> kDNA <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Barrio1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

                <p>To evaluate the specificity of the TcG1-, TcG2-, and TcG4-based diagnostic ELISA, sera samples from volunteer donors from Galveston TX, Buenos Aires Argentina, and Toluca Mexico with no history of residence in the endemic areas, and were healthy (n = 42, true negative controls) or exhibited cardiomyopathy of other etiologies (n = 20) were included in the study. Seronegative/cardiomyopathy patients were identified based clinical exam, and blood levels of NT-proBNP to be &gt;2000 pg/ml (normal&lt;450 pg/ml). To examine the cross-reactivity of antigen-based assay, sera samples from subjects living in Salta Argentina, and diagnosed for <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection (n = 35) or certain autoimmune diseases (n = 15) were also included in the study. Patients were diagnosed for leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucocutaneous or visceral) based upon three criteria (smears and lesions, Montenegro reaction, epidemiology and clinical demonstration) as described in <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Marco1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and further identified to be positive for <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection by kDNA-specific PCR and PS-PCR approaches, as above.

                <p>Sera samples were analyzed for IgG antibody levels by using TcG1-, TcG2-, TcG4-based ELISA. Recombinant TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 proteins were purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The nucleotide sequences of TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 antigens have previously been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers AY727914, AY727915 and AY727917, respectively <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The cDNAs encoding TcG1 (1–166 amino acids), TcG2 (1–220 amino acids), and TcG4 (1–92 amino acids) were cloned in pCR2.1 T/A vector, and then sub-cloned in to pET-22b plasmid (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) such that the encoded proteins were in-frame with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. All cloned sequences were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing at the Recombinant DNA Core Facility at UTMB. The pET22b plasmids containing TcG1, TcG2 or TcG4 were transformed in <italic>BL21</italic> (DE3) pLysS competent cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and recombinant proteins purified using the polyhistidine fusion peptide metal chelation chromatography system (Novagen) <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. After purification, proteins were dialyzed to remove contaminant particles, and endotoxins, and stored at −80°C till further use.

Plates were blocked for 2 h at 37°C with 200-µl/well of 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in PBS, washed with PBS-0.05%Tween-20 (PBST) twice, and PBS once, and then incubated for 2 h with test sera (100-µl/well) added in triplicate in 2-fold dilutions. Plates were then washed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 100-µl/well of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-human IgG (1∶5000 dilution in PBST-1% NFDM), and color was developed for 5 min with 100 µl/well of Sure Blue TMB substrate (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories). The colorimetric reaction was stopped with 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and absorbance measured at 450 nm using SpectraMax M5 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).</p>
                <p>The sensitivity of the antigen-based ELISA (2<sup>nd</sup> phase) was determined by calculating the percentage of chagasic samples that exhibited reactivity with recombinant proteins out of the total samples previously categorized as seropositive based on 1<sup>st</sup> phase screening with commercially available kits. The data from antigen-based ELISA analysis of sera samples from healthy individuals, other cardiomyopathy and leshmaniasis patients was utilized to calculate the specificity of the assay as follows: [ number of sera samples analyzed – number of sera samples that exhibited false positive reaction or cross-reactivity with TcG1, TcG2 or TcG4/number of sera samples analyzed] ×100.</p>

              <p>To proceed with sample analysis, we optimized ELISA components by cross-titration, using a pool of known positive and negative controls (1∶20–1∶1600 dilutions). The optimal sera and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody dilutions providing maximum signal-to-noise ratio were determined to be 1∶50 and 1∶5,000, respectively, and used in all further investigations.

              <p>We, first, monitored the antigenicity of TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 using sera samples collected from volunteers enrolled in the study in Argentina in year 2010. Samples were stored at −80°C just after collection, and thawed when utilized. The negative sera samples (n = 20) from the endemic area near Argentina-Bolivia border exhibited low reactivity for TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4, similar to that noted for confirmed negative controls (n = 42) from non-endemic areas (TcG1: 0.216±0.035 versus 0.211±0.048, TcG2: 0.240±0.04 versus 0.230±0.044, TcG4: 0.225±0.041 versus 0.252±0.038, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD). In comparison, a 4-fold, 2.75-fold, and 2.65-fold increase in sera levels of antibody response to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4, respectively, was noted in previously characterized seropositive subjects (n = 45) from Argentina-Bolivia border (TcG1: 0.81±0.33, TcG2: 0.66±0.20, TcG4: 0.57±0.09, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD, p&lt;0.001 for all, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g001">Fig. 1.A–C</xref>). The sera levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 were above the mean<sub>seronegative</sub> level in 62.2%, 66.6% and 75.5% of the 1<sup>st</sup>-phase seropositive subjects. When analyzing plasma samples from the same individuals, we noted a 3.34-fold, 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold increase in plasma levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 in seropositive subjects as compared to seronegative controls (TcG1: 0.77±0.21 versus 0.20±0.05, TcG2: 0.65±0.12 versus 0.21±0.057, TcG4: 0.67±0.09 versus 0.20±0.048, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD, p&lt;0.001 for all, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g001">Fig. 1.D–F</xref>). The plasma levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 were above the mean<sub>seronegative</sub> levels in 71.1%, 77.7% and 80% of the 1<sup>st</sup>-phase seropositive subjects. These data suggested that a) TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 are recognized by antibody responses elicited in human patients infected by <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, and b) both plasma and sera samples can be utilized to monitor the antibody response.</p>

                  <p>Sera (A–C) and plasma (D–I) samples obtained in year 2010 (A–F) and year 2009 (G–I) from volunteers in Salta Argentina were identified as seropositive (+ve) or seronegative (−ve) in 1<sup>st</sup>-phase screening by using conventional approaches. The 2<sup>nd</sup>-phase screening for antigen-specific antibody response was conducted by an ELISA using the recombinant TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 proteins. Data (mean of four observations from each sample) are presented as box plot. The horizontal lines of the box (bottom to top) depict the lower quartile (Q1, cuts off lowest 25% of the data), median (Q2, middle value), and upper quartile (Q3, cuts off the highest 25% of the data). The lower and upper whiskers depict the smallest and largest non-outlier observations, respectively, and solid dots represent the outliers. The spacing between the different parts of the box indicates the degree of dispersion (spread). Standard deviation for all samples was &lt;12%.</p>

              <p>We then analyzed the plasma samples that were collected in 2009, and characterized as seropositive (n = 65) and seronegative (n = 20) by 1<sup>st</sup>-phase serology tests. These samples were subjected to two cycles of freezing/thawing during the two-year storage. Our data showed a 6.72-fold, 2.4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in plasma levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 in seropositive subjects as compared to seronegative controls (TcG1: 1.66±0.55 versus 0.204±0.05, TcG2: 0.69±0.13 versus 0.239±0.039, TcG4: 0.75±0.20 versus 0.227±0.05, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD, p&lt;0.001 for all, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g001">Fig. 1.G–I</xref>). The plasma levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 were above the mean<sub>seronegative</sub> level in 61.5%, 64.6% and 81.5% of the seropositive subjects. These results suggest that antibody response to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 is stable, and field samples can be utilized to examine antigenicity of the selected candidates in large-scale population studies. Overall, the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g001">Fig. 1</xref> also indicate that TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 are expressed by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates circulating in the endemic areas at the Argentina-Bolivia border.</p>
              <p>It is important to know if antibody recognition of the three antigens can be expanded for diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in other countries where different isolates are suggested to be present in domestic and sylvatic cycle of parasite circulation. For example, in Argentina and neighboring countries in South America, TCII isolates are predominantly identified in peripheral blood of seropositive patients, though molecular studies have revealed the presence of TCI parasites also in heart biopsies of chronic chagasic patients <xref rid="pntd.0002018-delPuerto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Diez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Montamat1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

We, therefore, monitored the antigenicity of TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 in human sera samples from Mexico-Guatemala border area that were characterized as seropositive (n = 65) and seronegative (n = 34) by 1<sup>st</sup>-phase serology tests. Our data showed 6.72-fold, 2.4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in sera levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 in seropositive samples as compared to that noted in seronegative healthy controls (TcG1: 0.7±0.25 versus 0.211±0.047, TcG2: 0.64±0.22 versus 0.25±0.05, TcG4: 0.65±0.20 versus 0.212±0.048, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD, p&lt;0.001 for all, seropositive versus seronegative, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The sera levels of antibodies to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 were above the mean<sub>seronegative</sub> level in 69.2%, 76.9% and 72.3% of the seropositive subjects from Mexico. These data demonstrate that TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 are antigenic, and recognized by antibody responses in chagasic patients from Mexico, and suggest that the three antigens are expressed by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates circulating in Mexico-Guatemala border area.</p>

              <p>Five of the 110 seropositive/chagasic subjects from Argentina exhibited reactivity for <italic>Leishmaina</italic>-specific antibodies and were likely infected with both pathogens. To examine if the antigen-based ELISA is specific for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> detection, we performed recombinant antigens-specific ELISA using the sera samples from non-chagasic individuals (total 112), including leishmaniasis patients (n = 35), volunteer donors with cardiomyopathy (n = 20) and autoimmune diseases (n = 15) of other etiologies, and healthy donors from non-endemic areas (n = 42), and calculated the specificity of the antigen-based ELISA. Sera samples from leishmaniasis patients (n = 35) exhibited very low reactivity for TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4, similar to that noted for sera samples from confirmed negative controls from non-endemic areas (TcG1: 0.18±0.04 versus 0.21±0.048, TcG2: 0.15±0.06 versus 0.230±0.044, TcG4: 0.232±0.05 versus 0.252±0.038, expressed as mean absorbance ± SD). Likewise, sera samples from patients exhibiting symptoms of cardiomyopathy of non-chagasic etiology or autoimmune diseases showed reactivity to TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 below the cut-off threshold values derived from healthy/seronegative controls. The specificity for TcG<sub>mix</sub> was highest (98%), followed by TcG2 (96%), TcG4 (94.6%), TcG1 (93.6%) and TcTL (77.8%), determined by detection of false positive signal for 2, 4, 6, 7 and 25 of the samples, respectively, out of the total 112 samples from non-chagasic individuals that were submitted for antigen- and TcTL-based ELISA. These data indicated that the recombinant antigens were highly specific for the detection of anti-<italic>T.cruzi</italic> antibodies than the whole parasite (trypomastigote) lysate, and exhibited no cross-reactivity to <italic>Leishmania</italic>-specific antibodies.</p>
              <p>Pearson correlation analysis was employed to identify correlation between antigen-specific antibody response and disease state including the data derived from seronegative/healthy controls and seropositive/chagasic subjects. For this, seronegative/healthy subjects were labeled as 0, and patients classified as 0, I, II and III (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref>) were labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Antibody response was titrated using 2-fold sera dilutions (1∶50–1∶1600). We observed no significant correlation between the anti-TcG2, anti-TcG4, anti-TcG<sub>mix</sub> and anti-TcTL antibody titration curves and clinical disease category in any of the patient population (data not shown). The representative correlation data from sera levels of anti-TcG<sub>mix</sub> and anti-TcTL antibody response (1∶50 dilutions) and clinical disease category for the clinically characterized Argentine patients enrolled in the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g005">Fig. 5</xref>. It is worth noting that TcG<sub>mix</sub>-specific antibodies exhibited a clear downward trend with patients' disease severity, indicating that presence of antibodies for TcG1, TcG2, and TcG4 is protective during progressive Chagas disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). No clear trend or correlation was observed for TcTL specific antibody response and disease severity in any of the patient population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Serological diagnosis of Chagas disease is frequently based on tests such as enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIAs), indirect immunofluorescence assays, and indirect haemagglutination assays (IHAs). Most of these serological tests, including one recently licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use as a blood screening test in the U.S. <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Tobler1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, use crude or semi-purified <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigote forms as the antigen, the stage that is present in insects but not in infected humans. Overall, the current diagnostics fail to provide a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, requiring use of multiple tests for diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref rid="pntd.0002018-World1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Further, most of the currently available kits produce questionable results when used for donors with low titers <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Ribeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The absence of a true gold standard makes it difficult for the medical practitioners to provide proper treatment as not all cases are properly identified and treatment response cannot be accurately monitored. Accordingly, World Health Organization has emphasized the need to employ defined antigens for improved serodiagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection <xref rid="pntd.0002018-World2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, before an antigen can be used for diagnostics, several criteria should be met: (i) the selected candidate antigen(s) should be expressed in isolates circulating in different areas of endemicity, (ii) antigens should be highly immunogenic in populations with different genetic background, (iii) they should be absent from other pathogens to prevent cross-reactivity, and (iv) easily expressed and purified from traditional protein expression systems (e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>) to ensure reproducibility and quality control <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gomes1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Because of the complexity involved in antigen selection and testing, limited progress has been made towards the development of antigen-based kits for the diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
              <p>Keeping the above guidelines in mind, we believe that TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 are ideal candidates for the development of diagnostic assays. One, these antigens were previously shown to be expressed in infective and intracellular forms of clinically relevant multiple isolates of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Two, the small size of the three antigens (TcG1: 18.4 kDa, TcG2: 24 kDa, TcG4: 10 kDa) allows reproducible high-yield purification of the proteins from <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.5–1.0 g/L) and is amenable to large-scale production. Three, the presence of multiple 12-mer B cell epitopes of high specificity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002018-t002">Table 2</xref>) suggests that these antigens will be immunogenic, recognized by B cells of the immune system, and elicit antibody response. Indeed, we have found that TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 are recognized by antibodies elicited in infected dogs and mice <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-AparicioBurgos1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The diagnostic potential of the three antigens in humans was evident from our analysis of a panel of sera or plasma from chronic chagasic patients from Argentina-Bolivia and Mexico-Guatemala border areas. <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains of lineages TCV (IId), TCII (IIb) and TCI were identified in seropositive chagasic patients from Argentina/Bolivia (Patricio Diosque and Monge Rumi, personal communication), and of lineage TCI in seropositive subjects from Mexico/Guatemala (unpublished results). Others have documented the predominance of TCII isolates in peripheral blood of seropositive patients from South America <xref rid="pntd.0002018-delPuerto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Diez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Montamat1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and TCI in Mexico and Guatemala <xref rid="pntd.0002018-RuizSanchez1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bosseno1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, our data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g001">Figs.1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0002018-g004">4</xref> suggest the diagnostic kit developed using TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 will be useful in identifying <italic>T. cruzi</italic> circulation and transmission in South, Central and North America.</p>

              <p>It is important to note that TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4, when used individually, exhibited 93.6–96% specificity in detecting anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> antibody response that was in the range for other recombinant proteins (e.g. TSSA, CP1 and CP2) proposed for Chagas disease immunodiagnosis <xref rid="pntd.0002018-DeMarchi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Camussone1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, 98% specificity of the TcG<sub>mix</sub>-based ELISA was much higher than that observed for single antigens in this study or other recombinant antigens in other reports <xref rid="pntd.0002018-DeMarchi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Umezawa1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Further, TcG<sub>mix</sub> specificity at 98% was significantly better than that observed with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigote-based ELISA (77.8%) that is not desirable because culturing of human-infective form of the pathogen requires special facilities, technology, and expertise.</p>
              <p>Another major concern that is generally not taken into consideration when one is using serological tests for Chagas disease is the potential frequency of cross-reactivity. In some areas of endemicity in Central America and Brazil, where <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and the nonpathogenic protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma rangeli</italic> can be found infecting the same vectors and vertebrate hosts, cross-reactivity has been proposed to contribute to miscalculated higher percentage of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission and misdiagnosis of patients may have severe health-related and economic consequences <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Araujo1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Camargo1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Others have documented the crude antigen-based serodiagnostic kits exhibit cross-reactivity between sera of patients infected with <italic>T. cruzi</italic> and sera of patients infected with <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Passos1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Salles1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In our study, homology searches suggested that only TcG1 is similar to a ribosomal protein of other trypanosomes (&gt;90% identical) while TcG2 and TcG4 exhibited no clear paralog in the public databases (Fig.S1). Thus, to rule out the possibility of cross-reactivity with <italic>Leishmania</italic>, we have screened sera samples from confirmed leishmaniasis patients for antibody cross-reactivity to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4. Our data clearly showed that the three antigens exhibited no cross-reactivity to antibodies generated in cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis patients, providing evidence that the antibody response to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 was solely directed by exposure to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection.</p>
              <p>Finally, TcG<sub>mix</sub>-ELISA performed at a higher potency in discriminating weakly positive samples from background, demonstrated statistically by calculating the quotient of measured optical density values divided by the cutoff values. Only 12 of all the seropositive samples had a quotient smaller than 2.0 in the TcG<sub>mix</sub>-ELISA whereas TcG1-, TcG2- TcG4 and TcTL-based ELISA resulted in 18, 16, 14 and 16 samples below the mean value. This potency will facilitate diagnosis because weakly positive results routinely need to be confirmed by alternative assays. Thus, based upon high sensitivity (93%) and specificity (98%) to sera from chagasic patients from different endemic countries, we surmise that TcG<sub>mix</sub>-based ELISA can serve as a single assay to determine the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> status of a given blood sample, and diagnose Chagas disease. We plan to further standardize the assay for large-scale screening and establishing the prototype assay for commercial use of the selected antigens for diagnostic kits.</p>
              <p>The immune interactions necessary to eradicate <italic>T. cruzi</italic> parasites are extremely complex and require both humoral and cell-mediated components of the immune system. Previous experimental studies and a few studies in humans indicate that antibodies are able to kill <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in the presence of phagocytic cells, such as macrophages. Others have shown in B cell knockout mice or mice depleted of B cell function, the pivotal role of antibody molecules in attaining resistance to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and Chagas disease (reviewed in <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Krautz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>). In this study, the mean antibody response to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 (individually or in combination) exhibited a downward trend in correlation to clinical disease severity suggesting that antibody response to the candidate antigens was protective, though further studies with larger patient population will be required to validate the significance of this observation. The experimental data indicating the up regulation of IgG1 antibodies specific to TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-AparicioBurgos1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> suggest that isotypes related to up regulation of opsonization, cell dependent cytotoxicity and activation of classical complement pathway are elicited by the candidate antigens, and might be present in significant levels in seropositive/chagasic individuals. Considering that the three antigens have been shown to be located on plasma membrane of trypomastigote/amastigote stages of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> by flow cytometry <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, we predict that these will be available as a target to antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity effector mechanisms mediated by IgG1. Indeed, TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 have been shown to elicit potent trypanolytic antibodies in accordance with the intensity of the surface expression of these antigens in infective and intracellular stages (as compared to eight others tested in similar experiments) <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Bhatia1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition to IgG1, candidate antigens elicited IgG2b known to drive the type 1 adaptive immunity in experimental mice and dogs <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-AparicioBurgos1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. High levels of candidate antigens-induced IgG2b in vaccinated mice were linked to complement-dependent trypanolytic activity <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Patients in the indeterminate phase display higher levels of lytic antibodies compared with patients with chagasic heart disease indicating an association between the presence of lytic antibodies and a protective response in chronic patients <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Antas1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Cordeiro1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This was also evidenced by absence of lytic antibodies in patients treated with anti-parasite drugs that displayed negative hemocultures for over ten years <xref rid="pntd.0002018-Galvao1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Based upon these observations, we consider that activation of IgG2a (along with IgG1) will be an important attribute that contributes to host protection against <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and Chagas disease when TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 will be tested as vaccine candidates in humans.</p>
              <p>In summary, this is the first report identifying the antigenicity of TcG1, TcG2 and TcG4 in humans. We have concluded that the three candidate antigens are recognized by IgGs in sera samples of seropositive/chagasic patients. Further, the candidate antigens were represented in diverse strains of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> as the sera samples from two different endemic areas from the South, Central and North America recognized the antigens at the same rate. Our data show the serology test developed using the TcG<sub>mix</sub> is a significantly better alternative to epimastigote extracts currently used in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> serodiagnosis or the trypomastigote lysate used in this study for comparison purposes. TcG<sub>mix</sub> ELISA was &gt;98% specific and 93% sensitive, was not discriminatory of sex, age or geographic location of the individuals, performed at a higher potency in identifying weakly positive samples, and, thus, has a potential to serve as a single assay for the diagnosis of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. Future studies with large cohorts of patients will be required to determine if immunological responsiveness to the three antigens detects with high confidence the chronicity of infection, severity of disease, and effectiveness of treatment etc.</p>
