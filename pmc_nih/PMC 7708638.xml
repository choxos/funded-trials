                <p id="Par1">Little is known about the impact of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) on the efficacy of second generation integrase inhibitors. We sequenced pretreatment plasma specimens from the ADVANCE trial (NCT03122262). Our primary outcome was 96-week virologic success, defined as a sustained viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL from 12 weeks onwards, &lt;200 copies/mL from 24 weeks onwards, and &lt;50 copies/mL after 48 weeks. Here we report how this outcome was impacted by PDR, defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) mutation list. Of 1053 trial participants, 874 (83%) have successful sequencing, including 289 (33%) randomized to EFV-based therapy and 585 (67%) randomized to DTG-based therapy. Fourteen percent (122/874) have ≥1 WHO-defined mutation, of which 98% (120/122) are NNRTI mutations. Rates of virologic suppression are lower in the total cohort among those with PDR 65% (73/112) compared to those without PDR (85% [605/713], <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and for those on EFV-based treatment (60% [12/20] vs 86% [214/248], <italic>P</italic> = 0.002) and for those on DTG-based treatment (61/92 [66%] vs 84% [391/465] <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>P</italic> for interaction by regimen 0.49). Results are similar in multivariable models adjusted for clinical characteristics and adherence. NNRTI resistance prior to treatment is associated with long-term failure of integrase inhibitor-containing first-line regimens, and portends high rates of first-line failure in sub Saharan Africa.</p>

              <p id="Par3">The increasing prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance in those initiating or re-initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, along with the advantageous safety, potency, and cost-effectiveness characteristics of dolutegravir (DTG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend DTG-based ART as a preferred first-line regimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, recent concerns about DTG have emerged. For example, early data suggested a slight increased risk of neural tube defects following DTG exposure in pregnancy, although more recent data have been reassuring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Secondly, greater weight gain was observed in patients treated with DTG compared to efavirenz (EFV) in two clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in cohort studies from the North America and Europe, leading to concerns about long-term effects of obesity with lifelong ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Whilst cost-effectiveness analyses continue to support the use of DTG as first-line therapy despite these issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, the WHO and others are revisiting targeted use of efavirenz (EFV). Concerns remain about the use of EFV with widespread NNRTI resistance, which exceeds 10−15% in much of sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Pretreatment NNRTI resistance has been associated with a 2−3-fold greater risk of virologic failure (VF) for people initiating NNRTI-based regimens, both with older combinations such as nevirapine (NVP) and with EFV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. By contrast, the ANRS 12249 Treatment as Prevention Trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported that the most common NNRTI mutation, K103N, when detected alone, was not associated with increased risk of VF on an NNRTI-based single tablet regimen containing tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A study in Kenya similarly suggested isolated K103N might have limited impact on EFV-based ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">These conflicting data have generated controversy in the field on optimal first-line regimens to balance safety, tolerability, cost, and the impact of circulating NNRTI drug resistance on virologic outcomes. Although clinical trial data in the United States suggest that DTG performs exceptionally well in ART-naive individuals and as a switch regimen in the absence of significant background resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, there is relatively little data available on the efficacy of DTG in the context of high circulating NNRTI resistance. In the DAWNING trial, in which individuals failing NNRTIs were randomized to DTG or lopinavir/ritonavir, and over 90% had some evidence of NNRTI resistance, approximately 84% of individuals in the DTG arm achieved virologic suppression at 48 weeks. Notably the proportion of people suppressed at 48 weeks on DTG arm was lower than in most prior clinical trials, albeit of first-line therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As such, additional studies are needed to better elucidate the impact of pretreatment NNRTI drug resistance on virologic outcomes with both EFV-based and DTG-based used first-line regimens in the region.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Here we report results of next-generation sequencing of stored plasma specimens from participants in the ADVANCE clinical trial to determine the contributions of NNRTI pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) on 96-week virologic outcomes for individuals initiating EFV- and DTG-based ART. We hypothesize that NNRTI PDR significantly affects efficacy of EFV-containing regimens but has a negligible effect on outcomes for those initiating DTG-based therapy.</p>

              <p id="Par14">We report a strong association between drug resistance before treatment initiation, primarily to the NNRTI class, and virologic failure for people initiating first-line ART in the ADVANCE clinical trial. The effect was seen among individuals in the EFV arm and DTG arms, and persisted after adjusting for self-reported and pill count-based adherence and baseline viral load. When we considered a secondary outcome, which focused on persistent virologic failure (two or more consecutive visits with a high viral load), the effect of PDR on DTG persisted, but to a lower degree. In contrast to the effects seen for long-term outcomes, we did not find that PDR had an impact on time to initial suppression or change in quantified viral load from enrollment to 12 weeks, suggesting that NNRTI PDR affects longer-term maintenance of suppression for DTG-based ART or via a non-virally mediated behavioral mechanism. Nonetheless, the finding that NNRTI resistance appears to ultimately predict treatment failure among individuals initiating DTG-based ART in LMIC was unexpected, and to our knowledge not previously reported in the literature.</p>
              <p id="Par15">A virologic mechanism to explain our findings has not been established. NNRTI mutations are not known to affect susceptibility of DTG. The observed effect we identified may be consistent with preliminary data suggesting higher replication of NNRTI mutant viruses in the context of drug pressure from integrase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, although additional studies would be needed to corroborate this hypothesis. Whereas we found relatively little minority resistance and no effect of minority resistance on outcomes, existence of NNRTI resistance could be a surrogate marker of archived NRTI resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Integrase resistance mutations were not assessed in this study, but are generally believed to be rare (&lt;1%) in this region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Importantly, PDR did not hamper time to initial virologic suppression or change in viral load from enrollment to week 12 among people on DTG-based ART. A similar phenomenon of early maintenance of suppression followed by longer-term treatment failure was also seen with DTG monotherapy studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Alternatively, the lack of long-term suppression we identified in the DTG-based ART arms may be due to a behavioral component—pre-existing EFV mutations may be a surrogate of prior default among participants not disclosing previous ART exposure. Our multivariable logistic regression models included a measure of self-reported adherence and pill count-based adherence, both of which were highly predictive of virologic outcomes. Addition of these measures to our model did not meaningfully alter the effect size of PDR on virologic success. However, both self-reported and pill count-based adherence are imperfect measures, and can have a relatively low sensitivity to detect poor adherence, so residual confounding might be present<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated that prior ART exposure is associated with treatment failure and predicts virologic failure, even after controlling for PDR and treatment adherence, and thus could be a source of residual confounding if significant numbers of individuals in this study declined to disclose prior ART use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Notably, a number of studies have reported denial of ART use among individuals determined to be taking therapy based on drug level testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The South African public HIV program has used EFV in first-line therapy since its inception in 2004 and has over 5 million on treatment. The number of individuals who have defaulted and are re-initiating therapy are likely to be significant, and it is impossible to identify such individuals within clinical trials using existing South African data systems. Thus, while our effect size for PDR is large, and adjusted for confounding, the possibility that prior treatment exposure is a confounder of this effect remains substantial.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Whether the mechanism of effect is due to poor adherence or virologic mechanisms, our finding that NNRTI resistance, which is present in 10−20% of individuals initiating DTG in the region and is associated with a reduction in efficacy of DTG-based ART, has multiple public health implications. First, ensuring adequate virologic monitoring occurs with DTG-based regimens will remain a priority. Second, treatment programs will require ongoing attention to second- and third-line options, particularly if DTG failure or intolerance becomes more common than previously expected, and NNRTI-based regimens become more commonly used again. Third, integrase resistance testing, which is rarely done outside of research studies in resource-limited settings should become a consideration for referral laboratories in countries where DTG becomes the treatment of choice. Fourth, our data, in combination with the DAWNING study and others, highlight that the presence of drug resistance mutations might portend very different outcomes depending on the timing of when it occurs. In DAWNING, drug resistance mutations detected at the time of first-line failure were a surrogate measure of past adherence and predict success to second-line therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. By contrast, in this study the presence of drug resistance mutations at presentation for first-line treatment (or re-initiation after a default) appeared to signal the opposite—increased risk of virologic failure, perhaps mediated by poor adherence, or a virologic fitness deficit. Making this distinction about the clinical implications of drug resistance for clinical and public health purposes could be crucial. Fifth, our findings might signal a warning for national programs in the midst of large-scale switching from EFV-based to DTG-based ART, and support increased vigilance for the presence of treatment failure at the time of switch. Finally, these results signal the importance of future work to determine optimal treatment recommendations for individuals failing DTG-based ART, for which minimal data are currently available. Without such data, treatment programs should be advised to maintain virologic monitoring programs, adherence monitoring and support programs for those with failure, and regimen change guidance for individuals with intolerance or persistent virologic failure, even when documented drug resistance is absent. More novel strategies, such as real-time adherence and resistance monitoring, and long-acting injectable formulations of ART for those with adherence challenges should also be explored as these options become more widely available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par18">NAMSAL is the only other randomized controlled trial that has compared DTG vs EFV-based first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa. That study, conducted in Cameroon, compared low-dose 400 mg EFV to DTG as third agent at 48 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. DTG was non-inferior to EFV in that study, but baseline VL &gt; 100,00 copies/mL predicted failure in both arms. NAMSAL reported a much lower prevalence of NNRTI resistance (6%) than we did (14%), which is consistent with other data in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In NAMSAL, investigators reported no impact of baseline NNRTI resistance on outcomes, although 6/16 failures in the EFV arm had pre-existing NNRTI resistance. In that study, none of the three failures in the DTG arm at 48 weeks had baseline resistance to NNRTIs, the 6% of those that did appear to suppress during the study. By contrast, in our study, isolated K103N in the DTG arm was associated with lower virologic success in the primary analysis, albeit at 96 weeks. As in prior studies, we identified a very small number of individuals with resistance to both the NRTI and NNRTI drug classes, including K65R, M184V who we believe were unlikely to be treatment naive and who responded poorly to first-line ART. While the proportion is low, this finding is concerning from the point of view of the large-scale EFV to DTG-transition in sub-Saharan Africa, during which multi-class drug resistance is likely to be more prevalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Next-generation sequencing is becoming more widely used in research studies to measure the prevalence and impact of drug resistance in LMIC, and has the added advantage of being able to detect resistant viruses at low frequencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, many studies, and particularly those considering newer ART regimens, have failed to demonstrate a role for these low-level mutant viruses in determining clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. We also found no association between PDR and outcome when considering individuals with mutations in between 2 and 20% of viral quasispecies, which supports current practice to use major resistance mutation frequencies for determination of clinically significant drug resistance.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Our study should be generalized in light of its conduct in South Africa, and the presence of NNRTI resistance-conferring mutations as the large majority of the PDR detected. As this is the first study to show an impact of PDR on the efficacy of first-line DTG, it requires corroboration from future studies of similar cohorts. The presence of a higher prevalence of PDR in the DTG arm suggests that there might have been imbalance between groups, which is most likely due to chance, because the study arm was determined by computer randomization. Nonetheless, we have low suspicion for selective dropout in the study because interest in DTG among patients and within society at the time of randomization was minimal. Our estimates could be susceptible to unmeasured or residual confounding, particularly due to the effects of prior ART exposure and/or imperfect adherence not captured by self-report or pharmacy pill counts. Notably, our estimates of the effect of PDR on virologic outcomes remained large and significant after adjustment for confounders, including adherence, meaning an unmeasured confounder would have to have a strong association (OR of 2.7 or greater) with both PDR and virologic success to reduce the effect of pretreatment drug resistance to null<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Yet, prior studies have shown such an effect size for prior ART exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, known predictors of treatment success, such as adherence and pretreatment viral load, each predicted virologic success, which enhances the internal validity of our estimates. We also were unable to sequence approximately 15% of the study cohort due to unavailable specimens or failed sequencing. Despite that, our sample size remained large enough to detect relatively small changes in outcomes, and we detected no differences in characteristics between those who were and were not included in this sub-study, which reduces the risk of selection bias. Finally, our sequencing did not include the integrase region of the <italic>pol</italic> gene. Although resistance mutations that confer resistance to dolutegravir remain rare in South Africa, we cannot exclude the possibility of low-level resistance as a possible contributor to our findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">In summary, our study suggests that the presence of PDR to NNRTIs is negatively associated with long-term virologic outcome of both EFV- and DTG-based first-line ART in South Africa. In the context of highly prevalent PDR NNRTI resistance, our findings, if corroborated, have implications for first-line ART selection and treatment monitoring guidelines in the region. Future work should validate our findings, assess the contribution of pretreatment integrase mutations to outcomes, elucidate the impact of prior exposure to ART on treatment outcomes, and whether treatment failure observed on DTG-based ART is associated with emergence of integrase inhibitor mutations.</p>

                <p id="Par22">The ADVANCE trial is an open-label, non-inferiority, phase three clinical trial comparing three regimens for the initial treatment of HIV (NCT03122262). Individuals were recruited from 11 public HIV clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa. All study visits and data collection procedures were performed at one of two research clinics in Johannesburg operated by the study staff. Consenting participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to (i) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), EFV; (ii) TDF, FTC, DTG, or (iii) tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), FTC, and DTG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The study enrolled non-pregnant individuals over 12 years old without chronic kidney disease. Individuals were excluded if they had more than 30 days of prior ART use, any ART use in the past 6 months, were pregnant, or were actively undergoing therapy for tuberculosis.</p>

                <title>Study visits and measures</title>
                <p id="Par23">Study participants were seen for screening and randomization visits, which included collection of blood for pretreatment viral load and CD4 T-cell count measurements. Data on demographics, employment, marital status, and education attainment were collected. During observation, participants were scheduled for visits at week 4, 12, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Data for this analysis are limited to 96 weeks of observation. At each follow-up visit, plasma was collected for viral load estimation. Participants were asked about self-reported adherence over the past 4 days prior to each visit. Finally, study pharmacists recorded dispensed pills and performed a pill count of remaining pills at each follow-up visit. Pretreatment plasma specimens were shipped to KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) for extraction (Chemagic 360; Perkin Elmer, Germany), HIV-1 pol gene amplification (ThermoFisher HIV-1 genotype amplification module; Life Technologies, CA, USA), and next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq; llumina, CA, USA) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. We limited our analyses to sequences with ≥100× depth of coverage and spanning PR codons 1–99 and RT codons 1–254 (Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par24">We first described and graphically depicted the analytic sample to determine which study participants were included and excluded from this analysis. To assess for selection bias in this sub-analysis, we compared characteristics between individuals who had sequencing results available for this analysis with those who did not due to lack of available plasma specimens or failed sequencing. We then summarized clinical and demographic features of the analytic sample in total, and divided into those initiating EFV and DTG-based regimens. We then described the frequency and proportion of WHO-assigned PDR mutations overall, by drug class, and by treatment regimen.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Our primary exposure of interest was PDR, which we defined as the presence of at least one of the WHO list of surveillance drug mutations detected in at least 20% of the viral population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Our primary outcome of interest was 96-week virologic success, which we defined as sustained a viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL from 12 weeks through 96 weeks, &lt;200 copies/mL from 24 weeks through 96 weeks, and &lt;50 copies/mL from 48 weeks through 96 weeks. Individuals censored with virologic suppression at 48 weeks or after are considered to have achieved virologic success. Individuals who did not complete 12 weeks of observation are not included in this analysis (but are included in the 48- and 96-week Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Snapshot sensitivity outcomes as failures, as described below). We derived this definition to reflect treatment response in individuals who attain and maintain virologic suppression over the course of study observation. We estimated the proportion of participants who achieved virologic suppression by the presence or absence of PDR for the total cohort, and by EFV vs DTG treatment regimens.</p>
                <p id="Par26">We fitted logistic regression models with virologic success as the outcome of interest to estimate the contributions of both PDR and regimen to 96-week virologic success, with and without a regimen by PDR product interaction term to assess whether the effect of PDR differed by EFV vs DTG use. We then fitted multivariable logistic regression models with virologic success as the outcome of interest, including the following potential confounding variables, which have been shown to determine virologic success in prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>: sex, age, partnership status (defined as married or with a primary partner vs not), educational attainment (dichotomized as tertiary education or less), active employment status, pretreatment CD4 T-cell count (categorized as ≤200 cells/μL, 201−350 cells/μL, 351−500 cells/μL, and &gt;500 cells/μL), pretreatment viral load (categorized as &lt;10,000 copies/mL, 10,000−100,000 copies/mL, &gt;100,000 copies/mL), pill count-based adherence (calculated as the number of pills taken since the prior visit divided by the expected number of pills taken, capped at 100% at each visit, averaged over the course of the 96-week observation period, and categorized as 95−100%, 90−95%, and &lt;90% average adherence), and self-reported adherence (dichotomized as perfect adherence in the past 4 days vs any treatment interruptions in the past 4 days). We assessed for collinearity in our model by estimating variation initiation factors for each covariate within our fully adjusted model (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). In a third model intended to focus more directly on the virologic factors that determine treatment outcome, we restricted the model to pretreatment viral load, presence or absence of PDR, and study treatment allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par27">In sensitivity analyses, we varied our definition of virologic success. To assess for the impact of NNRTI PDR on persistent virologic failure, for a secondary outcome we defined success in individuals without two consecutive visits up to 96 weeks with a viral load &gt;200 copies/mL. In this definition, individuals censored or changed to a second-line regimen after a single viral load &gt;200 copies/mL are considered failures, whereas those who discontinue with virologic suppression are considered as achieving virologic success. This outcome is meant to detect persist virologic failure by allowing for virologic blips or episodic failure followed by re-suppression. To assess the contribution of PDR on virologic response to therapy, we also considered a virologic potency outcome defined by the change in log<sub>10</sub> viral load from enrollment to week 12, and assessed for time to first virologic suppression using Kaplan−Meier survival methods. In the survival analyses, individuals were censored at the time of first virologic suppression and considered failures if that occurred with a detectable viral load. We also conducted analyses using the FDA-defined 48-week and 96-week Snapshot to define virologic success. In these analyses, individuals who dropped out prior to the 48- and 96-week windows are considered as failures, irrespective of the reason. We considered three stratified analyses in which we (1) restricted the definition of PDR to individuals with only the K103N mutation, (2) restricted the definition of PDR to individuals who had WHO-defined PDR mutations at variant frequencies of 2−20%, and (3) assessed finding stratified by those in the EFV- or DTG-based arms. In a subset of individuals who had sequencing data available both prior to treatment initiation and after failure, we compared changes in patterns of NRTI and NNRTI-class resistance over time. We also conducted restricted analysis to individuals with sequences with ≥100× depth of coverage. Finally, we estimate an <italic>E</italic> value to determine the magnitude of the effect size of an unmeasured confounder who need to have to reduce the association between PDR and virologic success to null<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Data analysis was conducted in Stata (Version 15.1, Statacorp, College Station, Texas, USA), coded by two separate investigators (M.J.S. and B.S.) and compared for reproducibility.
