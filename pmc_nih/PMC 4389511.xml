                  <p>Dobutamine associated left ventricular (LV) wall motion analyses exhibit reduced sensitivity for detecting inducible ischemia in individuals with increased LV wall thickness.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>During dobutamine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DCMR) stress testing, we assessed rate pressure product (RPP), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), LV myocardial oxygen demand (pressure volume area, PVA, mass, volumes, concentricity, and the presence of wall motion abnormalities (WMA) and first pass gadolinium enhanced perfusion defects (PDs) indicative of ischemia in 278 consecutively recruited individuals aged 69 ± 8 years with pre-existing or known risk factors for coronary artery disease. Each variable was assessed independently by personnel blinded to participant identifiers and analyses of other DCMR or hemodynamic variables.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Participants were 80% white, 90% hypertensive, 43% diabetic and 55% men. With dobutamine, 60% of the participants who exhibited PDs had no inducible WMA. Among these participants, myocardial oxygen demand was lower than that observed in those who had both wall motion and perfusion abnormalities suggestive of ischemia (p = 0.03). Relative to those with PDs and inducible WMAs, myocardial oxygen demand remained different in these individuals with PDs without an inducible WMA after accounting for LV afterload and contractility (p = 0.02 and 0.03 respectively), but not after accounting for either LV stress related end diastolic volume index (LV preload) or resting concentricity (p = 0.31-0.71).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>During dobutamine stress testing, elderly patients experience increased LV concentricity and declines in LV preload and myocardial oxygen demand, all of which are associated with an absence of inducible LV WMAs indicative of myocardial ischemia. These findings provide insight as to why dobutamine associated wall motion analyses exhibit reduced sensitivity for identifying inducible ischemia in elderly.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The presence of inducible left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (LVWMA) observed during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and dobutamine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DCMR) is utilized widely to identify myocardial ischemia indicative of coronary artery disease (CAD) and forecast future cardiovascular (CV) events in those unable to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dobutamine stress wall motion analyses performed with DSE or DCMR exhibit reduced sensitivity for detecting myocardial ischemia in those with altered left ventricular (LV) geometry due to increased LV concentricity and hypertrophy, both common conditions in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion analyses performed with contrast echocardiography or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) display improved sensitivity for identifying coronary artery stenosis of intermediate severity or forecasting prognosis regardless of ventricular shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, we sought to understand the mechanism by which myocardial perfusion defects occur without concomitant inducible LVWMA in older individuals undergoing dobutamine stress testing. To accomplish this, we performed DCMR, a procedure which allows simultaneous assessment of wall motion and perfusion, LV concentricity, preload, afterload, and contractility in older individuals who frequently exhibit altered LV remodeling.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest Health Sciences, and each participant provided witnessed written informed consent. This study was registered within the United States on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00542503) and was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health grants R01HL076438 and P30AG21332. In addition, this study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. The purpose of this initiative was to utilize advanced DCMR techniques to identify rest and stress-induced cardiac and vascular abnormalities in older individuals that are associated with CV disease. In this study, each participant underwent an interview to collect and record information pertinent to CV disease (e.g., demographics, CV risk factors, etc.) and then underwent DCMR in which rate pressure product (RPP), aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), LV myocardial oxygen demand (pressure volume area, PVA, stroke work, SW), mass, volumes, concentricity, and the presence of WMA and first pass gadolinium enhanced perfusion defects (PDs) indicative of ischemia were measured and recorded.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>The study included participants from the rural counties of Central and Western North Carolina that exhibited a &gt;5 years presence of risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, or CAD) for a cardiac event, but no history of myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment, no contraindication to intravenous dobutamine or gadolinium based contrast nor the performance of a CMR exam (such as the presence of incompatible bio-metallic implants or claustrophobia). None of the subjects had angina or symptoms of heart failure in the 12 months prior to enrollment. Recruitment of study participants was achieved through newspaper and television advertisements, or mailings to randomly selected individuals over the age of 55, but &lt;85 years within Forsyth, Davie, and Davidson counties of Northwest North Carolina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>

                <title>Wall motion imaging</title>
                <p>The DCMR protocol was accomplished according to previously published techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with images that were acquired on a 1.5-T (Siemens Avanto) whole-body imaging system using a phased-array cardiothoracic surface coil placed on the chest. Dobutamine was infused incrementally from low (7.5 mcg/kg/min) to peak dose (20 to 40 mcg/kg/min), along with atropine (up to 1.5 mg), to achieve 80% of the maximum predicted heart rate response (MPHRR) for age. Cine images of the left ventricle were obtained in multiple contiguous short axis slices (apex to base) and in 3 long axis views (2, 3, and 4 chamber) at rest, low and peak dose dobutamine, and then after 10 minutes of recovery. Measurements of brachial artery systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were performed using a CMR compatible sphygmomanometer.</p>

                <p>First pass perfusion imaging with gadobenate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg) was performed when 80% MPHRR was achieved. Eighty percent (80%) of the maximum predicted heart rate response for age was selected for this study because [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] this heart rate response was previously shown to be accurate for identifying ischemia and forecasting cardiac prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A potential benefit of the mild decrease in peak stress heart rate (80% relative to 85%), is that it allowed for acquisition of 2 slices for assessing myocardial first pass perfusion at peak stress. These perfusion images were collected in the short axis orientation in the middle and apical segments (2 slice positions due to the rapid HR). Image parameters included an 8 mm thick slice, a 169 msec TR, a 1.1 msec TE, a FA of 12°, a FOV of 360 × 270 mm and a 192 × 108 matrix. Rest first-pass perfusion imaging was not performed.</p>
                <p>For each LV myocardial segment, a two-step process was utilized to identify perfusion defects indicative of ischemia. First, regions of first-pass hypo-perfusion were measured as a percentage of the corresponding myocardial wall thickness for that LV myocardial segment in the same imaging plane (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The radial length of the PD was expressed as a percentage of the total LV myocardial wall thickness. In addition, the duration (or number of frames) for each PD was calculated from onset of LV myocardial enhancement until complete resolution of the defect. Any PD that persisted for more than 5 frames from onset of myocardial enhancement and encompassed &gt;25% of the thickness of the wall was further evaluated for classification as ischemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This criterion of 25% transmural involvement was used successfully by other investigators to exclude dark rim artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Discordance between left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and perfusion defects indicative of inducible myocardial ischemia.</bold> Cine white blood imaging end-diastolic (left panel) and end-systolic (middle panel) frames from slice position acquired in the middle of the left ventricle at peak dobutamine and atropine infusion administered to achieve &gt;80% of the maximum predicted heart rate response for age.

Also, PVA is reduced in Groups II relative to Group I and trends toward a difference with Group III.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12968_2015_131_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Adjusted and unadjusted measures of myocardial oxygen demand.

              <p>To determine the factors influencing this lower myocardial oxygen demand between groups II and III, we adjusted the left ventricular PVA and SW for differences in baseline and peak stress LVEDVi (preload), peak stress PWV (afterload), the resting LVEF (contractility), and the LV concentricity as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B respectively. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, the lower LVPVA in individuals in Group II relative to Group III persisted after adjusting for contractility (7,684 ± 649 vs. 10,109 ± 883 mmHg*ml, p = 0.03), and afterload (7,639 ± 682 vs. 10,421 ± 930 mmHg*ml, p = 0.02). However, the differences in the PVA after dobutamine between individuals in Groups II and III were eliminated after accounting for stress LVEDVi (p = 0.71, Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), and LV concentricity (p = 0.31; Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Similarly, the lower LVSW in individuals in Group II relative to Group III persisted after adjusting for contractility (6,206 ± 529 vs. 8123 ± 720 mmHg*ml, p = 0.03; Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), and nearly persisted after accounting for LV afterload (6,170 ± 556 vs. 7,982 ± 776 mmHg*ml, p = 0.06; Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), but as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B, were eliminated when adjusted for stress preload, LVEDVi (p = 0.34) and LV concentricity (p = 0.47). This suggests that the lower LVSW and the PVA seen in individuals in Group II are related to the LV preload and LV concentricity. Similar results between Groups II and III were noted when the PVA and SW were respectively adjusted for baseline LVEDVI (8,207 ± 555 vs. 9,534 ± 740 mmHg*ml, p = 0.15, and 6,586 ± 459 vs. 7,294 ± 624 mmHg*ml, p = 0.36.</p>

              <title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
              <p>There are three important findings related to this study. First, in older men and women receiving a pharmacologic dobutamine stress test, myocardial oxygen demand often decreases during receipt of intravenous dobutamine despite achieving 80% of the MPHRR for age (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). Second, this reduction in myocardial oxygen demand is related to altered LV geometry and reductions in LV preload that are manifested by a decrease in LVEDV upon receipt of intravenous dobutamine (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B). Third, dobutamine related reductions in myocardial oxygen demand observed in older men and women may confound the identification of LV inducible wall motion abnormalities indicative of ischemia (Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In this study of elderly subjects at risk for inducible ischemia, of those exhibiting PDs suggestive of ischemia, 60% of individuals did not demonstrate a corresponding inducible LV wall motion abnormality.</p>
              <p>As shown in Figures <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, we identified three groups of individuals within the study population: those without (Group I) or with (Group III) inducible PDs and WMAs, and those with an inducible PD but without an inducible LV WMA indicative of ischemia (Group II). Similar observations in which PDs occur in the absence of dobutamine induced WMA have been reported in patients with resting LV hypertrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In those with LV hypertrophy, the presence of PDs has an increased sensitivity when compared to inducible LV WMA for detection of coronary arterial luminal narrowings of &gt;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is similar to observations made in studies of patients with altered LV geometry using both echocardiography and CMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The addition of myocardial perfusion has previously exhibited diagnostic and prognostic value with dobutamine stress testing, regardless of whether echocardiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or CMR imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] was used for diagnosis.</p>
              <p>To further understand why PDs occurred in the absence of WMA, we examined multiple hemodynamic variables throughout the stress testing procedure. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, HR increased while SBP decreased in all 3 participant groups (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This decrease in SBP contrasts with observations in prior studies of younger individuals in which a hypertensive response was uniformly noted after receipt of dobutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. As a result, the RPPs of the participants in this study ranged from 16,000 to 17,000 which are somewhat lower values than reported in previous studies of dobutamine stress testing, even after accounting for participant age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This observation may be related to the fact that elderly individuals often exhibit increased ventricular and arterial stiffness. As a result, their LV end-systolic pressure volume relationship curve is steeper which can potentially lead to greater reductions in SBP after the administration of systemic vasodilators when compared to younger individuals with more compliant arterial systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>PWV, a measure of arterial stiffening, was mildly elevated at rest across the 3 participant Groups. With stress, PWV remained similar or increased in all 3 Groups with the largest increase occurring in Group III participants. These data indicate that overall, aortic stiffness was elevated in older subjects and remained elevated after receipt of dobutamine. Given the absence of a concomitant increase in SBP in Group III, one possible explanation of the high PWV is that this group did not experience a vasodilator response with dobutamine stress. We have shown that elderly subjects with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose do not experience a normal decrease in afterload with dobutamine and instead experience an increase in arterial stiffness as evidenced by a decrease in aortic distensibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, myocardial oxygen demand as assessed by PVA was diminished at peak stress in those individuals with PDs but no WMAs (Group II) relative to those individuals in Group III (p = 0.03). We sought to determine which aspect (LV preload, LV afterload, LV contractility, or LV concentricity) of myocardial oxygen demand accounted for these differences by adjusting for each variable in our linear regression models. As shown in Figures <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and B, after accounting LV preload and concentricity, the differences in myocardial oxygen demand between Groups II and II were eliminated. This implies that both of these variables were integral for establishing the difference in myocardial oxygen demand noted between these two Groups.</p>
              <p>Since LV wall motion assessments of ischemia are driven by a supply–demand mismatch, a lower oxygen demand might not be adequate to provoke a WMA and could render the study insensitive for the detection of ischemia. The observation of a lower myocardial oxygen demand in those with increased LV concentricity, leading to hyperdynamic (and, consequently, and absence of WMA even though ischemia may be present during intravenous dobutamine) has been demonstrated by Mirelis, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These investigators identified fewer DCMR WMA in individuals with increased LV concentricity.</p>
              <p>Consistent with findings from other larger population based studies such as the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, the elderly individuals in our group exhibited a smaller LVEDV and increased LV concentricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, as reported in other studies, the LVEDVi decreased during dobutamine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, the magnitude of the decrease in LVEDVi was higher in this study relative to observations in prior studies of middle aged individuals undergoing dobutamine stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the presence of concentric LV remodeling or hypertrophy, decreases in LV preload can reduce the LV cavity size and render it more difficult to visualize WMAs even when myocardial shortening is abnormal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p>The results of this study have important implications for the interpretation of dobutamine wall motion stress testing in elderly individuals. As shown in this study, up to 61% of subjects who had ischemia identified by PDs did not experience an inducible WMA. In addition, the presence of these PDs was not associated with failure to achieve target HR during testing, or differences in the SBP response (which parenthetically decreased during testing) among all individuals receiving testing. Therefore, inducible ischemia (as defined by an inducible PD) may in fact be present during dobutamine stress in the elderly even though LV WMAs are absent. Other studies have found similar results regarding the lower sensitivity of LVWMA measures in assessing the risks for CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our study does exhibit some limitations. First, we did not perform contrast coronary angiography on the participants. Recently, however, the diagnostic utility and accuracy of CMR perfusion abnormalities have been established in multicenter and multivendor trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Second, the majority of our subjects were Caucasian. Insufficient numbers of individuals from other ethnicities were present to examine the effects of race or ethnicity. Third, our study population exhibited pre-existing CAD and multiple risk factors for CAD with either no or stable patterns of angina. More research is required to determine results in subjects with new onset, or unstable patterns of angina.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, despite achieving target HR, a subset of elderly patients with risk factors for CAD who undergo dobutamine stress experience perfusion abnormalities indicative of ischemia without a concomitant LV wall motion abnormality. Mechanistically, this occurs in part due to a lower myocardial oxygen demand that appears related to reductions in LV preload and increases in LV concentricity.</p>
