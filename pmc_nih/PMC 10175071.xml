                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Although modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccination is approved for smallpox and monkeypox prevention, immunological persistence and booster effects remain undescribed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants naive to smallpox vaccination were randomized to 1 dose MVA-BN (1×MVA, n = 181), 2 doses MVA-BN (2×MVA, n = 183), or placebo (n = 181). Participants with previous smallpox vaccination received 1 MVA-BN booster (HSPX, n = 200). Subsets of the formerly naive groups (approximately 75 each) received an MVA-BN booster 2 years later.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers (GMTs) increased from 1.1 (baseline, both naive groups) to 7.2 and 7.5 (week 4, 1×MVA and 2×MVA, respectively), and further to 45.6 (week 6, 2×MVA after second vaccination). In HSPX, nAb GMT rapidly increased from 21.6 (baseline) to 175.1 (week 2). At 2 years, GMTs for 1×MVA, 2×MVA, and HSPX were 1.1, 1.3, and 10.3, respectively. After boosting in the previously naive groups, nAb GMTs increased rapidly in 2 weeks to 80.7 (1×MVA) and 125.3 (2×MVA), higher than after primary vaccination and comparable to boosted HSPX subjects. Six months after boosting, GMTs were 25.6 (1×MVA) and 49.3 (2×MVA). No safety concerns were identified.</p>

            <p>The discontinuation of smallpox vaccinations in the 1970s has left much of the world's population susceptible to variola, the causative agent of smallpox, and other orthopox viruses for which the vaccine provided cross-protection [<xref rid="jiac455-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While the risk of smallpox from occupational exposure [<xref rid="jiac455-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] or bioterrorism [<xref rid="jiac455-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] remains concerning, the most prevalent human orthopox infection is currently monkeypox. In the 1970s and 1980s, monkeypox cases documented in Africa were suspected to result primarily from animal to human transmission with limited secondary spread between humans [<xref rid="jiac455-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, an increase in human monkeypox has been reported in Africa [<xref rid="jiac455-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and beginning in 2018, isolated travelers from Nigeria experienced cases of monkeypox upon arriving in Israel, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, with occasional secondary infection of close contacts [<xref rid="jiac455-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since May 2022, a geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak has occurred, primarily in men who identify as gay or bisexual, or men who have sex with men, leading to declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="jiac455-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These outbreaks highlight the absence of population protection against orthopox viruses and the urgency to better understand immunogenicity of different vaccine schedules.</p>
            <p>Although worldwide protection against orthopox viruses was achieved with replicating vaccinia-based vaccines, they have rare, but potentially serious, adverse effects including progressive vaccinia, encephalitis, and myopericarditis [<xref rid="jiac455-B10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>]. Risks of adverse reactions are higher in immunocompromised individuals and those with exfoliative skin conditions [<xref rid="jiac455-B13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref>]. These concerns prompted use of the highly attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus to develop the nonreplicating and substantially less reactogenic MVA-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) vaccine [<xref rid="jiac455-B17" ref-type="bibr">17–19</xref>]. MVA-BN induces immune responses comparable to traditional smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="jiac455-B18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>] and is well tolerated by healthy adults [<xref rid="jiac455-B21" ref-type="bibr">21–28</xref>] and those with human immunodeficiency virus [<xref rid="jiac455-B29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>], hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref rid="jiac455-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], or exfoliative skin conditions [<xref rid="jiac455-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These data and nonhuman primate studies [<xref rid="jiac455-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] supported approval of liquid frozen MVA-BN for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox under the trade names Jynneos (United States), Imvanex (European Union, United Kingdom), and Imvamune (Canada).</p>
            <p>The initial and follow-up clinical studies described herein demonstrate the duration and nature of immunological memory in both younger individuals never immunized against smallpox and older individuals vaccinated in the distant past using live-replicating vaccinia vaccines. These findings are of relevance when defining optimal vaccination strategies for outbreaks in a supply-constrained environment and for prophylaxis for those at risk of occupational orthopox exposure, such as health care providers, laboratory staff, and military personnel.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>Two studies were conducted to assess safety, immunogenicity, and boost response with MVA-BN in healthy adults with and without prior smallpox vaccination. These studies were conducted from 2006 to 2009 at 1 European site.</p>
                <p>The initial study (NCT00316524) was a phase 2, partially randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial. Participants without prior smallpox vaccination were randomized 1:1:1 to receive vaccinations 4 weeks apart with 1 dose of MVA-BN followed by 1 dose of placebo (1×MVA), 2 doses of MVA-BN (2×MVA), or 2 doses of Tris buffer placebo (PBO). Participants with prior smallpox vaccination (HSPX) were given a single booster dose of MVA-BN. The primary immunogenicity objective was to compare the humoral responses of the HSPX and 2×MVA groups to determine if a single booster dose of MVA-BN in a previously vaccinated population could induce a response comparable to 2 MVA-BN primary vaccinations in a population never vaccinated against smallpox. Secondary objectives included comparisons of immune response kinetics across groups. The safety results from the initial study were reported previously [<xref rid="jiac455-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
                <p>The follow-up study (NCT00686582) was a phase 2 open-label trial that assessed immunogenicity in the 1×MVA, 2×MVA, and HSPX groups 2 years following their last dose in the initial study. An MVA-BN booster dose (BD) was also administered to a subset of the participants without prior smallpox vaccination (1×MVA BD and 2×MVA BD groups) to evaluate postbooster immunogenicity and safety.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000/2008). All participants were informed verbally and in writing about the purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits, and provided consent before participation in any study-related assessments.</p>
                <p>The initial study included healthy men and nonpregnant women, aged 18 to 55 years who had normal laboratory values at screening and agreed to use birth control. For the 1×MVA, 2×MVA, and PBO groups, participants had no known or suspected previous smallpox vaccination and no detectable vaccinia scar. For the HSPX group, participants had a prior smallpox vaccination that was documented or manifested as a typical vaccinia scar. The <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref> contains full eligibility criteria.</p>
                <p>Participants who completed the initial study were able to have the persistence of their humoral response evaluated 2 years later, at the beginning of the follow-up study. Consenting eligible participants from the 1×MVA and 2×MVA groups received a booster and immunogenicity assessments over 6 months.</p>

                <title>Vaccine</title>
                <p>MVA-BN is a highly attenuated, purified, live vaccine [<xref rid="jiac455-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It and the Tris buffer placebo were produced at IDT Biologika GmbH (Dessau-Rosslau, Germany) according to current Good Manufacturing Practice standards. MVA-BN was provided in liquid frozen 0.5-mL aliquots of ≥ 0.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) MVA titer. MVA-BN and PBO were shipped and stored at −20°C ± 5°C, avoiding direct light, and administered subcutaneously with a 24- or 25-gauge needle in the upper arm.</p>

                <title>Immunogenicity Assessments</title>
                <p>Total and neutralizing serum antibody titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In the initial study, samples were drawn at screening, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, and 6 months after the last vaccination. In the follow-up study, samples were drawn 2 years (−2 to +3 months) after the initial vaccination from all available participants. Those who received the booster also had samples drawn at 1, 2, and 4 weeks, and 6 months postboosting.

                <title>Safety Assessments</title>
                <p>The safety profile for the initial study was previously reported [<xref rid="jiac455-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, the safety assessments described herein are specific to the follow-up study. Safety and reactogenicity assessments included solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Solicited AEs comprised a set of predefined, expected local and systemic reactions. See <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref> for specifics. These AEs were listed on a memory aid where participants recorded them for 8 days postbooster. Unsolicited AEs (AEs that were not listed on the memory aid or occurred outside the 8-day postbooster period) were reported at any study visit. All solicited local AEs occurring during the 8-day period were considered related to study vaccination, while the investigator determined causality for all other reported events.</p>
                <p>Safety tests were performed at screening and 2 weeks postbooster. Abnormal laboratory values assessed as clinically significant and grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (potentially life threatening) abnormal values were documented as AEs.</p>
                <p>AEs of special interest (AESIs) were clinically significant cardiac symptoms, electrocardiogram changes, or cardiac enzymes above normal limits. Participants developing an AESI returned for examinations and diagnostic tests and were followed until resolution.</p>

              <sec id="jiac455-s0.6">
                <title>Statistical Methods</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute). The safety and primary immunogenicity analyses were based on the full analysis set, comprising all participants given at least 1 vaccination. Immunogenicity was also summarized for the per protocol set, comprising those participants who adhered to all vaccinations and protocol conditions.</p>
                <p>In the initial study, a randomization list was deposited in the electronic case report form; in the follow-up study, no randomization was required. In both studies, conduct was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Unsolicited AEs were coded with <italic toggle="yes">Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities</italic> terminology.</p>
                <p>For participants seronegative at baseline, seroconversion was defined as development of antibody titers above the limit of detection (≥6 for PRNT and ≥50 for ELISA). For participants seropositive at baseline, seroconversion was defined as an at least 2-fold increase compared to baseline titer in the initial study and to the prebooster titer in the follow-up study. Geometric mean titer (GMT) was calculated as the antilogarithm of the mean of the log<sub>10</sub> titer transformations. Antibody titers below the detection limit were given an arbitrary value of 1; titers between the detection limit and quantification limit (20 for PRNT and 200 for ELISA) were analyzed as reported.</p>

                <p>The initial study included 753 participants. Of these, 204 participants vaccinated against smallpox in the distant past received an MVA-BN booster. The other 549 participants without prior smallpox vaccination were randomized among 1×MVA, 2×MVA, and PBO (<xref rid="jiac455-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Eight participants who did not meet eligibility criteria were not included. Primary MVA-BN vaccination was administered to 181 participants in the 1×MVA group and 183 participants in the 2×MVA group; placebo was administered to 181 participants. MVA-BN booster was administered to 200 participants in the HSPX group. In total, 745 participants received study vaccination and were included in the full analysis set.</p>

                <p>Approximately 2 years later, 304 participants (91 from the 1×MVA group, 92 from the 2×MVA group, and 121 from the HSPX group) provided blood samples to assess antibody persistence. A total of 77 and 75 participants initially given 1 or 2 MVA primary vaccinations, respectively, were boosted with MVA-BN.</p>
                <p>Demographic characteristics were generally comparable across treatment groups at initial study onset (<xref rid="jiac455-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Slightly more than half of participants were female (53.0% to 61.9%); most were white (97.2% to 99.0%). The HSPX group was older (mean age 41.5 years) than the other groups (25.3 and 26.0 years), as they were vaccinated prior to the declaration of worldwide smallpox eradication in 1980. At baseline, 64.4% of participants were on concomitant medication, most commonly over-the-counter pain medications and birth control.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study, an MVA-BN vaccine booster dose induced a robust immune response regardless of smallpox vaccination history and use of 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN for priming. Two years after priming in naive individuals, nAb titers rapidly increased, were highest at 2 weeks, and remained elevated relative to baseline at 6 months after boosting. A single MVA-BN booster administered to those vaccinated with older-generation replicating smallpox vaccines in the distant past also evoked the same pattern of rapid increase in nAb titers. The anamnestic nAb response was similar in magnitude in all groups, although slightly lower in both MVA-BN–primed groups. Booster responses greater than responses to primary vaccination are consistent with what has been previously observed following revaccination with other smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="jiac455-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>These data suggest that priming with 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN can induce B-cell immune memory similarly to that of older-generation replicating smallpox vaccines, which have conferred long-term protection and are believed to have prevented orthopox outbreaks (including monkeypox transmission) until recently [<xref rid="jiac455-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>While nAbs in those immunized long ago were detectable decades later, a protective threshold has not been defined for smallpox, monkeypox, or other orthopox viruses [<xref rid="jiac455-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. At booster study baseline, those who received primary MVA-BN immunizations 2 years earlier exhibited nAb levels that had declined to near baseline levels. Even so, a single MVA-BN booster induced robust anamnestic responses, regardless of the primary vaccination schedule administered. The rapid kinetics mirrored those observed after MVA-BN boosting in participants immunized long ago with older-generation replicating smallpox vaccines. This demonstration of long-lived B-cell memory strongly supports protection in the absence of persisting nAbs, particularly when considering the mean incubation periods for smallpox and monkeypox are both over 1 week (12.5 and 8.5 days, respectively) [<xref rid="jiac455-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], with minimum latencies of 7 and 3 days [<xref rid="jiac455-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>Sustained MVA-BN–induced protection has been observed in nonhuman primates challenged with monkeypox virus [<xref rid="jiac455-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although postimmunization nAb titers fell to prevaccination levels after about 3 years, they quickly rose upon exposure to the virus, and the animals were protected against disease. Thus, even a single MVA-BN vaccination, as administered in this study, may offer protection against future exposure.</p>
              <p>This type of long-term immunological memory, observed in the absence of sustained nAbs, has been demonstrated with vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). In HBV studies, 90% to 100% of previously vaccinated participants who were seronegative exhibited rapid anamnestic responses when given a booster vaccination [<xref rid="jiac455-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Neutralizing mumps antibodies were found to decrease over time [<xref rid="jiac455-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], as nearly half of young adults given MMR vaccinations 20 years earlier as infants were seronegative. However, over 70% of seronegative individuals had an anamnestic response upon revaccination [<xref rid="jiac455-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this study, MVA-BN booster vaccination induced robust total antibody responses in all groups. However, in contrast to nAb titers, total antibody titers were substantially higher upon booster vaccination in those primed with 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN than in those primed with older-generation replicating vaccines in the distant past. Although the difference in time between priming and boosting in the different groups may confound this finding, increasing evidence suggests nonneutralizing antibodies may play significant roles in protecting against some viral infections [<xref rid="jiac455-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These non-nAbs may elicit effector pathways such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, and antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, although nAbs are primarily effective against the targeted protein, less specific antibodies can target less variable, cross-serotype viral proteins. Thus, the very robust total antibody response induced by MVA-BN may be important in providing cross-protection against other orthopox viruses such as monkeypox [<xref rid="jiac455-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
              <p>No safety concerns were identified in the follow-up study. This is consistent with the initial study [<xref rid="jiac455-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Because reports of myopericarditis were reported in military personnel administered replicating smallpox vaccines [<xref rid="jiac455-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], cardiac events have been intensively monitored throughout the MVA-BN clinical development program. The cardiac AESIs observed in this study were considered unrelated to study vaccination. Therefore, the safety findings further support the existing safety profile of MVA-BN in adults, as no cardiac safety concerns or cases of myo-/pericarditis have been identified [<xref rid="jiac455-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="jiac455-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The immunological and safety findings described in this study are expected to translate to the recently developed freeze-dried formulation, as previous trials have demonstrated comparable safety profiles and noninferior immune responses between the 2 formulations.</p>
              <p>The study was conducted in a single European site, and lack of racial or ethnic diversity is one of the limitations. However, other MVA-BN studies [<xref rid="jiac455-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that enrolled a more diverse population have not revealed any racial difference in immunogenicity or safety. Another limitation is that the antigens used in the immune assays were based on vaccinia, and not on Monkeypox. This is consistent with the antigen used for evaluation of other smallpox vaccines that have been demonstrated to confer protection against smallpox.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>Priming with either 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN induced durable immune memory as boosting 2 years later elicited a rapid and sizable anamnestic response comparable to boosting following immunization in the distant past with older-generation replicating smallpox vaccines.</p>
