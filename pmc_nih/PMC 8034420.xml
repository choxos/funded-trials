                  <p>6030 patients were randomized over 22 months. The primary outcome occurred in 653
(21.3%) of 3059 patients with an alert and in 622 (20.9%) of 2971 patients
receiving usual care (relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.13,
P=0.67). Analysis by each hospital showed worse outcomes in the two non-teaching
hospitals (n=765, 13%), where alerts were associated with a higher risk of the
primary outcome (relative risk 1.49, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.98,
P=0.006). More deaths occurred at these centers (15.6% in the alert group
<italic>v</italic> 8.6% in the usual care group, P=0.003). Certain acute kidney
injury care practices were increased in the alert group but did not appear to
mediate these outcomes.</p>

              <p>Acute kidney injury—an abrupt decline in the kidney’s filtration function—is a common
occurrence in patients in hospital and is associated with nearly a 10-fold increase in
inpatient mortality.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In survivors, acute kidney injury is
associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, end stage kidney disease, and
mortality.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Despite the strong association with important
outcomes, the syndrome (which is asymptomatic) is often missed in the course of clinical
care; it occurs in roughly 15% of patients in hospital and yet is recorded in the
electronic health record in fewer than half of patients with acute kidney injury.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Best practices for acute kidney injury, such
as routine urinalysis and measurement of urine output, occur infrequently, and even
repeat measurement of creatinine is not universal. These deficiencies provide a reason
for alerting providers about the presence of acute kidney injury.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>With the assumption that increased recognition of acute kidney injury will improve care
of these patients and thus improve clinical outcomes, many health systems in the United
States, and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, have introduced an
electronic alert for acute kidney injury as part of routine clinical care.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Data on the efficacy of these alerts are
limited, however, and definitive evidence of their benefit for patient outcomes remains
absent. Additionally, as acute kidney injury is a heterogeneous condition, lacking
proven strategies for its mitigation, an alert might prompt actions that are unnecessary
or even harmful.</p>
              <p>The effectiveness of alerting probably depends on a combination of patient, provider,
and disease factors, and might differ in different care environments, thus requiring
rigorous evaluation. We conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial of usual care
versus usual care plus pop-up acute kidney injury alerts delivered through an electronic
health record. The alert was designed to reach multiple providers and was implemented
using an identical protocol across a diverse set of hospitals. We hypothesized that
alerts would influence provider behavior and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

                <p>A detailed description of the trial design and rationale has been previously
published.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Briefly, we conducted a
patient level, parallel group, randomized controlled trial of health record
electronic alerts versus usual care in adults with acute kidney injury at six
hospitals in the Yale New Haven Health System in Connecticut and Rhode Island, US.
The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki, and two institutional review boards associated with the six study hospitals
approved the study, which was deemed minimal risk. Patients were enrolled, and a
requirement for informed consent was waived, as the alert was deemed unlikely to
affect patient welfare and informing patients of their diagnosis of acute kidney
injury would contaminate the usual care group. An external data and safety monitoring
board performed four independent assessments during the trial, including one formal
interim analysis at 50% recruitment. These analyses were not stratified by hospital.
Hospitals were given guidelines to terminate the study if the P value associated with
interim analysis was less than or equal to 0.001 for efficacy or less than or equal
to 0.005 for harm. The hospitals also had the authority to terminate the study of
their own accord regardless of those recommendations. This trial was registered with
clinicaltrials.gov under registration number NCT02753751 on 25 April 2016, before
study initiation and patient enrolment.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Inpatient adults aged 18 or older with acute kidney injury, defined by the Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria as an increase in creatinine 0.3
mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or 1.5 times the lowest measured creatinine
within the previous seven days of admission to hospital, were eligible.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Owing to missing and inaccurate urine output
data, urine output was not used to classify acute kidney injury. Patients with a
history of end stage kidney disease (based on International Classification of
Disease, ninth and 10th revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10) codes, a dialysis order in the
past year, or an initial hospital creatinine greater than 354 μmol/L were excluded
automatically by the detection algorithm. We subsequently excluded patients whose
admission date was before the inception of alerts at a study hospital, whose first
alert occurred after hospital discharge, who had been enrolled in a previous study,
and who were enrolled during a two week period in which alerting ceased owing to an
upgrade of the electronic health record system (fig S1).</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Randomization and masking</title>
                <p>Eligible patients were identified using an acute kidney injury detection algorithm
built into our best practice alert within the Epic electronic health record system.
When the chart is opened, the algorithm automatically assesses the patient record for
inclusion and exclusion criteria. If all criteria are met, the patient is
automatically enrolled into the trial and randomized. Simple randomization was
performed within Epic using an internal random number rule with concealed allocation,
as our electronic health record system cannot perform permutated block randomization
or import external randomization lists. Randomization was performed at the patient
rather than the provider level, as inpatients at participating hospitals are often
cared for by many providers who change throughout their hospital stay. All study
investigators were blinded to patient randomization status until enrollment was
complete.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The intervention was an automated, electronic, pop-up alert which fired whenever the
patient’s electronic chart (Epic Systems, Verona, WI) was opened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">fig 1</xref>). Alerts were displayed only to individuals
who had authority to change or enter new orders on behalf of the patient—hereafter
referred to as “providers”—which included interns, residents, fellows, attending
physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician’s assistants. Alerts were displayed
each time the chart was opened, provided the patient continued to meet criteria for
acute kidney injury. If the provider agreed or disagreed with the presence of acute
kidney injury, the alert was suppressed for 48 hours for that provider. If multiple
providers used the electronic health record to care for the same patient, each of
them separately received the alert whenever they opened the patient chart. Patients
randomized to the usual care group generated “silent” alerts, which did not display
to providers but were tracked, allowing the study team to observe which type of
providers opened the chart and how often.</p>

                <p>The alert contained an option to add acute kidney injury to the patient’s problem
list, and also a link to an acute kidney injury order set (supplemental fig S2); the
set included options for blood and urine testing and kidney imaging but were limited
to tests and procedures considered minimal risk (that is, intravenous fluid
administration was not included). Providers at each of the study hospitals received
education about acute kidney injury and the alert system before study roll out during
departmental conferences. The educational program explained the definitions of acute
kidney injury, the functioning of the alert, and the ethics of the study but did not
provide suggested practices of care.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was a composite of inpatient acute kidney injury progression
(defined as an increase in acute kidney injury stage), receipt of dialysis, or death
within 14 days of randomization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included the
components of the primary outcomes and frequency of various practices of care for
acute kidney injury. These practices included administration of contrast, fluids, or
a nephrotoxic agent (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, or aminoglycoside), ordering a
urinalysis, documentation of acute kidney injury, monitoring of creatinine and urine
output, and ordering a kidney consultation. An assessment of each hospital’s alert
effects was also prespecified.</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>We present descriptive statistics as median (interquartile range) for continuous
variables and proportions for categorical variables. For the primary analysis, and
all comparisons of categorical variables between the intervention and control group,
we used the Mantel-Haenszel test, accounting for each hospital site as a stratum. We
used the Mantel-Haenszel approach to obtain the pooled relative risks across hospital
strata without adjusting for other baseline factors. </p>
                <p>As a sensitivity analysis, we used modified Poisson generalized estimating equations
with a robust variance estimator to present the relative risk estimates, adjusting
for the following characteristics assessed at the time of randomization: age, sex,
race, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, white blood cell count, heart rate,
respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, chronic heart failure,
hypertension, diabetes, malignancy, intensive care unit status, modified sequential
organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score, Elixhauser comorbidity score, and
hospital.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> We used the Van Elteren test
to compare continuous variables across the intervention groups, accounting for
hospital strata. </p>
                <p>To compare time to event between study groups, we used Cox proportional hazard
regression with intervention as the independent variable, stratified by hospital,
with censoring at 14 days after randomization. For individual hospital analyses,
Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and log rank tests were used. Patients discharged
before 14 days without an outcome of interest were assumed to be free of that outcome
at 14 days. Death was treated as a censoring event in analyses where death was not
the outcome. We used Schoenfeld residuals to examine the proportional hazards
assumption in Cox models; there were no violations. We specifically amended the
protocol to include a test for site heterogeneity on 4 May 2018—that is, two months
after the initial patient enrollment and before we had started alerting in any of the
hospitals in which adverse outcomes were ultimately detected. This new protocol was
based on ongoing executive committee calls and the hypothesis that the alert effect
might differ by hospital. No data were used to drive this decision.</p>
                <p>Our preliminary data suggested that 24.5% of patients would experience the composite
outcome. We considered a relative 20% reduction in this outcome (to 19.6) was
clinically significant and would represent an acceptable threshold to justify adding
an interruptive alert to the clinician workflow. A sample size of 2512 in each arm of
the study achieves 90% power to detect this degree of change, but given the potential
for contamination across study arms (whereby clinicians “learn” to identify and care
for acute kidney injury over the course of the trial), which would tend to bias the
results toward the null, we inflated the sample size by 20% to a total of 6030.
Although this sample increase does not deal with the bias toward the null, it does
allow for increased detection of a smaller effect size.</p>
                <p>Statistical analyses were conducted in Stata version 15.1 (College Station TX), SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and R (RStudio version 1.2.5033 (R version
3.5.3), Boston, MA), and P≤0.04 was considered statistically significant for the
primary outcome (to account for the interim analysis). We do not report P values for
secondary and exploratory analyses, except for safety outcomes, but report 95%
confidence intervals in all cases. The widths of the 95% confidence intervals have
not been adjusted for multiplicity, and inferences drawn from these might not be
reproducible.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures,
nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation
of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of
results. Patient involvement was not sought owing to the limited public understanding
of acute kidney injury and a lack of definitive treatment.</p>

                <p>Evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect was found across the six hospitals
(P=0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">fig 2</xref>). Some sites suggested a trend
towards a protective effect of alerts, such as hospital 3 (relative risk 0.80, 0.62
to 1.04, P=0.09), but others showed potential harm from alerts. In a post hoc
analysis, this heterogeneity was not accounted for by patient characteristics, but by
whether the hospitals were stratified as “teaching” or “non-teaching.” In particular,
there appeared to be harm from alerts at the two non-teaching hospitals in the study
(n=765), where 24.3% of patients in the alert arm compared with 16.3% in the usual
care arm met the primary outcome (relative risk 1.49, 1.12 to 1.98, P=0.006). No such
effect was found at the four teaching hospitals (0.97, 0.87 to 1.07, P=0.54), with
P=0.006 for interaction comparing teaching with non-teaching hospitals.</p>

alerts and death across the enrolled hospitals (P=0.05). Again, alerts were
associated with a significantly higher risk of death at 14 days in the non-teaching
hospitals, where 59 (15.6%) patients in the alert group versus 33 (8.6%) patients
receiving usual care met this outcome. The relative risk of death was 1.82 (1.22 to
2.72, P=0.003) in the non-teaching hospitals compared with a relative risk of 0.89
(0.74 to 1.06, P=0.18) at the teaching hospitals (P=0.001 for interaction).</p>

discharge to hospice overall or in the non-teaching hospitals.</p>

                <title>Sensitivity and post hoc analyses</title>
                <p>We examined the adjusted relative risk of the primary outcome accounting for a
variety of baseline factors individually and stratified into teaching and
non-teaching hospitals (supplemental table 19). The adjusted relative risks were
broadly similar, although the adjusted risk of death in the non-teaching hospitals
attenuated to 1.58 (95% confidence interval 1.08 to 2.31) and in the teaching
hospitals to 0.85 (0.72 to 1.01).</p>
                <p>We also performed a formal mediation analysis to determine if certain actions taken
after alerting might have mediated the adverse outcomes in the non-teaching hospitals
(supplemental table 20).<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The use of
intravenous fluid (in drip or bolus form, in high chloride or more physiologic form)
did not appear to mediate the adverse effect of the alert. Other proxies of volume
overload (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and the change in these parameters)
similarly did not show significant effect mediation. Exposures to medication, kidney
consultations, and the percent of alerts that went to attending versus other
providers also showed no significant effect mediation. Finally, the burden of other
electronic health record alerts (such as those for sepsis or interactions between
drugs) did not appear to mediate the deleterious effects of alerts for acute kidney
injury.</p>
                <p>We also examined the risks of two components of our primary outcome, death and
progression of acute kidney injury, in the period two years before the start of this
trial in each hospital (fig S7). Broadly, these risks were similar to those of the
control group in the randomized portion of the study. For example, two years before
our study started, the risk of death at 14 days after acute kidney injury in the
non-teaching hospitals was 8.6%, similar to the risk of death for the control group
of 8.6%, and significantly lower than the risk of death of 15.6% for the intervention
group.</p>

                <title>Principal findings</title>
                <p>In this multicenter randomized trial of patients with acute kidney injury, the
provision of an electronic health record alert to providers had no effect on the risk
of progression of acute kidney injury, dialysis, or death. Substantial heterogeneity
of effect was seen across study hospitals, however, with signals for harm emerging in
the two non-teaching hospitals. We cannot be sure whether the observed differences in
effect were due to the presence of teaching services or other practices that might
differ between the hospitals in our study. The fact that some process measures (such
as orders for intravenous fluids and urinalysis) occurred more often in the alert arm
suggests that the alerts were being noticed by providers and that they could change
provider behavior, but the magnitude of these changes was relatively small.</p>
                <p>Reconciliation of those findings with the fact that the risk of death was higher in
the alert arm in the non-teaching institutions is difficult. This increased risk
might have been due to random chance, although the P value for the alert:death
association of 0.003 suggests that chance is unlikely. Furthermore, adjustment for a
variety of baseline factors did not ablate the observed association, suggesting that
imbalance in baseline covariates is insufficient to explain the association.
Additionally, in our prior, single center, acute kidney injury alert trial (conducted
at a medical center not involved in this study), we noted a numerically higher,
although statistically insignificant, risk of death in the alert versus the usual
care arm. The risk of death at 14 days in that trial was 7.1% in the usual care group
and 7.7% in the alert group (P=0.58).<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> To
date, that study is the only previous trial of acute kidney injury alerts that
employed randomization at the patient level. Finally, we examined historical death
rates of acute kidney injury in the study hospitals and found them to be quite
similar to the rates seen in the usual care arm of our trial. Taken together, these
data suggest that there might be true harm associated with the provision of alerts
for acute kidney injury in certain situations. In view of the secondary nature of
these analyses, the results should be considered hypothesis generating, and any
attribution to the “non-teaching” nature of the hospital is premature.</p>
                <p>As alerts of this type are in widespread clinical use, we sought to determine if any
factor downstream of randomization drove these results. We speculated that an
increase in fluid administration in the alert group might lead to harm through volume
overload, but accounting for fluid administration did not attenuate the observed
effect. We further considered that certain types of providers (eg, medical doctors
<italic>v</italic> physician’s assistants) might respond to acute kidney injury
differently, but there was no indication that the effect changed according to the
type of provider receiving the alert. Furthermore, we assessed whether alert fatigue
might be to blame for poorer outcomes in the alert group, but accounting for the
frequency of other electronic health record alerts did not change the observed
association with the alert for acute kidney injury. Possibly, while no single factor
mediated the adverse effect in every patient, a constellation of factors resulted in
the observed effect. We are left without a satisfying unifying explanation for the
potential harm. Alerts might distract providers from other, more clinically
important, patient care. Alternatively, in the larger teaching institutions, systems
exist to protect patients from certain harms (like inappropriate drug dosing), which
are not present in the smaller hospitals (regardless of academic status). Finally, we
should consider that alerts could compel providers to do something, even if it is not
clinically indicated, perhaps owing to fears of medicolegal consequences if they do
not act.</p>

                <p>Alerts of all kinds, from electronic to auditory to visual, have proliferated in
medical care with the best of intentions under assumptions that risk is minimal.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Notably, alerting systems for acute kidney
injury have already been widely adopted across various health systems. The published
literature suggests that alerts are often effective in changing processes of care,
but their effect on clinical efficacy has been mixed.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> For example, a stepped wedge randomized trial of 24 059
episodes of acute kidney injury in the UK found a decreased length of stay, but no
change in overall mortality risk between the control and intervention periods.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In contrast, a before/after study of a
clinical decision support system for acute kidney injury among 64 512 patients found
a significant reduction in mortality risk from 10.2% to 9.4% from before to after the
intervention.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This design could not
account for secular trends in the care of patients with acute kidney injury, although
the mortality risk in patients with non-acute kidney injury did not change over the
study period.</p>
                <p>This trial cannot show a clear efficacy of alerts, but the phenomenon of “alert
fatigue”—a tendency to disregard even important alerts owing to their abundance—is
increasingly recognized.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The economic costs of alerts might be
minimal after the initial alert build, but the costs of provider attention, burnout,
and potential overtreatment might be substantial and clearly deserve additional
study.<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This trial was conducted under a
waiver of informed consent, based on the prevailing assumption that informational
alerts for acute kidney injury pose minimal risk to the patient and the recognition
that obtaining the consent of those randomized to the control group would invalidate
the study results. Unfortunately, for the alert deployed in this study, the
assumption of minimal risk proved incorrect. These results do illustrate, however,
that clinical trials of seemingly benign interventions, such as alerts, require
rigorous evaluation and should not be implemented without robust evidence of safety
and efficacy.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title>
                <p>Limitations of the study include randomization at the patient level, allowing for
providers potentially to learn how to better identify acute kidney injury throughout
the course of the trial. This contamination would tend to bias the results toward the
null hypothesis that the alerts did not affect the primary outcome, but an analysis
accounting for the duration that the alerts had been in effect at each hospital found
no evidence of this. Furthermore, our previous research has shown that patient level
factors, such as baseline creatinine value and sex, contribute to alert benefit.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Additionally, the alert was largely
informational. Although the alert provided a link to an acute kidney injury order
set, it provided no patient-specific recommendations (such as identifying current
nephrotoxic drug treatment)—a key feature of the successful alert for pediatric acute
kidney injury piloted by the nephrotoxic injury negated by just-in-time action
(NINJA) program, and by certain “care bundles” for acute kidney injury that have been
used in the UK.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The heterogeneity of acute kidney injury
might require more personalized interventions. Furthermore, the alert was sent only
to certain care providers, notably excluding nurses and pharmacists, who might
specifically benefit from receipt of the alert. The alert did not use urine output
criteria, as many ward patients do not have reliable estimates of urine output. This
might have meant that the study population was not fully representative of all
patients with acute kidney injury. Finally, the alert was conducted across six
hospitals within a single large health system in northeastern US, limiting
generalizability. However, the hospitals represent a diverse mix of patients and care
models, suggesting that these results might apply more broadly.</p>
                <p>The strengths of the study include its large size with an ability to detect
clinically meaningful changes in hard endpoints, its enrollment across a diverse
group of hospitals, and the use of a fully automated enrollment and randomization
system that could pave the way for future trials of alerting and clinical decision
support systems.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>In this large, randomized, multicenter study, we found that, overall, the provision
of an automated, electronic alert for acute kidney injury had a modest effect on
process measures and no effect on the risk of progression of acute kidney injury,
dialysis, or death. Substantial heterogeneity of effects across hospitals was found,
with the concerning finding of a significantly increased risk of death in the alert
group in non-teaching hospitals. This study argues against the implementation of
informational alerts for acute kidney injury and for a reconsideration of the alerts
currently used.</p>
