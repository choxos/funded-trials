                <p>Therapeutics to reduce intracranial pressure are an unmet need. Preclinical data have demonstrated a novel strategy to lower intracranial pressure using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor signalling.</p>
                <p>Here, we translate these findings into patients by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to assess the effect of exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, on intracranial pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Telemetric intracranial pressure catheters enabled long-term intracranial pressure monitoring. The trial enrolled adult women with active idiopathic intracranial hypertension (intracranial pressure &gt;25 cmCSF and papilloedema) who receive subcutaneous exenatide or placebo. The three primary outcome measures were intracranial pressure at 2.5 h, 24 h and 12 weeks and alpha set <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> at less than 0.1.</p>
                <p>Among the 16 women recruited, 15 completed the study (mean age 28 ± 9, body mass index 38.1 ± 6.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, intracranial pressure 30.6 ± 5.1 cmCSF). Exenatide significantly and meaningfully lowered intracranial pressure at 2.5 h −5.7 ± 2.9 cmCSF (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.048); 24 h −6.4 ± 2.9 cmCSF (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.030); and 12 weeks −5.6 ± 3.0 cmCSF (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.058). No serious safety signals were noted.</p>
                <p>These data provide confidence to proceed to a phase 3 trial in idiopathic intracranial hypertension and highlight the potential to utilize GLP-1 receptor agonist in other conditions characterized by raised intracranial pressure.</p>

              <p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut neuropeptide secreted by the distal small intestine in response to a meal.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> GLP-1 receptor agonists are existing therapeutic agents used in the treatment of diabetes. GLP-1 stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release, thereby lowering blood glucose but not causing hypoglycaemia.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> GLP-1 receptor agonists also signal at the hypothalamus to regulate satiety and weight.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This has led to GLP-1 receptor agonists being licensed to promote weight loss in the setting of obesity.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Relevant to this trial is the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in regulating fluid secretion. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to reduce sodium reabsorption and promote diuresis through actions in the renal proximal tubule.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the choroid plexus, the predominant CSF-secreting structure in the brain.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Our preliminary data have shown that GLP-1 receptor agonism reduces CSF secretion and intracranial pressure (ICP) in an <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> rodent model with elevated ICP.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The reduction in ICP was of a greater magnitude to that observed with the commonly used drugs in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).<sup><xref rid="awad003-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>IIH is characterized by increased ICP with no identifiable cause. Recent weight gain is the major risk factor for development of the condition and its occurrence is most commonly observed in women of reproductive age with obesity.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Weight loss is disease modifying and if maintained can induce remission.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> As the incidence of IIH is rising<sup><xref rid="awad003-B14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref></sup> in line with global obesity trends,<sup><xref rid="awad003-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> targeted treatments are an unmet clinical need.</p>
              <p>Visual loss is observed in greater than 90% of those with IIH<sup><xref rid="awad003-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> with up to 25% suffering marked visual impairment.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Chronic disabling headaches occur in the majority and have adverse impact on quality of life.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Cognitive deficits linked to raised ICP have been documented.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Currently, there is no licenced therapy for IIH.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The most commonly used off-label medicine is acetazolamide; other medicines have included topiramate, frusemide, spironolactone and octreotide.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Owing to side effects and treatment failures new therapies are needed. Patient groups have highlighted the importance of prioritizing novel targeted treatments for IIH.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The aim of the IIH:Pressure trial was to translate the preclinical data demonstrating efficacy of GLP-1 receptor signalling to reduce ICP into patients with raised ICP by conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in IIH. The trial aimed to evaluate both acute effects on ICP as well as effects over a 3-month time horizon.</p>

Thereafter, following blocking and washing steps, standards (mouse monoclonal anti-exendin-4 antibody; Abcam ab23407) and unknown samples with serial dilutions were added to the plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, biotinylated-exendin-4 (2 µg/ml concentration; AnaSpec Inc) was added and followed by washing and SA-HRP detection (KPL).

Data were reported as means and SD [with median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normal data], and standard error (SE) and 95% CI where appropriate. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to analyse repeated measures of the primary and secondary outcomes and to estimate differences adjusted for baseline values. In these models, population-level effects (also known as fixed effects) comprised the intercept, time as a factor variable and the two-way interaction of treatment arm and time as a factor variable to model changing treatment effects over time. Group-level effects (also known as random effects) comprised patient-level adjustments to the intercept. The threshold for statistical significance was pre-specified at 0.1.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the first randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide, with placebo to reduce ICP in patients with active IIH. We have found a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in ICP in the treatment arm as compared to the placebo arm both acutely and after 12 weeks of dosing. The drug was safe and well-tolerated. This trial establishes the successful translation of preclinical data into humans and is the first to demonstrate a new drug treatment for IIH that significantly reduces ICP in IIH.</p>
              <p>The hallmark of IIH is raised ICP, which causes headaches and visual loss (through compression of the optic nerve and papilloedema).<sup><xref rid="awad003-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of exenatide the primary outcome for this trial was chosen as ICP.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> A significant reduction in ICP was seen acutely at 2.5 h of −4.2 mmHg (equivalent to −5.7 cmCSF), which corresponds to peak exenatide serum levels. The reduction in ICP was also noted at 24 h [reduction of 4.7 mmHg (equivalent to 6.4 cmCSF); <xref rid="awad003-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="awad003-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>]. There are no studies that have evaluated other drugs (used off-label) to treat IIH that have shown ICP reduction within the first 24 h of administration. IIH patients can deteriorate rapidly (over days)<sup><xref rid="awad003-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and hence a drug with rapid onset of action is clinically advantageous for IIH. A drug treatment that can rapidly reduce ICP is also of potential relevance for other conditions characterized by raised ICP, such as following traumatic brain injury and stroke.</p>
              <p>A significant reduction in ICP was also noted after prolonged dosing at 12 weeks (−4.1 mmHg equivalent to −5.6 cmCSF; <xref rid="awad003-T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="awad003-F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), demonstrating durability of dosing. The minimal clinically important change in ICP in those with IIH has yet to be determined.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> There have been four previous randomized control trials in IIH<sup><xref rid="awad003-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B40" ref-type="bibr">40–42</xref></sup> and one prospective crossover trial.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Four of these have used ICP as an outcome measure, with the magnitude of treatment effect between trial arms ranging from 5.9 cmCSF (acetazolamide and diet),<sup><xref rid="awad003-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> −6.0 (1.8) (by bariatric surgery)<sup><xref rid="awad003-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and −6.2 cmCSF (through low-calorie diet).<sup><xref rid="awad003-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The efficacy in these studies is akin to what we have observed following treatment with exenatide for 3 months (−5.6 cmCSF).</p>
              <p>Headache is a key disabling feature for IIH patients and listed in the top 10 priority areas for research by patient groups.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Headache is also a key determinant for the significantly reduced quality of life in IIH.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In this trial, while not powered to evaluate secondary outcome measures, there was a significant reduction in monthly headache days between baseline and 12 weeks among those patients taking exenatide (−7.7 days); those in the placebo arm did not have any significant improvement (−1.5 days; <xref rid="awad003-F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). A reduction in monthly headache of 1.5–2 days is regarded as meaningful in chronic migraine randomized controlled trials.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B43" ref-type="bibr">43–46</xref></sup> Improvements in headache in IIH have been shown in other trials to occur due to reduction in ICP.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Headache outcomes may show more benefit over a longer trial duration, as during the relatively short time horizon of this trial other factors may also have contributed to headache such as medication overuse and opiate use, which occur in approximately one-third of IIH patients.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p>
              <p>There was a significant improvement in visual acuity between the trial arms at 12 weeks (<xref rid="awad003-F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). In this trial, the magnitude of change (five letters) was equivalent to a line on the visual acuity chart. In other ocular diseases a change of more than five letters would have &gt;90% probability of being a real change.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Changes in visual acuity of five letters have been noted previously in a prospective crossover cohort study evaluating a weight loss intervention where there was a reduction of ICP by −6.2 cmCSF.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> It is likely that the improvement in visual acuity found here may be related to resolution of the hyperopic shift associated with raised ICP and papilloedema.</p>
              <p>Weight loss has been shown to reduce ICP in IIH.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In this study, there was no significant reduction in body weight at 12 weeks in the treatment arm, which implies that the reduction in ICP was likely to have been mediated by a reduction in CSF secretion, the mechanism demonstrated in preclinical studies, rather than through weight loss.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Additionally, the significant reduction in ICP noted at the early time points of 2.5 h and 24 h would have been too premature to be modulated by weight loss. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as exenatide can increase satiety and promote weight loss, but this is generally in a context of a concurrent low-calorie diet.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Exenatide is widely used to treat type 2 diabetes and has an established long-term safety record (licensed in 2005).<sup><xref rid="awad003-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> In this trial exenatide was safe and well-tolerated, with no withdrawals due to drug adverse effects. This is relevant as the drug predominantly used off-label for IIH, acetazolamide, can be poorly tolerated. In a previous randomized controlled trial 48% of patients withdrew over a 3-month period, due to adverse effects.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Nausea is a known side effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists,<sup><xref rid="awad003-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="awad003-B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and was predicted to occur in those IIH patients taking exenatide. In this trial seven patients experienced nausea related to exenatide, but this settled over the first week. The nausea may, in part, be explained by the exenatide pharmacokinetic profile with high peak levels noted twice a day with twice daily Byetta dosing.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Our pharmacokinetic data illustrated highest serum levels at 2.5 h post-dose, in keeping with the established literature on Byetta. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in two participants. The clinical relevance of this is not determined; however, anti-drug antibodies have not been shown to impact drug effects in diabetes.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> IIH is known to be a disease of insulin resistance<sup><xref rid="awad003-B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> and therefore exenatide’s insulin-sensitizing effects may have additional benefits in this population.</p>
              <p>This is the first trial, to our knowledge, to use telemetric intracranial monitoring to measure ICP in IIH. Patient input into the trial design advocated for telemetric ICP monitoring over multiple lumbar punctures to facilitate data validity and reduce patient discomfort from multiple lumbar punctures. This has permitted detailed characterization of ICP changes and the ability to measure ICP for prolonged periods over several weeks without further invasive procedures.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> This technology has led to the accurate demonstration of ICP lowering both with single dosing and with repeated dosing. The intracranial telemetric catheters were safe, with only one failing to register by 12 weeks.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. As an early phase study, it was powered to the primary end points of ICP reduction with single and repeated dosing. Thus, the study was underpowered to detect differences in patient-centred outcomes and secondary clinical end points such as headache and visual field perimetry. Powering the study for those end points would have required a large increase in number of participants; however, telemetric ICP monitors would not be feasible in large trial cohort. No stratification was used at randomization and groups were unmatched for baseline headache days and visual field perimetry. Additionally, patients with minimal visual field defects were not excluded as in prior studies, thus making the study more clinically representative, but visual effects more difficult to detect due to the ceiling effect of the measurement. With the main side effect of exenatide being nausea, patients could have been unmasked; however, the primary end point was a physiological measure, which should minimize this risk.</p>
              <p>The results of this study may have wide reaching implications for many other diseases of raised ICP as the drug does not target the specific pathogenesis of IIH, but CSF secretion. Given the tolerability of exenatide and its direct and early effect on ICP, it may be beneficial in other conditions such as hydrocephalus, traumatic brain injury, raised ICP in stroke and meningitis and space flight–associated neuro-ocular syndrome. In addition, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to demonstrate neuroprotective properties and hence may have additional benefits in conditions such as traumatic brain injury.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We had previously identified a novel pathway to modulate ICP in an animal model.<sup><xref rid="awad003-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This preclinical work has now been translated to a population of patients with raised ICP due to IIH. The data demonstrated the efficacy of exenatide to significantly lower ICP. A new efficacious therapy is a clear unmet patient need,<sup><xref rid="awad003-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and this is the first trial of a new drug treatment for IIH that significantly reduces ICP. The data presented here support further evaluation of exenatide in a large randomized controlled trial, powered to evaluate clinically relevant outcome measures.</p>
