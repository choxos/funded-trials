                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>We evaluated an online Sleep Health and Wellness (SHAW) programme paired with dayzz, a personalised sleep training programme deployed via smartphone application (dayzz app) that promotes healthy sleep and treatment for sleep disorders, among employees at a large healthcare organisation.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p>Participants were randomised to intervention (n=794) or control (n=561) on consent. Intervention participants received the SHAW educational programme at baseline plus access to the personalised dayzz app for up to 9 months. The control condition received the intervention at month 10.</p>

                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Our primary outcome measures were sleep-related behavioural changes (eg, consistent sleep schedule); sleep behaviour tracked on an electronic sleep diary and sleep quality. Our secondary outcome measures included employee absenteeism, performance and productivity; stress, mood, alertness and energy; and adverse health and safety outcomes (eg, accidents).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>At follow-up, employees in the intervention condition were more likely to report increased sleep duration on work (7.20 vs 6.99, p=0.01) and on free (8.26 vs 8.04, p=0.03) nights. At follow-up, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was lower in the intervention (n=160 of 321, 50%) compared with control (n=184 of 327, 56%) (p=0.04). The mean total dollars lost per person per month due to reduced workplace performance (presenteeism) was less in the intervention condition (US$1090 vs US$1321, p=0.001). Employees in the intervention reported fewer mental health visits (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.94, p=0.01) and lower healthcare utilisation over the study interval (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98, p=0.03). We did not observe differences in stress (4.7 (95% CI 4.6 to 4.8) vs 4.7 (95% CI 4.6 to 4.8)), mood (4.5 (95% CI 4.4 to 4.6) vs 4.6 (95% CI 4.5 to 4.7)), alertness (4.9 (95% CI 4.8 to 5.0) vs 5.0 (95% CI 4.9 to 5.1)) or adverse health and safety outcomes (motor vehicle crashes: OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.9); near-miss crashes: OR=0.89 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.5) and injuries: 0.9 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.3)); energy was higher at follow-up in the intervention group (4.3 vs 4.5; p=0.03).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Results from this trial demonstrate that a SHAW programme followed by access to the digital dayzz app can be beneficial to both the employee and employer.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Seventy per cent of adults in the USA admit routinely obtaining insufficient sleep (less than the recommended 7 hours minimum).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Additionally, sleep disorders are very common. Approximately 50â70 million adults in the USA are at risk for a sleep disorder,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> with 30%â40% of employees screening positive for at least one common sleep disorder.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â7</xref> Moreover, approximately 85% of those at risk for a sleep disorder are undiagnosed and untreated.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 8</xref></p>
              <p>Sleep deficiency and/or untreated sleep disorders are associated with significant consequences for employee health. Specifically, insufficient sleep is associated with an increased risk for hypertension,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> obesity,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11</xref> type II diabetes<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and cancer.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Also, insufficient sleep among employees carries a significant burden in terms of workplace outcomes, including lower productivity<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and greater absenteeism.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The worldwide social and economic burden of undiagnosed and untreated sleep disorders on employees, employers and the healthcare system is staggering. According to the WHO, insomnia is responsible for 3.6 million disability-adjusted life-years lost per year worldwide, representing the 11th highest global burden among all mental, neurological and substance use disorders.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In Germany, the direct and indirect costs for insomnia are as high as â¬40ââ¬50 billion annually<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> whereas in France, the total costs of workplace loss per employee are estimated at â¬1139.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the USA, the direct and indirect costs attributed to insomnia are approximately US$150 billion per year due to lost work productivity, absenteeism and healthcare utilisation,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> while the absolute cost of insufficient sleep is estimated to be almost three times as much, US$$411 billion per year (2.23% in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) terms) and growing annually.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> People with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), another common sleep disorder with serious health implications, are 10 times more likely to suffer from reduced productivity and increased illness and healthcare costs.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> They are also at a much higher risk for work and motor crashes, which increase the potential for workplace disability and liability.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 22â24</xref> Researchers found that treating employees with sleep apnoea is associated with significant cost savings totaling on average US$6000 over 2 years in terms of reduced healthcare and disability-related costs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>Workplace-based health programmes hold promise for improving employee health and workplace outcomes, yet research on the effectiveness of such programmes has found mixed results.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26â28</xref> Recent randomised controlled trials that did not prioritise sleep found that behavioural change resulting from the wellness programmes was not followed by improved downstream health, healthcare utilisation or workplace productivity.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> However, previous research has shown that when sleep is prioritised, workplace health programmes can be effective for improving employee sleep, overall health and workplace outcomes. In a randomised controlled trial of an in-person sleep education and sleep disorders screening intervention, researchers found that there was a significant reduction in injuries and disability day usage.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Further, among employees at a national trucking company, diagnosing and treating the sleep disorder sleep apnoea through an employer-sponsored programme was associated with significant savings in terms of reduced healthcare costs.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
              <p>Despite the importance of sufficient sleep and overall sleep health for workplace productivity as well as employee health and safety, nationally representative data collected among US employers shows that fewer than 10% of employers report that they provide sleep-focused programmes for their employees, yet nearly one-third report nutrition or exercise programming for employees.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> There is a need for more research on sleep-focused workplace wellness programmes and technologies (eg, smartphone applications, apps) have the potential to increase the reach and impact of such programmes due to their capabilities, such as the ability to sense a userâs location and deliver personalised messages.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> We conducted a randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of a Sleep Health and Wellness (SHAW) programme combined with access to a smartphone app (âdayzzâ) on employee sleep (eg, sleep duration, sleep health behavioural changes); workplace outcomes (eg, employee presenteeism, absenteeism and performance) and healthcare utilisation (eg, mental health, ambulatory visits and emergency room visits).</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>As described in detail elsewhere,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> we conducted an open-label, randomised, parallel-group remote clinical trial using a waitlist control design among daytime employees at a large healthcare organisation in the Northeast USA. The study recruitment was originally intended to be conducted in-person. However, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the start of study implementation, recruitment, enrolment, randomisation, baseline and follow-up procedures were redesigned and completed entirely online. Researchers were blinded to study group allocation and there was no interaction with study participants other than to facilitate payment for study incentives for both groups. The statistical analysis was conducted without knowledge of group allocation.</p>
                <p>Eligible participants were daytime workers and were recruited remotely via system-wide emails to the &gt;40 000 member organisation. An advertisement for the study was also posted on a website hosted by the organisation devoted to recruitment for research studies, with a wide circulation (&gt;10 000 visitors monthly) and targeted social media advertisements were commissioned to individuals who reported the organisation as their primary employer on Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
                <p>Potential participants were directed to an online landing page with more information about the study. An online screener was administered which automatically scored responses to determine eligibility according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible participants received a message inviting them to provide consent and complete the baseline procedure. Ineligible participants received a message indicating they were not eligible.</p>
                <p>Consent was collected via electronic signature. After providing electronic consent via the online landing page, a random number generator built into the study webpage randomised participants to either the control or intervention. Because additional steps (eg, downloading the app, viewing a sleep health educational video) were required in the intervention condition, we employed an adaptive randomisation strategy whereby the likelihood of being assigned to the intervention condition was approximately 1.3â1 to ensure that sufficient participants were recruited in each condition (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Reporting followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>

                <title>Intervention: a SHAW programme plus access to a personalised digital health app (dayzz)</title>
                <p>After randomisation, participants assigned to the intervention condition received the online SHAW programme, which included a 20 min sleep educational programme. The SHAW programme covered topics including (A) the problem of insufficient sleep in our society; (B) research on sleep and its relationship to a variety of domains of health, performance and safety; and (C) tips and strategies on how to improve sleep. Then, as part of the SHAW programme, participants received a screener for common sleep disorders. Those that screened positive for OSA, restless leg syndrome or shiftwork disorder received a referral to an accredited sleep clinic to facilitate further evaluation and treatment, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>After completing the online SHAW programme, participants in the intervention condition received information on how to access the personalised digital health app on their mobile device. To prevent contamination, the personalised digital health app was password protected. The password was only provided to intervention participants on the download page. The control condition participants were offered the intervention (SHAW plus dayzz) at the end of the study.</p>
                <p>The dayzz personalized app begins with a brief onboarding and registration process. Users may elect to connect a personal (not provided by the study) wearable device (eg, Fitbit) or a digital health data platform (eg, Apple Health), that is then streamed directly into the app, or manually entered by the user using the appâs sleep tracker. Based on the userâs sleep assessment outcome and available sleep and behavioural data, the dayzz app offered each user a personalised sleep training programme through a combination of tailored modules to deliver evidence-based therapies for the specific sleep issue(s) users reported. In the case of users at risk for sleep disorders, participants received modules that provided messages to help navigate the user toward recommended care. All users received modules covering basic sleep hygiene principles and tools, such as bedroom environment optimisation (integrating smartphone noise and light sensors), white noise audios and written or auditory content to promote sleep health. Modules were dynamic and modified based on userâs engagement level, sleep and behaviour patterns, and programme progress. The dayzz app used just-in-time adaptive intervention mechanisms to deliver treatment content at targeted times. Screenshots of the digital health app can be found in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file</xref>, and details of the dayzz app functionality can be found elsewhere.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>All participants were asked to complete baseline, monthly and end-of-study questionnaires; as well as a detailed daily sleep diary for consecutive weeks at two separate time points near the beginning and again near the end of the study interval. We evaluated changes in sleep behaviours on the monthly and end-of-study questionnaire using a checklist that asked participants to select the healthy sleep changes they have made since starting the study. Specifically, participants were asked âDuring this study, have you changed any sleep-related behaviours to improve your sleep since participating in the study (check all that apply)?â Participants had the option to select changes they may have made, such as âGo to bed earlier,â âKeep a more consistent sleeping scheduleâ and âSet an alarm to remind you of your bedtimeâ.</p>
                <p>Participants were also asked to self-report their sleep duration and timing on the sleep diary. The Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), percentage probability of an individual being in the same state (asleep vs awake) at any two time points 24 hours apart, was calculated and averaged across each sleep diary interval.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> An individual who sleeps and wakes at exactly the same times each day scores 100 (better outcome), whereas an individual who sleeps and wakes at random scores 0 (worse outcome).</p>
                <p>Participants also reported their sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) on the baseline, monthly and end-of-study questionnaires.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The PSQI differentiates âpoorâ from âgoodâ sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The participant self-rated each of these seven areas of sleep.</p>
                <p>Absenteeism, performance and productivity were evaluated using the WHO Health and Work Performance Questionnaire Short Form (HPQ).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Participants were asked the number of hours worked in a typical week. The HPQ asks participants to report their absence from work (absenteeism) in terms of days and their relative performance at work (presenteeism) on a 0â100 scale each month, where 100 is the level of a top worker and 0 is no work at all. Participant salary information is then used to convert absenteeism and presenteeism into cost estimates based on work time lost.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p>
                <p>Mood, alertness and energy were assessed on the sleep diary by asking participants to report, using 100 mm Visual Analogue Scales, their: (1) mood from âsadâ (0) to âhappyâ (100); their (2) alertness from âsleepyâ (0) to âalertâ (100) and (3) energy from âsluggishâ (0) to âenergeticâ (100). Higher scores indicated a better outcome. On the monthly questionnaires, we also assessed mood on a 7-point scale from âvery poorâ (0) to âvery goodâ (7), alertness from âvery poorâ (0) to âvery goodâ (7) and energy from âvery lowâ to âvery highâ (7).</p>
                <p>Healthcare utilisation was assessed monthly using a modified version of a validated scale.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The scale was updated to include specific visits more likely to occur in our study, such as home or laboratory sleep studies. Participants reported interactions with the healthcare system, such as visits to the emergency room or urgent care, or to their primary care or mental health providers. The total number of each type of visit was calculated over the study interval.</p>
                <p>Motor vehicle crashes and near-crashes were captured via self-report on the monthly questionnaire, consistent with previous studies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 40</xref> Participants were asked, âIn the last month, did you have any motor vehicle accidents or crashes (actual collisions) in which you were driving,â and âIn the last month, did you have any near miss motor vehicle accidents or crashes (narrowly avoided property damage or bodily harm) in which you were driving.â Participants who responded yes were be asked to provide the number of times that each outcome occurred during the month. We also assessed injuries by asking participants âIn the last month, how many injuries did you haveâ and attentional failures by asking participants the number of times they âNodded off or fell asleep during meetings at work,â ââ¦on the telephone,â ââ¦while driving,â and ââ¦while stopped in traffic.â</p>
                <p>Finally, feasibility and acceptability were assessed on the end-of-study questionnaire. Participants in the intervention condition only were asked âDid the study app provide helpful information?â âWould you recommend the study app to others?â and âDid you find the study app easy to use?â on scales from 1 ânot at allâ to 7 âvery much soâ Adverse events were captured across the study duration, from baseline through 10 months follow-up.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>The power analysis was performed prior to study recruitment. We estimated that a cohort of 1000 active participants would provide sufficient data for comparison (500 in each arm of the protocol). Power was estimated for each of the aims using GPower V.3.1.9.4. A sample size of 500 in each group enabled us to detect an effect size of 0.16 between the groups, roughly translating to a relative risk of 1.20. In anticipation of potential attrition, we noted this sample size would still be able to detect a small difference in effect size if we enrolled at least 600 participants.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach (ITT). Outcome measures were compared by assignment to the intervention and waitlist control conditions. The ITT analysis included all participants randomised in the study. Due to variability in study start date and study duration depending on the date of enrollment, baseline to follow-up comparisons were conducted using the first available datapoint (96% reported in month 1 or month 2) and the mean responses from months 7â9. The distribution of the data was examined. No transformations were necessary for the comparisons reported in this paper.</p>
                <p>The odds of changing sleep behaviours each month relative to the start of the study were tested using mixed effects logistic regression models. Sleep quality was assessed using the PSQI. We examined sleep duration, PSQI score, mood, alertness and energy, respectively, at baseline (first submitted survey) and follow-up (the mean of submitted values in months 7â9) in both conditions using two-sample t-tests. We compared the mean total costs of absenteeism and presenteeism over the study interval using two-sample t-tests.</p>
                <p>We compared monthly utilisation of the healthcare system and the incidence of crashes, near-crashes and injuries between conditions using mixed models that accounted for the dependence between repeated measures. The relative risk of each type of visit were compared using mixed models. An incidence rate ratio for all visits was constructed between conditions using a Poisson distribution in a mixed model that accounted for repeated measures. We computed mean responses to the feasibility questions among intervention participants on the end-of-study questionnaire. An overall mean above the scale midpoint (4) on the feasibility questions was used to determine that the app is feasible and accessible.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Finally, to consider the impact of missingness on the results we conducted sensitivity analyses that restricted the study population to those that completed at least three surveys for primary outcomes that relied on monthly reports. Alpha was set at 0.05 for all comparisons. Stata V.15.1 was used to conduct the statistical analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomised clinical trial implemented at a large healthcare organisation found that a sleep health education programme, followed by ongoing access to a personalised digital health tool demonstrated several favourable outcomes on employee sleep and health, workplace productivity and employee healthcare utilisation. Specifically, those randomly assigned to the intervention condition self-reported an increase in healthy sleep behavioural changes (ie, more sleep consistency, and increased sleep duration). Also, according to the daily sleep diary, participants in the intervention condition demonstrated improved sleep quality and longer sleep duration at the end of the study. Regarding workplace outcomes, those in the intervention condition also reported significantly lower presenteeism compared with the control condition. We observed lower healthcare utilisation (fewer mental health visits, specifically and fewer total healthcare visits, broadly) in the intervention condition. Finally, we did not detect significant differences in mood or adverse health and safety outcomes between the intervention and control conditions.</p>
              <p>The finding observed in our trial of behavioural change as well as improvements in measures of workplace productivity and reduced healthcare costs contrast with a cluster randomised trial evaluating a workplace health programme targeting a variety of health behaviours delivered to randomly selected worksites across a large retailer (&gt;32 000 employees) that found no effect of the intervention on economic outcomes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Our findings also contrast with a randomised controlled trial evaluating a âcomprehensiveâ employee health programme that addressed a variety of health behaviours (eg, physical activity, nutrition) and was delivered to more than 4000 employees at a large university that did not find improvements in measured health outcomes or healthcare costs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> A review of more than 100 studies also found little evidence for the efficacy of such programmes, which authors attributed to heterogeneity in study designs and intervention duration.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> These findings, taken together, could beg the question: are workplace-based health programmes worthwhile? However, 90% of workplace programmes to date have lacked attention to employee sleep.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Therefore, a possible explanation for the mixed evidence for workplace wellness programmes to date is the lack of focus on employee sleep, yet sleep health is critical for a variety of favourable employee health and workplace outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â11 14 42</xref></p>
              <p>Although sleep-focused workplace wellness programmes are far less prevalent compared with programmes addressing physical activity or nutrition,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> there has been growing attention to these programmes and their results suggest positive effects on employee sleep. One workplace-based sleep health for police officers in Italy demonstrated an improvement in sleep quality and sleep duration among officers.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Another sleep-focused workplace-based programme for employees in Japan showed that exposure to the programme was associated with an increase in sleep duration.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Finally, a study that combined a live sleep education session with follow-up emails demonstrated improvements in employee sleep duration and a reduction in sleep difficulties.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Our results contribute to the literature by evaluating a new and novel approach to sustaining behavioural change, an educational programme combined with an app that provides ongoing personalised health advice. It is possible that our approach, which featured the online SHAW programme coupled with ongoing access to personalised sleep health curricula based on the specific user and their needs that employed just-in-time and machine learning technologies to navigate users toward better sleep health, resulted in sustained change over the study interval. Many workplace health programmes feature education alone without additional features to increase adherence to recommended health behaviours and a sleep disorder care regimen.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Therefore, a significant strength of this study is the use of a digital app for delivering ongoing support for sleep health and sleep disorders care. Access to the personalised digital app following exposure to the SHAW programme may have allowed for the sustained improvement on self-reported behaviours, actual behaviours, and economic outcomes that were observed in our study. Finally, responses to questions assessing feasibility and acceptability of the digital health app were all above the midpoint, suggesting likability and usability of this component of the intervention.</p>
              <p>With respect to clinical significance, the approach outlined in this trial of a sleep health education session followed by ongoing access to a digital health coach, demonstrated improvement in sleep-related outcomes, but also on other compelling outcomes such as presenteeism and healthcare utilisation, thereby suggesting that the intervention is a viable approach for improving sleep, but also possibly productivity and general health and well-being among workers.</p>
              <p>The cost of sleep insufficient and untreated sleep disorders in the workplace is staggering.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 20</xref> Despite a growing number of studies evaluating the financial impact of sleep and sleep disorders, thereâs a paucity of evidence regarding the utility of a workplace wellness programme focused on sleep improvement for addressing these social and economic costs. Our study offers a validated assessment of the cost-effective benefits resulting from a SHAW programme coupled with access to a tailored, digitally enabled and highly personalised smartphone app (dayzz).</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>This study has several limitations. First, the participants recruited in our trial were affiliated with a single employer. Though the occupational roles in our sample were diverse, our results may not generalise to other employee or employer populations. Moreover, access to a smartphone and regular use of smartphone apps was a requirement for study participation. It is possible that this study did not include low wage workers in the employee population without access to these resources, which limits the generalisation of our findings. Another limitation of our findings is that we only included day workers in this study. Shift workers have well-documented barriers to healthy sleep and increased burden of untreated sleep disorders. Future research is needed to determine the feasibility of this intervention for those employee groups. Further, the pandemic offered greater flexibility of work schedules for many workers. It is worth noting that both groups increased sleep duration during the study interval, which spanned the COVID-19 pandemic, yet employees in the intervention condition increased their sleep to a greater extent than employees in the control condition. The outcomes in this study are subject to several forms of bias, including selection bias and healthy worker bias at study entry, as well as recall or self-reporting bias and social desirability bias throughout data collection. The groups were balanced on known confounders at baseline. The randomised design limits the likelihood of differential misclassification of outcomes throughout the study. Finally, attrition was greater in the intervention group, compared with the control, perhaps due to more initial study requirements, which may have biased the results. Differential attrition was considered in the statistical plan, and the total number of surveys completed between the groups was nearly identical.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In summary, this randomised, remote, employee-centred clinical trial demonstrates that a brief, online sleep health education paired with a digital personalised sleep training programme is effective at increasing sleep quality and sleep duration, lowering presenteeism and reducing the rate of healthcare utilisation, presenting a clinical and economic benefit to the employee and employer. Future research may apply the approach taken in this trial to employees on other work schedules, such as shift workers.</p>
