                <p id="Par1">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, but pharmacological treatments are ineffective in a substantial fraction of patients and are accompanied by unwanted side effects. Here we evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 10 Hz, which we hypothesized would improve clinical symptoms by renormalizing alpha oscillations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). To this end, 32 participants with MDD were randomized to 1 of 3 arms and received daily 40 min sessions of either 10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, or active sham stimulation for 5 consecutive days. Symptom improvement was assessed using the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as the primary outcome. High-density electroencephalograms (hdEEGs) were recorded to measure changes in alpha oscillations as the secondary outcome. For the primary outcome, we did not observe a significant interaction between treatment condition (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, sham) and session (baseline to 4 weeks after completion of treatment); however, exploratory analyses show that 2 weeks after completion of the intervention, the 10 Hz-tACS group had more responders (MADRS and HDRS) compared with 40 Hz-tACS and sham groups (<italic>n</italic> = 30, <italic>p</italic> <italic>=</italic> 0.026). Concurrently, we found a significant reduction in alpha power over the left frontal regions in EEG after completion of the intervention for the group that received per-protocol 10 Hz-tACS (<italic>n</italic> = 26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that targeting oscillations with tACS has potential as a therapeutic intervention for treatment of MDD.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, severe psychiatric illness that has a lifetime prevalence of about 16.6% in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and results in the highest burden of disability among all mental and behavioral disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Current recommended drug therapies are associated with suboptimal remission rates and, oftentimes, undesirable side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the effects of pharmacological agents are widespread; in contrast, interventions that can target specific abnormalities in brain activity may permit greater therapeutic precision. Patients with MDD exhibit elevated oscillatory activity, specifically in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which is often localized to left frontal regions, resulting in what has been called “frontal alpha asymmetry”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although alpha oscillations serve important functions in the healthy brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, increased alpha oscillation strength in depressed patients represents a state of neuronal hypoactivity leading to disrupted affective processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, renormalizing this elevated alpha activity could potentially mitigate symptoms of MDD. Brain activity can be altered with noninvasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation. Rhythmic TMS bursts at the alpha frequency can entrain brain activity in healthy humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and synchronized TMS at individualized alpha frequencies has been evaluated for the treatment of MDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, although TMS has not yet been demonstrated to alter alpha oscillations in these patients.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Another stimulation paradigm used to modulate endogenous brain activity is transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which applies a weak electric current with a sine-wave pattern to the scalp. Such sine-wave stimulation may better lend itself to targeting oscillatory brain activity than methods such as TMS. TACS can modulate cortical oscillations that mediate cognitive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and can selectively modulate oscillations at the applied frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, the side effects of tACS are mild and transient, and no serious adverse events have yet been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Despite these promising results, tACS has not yet been tested as a possible therapeutic intervention for MDD. To address this gap in knowledge, we hypothesized that tACS at 10 Hz targeting both left and right frontal areas with synchronous stimulation would improve the symptoms of MDD and restore a more physiological balance of alpha oscillations by reducing the pathologically elevated power of the alpha oscillation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).</p>
              <p id="Par4">To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot double-blind study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of tACS as a treatment for the symptoms of depression. Patients diagnosed with MDD were randomized to one of three arms to compare 10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, and active sham stimulation. The investigation of a second, different stimulation frequency (i.e., 40 Hz) served to assess whether symptom and electrophysiological changes were frequency-dependent or merely stimulation-dependent. The tACS intervention comprised 40 min of daily stimulation for 5 consecutive days. The primary outcome was the change in Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from baseline to the final follow-up study visit 4 weeks after completion of the intervention. To understand how tACS affects brain activity, we measured alpha power changes using high-density electroencephalography as our secondary outcome.</p>

              <p id="Par5">This study was a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled pilot clinical trial conducted at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from May 2015 to June 2017 and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02339285). The study was approved by the Biomedical Institutional Review Board at UNC Chapel Hill (IRB # 14-1622) and used a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) through the North Carolina Translational &amp; Clinical Studies Institute, to ensure participant safety. Bi-annual reviews of blinded data and adverse events were submitted to the DSMB. All participants provided written informed consent before all study-related activities.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="Par6">A total of 32 patients (27 female; aged 36.69 ± 13.08 years) diagnosed with unipolar, non-psychotic MDD (confirmed with the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) of &gt;8 and low suicide risk, defined as scoring &lt;3 on the Suicide Item on the HDRS, were randomized in this trial. Previous treatments include medication (94% reported) and therapy (69% reported), indicating the enrolled participants in this sample have attempted to treat their depression before enrollment. Of the 32 enrolled participants (defined as intent-to-treat, or ITT, sample), 26 completed all study visits as designed (defined as per-protocol, or PP, sample; see CONSORT). Screened participants were excluded from participation for the following reasons: concurrent anticonvulsant medications or daily treatments with benzodiazepines (limited as-needed use that was discontinued more than 48 h before a study session was allowed); diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence (other than nicotine) within the last 12 months; current Axis I mood or psychotic disorder other than MDD; lifetime comorbid psychiatric bipolar or psychotic disorder; eating disorder (current or within the past 6 months); obsessive-compulsive disorder (lifetime); post-traumatic stress disorder (current or within the last 6 months); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (currently under treatment); history of significant head injury or traumatic brain injury, prior brain surgery, or any brain devices/implants; history of seizures, unstable medical illness, or pregnancy. Although not an exclusion criterion, none of the participants were left-handed (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, 82.8 ± 24.9). Screened participants were not excluded for use of antidepressants and 38% of participants were on at least one antidepressant at the time of enrollment. To control for changes in medication, participants were required to be at least 6 weeks stable on their antidepressants.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed with a preliminary phone screening and then more extensively at the initial session with the study coordinator. At the initial session, participants signed consent and completed several questionnaires (demographics, Edinburgh handedness Inventory, “Hunter Beliefs About Treatment Questionnaire,” used with permission of the UCLA Laboratory of Brain, Behavior, and Pharmacology, ©2005, 2017 UC Regents). In addition, the study coordinator administered the M.I.N.I. and the HDRS to confirm eligibility. Before randomization, eligible participants also met with an experienced mood disorders clinician (D.R.R.) to further assess their clinical symptoms and to verify the participants met the inclusion criteria. Once eligibility was confirmed, participants returned for 5 consecutive days of treatment (Day 1 to Day 5). Baseline scores for all assessments were completed on Day 1. Participants also attended a 2-week follow-up and a 4-week follow-up after they completed the week of stimulation.</p>

Intervention type was based on study codes prepared by a member of the research lab, who was not otherwise associated with the study, and codes were randomized such that no more than three participants in a row received the same intervention. All authors and members of the research team were unaware of the group assignments until completion of the entire study. To administer stimulation in a double-blind manner, we developed a custom Matlab-controlled computer interface (Mathworks, Natick, MA; NIDaq USB 6001, National Instruments, TX, USA) to control two Neuroconn DC plus stimulators (Neuroconn Ltd., Ilmenau, Germany) that delivered the stimulation based on the study code entered. To ensure that the correct waveform was applied for each session, this interface recorded the applied waveform for subsequent verification by a group member not associated with the study.</p>

                <p id="Par10">Each participant completed 5 consecutive days of the intervention (40 min of stimulation) at approximately the same time of day (±90 min). The choice of intervention duration (5 consecutive days, 40 min each day) was informed by a previous study of transcranial direct current stimulation, which found efficacy 4 weeks after completion of treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The tACS stimulation waveform was a sine-wave with an amplitude of 2 mA at Cz and an amplitude of 1 mA at F3 and F4 (amplitudes are reported as zero-to-peak). There were two tACS conditions: the proposed therapeutic frequency of 10 Hz and the control frequency of 40 Hz. Previous research indicates that gamma oscillations have a stronger relationship to cognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and would theoretically not target alpha oscillations and not result in mood symptom changes; therefore, 40 Hz-tACS would be an appropriate control frequency for this trial. Active sham stimulation included 20 s of ramp-in to 40 s of 10 Hz-tACS, with a ramp-out of 20 s, for a total of 80 s of stimulation. Both 10 Hz and 40 Hz-tACS included 20 s of ramp-in to 40 min of stimulation, with a ramp-out of 20 s for a total of 2440 s of stimulation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). During each stimulation session, participants were seated comfortably upright with their eyes open and were asked to focus on a ReefScapes video (Undersea Productions, Queensland, Australia) presented on a large projector screen directly in front of them. This video served the purpose of masking the phosphenes induced by tACS and keeping all participants in the same state during stimulation sessions. On the final day of stimulation (Day 5), participants were asked whether they believed they received stimulation over the past week (Yes, No, I don’t know) to assess blinding.</p>

RSEEG was administered before the final stimulation on Day 5 to avoid recording the immediate aftereffects of tACS. Participants followed pre-programmed computer-generated instructions (Presentation, Neurobehavioral Systems, CA, USA) and had their eyes closed for 2 min, following which they had their eyes open for 2 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This sequence was repeated twice resulting in a total of 8 min of RSEEG. The sequence was counterbalanced across participants, i.e., half of the participants started with 2 min of eyes-open condition and the other half started with 2 min of eyes-closed condition. During the eyes-open condition, participants were instructed to fixate on a cross-hair. Participants also completed a working memory task, the results of which are not presented here.</p>

To determine changes in RSEEG at Day 5 and the 4-week follow-up, spectral power in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) was calculated and decibel-normalized to spectral power estimated from baseline at each individual electrode as well as averages within a topographical region. The former was used to assess significant changes in oscillation power within each group, whereas the latter was used to compare changes across the three groups. In addition, alpha power in baseline session was log-transformed and compared between the groups.</p>

                <p id="Par22">In exploratory analyses, we calculated effect sizes between and within the treatment groups in the ITT sample. We looked at the mean (SD) change in MADRS from baseline to Day 5, the 2-week follow-up, and the 4-week follow-up (Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The change in scores from baseline to the 4-week follow-up demonstrated a moderate effect size between conditions (<italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.060) and the largest effect size was seen in the change from baseline to the 2-week follow-up (<italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.116). We also calculated Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> in each treatment group from baseline to Day 5, the 2-week follow-up, and the 4-week follow-up. For the MADRS, the largest within-group effect size was seen in the 10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 2-week follow-up (<italic>d</italic> = 1.70), with the next largest seen in the 10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 4-week follow-up (<italic>d</italic> = 1.60).</p>

The mean (SD) change in HDRS from baseline to the 4-week follow-up was −8.67 (5.32) for 10 Hz-tACS, −5.20 (5.67) for 40 Hz-tACS, and −5.11 (7.61) for sham stimulation. Similar to the MADRS, this change demonstrated a moderate between-group effect size (<italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.071).

              <p id="Par30">This pilot clinical trial was designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of tACS as a treatment for the symptoms of MDD. Although our primary outcome measure, change in MADRS at the 4-week follow-up in the ITT sample, was not significantly different between the groups, 10 Hz-tACS significantly outperformed 40 Hz-tACS and sham stimulation in terms of response rates at the 2-week follow-up. These results were consistent in both clinician-administered measures (MADRS, HDRS). In addition, 10 Hz-tACS was also effective in engaging alpha oscillations compared with sham or 40 Hz-tACS. Taken together, our results suggest that targeting alpha oscillations with tACS is a potentially viable therapeutic approach and a fully powered subsequent study is justified to further establish tACS as a treatment for depression.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Stimulation was tolerated well by the participants, with no serious adverse events related to the stimulation reported and no development of mania, hypomania, or increase in suicidal ideation as a result of stimulation. Retention rates were high for all three groups. These data indicate that future trials using tACS are feasible in this population.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Our physiological target in this study was frontal alpha oscillations. Altered alpha oscillations are thought to be a key physiological marker in patients with MDD. Resting state recordings in patients with MDD are characterized by increased synchrony in the theta and alpha frequency bands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the latter of which likely emerges from abnormal thalamocortical connectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In addition, alpha activity in the left frontal regions has been shown to be higher than that of the right frontal regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This increased, asymmetric alpha activity is thought to reflect reduced neuronal activity in the left dlPFC, one of several key regions identified as abnormal in brain imaging studies of depression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Although repetitive TMS (rTMS) studies for treating depression often use stimulation frequencies around the alpha band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the effect of rTMS on oscillations in patients with MDD has seldom been demonstrated, except in a few case studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The 10 Hz-tACS led to significantly reduced alpha oscillations over the left frontal regions along with the highest response rates, suggesting that successful reshaping of disrupted oscillations may have led to the decreased symptoms observed, despite the fact that alpha asymmetry was not observed in our sample. This indicates that 10 Hz-tACS may have a therapeutic effect regardless of asymmetry. However, our interpretation of the results is limited by the fact that we did not collect RSEEG data at the 2-week follow-up. In studies with healthy volunteers, tACS has often been suggested to increase alpha power immediately after stimulation with effects lasting up to 70 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast, our results indicate a decrease in alpha power. The differences could be attributed to dosage (five sessions of 40 min stimulation vs. one session of 20 min stimulation). Alternatively, the differences could be due to the altered network oscillations in patients with MDD (i.e., the impact of tACS may differ in the presence of abnormal alpha activity). The exact mechanism of tACS has not yet been determined. Studies suggest tACS could induce entrainment of cortical oscillations or plasticity (or likely a combination of both)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The effects of periodic perturbation have been shown to be state-dependent, further confounding the possible mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Although the immediate after-effect of tACS may be enhancement in alpha power, repeated application of tACS may lead to a resetting of oscillators potentially through homeostatic mechanisms resulting in a decrease in alpha power, as is proposed for rTMS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms underlying the effect of tACS in patients with aberrant network oscillations.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Despite the promising results as measured by clinician-administered assessments (MADRS, HDRS), we did not see the same results in the self-report measure of the BDI. This may be due to the different time frame (past week vs. past 2 weeks) or that patients may have a delay in recognizing symptom changes compared to clinicians.</p>
              <p id="Par34">This study has several limitations. First, this was an exploratory pilot study with a small sample size, powered to detect only large effect sizes. Although we determined our sample sizes based on previous tACS results, our study investigated effects at a longer time frame compared with the previous studies. Second, blinding was not successful in the 40 Hz-tACS group; however, the blinding was successful in the 10 Hz-tACS group, indicating that, at least in this group, the change in symptoms may be more related to the stimulation and less likely a placebo effect. Third, further studies with EEG data collection before and after each stimulation session will be required to strengthen the evidence for alpha oscillations as the target for the 10 Hz-tACS intervention. Finally, as this was a small pilot study, the heterogeneity introduced by medication, therapy, duration of illness, etc., may have affected our results.</p>
              <p id="Par35">To our knowledge, this is the first time tACS has been studied for the treatment of MDD, demonstrating that it may be a feasible and efficacious treatment in this population. With these results, the next steps would be to validate these results in a larger sample that can establish the use of tACS to treat MDD. Future directions may also include investigating dosage, maintenance treatment, and following participants for longer than 4 weeks after treatment.</p>
