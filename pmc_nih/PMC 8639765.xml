                  <title>APPROACH AND RESULTS:</title>
                  <p id="P3">We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02786537">NCT02786537</ext-link>) to compare the effectiveness of DAAs for HCV genotype 1a or 1b on viral response, safety, tolerability, and medication nonadherence. Adults with compensated liver disease, HCV genotype 1, not pregnant or breastfeeding, and with health insurance likely to cover ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) were recruited from 34 US viral hepatitis clinics. Participants were randomized (± ribavirin) to LDV/SOF, elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR), and paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir+dasabuvir (PrOD; treatment arm stopped early). Primary outcomes included sustained viral response at 12 weeks (SVR12), clinician-recorded adverse events, patient-reported symptoms, and medication nonadherence. Between June 2016 and March 2018, 1,609 participants were randomized. Among 1,128 participants who received ≥1 dose of EBR/GZR or LDV/SOF (± ribavirin), SVR12 was 95.2% (95% CI, 92.8%–97.6%) and 97.4% (95% CI, 95.5%–99.2%), respectively, with a difference estimate of 2.2% (−0.5% to 4.7%), falling within the “equivalence” interval (−5% to 5%). While most (56%) participants experienced adverse events, few were serious (4.2%) or severe (1.8%). In the absence of ribavirin, discontinuations due to adverse events were rare. Patient-reported symptoms and medication nonadherence were similar. Study limitations were dropout due to insurance denial and loss to follow-up after treatment, limiting the ability to measure SVR12.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS:</title>
                  <p id="P4">This pragmatic trial demonstrated high SVR12 for participants treated with EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF with few adverse effects. Overall, the two regimens were equivalent in effectiveness. The results support current HCV guidelines that do not distinguish between ribavirin-free EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF.</p>

            <p id="P5">HCV chronically infects more than 2.4 million people in the United States and 70 million people globally, placing these individuals at risk for cirrhosis, liver failure, HCC, and death.<sup>(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup> Compared to those with ongoing infection, persons who achieve HCV cure have markedly lower risk of liver disease complications, and the incidence rate of HCV-related death in the United States has declined with the uptake of curative HCV treatment.<sup>(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> Accordingly, the World Health Organization endorsed the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030, which will require the diagnosis and treatment of most people living with HCV and, if achieved, will reduce HCV-related mortality by 65% over the next 10 years.<sup>(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> In this context, multiple direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are available for the treatment of hepatitis C including the most common strain in the United States and world, HCV genotype 1.</p>
            <p id="P6">Recommended DAA regimens for persons who have not been previously treated combine two drugs that target different steps in the HCV life cycle to create effective antiviral regimens, including HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitors (elbasvir [EBR], ledipasvir [LDV], velpatasvir) and NS3 protease inhibitors (grazoprevir [GZR]) or NS5B polymerase inhibitors (sofosbuvir [SOF]).<sup>(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Although recommended as first-line therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection, these combinations may have different safety, tolerability, and efficacy in some patient subpopulations. Despite the widespread use of these and other DAA regimens, evidence of comparative effectiveness from randomized controlled trials is unavailable.</p>
            <p id="P7">We conducted a comparative effectiveness study, designed as a randomized, pragmatic clinical trial (The PRIORITZE Study, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02786537">NCT02786537</ext-link>) of the effectiveness of three DAA regimens for treatment of HCV genotype 1a or 1b on (1) sustained viral response at 12 weeks posttreatment (SVR12), (2) clinician-recorded adverse events (AEs), (3) patient-reported symptoms and functional well-being, and (4) patient-reported medication nonadherence.</p>

                <title>STUDY DESIGN</title>
                <p id="P8">PRIORITIZE was a multicenter, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial comparing three DAA regimens: LDV/SOF (Harvoni; Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA); EBR/GZR (Zepatier; Merck and Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ); paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir + dasabuvir (PrOD; Viekira Pak/Viekira XR; AbbVie Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Park, IL) (phase 1 only). Consistent with prescribing information and guidelines, ribavirin (RBV) could be added to any regimen at the discretion of the treating clinician. Treatment assignment was open label, and efficacy outcomes were unblinded.</p>
                <p id="P9">We planned to randomize 3,750 participants in a 1:1:1 ratio. In January 2017, in anticipation of a US guideline<sup>(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> recommendation that PrOD + RBV was to become nonpreferred for genotype 1a infection, randomization to PrOD was discontinued (defining the end of phase 1). In phase 2, enrollees were randomized 1:1 to LDV/SOF or EBR/GZR.</p>
                <p id="P10">At the start of phase 2, a blinded update of the sample size estimation accounted for the loss of one arm and the low prevalence (~15%) of cirrhosis in phase 1. The revised enrollment target was 1,600 enrolled participants. In both phases, randomization was stratified by cirrhosis status and genotype 1 subtype (a or b). This report is limited to outcomes from LDV/SOF and EBR/GZR in phases 1 and 2. Because the regimen was discontinued in the United States and no longer recommended in other regions, comparisons to PrOD in phase 1 are available in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>.</p>

                <p id="P11">The Data Coordinating Center used a Research Data-Capture (REDCap) system to conceal the randomized allocation of treatment assignments, to validate patient eligibility, and to capture and manage the study data. The Clinical Coordinating Center used the operational infrastructure of the HCV-TARGET Research Network<sup>(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> for standardized, centralized chart data abstraction and targeted data monitoring. All survey instruments were administered by phone interview or by a secure, web-based link into the REDCap system. Participants received $40 remuneration for completing each survey session.</p>

                <p id="P12">Adult participants (&gt;18 years) with chronic HCV genotype 1a or 1b infection who presented for initial antiviral treatment were invited to participate if, in their clinician’s opinion, therapy with any of the study regimens was appropriate. The 34 study sites were selected from those participating in the HCV-TARGET network. Site clinicians were generally experienced with the management of patients with chronic HCV infection based on their involvement in HCV-TARGET (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Table S1</xref>). Individuals were excluded for inability to provide written informed consent, current or historical evidence of hepatic decompensation (variceal bleeding, HE, or ascites) unless this was prior to successful liver transplant, Child-Turcotte-Pugh stage B or C cirrhosis, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or health insurance that did not permit LDV/SOF which was not provided by the study. Individuals with HIV coinfection, organ transplantation, substance use disorder (past or current), and other medical or psychiatric conditions were eligible.</p>

Regardless of the source of medication, participants were treated according to standard practice which, while not protocol-mandated, generally followed US prescribing information and HCV guidelines.<sup>(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> All participants were offered free, real-time testing for the presence of NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, and 93 (Laboratory Corporation of America, Burlington, NC). LDV/SOF was administered as one tablet (90/400 mg) daily for 8 or 12 weeks at clinician discretion. EBR/GZR was administered as one tablet (50/100 mg) daily for 12 weeks; participants infected with NS5A-resistant genotype 1a received 16 weeks of EBR/GZR plus twice-daily RBV dosed according to body weight.</p>

Intent-to-treat estimation was modified (mITT) due to missing values for enrollees who did not start treatment or did not return for SVR12 evaluations. To cope with missing data, we followed the approach of White et al.: (1) attempt to avoid missing data, (2) use nonmissing data to perform a main analysis specified <italic>a priori</italic> that is valid under plausible assumptions about causes of missing data, (3) use sensitivity analyses to guide trust in the main results by evaluating their robustness/fragility to reasonable perturbations of assumptions and methods used, and (4) account for all randomized enrollees in at least one sensitivity analysis.<sup>(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup> For the main analyses we anticipated and assumed mechanisms that caused missing data are ignorable. In our sensitivity analyses, baseline characteristics of all randomized enrollees played an important role in our investigation of potential selection biases; e.g., we used inverse-probability weighting, multiple imputation of outcomes, as-treated analyses, and variations on model assumptions. In the main analyses, we modeled the assigned DAA regimen, cirrhosis status, genotype 1 subtype, and specified covariates (sex, age group, treatment-naive status, race) along with terms representing interactions of regimen with cirrhosis, subgenotype, and race.</p>

                  <title>SVR12 effectiveness</title>
                  <p id="P19">Due to the small number of participants not achieving SVR12, the main logistic regression model for effectiveness represented the probability of achieving SVR12 as a function of just three variables: assigned DAA regimen, cirrhosis status, and subtype. Fitted using Firth’s penalized likelihood method,<sup>(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> this model provided point and interval estimates of the regimen-specific proportions (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>) and their difference (P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>2</sub>) in the target population. We performed a superiority test of the null hypothesis “(P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>2</sub>) = 0 in the target population” and an equivalence test of the null hypothesis “|P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>2</sub>| ≥ 5% in the target population.” It is plausible that both null hypotheses are false (i.e., 0% &lt; |P<sub>1</sub> – P<sub>2</sub>| &lt; 5%). For hypothesis generation regarding heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE), (1) covariates were added to the model one at a time to avoid overfitting bias, (2) an overfitted logistic model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized likelihood estimation was explored, and (3) unadjusted SVR12 frequencies for subgroups were examined.</p>

In these constrained longitudinal data analysis models,<sup>(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> the baseline score was treated as one of the longitudinal outcomes, and mean response was represented as a function of the as-randomized regimen and the <italic>a priori</italic> covariates and interactions described. Therefore, an on-treatment mean increase from baseline would be evidence of participants becoming more symptomatic during treatment. The models were also used to explore subgroup differences and HTE.

Of these randomized participants, 1,128 received at least one dose of EBR/GZR (n = 700) or LDV/SOF (n = 428) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and were followed longitudinally. Failure to initiate therapy was more frequent among participants randomized to LDV/SOF (41%, 298 of 726 participants) than EBR/GZR (4%, 29 of 729 participants). Of the 726 enrollees randomized to LDV/SOF, 150 (21%) experienced insurance denial of treatment, and another 168 (23%) did not start for diverse reasons, including the burden of the prior authorization process; 408 were treated with LDV/SOF, and 20 (with insurance denials) were treated with EBR/GZR. Insurance denials of LDV/SOF were primarily by state Medicaid programs (75% of the 150 denials).<sup>(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup> The 1,128 treated participants were more commonly men (60%) than women (40%), the mean age was 55 years, approximately 42% were Black, 17% had cirrhosis, and 3% had HIV coinfection. NS5A RASs at key amino acid positions (28, 30, 31, or 93) were detected in 9.9% and 12.6% of participants receiving EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF, respectively.

                <p id="P29">The percentage of participants treated with EBR/GZR or LDV/SOF with any AE was 56% (628 of 1,129 participants). Among those patients experiencing any AE, most had AEs coded as related to HCV treatment (601 of 628 patients with AEs). Participants taking DAAs plus RBV reported more AEs than those not taking DAAs alone. The most common AEs recorded in the medical record were fatigue (19%), headache (16%), and nausea (9.1%). Anemia (27%), dizziness (10%), and insomnia (10%) were observed almost exclusively in participants prescribed RBV. Severe AEs were observed in 1.8% (n = 23) of 1,129 participants. Serious AEs occurred in 4.2% (42 participants with 53 events), of which two were considered treatment-related, chest pain and flare of HBV infection.</p>

Hepatic decompensation was not observed in the 102 participants with cirrhosis who received the HCV protease inhibitor GZR (part of the EBR/GZR regimen); however, one patient without cirrhosis treated with EBR/GZR had HBV reactivation with evidence of trace ascites. Early discontinuation of treatment due to an AE occurred in 22 participants, and the incidence was similar in participants treated with LDV/SOF (7 of 409, 1.7%) and EBR/GZR (15/720, 2.1%).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P34">This pragmatic trial is a comparative effectiveness study for oral DAAs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. We treated 1,128 participants with genotype 1 infection at 34 clinical sites in the United States and randomly assigned them to one of two recommended antiviral regimens. Consistent with observations from efficacy trials and clinical cohorts, SVR12 proportions were high for both DAA regimens (≥95%), and HCV virologic failure was uncommon (&lt;1%). In the absence of ribavirin, the DAA regimens had similar side-effect profiles based on the medical records, and treated participants reported improved symptoms and functional well-being during and after therapy. These findings have important implications for the treatment of HCV infection, globally and by nonspecialists, because the safety and tolerability of RBV-free regimens allow for minimal monitoring during therapy.</p>
              <p id="P35">The randomized design of our study allowed for direct comparison of the effectiveness and side-effect profile of these two recommended DAA regimens, EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF. The overall SVR12 proportions were similar, with strong evidence that the two regimens are equivalent in the target population. Compared to the registration trial enrollment for these regimens (EBR/GZR, 18%; LDV/SOF, 12%–15%), we enrolled a significantly larger proportion of Black Americans. Approximately 42% of the PRIORITIZE study populations was Black, allowing for greater precision around the estimated SVR12 rate, which was similar for both DAA regimens and the SVR observed in non-Black participants. The high participation rate in the study by Black Americans, a group underrepresented in HCV trials, also provides a roadmap for continued engagement to reduce HCV-related disparities and health inequities, essential for the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat.<sup>(<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)</sup></p>
              <p id="P36">We also observed small differences in the unadjusted SVR12 proportions in important patient subgroups in exploratory analyses conducted for hypothesis generation. For both EBR/GZR and LDV/SOF, the SVR12 rate was lower in participants with NS5A RASs compared to those with wild-type HCV. Because only 1 in 10 patients had evidence of baseline NS5A resistance and the impact of SVR was similar for both DAA regimens, we do not believe that our data support routine RAS testing prior to therapy. We also observed small differences in the unadjusted SVR12 proportions favoring LDV/SOF in women, in those with genotype 1a infection, and in those without cirrhosis. Conversely, these small differences in the unadjusted SVR12 proportions favored EBR/GZR in participants with cirrhosis. These exploratory observations are consistent with reports from uncontrolled trials of each regimen and may serve to guide the selection of HCV treatment regimen by patients and clinicians.<sup>(<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>)</sup></p>
              <p id="P37">Overall, 56% of participants experienced some AEs during treatment; but few were severe (1.8%) or serious (3.7%), and few participants (&lt;2%) discontinued RBV-free treatment due to an AE. As expected, participants who received RBV experienced more AEs unique to RBV use. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities were uncommon with RBV-free DAAs with few treatment-related serious AEs including liver-related events in persons taking HCV protease inhibitors, which has been associated with liver dysfunction and death in participants with moderate to severe liver impairment.<sup>(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)</sup> In our study population, which did not include persons with decompensated cirrhosis, liver-related AEs were rare. We also measured PROs with surveys to evaluate changes in headache, nausea, and fatigue from baseline, demonstrating that, on average, these symptoms did not worsen during either treatment regimen, consistent with previous studies of PROs.<sup>(<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)</sup> Similarly, functional well-being improved on average during treatment with both regimens and especially in participants receiving LDV/SOF.</p>
              <p id="P38">Our study findings should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. (1) Due to the economic barriers in accessing HCV treatment in the United States at the time of this study, we provided participants with EBR/GZR sourced directly from a commercial manufacturer, whereas LDV/SOF was sourced externally through commercial or other health insurance. As a result of health insurance denial and other barriers to treatment access (e.g., prior authorization), failure to start treatment was more common in participants randomized to LDV/SOF, resulting in some imbalances in patient characteristics between the treatment arms. Despite this, our sensitivity analyses indicated that these occurrences of pretreatment dropout (as well as posttreatment dropouts) did not induce selection biases. Further, the observation that curative treatment was denied to 41% of patients using health insurance underscores the impact of systemic barriers to HCV elimination. (2) The HCV treatment landscape changed rapidly during our study, leading to discontinuation of one arm (PrOD) and modification of our research plans. (3) Several factors (e.g., declining prevalence of cirrhosis and loss to follow-up during and after treatment) limited the number of non-SVR12 cases to a level (n = 40) that did not support our intended investigation of the HTE across subgroups. To avoid overfitting bias, the logistic model for SVR12 analysis was limited to accounting for only three factors—regimen, cirrhosis, and genotype 1 subtype— and inclusion of subgroup-by-treatment interaction terms was not feasible. (4) Based on feedback from patient stakeholders during the study design phase, we did not collect data related to active substance use, which precludes analysis. (5) We were not able to evaluate the two newer, pangenotypic regimens, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and SOF/velpatasvir, as they were not available at the time of the study.</p>
              <p id="P39">The PRIORITIZE study is a large randomized controlled trial to compare oral DAA regimens for the treatment of chronic HCV infection on effectiveness, safety, side effects, and medication adherence in a usual clinical-care setting. Our findings are consistent with observations from controlled phase 3 efficacy trials and uncontrolled cohort studies, demonstrating high SVR12 proportions with few virologic failures and, in the absence of RBV, minimal adverse effects. Our data support HCV guidelines that do not distinguish between RBV-free EBR/GZR or LDV/SOF for the treatment of persons with compensated liver disease due to HCV genotype 1 infection. While this trial had a large, representative population, there was a low proportion of patients with cirrhosis, and there were no patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The findings may not generalize to the larger HCV population including decompensated cirrhosis, younger people injecting drugs, veterans, and those incarcerated.</p>
              <p id="P40">Future randomized controlled trials should focus on the comparative effectiveness of the recommended pangenotypic DAA regimens SOF/velpatasvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.</p>

The model expressed mean score as a function of DAA regimen, cirrhosis status, HCV genotype, sex, age, race, and previous treatment status. <sup>2</sup>95% confidence interval estimate. ³p-value for a test of the null hypothesis “the parameter is zero in the target population”. <sup>4</sup>Difference of the mean change for LDV/SOF minus the mean change for EBR/GZR. <sup>5</sup>The scale for function and well-being is reversed (= 100-HCV-PRO) for directional consistency with symptom scores. <sup>6</sup>The scare for “Headache” is the HIT-6 score. The scare for “Nausea” is the PROMIS® Nausea Short Form T-score. The scale for “Fatigue” is the PROMIS® Fatigue Short Form T-score. Negative values for mean change represent improvement, while negative values for “Difference” indicate the LDV/SOF performed better than EBR/GZR.</p>
