              <abstract>
                <p>SAMHD1 is a newly identified anti-HIV host factor that has a dNTP triphosphohydrolase activity and depletes intracellular dNTP pools in non-dividing myeloid cells. Since DNA viruses utilize cellular dNTPs, we investigated whether SAMHD1 limits the replication of DNA viruses in non-dividing myeloid target cells. Indeed, two double stranded DNA viruses, vaccinia and herpes simplex virus type 1, are subject to SAMHD1 restriction in non-dividing target cells in a dNTP dependent manner. Using a thymidine kinase deficient strain of vaccinia virus, we demonstrate a greater restriction of viral replication in non-dividing cells expressing SAMHD1. Therefore, this study suggests that SAMHD1 is a potential innate anti-viral player that suppresses the replication of a wide range of DNA viruses, as well as retroviruses, which infect non-dividing myeloid cells.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Various viral pathogens such as HIV-1, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and vaccinia virus infect terminally-differentiated/non-dividing macrophages during the course of viral pathogenesis. Unlike dividing cells, non-dividing cells lack chromosomal DNA replication, do not enter the cell cycle, and harbor very low levels of cellular dNTPs, which are substrates of viral DNA polymerases. A series of recent studies revealed that the host protein SAMHD1 is dNTP triphosphohydrolase, which contributes to the poor dNTP abundance in non-dividing myeloid cells, and restricts proviral DNA synthesis of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses in macrophages, dendritic cells, and resting T cells. In this report, we demonstrate that SAMHD1 also controls the replication of large dsDNA viruses: vaccinia virus and HSV-1, in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. SAMHD1 suppresses the replication of these DNA viruses to an even greater extent in the absence of viral genes that are involved in dNTP metabolism such as thymidine kinase. Therefore, this study supports that dsDNA viruses evolved to express enzymes necessary to increase the levels of dNTPs as a mechanism to overcome the restriction induced by SAMHD1 in myeloid cells.</p>

              <p>It is becoming increasingly evident that host cells employ metabolic regulatory mechanisms in order to restrict the life cycle of pathogens <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Craveiro1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bugianesi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Munger1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Munger2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The recent discovery of sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain and histidine-aspartic (HD) domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) has contributed to our understanding of the metabolic regulation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the substrate for cellular DNA polymerases to synthesize and repair host DNA. SAMHD1 expression limits proviral DNA synthesis in lentiviruses particularly in non-dividing myeloid cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laguette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lahouassa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. SAMHD1 is a dNTPs triphosphohydrolase, and functions by hydrolyzing dNTPs into dNs and triphosphates <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Goldstone1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Powell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, thus leading to the reduction of cellular dNTP concentrations <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This in turn can impact the kinetics of cellular, viral, and parasitic DNA polymerization by reducing the availability of dNTP substrate for the enzyme.</p>
              <p>Cellular dNTP concentrations are significantly varied among cell types <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Jamburuthugoda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Due to the close link between S phase-dependent dNTP biosynthesis and cellular DNA replication, dividing cells harbor an abundant amount of dNTPs compared to non-dividing cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Traut1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Indeed, we previously reported that terminally differentiated/non-dividing monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), which are a HIV target cell type <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, have 22–320 times lower dNTP concentrations compared to actively dividing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Even though lentiviral reverse transcriptases (RT) have evolved to function at low dNTP concentrations, the limited dNTP availability contributes to a significant delay in proviral DNA synthesis in macrophages as compared to activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Amie1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, some lentiviruses, such as HIV-2 and SIVsm, encode an accessory protein called viral protein X (Vpx) that overcomes the SAMHD1-induced dNTP depletion in non-dividing target cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laguette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Upon infection, virally co-packaged Vpx promotes proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1 <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bergamaschi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Goujon1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, leading to the rapid elevation of cellular dNTP concentrations and ultimately the acceleration of proviral DNA synthesis <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lahouassa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Both the Vpx-induced dNTP pool elevation and the promotion of viral reverse transcription were observed in several non-dividing viral target cell types which include macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laguette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lahouassa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, DCs <xref rid="ppat.1003481-StGelais1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bobadilla1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and resting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Descours1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Baldauf1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Moreover, all these cell types play a significant role in lentiviral pathogenesis. In addition, HIV-1 replicated more efficiently in monocytes isolated from Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome patients, who have mutations in <italic>SAMHD1</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003481-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The enhanced HIV-1 replication likely resulted from the elevated cellular dNTP pools due to loss of phosphohydrolase activity of mutated SAMHD1 <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Rice1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A recent study also reported that other retroviruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, N-tropic and B-tropic murine leukemia viruses and equine infectious anemia virus were subject to restriction by SAMHD1 in macrophages, and this restriction was counteracted by the expression of Vpx <xref rid="ppat.1003481-White1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. These recent SAMHD1/Vpx studies support the hypothesis that SAMHD1 imposes a strong evolutionary selective pressure against lentiviral proviral DNA synthesis in non-dividing target cells by limiting dNTPs, the essential metabolic building blocks for DNA.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, large double stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses such as vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus also infect non-dividing cells such as macrophages during the course of infection <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Rubins1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-EitzFerrer1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Stinski1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bustos1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-DomkeOpitz1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-LopezGuerrero1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, unlike lentiviruses, these large dsDNA viruses encode dNTP biosynthesis proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and thymidine kinase (TK) that supply essential dNTP substrates for the viral DNA polymerase. Both of these genes are dispensable for HSV-1 viral replication in dividing cells, but are essential for replication under serum-starvation/non-dividing conditions where dNTP pools are limited <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Thus, it is plausible that the dNTP biosynthesis machinery of dsDNA viruses promotes efficient replication in both dividing and non-dividing target cell types.</p>
              <p>In this study we examined whether SAMHD1 affects the ability of vaccinia virus and HSV-1 to replicate in non-dividing cells. We observed that SAMHD1 controls the replication capacity of these dsDNA viruses by limiting the dNTP concentration.</p>

                <title>Vaccinia virus replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages was enhanced by Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1</title>
                <p>We investigated whether SAMHD1 affects the replication of vaccinia virus, the prototypical poxvirus, in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Vaccinia is a large dsDNA virus that replicates entirely in the cytoplasm of the cell and has staged expression with early, intermediate, and late gene expression. Early genes are transcribed in the core of the virion upon entering the cytoplasm, whereas intermediate and late gene expression requires uncoating and replication of the dsDNA genome. For these studies, we utilized the Western Reserve (WR) strain of vaccinia virus that has the viral core protein (A4) fused to YFP (vA4-YFP), <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. A4 is a late gene and is expressed after the viral genome has been replicated. It has been shown that the delivery of Vpx via lentiviral generated virus-like particles (VLPs) reduced the levels of SAMHD1, and increased the concentrations of dNTPs in MDMs <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laguette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lahouassa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bobadilla1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Baldauf1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Berger2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p>
                <p>First, MDMs were pretreated with VLPs (containing or not containing Vpx) for 24 h, and then infected with virus. At 24 hpi, samples were collected and analyzed by various assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> for a representative donor of MDMs, the productive infection frequency was monitored by examining the level of A4-YFP expression by flow cytometry. We then plotted the data for three independent MDM donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and observed a measurable 1.8- to 2.3-fold increase in the frequency of YFP+ cells treated with Vpx+ VLPs as compared to the Vpx− VLP treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Six MDM donors were infected with A4-YFP WR virus, analyzed by flow cytometry for infection frequency and plotted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003481.s001">Fig. S1</xref>. The means (p&lt;0.05; Mann-Whitney test) for the Vpx− versus Vpx+ VLP groups was 59% and 76%, respectively. Finally, we measured plaque-forming units (PFUs) for the different treatment groups, and found that Vpx+ VLP treatment led to a 1.8- to 4–6-fold increase in the amount of infectious viral particles produced as compared to Vpx− VLP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), To further confirm that the increases observed in infection frequency and PFUs were solely due to Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation, a composite of all the experiments is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003481.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, showing that the no VLP treatment group was comparable to Vpx− VLP treatment group in all parameters.</p>

                <p>Vaccinia thymidine kinase (TK; J2R gene) is an early viral gene and is dispensable for viral replication in tissue culture; but it is important for virulence in animal models <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Buller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Zeh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. TK is a central enzyme in the nucleotide salvage pathway and catalyzes the addition of a monophosphate to deoxythymidine (dT) <xref rid="ppat.1003481-MunchPetersen1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. To look at the involvement of viral TK in the infection of MDMs, the TK gene was removed and replaced with F13L-GFP fusion protein to generate, the WRΔTK (ΔJ2R) strain. The F13 gene is expressed late during infection and MDMs only become GFP+ when productively infected. To validate that the TK deletion, ΔJ2R, did not compromise viral growth, HeLa cells were pretreated with VLPs and then infected with WRΔTK (vΔJ2R/F13L-GFP) or parental WR (vA4-YFP) strain. We found that both strains infected HeLa cells comparably using an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell, and did not require Vpx+ VLPs for enhancing infectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003481.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), which is consistent with published data showing that TK is not essential for infection in tissue culture <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Buller1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To test the importance of viral TK, MDMs were pretreated with VLPs for 24 h and subsequently infected with WRΔTK virus. At 24 hpi, we quantified the frequency of GFP+ MDMs by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, representative donor shown) and plotted the percentages of GFP+ MDMs for three independent donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Similar to the parental WR strain, MDMs pretreated with Vpx+ VLP showed a 2.8- to 6.1-fold increase in the percentage of MDMs expressing the late protein F13L-GFP in the absence of the viral TK gene, indicating an enhancement of viral replication. Six MDM donors were infected with WRΔTK virus, analyzed by flow cytometry and plotted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003481.s001">Fig. S1</xref>. The mean percentages for viral infection were 9% and 24% (p&lt;0.05) for the Vpx− VLP versus Vpx+ VLP groups, respectively. Finally, we observed 3.5- to 27.1-fold increase in PFUs between Vpx+ VLP versus Vpx− VLP treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). PFUs were determined for differentiated THP-1 cells, which were treated with +/−Vpx VLPs and then infected with either WR or WRΔTK virus. THP1 cells showed similar trends to treatment as the primary human MDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003481.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Collectively, data from experiments using WR and WRΔTK viruses suggest that Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation enhances vaccinia virus infection in MDMs, with an even greater enhancement of infection in the absence of the viral encoded TK gene.</p>

                <p>Several lentiviruses encode Vpx.

We tested whether vaccinia virus infection promoted degradation of SAMHD1 in MDMs. Cells were pretreated with Vpx+ or Vpx− VLPs for 24 h and were then infected with either WR or WRΔTK vaccinia viruses at 1 PFU/cell. The following day, MDMs were harvested and lysed to detect SAMHD1 levels by Western blot analysis. Vpx+ VLP treatment showed a substantial decrease in the amount of SAMHD1 (85–99% reduction in protein level as compared to uninfected MDM or infected Vpx− VLP treated MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>; representative donor shown). SAMHD1 expression level data for the three donors are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>. To monitor viral replication, cell lysates were incubated with a GFP antibody, which recognizes both A4-YFP and F13L-GFP (late gene protein products). Immunoblots showed that the Vpx+ VLP pretreated groups for either WR or WRΔTK virus had more protein detected than the Vpx− VLP pretreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating more viral genome replication had occurred in the Vpx+ VLP treatment groups. These data show that vaccinia virus does not promote SAMHD1 degradation in MDMs, and that the enhanced viral replication capability in MDMs was mediated by Vpx+ VLP treatment.</p>

                <title>Vaccinia infection increases dNTP levels, which is further increased by Vpx+ VLP treatment</title>
                <p>Like other large dsDNA viruses, vaccinia virus encodes several dNTP biosynthesis proteins such as TK and RNR <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hruby1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Gammon1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Therefore, we examined cellular dNTP concentrations in MDMs infected with vaccinia virus in the presence and absence of Vpx treatment. To do this, we used a highly sensitive HIV-1 RT-based primer extension assay <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Diamond1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> to monitor changes in dNTP levels for each of the four dNTPs. In this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), the level of the extended primer product (Primer +1) is indicative of the dNTP level. Both fold increases and absolute dNTP concentrations for dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP were determined for the various treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). As shown in lane 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, uninfected MDMs displayed very low levels of dNTPs, indicative of the low cellular dNTP level in MDMs. MDMs infected with WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, lane 4) showed elevated levels for dATP (8.2-fold), dGTP (6.3-fold) and dTTP (3.7-fold), while dCTP (1.0-fold) remained unchanged. Our results demonstrate that virus encoded dNTP biosynthesis machinery was able to elevate the cellular dNTP levels in MDMs. However, when we analyzed the dNTP samples extracted from MDMs infected with WRΔTK virus only dGTP (7.1-fold) and dATP (4.5-fold) were elevated while dCTP (0.8-fold) and dTTP (0.4-fold) were reduced as compared to uninfected MDMs. This demonstrates that WRΔTK is deficient in TK activity. These data indicate that the increased replication of WR strain as compared to WRΔTK strain in MDMs is the result, in part, of increased dTTP biosynthesis.</p>

Collectively, vaccinia infection of MDMs alone only modestly elevated the cellular dNTP pools, which was further enhanced by Vpx+ VLP treatment.

                <title>SAMHD1 also controls infection of HSV-1 viral replication in THP-1 cells</title>
                <p>Next we validated that SAMHD1 controls replication of another large dsDNA virus, HSV-1. For these studies, we infected a human monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells, with an HSV-1 strain (HSV-1 KOS). THP1 cells undergo differentiation to a macrophage-like cell by Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment. In addition, we also used PMA-treated THP-1 cell lines that stably express SAMHD1-specific shRNA (shSAMHD1) or control shRNA (shControl). As previously reported <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we confirmed knockdown of SAMHD1 in the differentiated THP-1 cells expressing SAMHD1 specific shRNA with HSV-1 infections at various MOIs, but not in cells expressing the control shRNA (MOI “0” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). In addition, the SAMHD1 level remained unchanged even with a MOI of 1 for HSV-1 KOS in the shControl THP-1 cells, indicating that like vaccinia virus, HSV-1 does not down-regulate SAMHD1 expression. Next, we monitored the expression of HSV-1 intermediate-early viral protein ICP-4 and late viral protein UL-27 by Western blot analysis. Higher levels of ICP4 and UL-27 were observed in the shSAMHD1 cells as compared with shControl cells, with the most pronounced differences detected at MOIs of 0.1 and 1, (*, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), implying that SAMHD1 suppresses HSV-1 KOS in differentiated THP-1 cells. Next, shControl and shSAMHD1 THP-1 cells were infected with WT HSV-1 KOS virus at MOIs of 0.01 and 0.1, and viral DNA replication was monitored by real-time PCR to determine the level of initial viral input (“2 h” time point) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g005">Fig. 5B &amp; D</xref>) and also my measuring PFUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g005">Fig. 5C &amp; E</xref>).

PFUs increased by 12-fold and 21-fold at 72 hpi for the different groups infected with an MOI 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. Indeed, both HSV-1 genome replication and viral production was clearly augmented in shSAMHD1 cells (dashed lines) as compared with shControl cells (solid lines).</p>

                <p>Next, we examined dATP concentration in differentiated and undifferentiated THP-1 cells that were either infected or uninfected with HSV-1 KOS virus. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, both the uninfected and infected differentiated shSAMHD1 cells showed elevated dATP pools (3.6-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively) as compared to the shControl THP-1 cells, suggesting that HSV-1 infection alone did not promote a significant change in cellular dATP levels. Between undifferentiated shControl and shSAMHD1 THP-1 cells, no difference in dATP concentration was observed for either NI (0.9-fold) or infected (1.1-fold) groups. These data suggest that the dNTP depletion by SAMHD1 can negatively regulate the dNTP pool size even in the presence of HSV-1 dNTP biosynthesis in differentiated THP-1 cells.</p>

                <p>Next we tested whether Vpx treatment could enhance HSV-1 replication in differentiated THP-1 cells. First, the shControl and shSAMHD1 THP-1 cells were treated with Vpx− or Vpx+ VLPs, and the SAMHD1 level was monitored by Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>, Vpx+ VLP treatment effectively degraded SAMHD1 in the shControl THP-1 cells, while shSAMHD1 THP-1 cells showed no detectable SAMHD1 expression regardless of Vpx+ VLP treatment.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Several studies have shown the necessity of both innate and adaptive immune responses in order to control both herpes and poxvirus infections <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lousberg1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Walsh1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Bahar1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laing1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Macrophages are part of the innate immune response and are rapidly recruited to sites of infection. It is therefore not surprising that these cells have developed strategies to limit pathogen replication within them. A series of recent studies highlighted SAMHD1, a cellular dNTP triphosphohydrolase, as an anti-lentiviral restriction factor predominantly found in myeloid cells <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Hrecka1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Laguette1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Lahouassa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-White1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-StGelais2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Puigdomenech1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Since dNTPs are universal substrates for cellular, parasitic, and viral DNA polymerases, it seems likely that cellular dNTP concentrations could influence the genome replication of all dsDNA viruses. We attempted to expand the role of SAMHD1 as a restriction factor against large dsDNA viruses such as vaccinia virus and HSV-1. Indeed, the results presented in this study support the theory that SAMHD1 suppresses the replication capacity of these dsDNA viruses in a similar manner observed with HIV-1 and HIV-2 lentiviruses, by depleting the cellular dNTP pools and thus limiting the substrate availability for viral DNA polymerases.</p>
              <p>Viral replication occurs in different compartments for vaccinia virus and HSV-1. Like retroviruses, vaccinia virus undergoes DNA synthesis outside the nucleus and sets up a cytoplasmic viral factory for replication of its genomic DNA <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Yuwen1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In contrast, the HSV-1 genome is replicated in the host cell nucleus <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Placek1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and is dependent on nuclear import <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Liashkovich1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This difference in cellular localization of viral genome replication may contribute to the complexity in understanding each virus; but clearly from our data, high cellular dNTP pools appears to be critical for efficient viral genome replication regardless of the cellular compartment in which it takes place in. It is surprising that neither vaccinia virus nor HSV has evolved to target SAMHD1 for degradation. Since cellular nucleotides are dispersed throughout the cell <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Traut1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, SAMHD1 can deplete dNTPs and restrict viral replication of DNA viruses regardless of their replication site within a cell <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.</p>
              <p>HSV-1 and vaccinia virus have been reported to hamper adaptive immunity upon infection of myeloid cells. HSV-1 infection of DCs promotes the down regulation of CD83 <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Kummer1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, a co-stimulatory molecule. This in turn may limit T cell activation against this pathogen. Vaccinia virus infection inhibits MHC class II presentation on the surface of macrophages <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Yao1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref> and DCs <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Huemer1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Therefore, the antiviral role of SAMHD1 in myeloid cells may be to limit viral replication, in an environment of decreased antigen-presentation by myeloid cells.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, unlike retroviruses, these large dsDNA viruses are equipped with their own dNTP biosynthesis machinery such as TK and RNR, to aid in genome replication when dNTP concentrations are suboptimal. However, TKs from vaccinia and HSV-1 are most similar in sequence and structure to human TK1 (hTK1) <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. hTK1 is also cell cycle regulated <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Ke1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, being degraded in G0 cells, such as MDMs. Moreover, the activity of human RNR is coupled to DNA replication <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Salguero1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. Collectively, MDMs have very low dNTPs, making them very restrictive to infection. Indeed, infection with vaccinia virus alone promoted a measurable increase in dTTP, dATP, and dGTP concentrations in MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). With the exception of dTTP, WRΔTK virus also induced a similar increase, albeit not to the same levels. The increase in dNTPs was not enough to promote a robust infection of MDMs by vaccinia virus. Indeed, the antiviral restriction potential of SAMHD1 became greater when using WRΔTK (vΔJ2R/F13L-GFP) virus to infect MDMs. This observation proposes that dsDNA viruses may have evolved to encode their own viral dNTP biosynthesis enzymes to change the dNTP pool ratios in their favor, since vaccinia contains a high 66.6% AT rich genome <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Goebel1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, whereas HSV-1 contains a 68% GC rich genome <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. However, both viruses have not adapted to escape from the replicative restriction pressure induced by SAMHD1 in macrophages and DCs, since they do not degrade SAMHD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003481-g005">5A</xref>). Collectively, our findings validate that SAMHD1 acts as a host restriction factor against large dsDNA viruses in non-dividing target cells.</p>

For HSV-1 KOS infection experiments, THP-1 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/mL of PMA overnight, washed on day two with PBS, and replaced with fresh medium. On the third day, HSV-1 KOS adsorption was carried out for one hour at 37°C at the indicated MOI, cells were washed twice with PBS, replaced with fresh media and infection was allowed to continue for the indicated time points. Unless indicated otherwise, a MOI 0.1 was used for all HSV-1 experiments.</p>

                <p>Six T225 flasks containing 293T cells were transfected with 40 µg of pVpx− VLP or pVpx+ VLP (kindly provided by Drs. Florence Margottin-Goguet and Nathaniel Landau) and 20 µg of pVSVg at a ratio of 1 µg of DNA to 3 µl of polyethylenimine (1 mg/ml). The following day, medium were discarded and replaced with fresh DMEM medium (5% FBS and antibiotics). On days 2–3 after transfection, the medium was collected and replaced with fresh medium. On the day of collection, medium was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min to remove cells. Supernatant was subsequently filtered through a 0.45-µm membrane (Corning Inc.). Supernatant was overlaid on top of 5 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion (25% (w/v) sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). VLPs were concentrated at 28,000 rpm for 90 min by ultracentrifugation. Supernatant was aspirated, and pellets were suspended in 600 µl of serum-free DMEM. Supernatant was centrifuged for 1 min at 14K rpm to remove debris. Aliquots (50 µl) were stored at −80°C. The p27 antigen level was determined using an ELISA kit (Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc., Rockville MD). A minimum of 145 ng of p27/million cells was used.</p>

                <p>The procedure for the vaccinia plaque assay used has been described previously <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Ward1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Briefly, confluent monolayers of BSC-40 cells were infected with the indicated viruses. At 2 hpi, the inoculum was removed and cell monolayers were overlaid with semisolid medium. Three days after infection, cell monolayers were stained with crystal violet and imaged. For the HSV-1 plaque assay, supernatants obtained from HSV-1-infected THP-1 cells were serially diluted and then inoculated onto Vero cells seeded on a 6-well polystyrene plate. After a one hour adsorption at 37°C, cells were replaced with fresh medium containing the heavy chain of immunoglobulin G. After 3 dpi, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min at room temperature and then stained with crystal violet solution (20% ethanol and 1 mg/ml of crystal violet) for 20 min at room temperature followed by washing with distilled water to remove the staining solution. Visible plaques were quantified.</p>

The cells were sonicated with 3×, 5 second pulses, to ensure compete lysis. Cellular debris was removed by 15K rpm centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were stored at −80°C before use. Cell lysates were resolved on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected as described in the Figure legends using the following antibodies: mouse anti-GFP mAb (Roche), mouse anti-SAMHD1 mAb (Abcam), mouse anti-SAMHD1 mAb (kindly provided by Dr. Oliver Schwartz, <xref rid="ppat.1003481-Puigdomenech1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>), mouse anti-tubulin mAb (Sigma), mouse anti-HSV-1 ICP4 mAb (Virusys), anti-UL27 and anti-ß-actin mouse mAb. HRP and Cy-5 conjugated, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Cell Signaling. HRP was detected using chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) following the manufacturers instructions. The fluorescent and chemiluminescent signals were captured using a Kodak Image Station 4000 mmPro (Carestream Health), outfitted with appropriate filters, and a Fujifilm LAS4000. Blot was striped and re-probed for actin. Images were captured using BioRad ChemiDoc Imager.</p>
