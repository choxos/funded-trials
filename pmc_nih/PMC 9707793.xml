                  <p>To compare a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment (Cognitive Processing Therapy; CPT), an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) treatment (Relapse Prevention; RP), and assessment-only (AO) for those meeting diagnostic criteria for both PTSD and AUD.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Participants with current PTSD/AUD (N = 101; mean age = 42.10; 56% female) were initially randomized to CPT, RP, or AO and assessed post-treatment or 6-weeks post-randomization (AO). AO participants were then re-randomized to CPT or RP. Follow-ups were at immediate post-treatment, 3-, and 12-months. Mixed effects intent-to-treat models compared conditions on changes in PTSD symptom severity, drinking days, and heavy drinking days.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Over half of community-dwelling individuals with lifetime Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) also have lifetime Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and approximately 12% of individuals with lifetime AUD have lifetime PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Among those seeking substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, approximately 60% have comorbid PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Current conventional wisdom is that combined or integrated treatments addressing both aspects of the comorbidity are preferable for those with PTSD/SUD [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there may be practical reasons for utilizing single-focus treatments. A recent review describes numerous barriers to receiving integrated care for dual diagnoses [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and consistent with the wider comorbidity literature [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], recent epidemiologic research indicates that most individuals with PTSD/AUD report receiving only mental health-oriented care (i.e., not care for their AUD; 58%) with less than a fifth reporting receiving care for both issues [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. From a public health standpoint, should randomized clinical trials reveal that single-focus treatment options successfully address both aspects of PTSD/AUD, some lower resource mental health and substance abuse clinics may wish to improve the fidelity of their single-focus offerings rather than invest in training staff on new treatments.</p>
              <p>Although typically a control condition in PTSD/SUD treatment studies, cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) for SUD, such as Relapse Prevention (RP) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], have demonstrated comparable improvements in both PTSD and substance use outcomes as non-trauma focused integrated treatment [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and have performed as well as trauma-focused treatments on PTSD and substance use outcomes in <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> intent-to-treat models of some [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but not all trials [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent meta-analytic work specifically compared manualized CBT-SUD control conditions with both trauma-focused and with non-trauma-focused interventions designed for those with PTSD/SUD in the context of randomized clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results indicate that the CBT-SUD conditions did not significantly differ from either trauma-focused or non-trauma-focused treatments on PTSD outcomes at either immediate post-test or longest follow-up, but were associated with significantly better substance use outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, treatment completion for those assigned to individual CBT-SUD control conditions mostly ranged from 55% to 86% [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; cf. [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], rates that were typically comparable to or better than those found for the target experimental conditions. Thus, there is evidence that standalone RP may be a reasonable option for individuals with co-occurring PTSD/AUD, particularly if they present for care in addiction treatment settings.</p>
              <p>There is less information available about standalone PTSD treatments and how they perform for individuals with co-occurring PTSD/AUD or PTSD/SUD. A few studies have provided Prolonged Exposure (PE) to individuals with PTSD/SUD alongside (i.e., not integrated with) substance abuse treatment, such that the treatments were delivered by different clinicians. In a residential setting 60% of those with PTSD/SUD assigned to PE completed it [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, completion rates for PE in outpatient studies involving patients with this comorbidity have been low (39%) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], very low (3.3%) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or not reported [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although treatment retention is substantially higher when PE is integrated with cognitive-behavioral treatment for addiction, as it is in <italic toggle="yes">Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and SUDs using Prolonged Exposure</italic> (COPE) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it would be helpful to have alternative standalone treatment options available to address the needs of outpatients with PTSD/SUD.</p>
              <p>One potential single-focus intervention for individuals with PTSD/SUD is Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), which performs as well as PE for those with PTSD [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CPT has some advantages over PE in that it can be provided as a group therapy [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], can be provided in cases where there is not a clear trauma memory [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] such as in cases of early childhood abuse [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and can be more acceptable to patients [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and providers [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A retrospective chart review of veterans with PTSD with and without AUD who received CPT found low drop-out for both groups and comparable declines in PTSD (alcohol use was not assessed) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. CPT has reduced PTSD and alcohol use frequency relative to waitlist control [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and was found to be a helpful follow-up treatment after group-based AUD treatment [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite these promising preliminary findings, CPT has not been compared to an active treatment in the context of an RCT for individuals with comorbid PTSD and AUD.</p>
              <p>To address the efficacy of two promising single-focus treatments for those with comorbid PTSD/AUD, this study compared RP and CPT to each other and to an Assessment Only (AO) condition that involved weekly brief telephone safety monitoring and check-ins. Our primary hypotheses were that the active conditions would show greater improvement from baseline to immediate follow-up on PTSD and drinking outcomes than the AO condition. Following re-randomization of AO participants to CPT or RP, both treatments were hypothesized to yield significant within-subject improvements in PTSD and alcohol consumption through the 12-month follow-up period, but those receiving CPT were expected to have better PTSD outcomes and those receiving RP were expected to have better drinking outcomes.</p>

                <p>This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial (RCT) wherein participants were randomized to one of two active behavioral interventions or to 6-weeks of assessment-only (AO) with 2:2:1 allocation. Those initially assigned to AO were re-randomized to one of the two active interventions (1:1 allocation) after 6-weeks of assessment. Participants were followed for a maximum of 12-months post-treatment. The trial design remained the same but several changes to methods and procedures were made after the trial commenced to improve recruitment and participant retention (please see the IRB-approved protocol for an overview of major modifications; major changes are also noted in the methods overview below).</p>

                <title>Participants, eligibility criteria, and settings</title>
                <p>The study took place at a university hospital-affiliated mental health clinic and a VA-based research clinic in the Pacific Northwest with participant recruitment taking place from November 13, 2013 and December 8, 2017 and participant contact ending August 31, 2018. One hundred and one adults who responded to recruitment ads in newspapers, flyers, or to letters sent via medical record abstraction and who met current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for both PTSD and AUD were randomized to one of the three study conditions. Veterans and non-veterans were enrolled at both sites. Additionally, participants needed to meet the following study inclusion criteria: 1) reported at least 2 heavy drinking days (5+/4+ standard drinks for men/women) or at least 2 weeks of heavy drinking (21+/14+ drinks per week for men/women) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in the past month {Note: The drinking inclusion criteria were assessed during the initial phone screen and were not re-adjudicated at the subsequent in-person screening assessment. This led to the inclusion of 3 participants (2 initially randomized to CPT and 1 initially randomized to RP) who reported past-30-day abstinence from alcohol at the in-person visit}; 2) stated desire to abstain from or reduce alcohol use; 3) English fluency, and 4) age 18 and older. Study exclusion criteria were: 1) presence of a psychotic or uncontrolled bipolar disorder; 2) suicide attempt or serious self-harm in the past 3 months or suicidal ideation with intent or plan in the past 2 months; 3) current interpersonally violent relationship; 4) alcohol withdrawal at time of consent as assessed by the SHOT (Sweating, Hallucinations, Orientation, and Tremor) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; 5) unstable psychiatric medication in the past 3 months (i.e., dose changes and/or addition or subtraction of medications); 6) past-month Antabuse use (Note: Other alcohol medications were allowed (e.g., Naltrexone, Acamprosate, etc.) if participants were on them for at least three months prior to screening because it is possible to drink at unhealthy levels while taking these medication); and 7) past-month trauma-focused mental health treatment or behaviorally focused alcohol treatment. Supportive counseling, self-help, and medication management were allowed during treatment and there were no restrictions on treatment during follow-up.</p>
                <p>The study was approved by both the University of Washington and the VA Puget Sound institutional review boards and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization’s Tripartite Guideline on Good Clinical Practice. All participants underwent a consent process that included a careful review of what the study entailed, addressed any questions or concerns they had, and obtained written informed consent. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01663337).</p>

                  <p>CPT is a 12-session cognitive treatment that teaches clients to question and replace faulty cognitions about causes of traumatic events and overgeneralized beliefs through progressive worksheets and Socratic questioning [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Participants were encouraged to experience emotions about their trauma while working on thoughts about it. We used CPT without trauma narratives [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Alcohol use in CPT is conceptualized as an avoidance behavior [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and addressed without protocol modification both through directly targeting it as an avoidance behavior and through challenging alcohol-related cognitive distortions using cognitive therapy.</p>

                  <p>RP is a 12-session CBT approach that emphasizes self-monitoring and coping skills to address high-risk drinking situations [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. RP works with each clients’ patterns of substance use and can address PTSD-related triggers without protocol modification in that participants were encouraged to use the skills they were learning (e.g., reaching out for social support, engaging in healthy distraction, reminding oneself of reasons for not drinking, etc.) when they experienced PTSD symptoms such as intrusive thoughts or startle. Discussion of trauma memories was proscribed.</p>

                  <p>AO participants received brief (15 minute) weekly support/safety calls with the study therapist they would see upon re-randomization.</p>
                  <p>Participants attended individual therapy sessions once or twice per week for a maximum of 20 weeks. The study was originally designed such that participants initially assigned to an active treatment would attend twice weekly sessions over 6-weeks. However, this treatment schedule proved too challenging for most participants and the treatment window was adjusted to allow up to 20 weeks for treatment completion. Thus, the treatment duration during the active treatment phase was 0 to 20 weeks. Of those who completed at least one treatment session, the average number of weeks between first and last session completed was 7.13 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 4.03) for CPT and 7.35 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 3.73) for RP (with AO participants included following re-randomization). Among those who completed at least 9 treatment sessions, the average number of weeks between first and last session completed was 9.65 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 2.71) for CPT and 9.36 (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 2.00) for RP.</p>
                  <p>Three female Licensed Clinical Social Workers learned both treatments via two-day workshops (CPT: Patricia Resick, PhD; RP: Denise Hien, PhD). Two of the three clinicians provided care at the university-based clinic and the third provided care at the VA-based clinic. Intervention fidelity was supported by weekly supervision provided by the study principal investigators (CPT: DK) and (RP: TS). To assess intervention fidelity, trained master’s level counselors coded audiotapes of 75 sessions regarding coverage of core treatment elements and intrusions from the other therapy. All CPT sessions and 97% of RP sessions met their respective minimal requirements. Of the sessions coded, two CPT and four RP sessions had intrusions or contaminations from the other treatment. For example, teaching drink refusal skills in the setting of CPT or engaging in Socratic questioning regarding a faulty trauma-related belief in the setting of RP would constitute treatment contaminations.</p>
                  <p>Consistent with Health and Human Services guidance [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Adverse Events (AEs) were defined as any abnormal or unanticipated signs or symptoms temporally associated with study participation whether deemed related to study participation. Severe adverse events (SAEs) were defined as death, hospitalization, prolonging of hospitalization, or permanent or persisting disability temporally associated with study participation whether deemed related to study participation. AEs and SAEs were queried during all clinical and research contacts. In addition, for those enrolled at the University of Washington, automatic alerts were provided if a participant visited the Emergency Room or was admitted to the hospital for any reason.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>Assessment interviews were conducted by one of two trained and supervised master’s level social workers masked to study condition at baseline, post-treatment, 3- and 12-month follow-up points. Self-report measures collected demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment, and veteran status) at baseline.</p>
                <p>The CAPS-5 [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was used to assess PTSD diagnostic criteria and severity, the latter of which was represented via a total score (possible range: 0 to 80; α = .71 –.94 across assessments). Following Norman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], remission was defined as total CAPS-5 score &lt; 12. Exposure to 16 potentially traumatic events was assessed via the Life Stressor Checklist [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] at baseline. Number of trauma types and the index trauma were coded.</p>
                <p>The Form-90 [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] was administered to ascertain drinking days (DD) and heavy drinking days (HDD). Information from the prior 30 days was used to parallel the PTSD timeframe. Low-risk drinking status was based on NIAAA criteria (i.e., no HDD past 4 weeks and no weeks with ≥15/≥8 drinks for men/women) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Past month abstinence status was noted.</p>

                <title>Assessment procedures</title>
                <p>Participants were assessed at baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 3- and 12-months post-treatment, with AO participants completing an extra assessment upon treatment completion. (Two additional online assessments took place at 6- and 9-months but because the CAPS and Form-90 interviews were not conducted, these data are not included here.) CPT and RP participants were required to complete the immediate post-treatment assessment within a month of treatment completion. AO participants completed this assessment 6-weeks post baseline to avoid further treatment delay. Because people were allowed 20 weeks in which to complete the 12-session interventions timing from baseline to the first post-treatment assessment was somewhat variable, but the 3- and 12-month assessments took place 3 and 12 months after treatment ended. Maximum remuneration for assessments was $320 for non-AO and $375 for AO participants. To maximize time for enrollment, the final 13 participants were only followed through the 3-month follow-up (or post-treatment assessment for AO participants) rather than out to 12-months as originally planned.</p>
                <p>Additionally, participants were asked to complete daily monitoring of symptoms starting the day of the baseline through the end of treatment. These data were used to identify PTSD symptom exacerbations and unsafe alcohol consumption we note that a PTSD exacerbation was characterized by 47+ point elevation over each person’s own symptom average during the week prior to starting treatment (possible scores ranged from 0 to 160 as we used a 0–8 point scale to maximize variability across the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms) and a potentially dangerous level of alcohol consumption was characterized by an estimated blood alcohol level of ≥ 0.35 calculated using baseline weight and number of standard drinks reported via IVR.</p>

                <p>Considerable research shows that CPT and RP are effective treatments for their prescribed problems (i.e., PTSD for CPT and HDD for RP) and hence the study was powered to detect effects of each intervention on the non-prescribed targets (i.e., HDD for CPT and PTSD for RP). A priori power analyses were conducted via simulation using mixed effects generalized linear models with different outcome distributions (i.e., normal vs. Poisson). Datasets were generated in which fixed effects for intercept and slope were based on preliminary studies and random-effects were generated based on random draws from a multivariate normal distribution (also specified based on prior research with PTSD and drinking outcomes). The simulation-based estimate of power was provided by the percentage of datasets in which the t statistic for the effect of intervention condition on change across time indicated significance at a critical value of p &lt; .05. These procedures indicated a sample of 235 (CPT/RP each 95; AO 45) was needed to have .8 power to detect moderate (d = .4) effect sizes on the non-target outcomes for each active condition relative to the AO condition (i.e., drinking/CPT; PTSD/RP).</p>

                <title>Randomization and allocation concealment</title>
                <p>Randomization tables stratified by gender, PTSD severity (CAPS-5 [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] score 35+ vs. below), and AUD severity (MINI [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; AUD mild/moderate [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] vs. severe [6+]) were created prior to participant enrollment by one of the principal investigators (TS) who was not involved with participant allocation. Participants with current PTSD/AUD were initially allocated 2:2:1 to CPT, RP, or 6-weeks of assessment (AO), after which AO participants completed their first follow-up assessment and were re-randomized to an active condition (1:1 allocation). The Project Coordinator conducted randomization via the pre-set tables. Although allocation was not formally masked, it was not possible to know ahead of time the condition assignment of a particular participant. Because our primary interest was in the comparisons between participants assigned to CPT and to RP and to minimize the number of people whose active treatment receipt would be delayed, we opted to assign fewer participants to the AO condition.</p>

                <p>Although it is not possible to keep participants or clinicians masked to intervention assignment in behavioral research, when participants were randomized to active treatment they remained masked to CPT/RP assignment until the first therapy session. Additionally, assessors remained masked to condition assignment for all assessments.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p>Hypotheses were tested via two sets of intent-to-treat mixed effects models. The first set compared CPT and RP to AO with respect to change in PTSD severity, DD, and HDD between baseline and first follow-up. Covariates were included for condition (RP vs. AO, CPT vs. AO), time (baseline = 0; first follow-up = 1), and time-by-condition interaction terms. To increase model precision and reduce bias due to missing data, additional covariates included demographic variables of sex (female = 0, male = 1), age (in years), and race/ethnicity (Hispanic or nonwhite = 0, non-Hispanic White = 1); site at which individuals were treated (university clinic = 0, VA = 1); and whether employed at baseline (unemployed = 0, employed = 1) as a measure of economic status. Although income level also differed between groups, because this was a function of employment status, we opted to covary only employment status. Random effects were included for intercept and time. Primary coefficients of interest were main effects of time, which captured changes from baseline to first follow-up in the AO group, and time-by-condition interactions, which assessed whether CPT and RP differed from AO regarding changes from baseline to follow-up.</p>
                <p>The second set of analyses compared CPT and RP across four time points, from baseline through 12-months, including re-randomized AO participants whose first follow-up was treated as their baseline. Condition was treated as a binary factor (0 = CPT, 1 = RP). Change was modeled with a piecewise, or spline, function of time. To assess overall changes from pre- to posttreatment, the first time variable reflected baseline (0) vs. posttreatment (1 = immediate posttreatment, 1 = 3-month follow-up, 1 = 12-month follow-up). The second time coding captured change (in units of months) during the year following treatment (0 = pretreatment; 0 = immediate posttreatment; 3 = 3-month follow-up; 12 = 12-month follow-up). Interaction terms were included between condition and each coding of time. This approach addressed (1) whether participants had immediate improvements after treatment (main effect of pre-post time), (2) whether these improvements differed between CPT and RP (pre-post time-by-condition interaction), (3) whether improvements increased or decreased during the year after treatment (main effect of post-treatment time), and (4) whether change during the year post-treatment differed between CPT and RP (post-treatment time-by-condition interaction). AO assignment was added as a covariate to the original sociodemographic covariates.</p>
                <p>Linear forms of the mixed model were used for PTSD severity. For PTSD severity, effect sizes are reported in terms of Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>, which were computed as the time-by-treatment interaction estimate divided by the pooled standard deviation for PTSD symptom severity at baseline. Over-dispersed Poisson models were used for DD and HDD (discrete non-negative integers showing positive skew; i.e., count outcomes). The over-dispersed Poisson model includes an extra term to account for the variance of outcomes exceeding the means [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which was the case for the DD and HDD outcomes. For these models, effect sizes are reported as Count Ratios (CRs), which describe proportional change in the count associated with a 1-unit increase in the covariate of interest (e.g., the treatment group relative to the reference) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Between-group differences in PTSD remission, alcohol abstinence, and low-risk drinking were evaluated via Chi-square, exact tests. All other models were estimated with HLM 7 using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. REML is recommended for growth models with small to moderate sample sizes and in situations where all cases are not assessed at all time points. The assumption of normally distributed random effects was checked for all models by saving random effect estimates and then examining their distributions graphically and with respect to measures of skewness and kurtosis. As an approach to handling missing data, simulation studies indicate REML performs as well as multiple imputation [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The models used all available data, including data from individuals who were not assessed at all time points. This approach provides unbiased estimates when data are missing at random (MAR: i.e., missingness related only to measured covariates) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To assess sensitivity to violations of this MAR assumption, we evaluated pattern mixture models [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] appropriate for data missing not at random (MNAR) to investigate whether treatment effects varied as a function of attrition. Specifically, we created a dummy variable for attrition, defined as missing at least one follow-up assessment (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 55; coded as 1), relative to completing all follow-up assessments (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 46; coded as 0). Then, within the four-timepoint models for each outcome, we examined a three-way interaction between attrition, treatment, and each time variable, as well as lower-order effects (i.e., two-way interactions and main effects). Wald tests revealed that inclusion of main and interactive effects of attrition did not significantly improve model fit for any outcome, consistent with the MAR assumption of the primary analyses presented below.</p>

                <p>Approximately three-quarters of participants experienced at least one of the following: PTSD exacerbation, alcohol consumption in excess of .35 BAC, suicidal ideation at some point during the study. Because none of these situations were unanticipated for this clinical group, they were not considered AEs by either IRB or the study funder. There were, however, 19 SAEs involving 15 participants, all of which occurred after treatment ended. One of the SAEs was likely study related; a participant was hospitalized for psychosis three days after his final CPT session during which he noted that treatment opened up new feelings. There was one death (CPT) due to a long-standing medical issue, 8 psychiatric hospitalizations (7 CPT, 1 RP), and 10 medical hospitalizations (4 CPT, 6 RP), 5 of which were likely for substance-related health issues (3 CPT, 2 RP). The psychiatric hospitalizations for those assigned to CPT were for the following concerns: 1 for psychosis, 3 for mood disorders, 1 for stress, and 2 for suicidal and/or homicidal ideation. The psychiatric hospitalization for the person assigned to RP was for suicidal ideation. There were no known suicide deaths or attempts.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>CPT and RP were delivered unmodified to evaluate whether these single-focus treatments for PTSD and AUD, respectively, lead to sustained improvements on both types of outcomes pertinent to individuals with PTSD/AUD. CPT addressed avoidance functions of drinking and thoughts hindering PTSD recovery (e.g., “I can’t cope with my rape memories without drinking”). Although explicit discussion of trauma memories was prohibited, RP addressed PTSD symptoms that triggered craving or drinking by encouraging use of standard behavioral coping strategies such as seeking social support, engaging in healthy distraction or alternative activities, waiting for cravings to pass, and reminding oneself of one’s reasons for not drinking.</p>
              <p>Although caution is warranted as our models were underpowered, our primary hypotheses were largely supported. Specifically, compared to AO participants, those receiving CPT showed significantly greater reduction in PTSD severity that was associated with a large effect size (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = 1.22). In contrast, although the effect size pertaining to PTSD for the RP v. AO comparison was moderately large (<italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .76), it failed to reach statistical significance. However, both active conditions were associated with significantly greater reductions in heavy drinking days immediately post-treatment than assignment to the AO condition, differences that were substantial and clinically meaningful (CPT v. AO: 49%; RP v. AO: 66%). Although receipt of an active intervention was more beneficial than assignment to AO, it is noteworthy that those assigned to the AO condition made significant within-subject improvements in both their PTSD symptoms and their HDD. These findings are consistent with other research showing that many people reduce their drinking after making the decision to seek care but prior to actual receipt of care [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and that many people with PTSD benefit from non-directive phone support [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
              <p>As predicted, after AO participants were re-randomized we found that both active treatments were associated with substantial within-person improvement on both PTSD severity and drinking outcomes. Participants in both active conditions showed robust initial decreases in PTSD severity as measured by CAPS scores from pre- to post-treatment (CPT: 48%; RP: 37%) and in days of heavy drinking (CPT: 73%; RP: 82%). Of note, the pattern of results suggests that both active treatments were more associated with harm reduction oriented changes in drinking (i.e., reductions in heavy drinking) than they were with abstinence. With regard to between-group comparisons, we found that the two groups did not differ significantly on either PTSD severity or days drinking, but as predicted, RP participants showed significantly greater reductions in heavy drinking days than those receiving CPT (45% greater reduction in heavy drinking for RP v CPT).</p>
              <p>Overall, the percent reduction in both PTSD and drinking outcomes from baseline to post-treatment for both active conditions tested in the present study was comparable to those found among individuals assigned to the integrated intervention COPE in trials addressing comorbid PTSD/SUD, which for PTSD range from 26% to 40% (current study: CPT 40%; RP: 37%) and for primary substance use outcomes range from 36% to 65% (current study: CPT 59%; RP: 77%) [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the present study, CPT and RP participants were nearly identical in achievement of “low-risk drinking” status and past-month abstinence at 12-months. Approximately one-fifth of both CPT and RP participants achieved both PTSD remission and low-risk drinking status at 12-months, though fewer achieved both PTSD remission and abstinence. When considered alongside the extant findings in the literature pertaining to COPE, the present findings have implications for service delivery for PTSD/AUD patients in that they suggest that unmodified CPT and unmodified RP may constitute additional viable treatment options when COPE, or other effective integrated treatment options, are not available [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Applying CPT and RP effectively in the setting of PTSD/AUD likely requires sustained attention to each treatments’ non-target issue (i.e., drinking/CPT, PTSD/RP) and skillful application of each treatments’ strategies to address patients’ full clinical presentations. In the present study, regular supervision addressed patients’ comorbid presentations within each treatment frame. Additionally, treatment was informed by intensive symptom monitoring, an uncommon practice in general mental health or addiction clinics. However, in this controlled therapeutic context, results suggest that CPT and RP have potential to treat co-occurring disorders as the magnitude of change out to 12-months in both PTSD symptom severity and substance use observed in the current study is generally comparable to that seen for COPE in trials with shorter follow-up periods [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our findings also raise important considerations regarding patient safety. There were no unanticipated AE’s and no SAE’s occurred in either intervention arm during active treatment. However, 15 participants in our study experienced SAE’s during follow-up. Both the extant literature and our own results suggest that CBT-SUD interventions, including RP, are safe and well tolerated [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The present findings regarding the safety of CPT are, however, less clear. Few other studies have examined CPT without SUD intervention strategies integrated in the treatment of PTSD/SUD patients [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and scant relevant information on safety is available. In a study of culturally adapted CPT tested within a sample of Native American women with PTSD/AUD, there were no AE’s or SAE’s [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (personal communication) although inclusion criteria included subthreshold PTSD and some heavy episodic drinking in the past year. A recent pilot study by Vujanovic et al. [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] (personal communication, August 2020) testing an integrated version of CPT and CBT for SUD had one psychiatric SAE among those randomized to the experimental treatment. More research is needed to evaluate CPT delivered to those with more severe AUD, including over longer follow-up periods to evaluate safety post-treatment, and to help explain the discrepancy between this study’s findings and prior research on CPT with substance use comorbidity. However, based on these preliminary findings, results suggest that when delivering standalone CPT to those with fairly severe AUD, patients’ mood and stress levels should be monitored, including after the primary course of treatment is over, perhaps through tapered clinical contacts or variable length CPT to ensure a good end state[<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p>
              <p>An important next step in this line of research will be determining which patients with comorbid PTSD/AUD are apt to fare well with regard to their PTSD and alcohol outcomes and with regard to safety in solidly executed RP or CPT, and which are best served by integrated interventions such as COPE. Project HARMONY [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] is a recently completed person-level meta-analytic study that is using relevant trial data to identify patient characteristics associated with better (and worse) outcomes reported by participants who received different interventions. In the meantime, clinicians may consider employing shared decision-making in treatment selection when multiple empirically well supported treatments are available [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p>
              <p>The current study has several limitations. Recruitment was challenging, which led to a smaller than anticipated sample size. In many ways this difficulty with recruitment makes sense because patients may have preferences for treatment of their substance use or their PTSD symptoms and may not see them as equally desirable treatment options. Whatever the reasons for the recruitment difficulties, our final sample size was 101, which, although comparable to or larger than sample sizes used in most efficacy trials of psychosocial treatments for comorbid PTSD and AUD or SUD [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], does mean we had limited statistical power and precision for estimates of what might be small-to-medium (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> &lt; 0.4) effects. We did find that relative to assessment only there were moderate to large effect sizes favoring the active treatment interventions on both PTSD and heavy drinking. Additionally, the lack of noteworthy difference observed between the two active treatment conditions with regard to PTSD suggests that a non-inferiority trial with a large sample would be helpful in establishing whether individuals with PTSD/AUD can successfully address their PTSD symptoms through receipt of either CPT or RP and could also address mechanisms of change to explore how it is that such different approaches result in similar outcomes. It is possible that general behavioral skills clients gain through both CPT and RP (e.g., improved communication and assertiveness, distress tolerance, reaching out for healthy social support, coping self-efficacy) are helpful in addressing underlying dimensions of psychopathology common to both SUD and PTSD. Gaining such skills may help clients mitigate current stress, better tolerate negative emotions, and temper stress reactivity [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], including those associated with cravings in response to substance or trauma-related cues. It is also possible that improvement in one or the other set of signs and symptoms (i.e., PTSD or AUD) leads to salutary effects in the other. Indeed, support for the idea that reductions in PTSD are associated with later reductions in substance use was found [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] in a large behavioral treatment trial involving women with co-occurring PTSD and SUD. This secondary analysis did not, however, find that reductions in substance use were associated with later improvements in PTSD. Future research on both the sequence of symptom change and mechanisms of change associated with these two interventions will be important for unraveling the finding that they are each associated not only with positive changes in their target outcomes, but also in their non-target outcomes.</p>
              <p>The lack of 12-month assessment for the final 13 participants due to time and budget constraints is a limitation as are the relatively high treatment and assessment dropout rates. An appropriate missing data strategy was used to include all cases in the analyses (i.e., including individuals who did not complete assessments at some time points), and sensitivity analyses with pattern mixture models suggested findings were robust to the violation of the assumption that data were missing at random, but missing data do reduce the precision of model estimates. Additionally, the project coordinator conducted phone screens and handled the randomization and thus allocation to condition was not masked. Finally, because active treatment lasted 0 to 20 weeks, assessment timing was variable and it is possible that those originally assigned to assessment only might have continued to improve with regard to their PTSD and drinking if they waited another four to five weeks before being assessed.</p>
              <p>The current study also has several noteworthy strengths. This study is one of a small number of RCTs on this topic have included 12-month follow-up assessments [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In addition, we recruited a severe sample in that all participants met full diagnostic criteria for current PTSD and AUD and had engaged in recent unsafe drinking. Relatedly, nearly 40% had a concomitant, current DUD. The study design also included a minimal support condition from which people were re-randomized to active treatment in order to gauge the amount of short-term improvement that may be expected after people make a decision to seek care, which in the current study was fairly substantial but, as predicted, did not match the degree of change reported by those in the active treatment conditions. We also benchmarked drinking outcomes against the NIAAA guidelines for safer drinking, which, to our knowledge, is novel in this literature. Finally, we provided estimates regarding rates of clinically meaningful change on both PTSD and drinking outcomes and their combination.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial found that unmodified CPT and RP led to substantial improvements relative to assessment only and, importantly, that following re-randomization of the control group to active treatment, the two interventions showed substantial comparable improvements in PTSD over the course of 12 months. Both interventions had treatment retention rates and led to improvements that are comparable to those observed for integrated trauma-focused/SUD treatments in other PTSD/SUD trials. Results from this trial suggest that treatments targeting one <italic toggle="yes">or</italic> the other aspect of the PTSD/AUD comorbidity may have salutary effects on both types of outcomes. If these findings are replicated in a future, fully powered trial that mitigates potential safety issues among CPT clients with more severe AUD, it would suggest that mental health and addiction clinics could offer high quality CPT or RP to their patients with comorbid PTSD/AUD as an additional option to integrated interventions such as COPE [<xref rid="pone.0276111.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0276111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] or as an alternative in settings where access to those integrated interventions is limited.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The objective of this RCT is to assess and compare the CPT treatment, an AUD treatment, and an assessment-only (AO) treatment, via a longitudibal study design. The study was approved by the respective IRB/Ethics Committee, and carries a valid NCT number (registered within clinicaltrials.gov). While the study objectives sound interesting, is important, and on target, a number of shortcomings were observed, in regards to abiding by the CONSORT guidelines for conducting and reporting results of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Although statistical methods employed looked more or less adequate, some concerns remain:</p>
              <p>1. Methods: Methods reporting require an orderly manner following CONSORT guidelines, without repeating information, such as Trial Design, Participant Eligibility criteria and settings, Interventions, Outcomes, sample size/power considerations, Interim analysis and stopping rules. Randomization (details on random number generation, allocation concealment, implementation), and Blinding considerations should be mentioned explicitly. The authors are advised to create separate subsections for each of the possible topics (whichever necessary), and that way produce a very clear writeup. I see the Authors already made a sincere attempt; however, they are advised to write it carefully, following nice examples in the manuscript below:</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>Specific comments below:</p>
              <p>(a) For instance, the randomization and allocation concealment should be made very clear (they are NOT the same thing); the trial staff recruiting patients should NOT have the randomization list. Randomization should be prepared by the trial statistician, and he/she would not participate in the recruiting.</p>
              <p>(b) Sample size/power: Power analysis is provided, but to dot clearly mention the "name of the statistical test" used. On what basis was the 2:2:1 allocation decision taken?</p>
              <p>(c) Statistical Analysis:</p>
              <p>(c1) Linear mixed models (with random intercepts and time) were used to model the PTSD severity; however, these models work well under Gaussian assumptions of the random terms (effects &amp; errors). It is not clear if those assumptions were assessed, post model fitting. If those fail, alternative methods need to be employed.</p>
              <p>(c2) Did the authors meant "Negative Binomial" regression, when they refereed to "Poisson Model with Overdispersion" for the DD &amp; HDD?</p>
              <p>2. Results:</p>
              <p>The authors should check that any statement of significance should be followed by a p-value in the entire Results section. Otherwise, it looks OK.</p>
              <p>3. Conclusions and Discussion:</p>
              <p>Writeup should reflect that study findings from this RCT are based only on this specific population, and future studies (on other populations) are warranted to justify the hypothesized group differences.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting results from a randomized trial that evaluated two active intervention compared to assessment only on PTSD symptoms, heavy drinking and drinking days in population diagnosed with PTSD and AUD. The individuals in the assessment only were then re-randomized to receive either CPT or relapse prevention and assessed for 12 months. This is a well-designed study with lots of advantages including the assessment of active treatment vs none then the comparison of two different active treatment. The hypothesis that one treatment for one disorder will be as good for the other disorder is novel. The assessment length for 12 months is another advantage. The main disadvantage that the author noted clearly in the manuscript is the sample size that did not reach the power size calculation. However, the manuscript is written with the confidence that any of these two treatment interventions is good for the other one. For example in the conclusion, and similar throughout the study, it says "Results indicate that treatments targeting one or the other aspect of the PTSD/AUD comorbidity have salutary</p>
              <p>effects on both types of outcomes.". I suggest to change this to probable or possible because you cannot confirm there are equal if not reached the target sample size.</p>
              <p>i would also like to see other information that is not presented in the study and if it was imbalanced , it might affect the results:</p>
              <p>what was the percentage of people using antidepressnts in the three groups?</p>
              <p>what is the percentage of people using anticraving for the three groups?</p>
              <p>Was fidelity checked for the two active treatments? how?</p>
              <p>What is the age at onset for PTSD and/or AUD in the three groups? If the trauma/PTSD happened after AUD (AUD-facilitated trauma) it might affect the individual perspective on what treatment is needed which might affect treatment retention. The opposite might be true.</p>
              <p>In addition:</p>
              <p>I am not clear what is the timeline for "post-treatment" " if both CPT and RP is 12 sessions then it should be three months. If so, what is the difference between post-treatment and 3-months timeline.</p>
              <p>For example, line 197: how is it 20 weeks if it is 12 sessions?</p>
              <p>Also:</p>
              <p>line 376: " RP addressed PTSD symptoms that triggered craving or drinking," . How do you explain this?</p>
              <p>The limitation talks a bit about it "the generic behavioral skills clients</p>
              <p>446 gain through both CPT and RP (e.g., communication and assertiveness, distress tolerance,</p>
              <p>447 reaching out for healthy social support)" but more theories can be introduced such as treating one disorder is automatically helping the other disorder. CPT could be just o PTSD which decrease the need for drinking. RP is more for drinking which alleviate the symptoms of PTSD. Thus, I would suggest to consider measuring craving as well in the future.</p>
              <p>Finally, the fact that only about 50% each group completed treatment could be very likely related to the difficulty of recruitment which means that a lot of individuals with PTSD-AUD are not ready for trauma-focused therapy. This means that RP could actually have advantage for some individual to start with rather than to be sent to any available treatment. A lot of individuals might not tolerate a referral to CPT.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Pg 5, Ln 72: change “more acceptable patients” to “more acceptable to patients”</p>
              <p>Pg 6, Ln 82: change “hypothesizes” to “hypotheses”</p>
              <p>Exclusion critera: What is "unstable psychiatric mediation"? Just no dose changes?</p>
              <p>Were the 3 clinicians practicing at both the university and VA sites?</p>
              <p>Curious how other substance use disorders affected outcomes? Was this looked at as a covariate? If not, why?</p>
              <p>Can you comment on the additional rapport-building time in AO and much improved adherence?</p>
              <p>Can you comment more on sig improvement in PTSD and HDD in AO?</p>
              <p>I'm very confused about no AEs being reported given that this was asked about at each visit. If participants were asked about AEs I find it difficult to believe that none of them ever reported having a cold or a headache, etc. Can you explain more how you ended up with no AEs reported?</p>
              <p>Lastly, I'm curious, based on your charts it looks like RP reduces PTSD as much as CPT but reduces drinking more than CPT. Is there a basis for recommending RP over CPT for PTSD-AUD?</p>
              <p>Thank you for putting land acknowledgment!</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: The objective of this RCT is to assess and compare the CPT treatment, an AUD treatment, and an assessment-only (AO) treatment, via a longitudinal study design. The study was approved by the respective IRB/Ethics Committee, and carries a valid NCT number (registered within clinicaltrials.gov). While the study objectives sound interesting, is important, and on target, a number of shortcomings were observed, in regards to abiding by the CONSORT guidelines for conducting and reporting results of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Although statistical methods employed looked more or less adequate, some concerns remain:</p>
              <p>1. Methods: Methods reporting require an orderly manner following CONSORT guidelines, without repeating information, such as Trial Design, Participant Eligibility criteria and settings, Interventions, Outcomes, sample size/power considerations, Interim analysis and stopping rules. Randomization (details on random number generation, allocation concealment, implementation), and Blinding considerations should be mentioned explicitly. The authors are advised to create separate subsections for each of the possible topics (whichever necessary), and that way produce a very clear writeup. I see the Authors already made a sincere attempt; however, they are advised to write it carefully, following nice examples in the manuscript below:</p>
              <p>
                <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889540619300010</ext-link>
              </p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this guidance and for providing the helpful example. We have completely revamped the presentation of the Methods section starting on page 6 and it now conforms to the CONSORT guidelines, paying particular attention to delineating randomization from allocation.</p>
              <p>Specific comments below:</p>
              <p>(a) For instance, the randomization and allocation concealment should be made very clear (they are NOT the same thing); the trial staff recruiting patients should NOT have the randomization list. Randomization should be prepared by the trial statistician, and he/she would not participate in the recruiting.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for pointing these issues out; we have now clarified that a priori stratified randomization tables were created by lead author Simpson who was not involved with participant recruitment or allocation. However, we now include in the limitations section that the Project Coordinator used the randomization tables to assign participants and was directly involved with participant recruitment and screening, which could have influenced allocation (pg. 31, lines 542-543).</p>
              <p>(b) Sample size/power: Power analysis is provided, but to dot clearly mention the "name of the statistical test" used. On what basis was the 2:2:1 allocation decision taken?</p>
              <p>Response: We have elaborated on the power calculations in the manuscript as follows (pg. 12, starting line 219): </p>
              <p>Considerable research shows that CPT and RP are effective treatments for their prescribed problems (i.e., PTSD for CPT and HDD for RP) and hence the study was powered to detect effects of each intervention on the non-prescribed targets (i.e., HDD for CPT and PTSD for RP). A priori power analyses were conducted via simulation using mixed effects generalized linear models229 with different outcome distributions (i.e., Normal vs. Poisson). Datasets were generated in which fixed effects for intercept and slope were based on preliminary studies and random-effects were generated based on random draws from a multivariate normal distribution (also specified based on prior research with PTSD and drinking outcomes). The simulation-based estimate of power was provided by the percentage of datasets in which the t statistic for the effect of intervention condition on change across time indicated significance at a critical value of p&lt;.05. These procedures indicated a sample of 235 (CPT/RP each 95; AO 45) was needed to have .8 power to detect moderate (d = .4) effect sizes on the non-target outcomes for each active condition relative to the AO condition (i.e., drinking/CPT; PTSD/RP).</p>
              <p>We have added the following text to explain our rationale for the 2:2:1 allocation scheme (pg. 13, starting line 242):</p>
              <p>Because our primary interest was in the comparisons between participants assigned to CPT and to RP and to minimize the number of people whose active treatment receipt would be delayed, we opted to assign fewer participants to the AO condition.</p>
              <p>(c) Statistical Analysis:</p>
              <p>(c1) Linear mixed models (with random intercepts and time) were used to model the PTSD severity; however, these models work well under Gaussian assumptions of the random terms (effects &amp; errors). It is not clear if those assumptions were assessed, post model fitting. If those fail, alternative methods need to be employed.</p>
              <p>Response: With regard to the distribution of the measure of PTSD severity, the linear distributional model was chosen because at each time point absolute values for skewness were below .4 and absolute values for kurtosis were below .8. The limited deviation from a normal distribution in this study sample is not surprising given that all participants were required to meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD. With regard to distributions of random effects, we examine random effects graphically and calculated skewness and kurtosis of random effects for all models. In all cases, skewness was below an absolute value of .6. Kurtosis was also low (&lt;1) for almost all random effects, with the exception of the random effects for post-tx time in models predicting PTSD symptom severity and HDD. Kurtosis for these random effects were 1.9 and 2.7, respectively, which are still below recommended cut-offs for violations of the normality assumption. The relatively high kurtosis values reflect the small amount of between-person variance in change across the post-tx time points. Although removing these random effects would have resulted in models that fit adequately and were more parsimonious (and yielded the same results with respect to fixed effects of treatment condition), we retained these random effects to be consistent with the study design and our research questions. We have added a sentence to the Methods indicating how we checked the normality assumption (pg. 16, starting line 293).</p>
              <p>(c2) Did the authors meant "Negative Binomial" regression, when they refereed to "Poisson Model with Overdispersion" for the DD &amp; HDD?</p>
              <p>Response: Using the specifications available in HLM software for modeling count data in multilevel mixed models that contain random slopes in addition to random intercepts, we used Poisson models that include an over-dispersion term that makes the variance proportional to an observation’s expected value and accounts for the fact that variance of these outcomes exceeded their means. This approach also allows for estimation of random slopes as well as random intercepts. Multilevel negative binomial models, when implemented in most available software, only allow for random intercepts. The over-dispersed Poisson model is similar to a negative binomial model, which also includes an extra term and where the variance in the outcome is a quadratic function of the mean. This issue is described the bottom of page 7 and top of page 8 in the article by Atkins et al. (2013), and the formula for the variance term in the over-dispersed Poisson model is given in the HLM manual (Raudenbush et al., 2011). </p>
              <p>We made the following edits to the Methods to make the specification of these models clearer (pg. 15, starting line 283):</p>
              <p>Over-dispersed Poisson models were used for DD and HDD (discrete non-negative integers showing positive skew; i.e., count outcomes). The over-dispersed Poisson model includes an extra term to account for the variance of outcomes exceeding the means (Atkins et al., 2013; Raudenbush et al., 2013), which was the case for the DD and HDD outcomes.</p>

              <p>2. Results:</p>
              <p>The authors should check that any statement of significance should be followed by a p-value in the entire Results section. Otherwise, it looks OK.</p>
              <p>Response: p-values have been added throughout the Results section.</p>
              <p>3. Conclusions and Discussion:</p>
              <p>Write-up should reflect that study findings from this RCT are based only on this specific population, and future studies (on other populations) are warranted to justify the hypothesized group differences.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion; it is in line with comments from Reviewer 2. In response we have tempered our conclusions and altered the following sentence in the Conclusion section (here, italics denote wording changes) (pg. 32, starting line 565):</p>
              <p>Results from this trial suggest that treatments targeting one or the other aspect of the PTSD/AUD comorbidity may have salutary effects on both types of outcomes.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is an interesting results from a randomized trial that evaluated two active intervention compared to assessment only on PTSD symptoms, heavy drinking and drinking days in population diagnosed with PTSD and AUD. The individuals in the assessment only were then re-randomized to receive either CPT or relapse prevention and assessed for 12 months. This is a well-designed study with lots of advantages including the assessment of active treatment vs none then the comparison of two different active treatment. The hypothesis that one treatment for one disorder will be as good for the other disorder is novel. The assessment length for 12 months is another advantage. The main disadvantage that the author noted clearly in the manuscript is the sample size that did not reach the power size calculation. However, the manuscript is written with the confidence that any of these two treatment interventions is good for the other one. For example in the conclusion, and similar throughout the study, it says "Results indicate that treatments targeting one or the other aspect of the PTSD/AUD comorbidity have salutary effects on both types of outcomes." I suggest to change this to probable or possible because you cannot confirm there are equal if not reached the target sample size.</p>
              <p>Response: As noted above in response to similar comments from Reviewer 1, we edited the noted sentence to be more circumspect and tentative given the small sample size (pg. 32, starting line 565).</p>
              <p>I would also like to see other information that is not presented in the study and if it was imbalanced, it might affect the results:</p>
              <p>what was the percentage of people using antidepressants in the three groups?</p>
              <p>what is the percentage of people using anticraving for the three groups?</p>
              <p>Response: Unfortunately while we recorded the details of study participants’ medication regimens in their baseline case report forms, we did not enter those details into our database so we cannot speak to the specifics of receipt of either antidepressants or anti-craving medications. The hard copies of the forms are now archived off-site and we do not have a timely way to retrieve them nor the staff to assist with data entry. Fortunately, however, we do not see evidence of a condition imbalance with regard to psychiatric medications generally, as reflected in online Table S3.</p>
              <p>Was fidelity checked for the two active treatments? how?</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we checked for treatment fidelity by evaluating session audiotapes by a trained rater (please see the Intervention sub-section in the Methods section; pg. 10, starting line 168).</p>
              <p>What is the age at onset for PTSD and/or AUD in the three groups? If the trauma/PTSD happened after AUD (AUD-facilitated trauma) it might affect the individual perspective on what treatment is needed which might affect treatment retention. The opposite might be true.</p>
              <p>Response: We now include the age of onset of participants’ index traumas and problem(s) with alcohol in online Table S3 by assigned condition as well as the proportions in each group that experienced the index trauma first, alcohol problem(s) first, or at the same age. </p>
              <p>Although we found that those assigned to CPT experienced their index traumas at older ages than those assigned to RP and were more likely to report onset of alcohol problems prior to their index traumas, we have opted to simply share these observations in the participant characteristics section of the results rather than delve into how these onset patterns may or may not be associated with treatment retention or outcomes as this deserves more space and attention than can be afforded in the primary outcome paper.</p>
              <p>In addition:</p>
              <p>I am not clear what is the timeline for "post-treatment" " if both CPT and RP is 12 sessions then it should be three months. If so, what is the difference between post-treatment and 3-months timeline.</p>
              <p>Response: We appreciate that the assessment timing is somewhat confusing and have attempted to clarify it with the following new text (pg. 12, starting line 204):</p>
              <p>Because people were allowed 20 weeks in which to complete the 12-session interventions baseline to the first post-treatment assessment was somewhat variable, but the 3- and 12-month assessments took place 3 and 12 months after treatment ended.</p>
              <p>For example, line 197: how is it 20 weeks if it is 12 sessions?</p>
              <p>Response: Many of our participants struggled to attend treatment sessions consistently due to various life challenges (e.g., over-sleeping, getting a job for the day, having childcare fall through, etc.). Thus we extended the treatment window to 20 weeks so as to afford them a reasonably sufficient time in which to obtain as much treatment as they could without having their active intervention engagement drag on indefinitely. We have clarified this in the methods section as follows (italics denote new text) (pg. 9, starting line 153):</p>
              <p>“Participants attended individual therapy sessions once or twice per week for a maximum of 20 weeks. The study was originally designed such that participants initially assigned to an active treatment would attend twice weekly sessions over 6-weeks. However, this treatment schedule proved too challenging for most participants and the treatment window was adjusted to allow up to 20 weeks for treatment completion. Thus, the treatment duration during the active treatment phase was 0 to 20 weeks.”</p>
              <p>The limitation talks a bit about it "the generic behavioral skills clients gain through both CPT and RP (e.g., communication and assertiveness, distress tolerance, reaching out for healthy social support)" but more theories can be introduced such as treating one disorder is automatically helping the other disorder. CPT could be just o PTSD which decrease the need for drinking. RP is more for drinking which alleviate the symptoms of PTSD. Thus, I would suggest to consider measuring craving as well in the future.</p>
              <p>Response: Yes, we absolutely agree that the interventions could be having positive effects on their target outcomes (CPT on PTSD and RP on drinking), which in turn led to positive effects on the non-target outcomes. We have included new language describing this possibility in the discussion (pg. 30, starting line 521). </p>
              <p>It is possible that general behavioral skills clients gain through both CPT and RP (e.g., improved communication and assertiveness, distress tolerance, reaching out for healthy social support, coping self-efficacy) are helpful in addressing underlying dimensions of psychopathology common to both SUD and PTSD. Gaining such skills may help clients mitigate current stress, better tolerate negative emotions, and temper stress reactivity [69–72], including those associated with cravings in response to substance or trauma-related cues. It is also possible that improvement in one or the other set of signs and symptoms (i.e., PTSD or AUD) leads to salutary effects in the other. Indeed, support for the idea that reductions in PTSD are associated with later reductions in substance use was found [73] in a large behavioral treatment trial involving women with co-occurring PTSD and SUD. This secondary analysis did not, however, find that reductions in substance use were associated with later improvements in PTSD. Future research on both the sequence of symptom change and mechanisms of change associated with these two interventions will be important for unraveling the finding that they are each associated not only with positive changes in their target outcomes, but also in their non-target outcomes. </p>
              <p>With regard to the suggestion about assessing cravings, we did include a measure of cravings and found the same pattern for craving as the drinking outcomes; no between group differences for the CPT and RP comparisons. Given that the paper is already long and complex with multiple primary outcomes included, we prefer not to add craving but appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to consider this indicator of alcohol involvement.</p>
              <p>Finally, the fact that only about 50% of each group completed treatment could be very likely related to the difficulty of recruitment which means that a lot of individuals with PTSD-AUD are not ready for trauma-focused therapy. This means that RP could actually have advantage for some individual to start with rather than to be sent to any available treatment. A lot of individuals might not tolerate a referral to CPT.</p>
              <p>Response: Although it is true that treatment completion rates were low in the present study, these same low rates were seen nearly across the board in a recently published meta-analysis conducted by members of our team (Simpson et al., 2021). It may be that people with PTSD/AUD are reluctant to engage with treatment in the first place or may have difficulty staying in treatment because they are concerned that trauma-focused treatment will be too challenging, but in our study and in the larger literature, the treatment completion rates are also quite low for non-trauma focused interventions, including manualized SUD care like RP, or treatments like Seeking Safety. These overall findings suggest that people with PTSD/AUD (or PTSD/SUD more generally) have an especially hard time engaging in and sticking with treatment of any sort and future research is needed to ascertain why this is and whether it has to do with the treatments we currently have available for them or the life circumstances they are contending with (or both).</p>

              <p>Pg 5, Ln 72: change “more acceptable patients” to “more acceptable to patients”</p>
              <p> Response: Thank you for pointing out this error; it has been corrected.</p>
              <p>Pg 6, Ln 82: change “hypothesizes” to “hypotheses”</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for pointing out this error as well; it has been corrected.</p>
              <p>Exclusion criteria: What is "unstable psychiatric mediation"? Just no dose changes?</p>
              <p>Response: We now note in the Methods section that “unstable psychiatric medication” refers both to dose changes and to the addition/subtraction of medications (see pg. 8, starting line 119).</p>
              <p>Were the 3 clinicians practicing at both the university and VA sites?</p>
              <p>Response: We now note that two of the three clinicians provided care at the university clinic site and that the third provided care at the VA clinic site (see pg. 10, starting line 165).</p>
              <p>Curious how other substance use disorders affected outcomes? Was this looked at as a covariate? If not, why?</p>
              <p>Response: Because there were no differences between randomized study conditions with regard to additional drug use disorders or use of commonly used drugs, we did not control for this in the models for parsimony.</p>
              <p>Can you comment on the additional rapport-building time in AO and much improved adherence?</p>
              <p>Response: Although those initially assigned to AO were more likely to participate in the first post-baseline assessment than those randomized to receive either CPT or RP right away, the AO group did not have better retention or adherence when it came to treatment completion. As may be seen in the table below, if anything, those who were initially assigned to the AO condition had slightly worse treatment retention than the other two groups. Completion of 9 or more sessions did not differ between those who were and were not initially assigned to AO, χ2(1) = 0.34, p = .561. Because there does not appear to be an effect of the pre-treatment support calls on later treatment retention, we have not included this information in the revised manuscript although it generally does not support the idea that additional rapport building improved adherence.</p>

              <p>Can you comment more on sig improvement in PTSD and HDD in AO?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this particular finding. We have added the following to the Discussion section to address it (pg. 26, starting line 439):</p>
              <p>Although receipt of an active intervention was more beneficial than assignment to AO, it is noteworthy that those assigned to the AO condition made significant within-subject improvements in both their PTSD symptoms and their HDD. These findings are consistent with other research showing that many people reduce their drinking after making the decision to seek care but prior to actual receipt of care (Stasiewicsz et al. 2019), and that many people with PTSD benefit from non-directive phone support (Lehavot et al., 2021).</p>
              <p>I'm very confused about no AEs being reported given that this was asked about at each visit. If participants were asked about AEs I find it difficult to believe that none of them ever reported having a cold or a headache, etc. Can you explain more how you ended up with no AEs reported?</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for flagging this important issue. As you point out, participants certainly reported distress over the course of the study. Many of our study participants experienced PTSD exacerbations, reported suicidal ideation, and at times consumed large quantities of alcohol; all of these challenges were anticipated (i.e., they are common regardless of treatment and were expected) for this group of patients as determined by both IRBs and NIAAA, the study sponsor. Adverse events are typically defined as unexpected medical or psychiatric problems during treatment. Thus, our original statement that there were no AE's stands. We have, however, noted the challenges that our study participants most frequently experienced and clarified that they were anticipated. (see pg. 25, starting line 409). </p>
              <p>Lastly, I'm curious, based on your charts it looks like RP reduces PTSD as much as CPT but reduces drinking more than CPT. Is there a basis for recommending RP over CPT for PTSD-AUD?</p>
              <p>Response: Although we appreciate the Reviewer’s observations regarding the comparable PTSD outcomes for those assigned to CPT and to RP and the better heavy drinking outcomes for the latter group, because we saw evidence that CPT was more helpful for PTSD relative to the AO condition early on and RP was not, we are reluctant to recommend RP over CPT at this point.</p>
              <p>Thank you for putting land acknowledgment!</p>
              <p> Response: You are most welcome and thank you for the reinforcement!</p>
