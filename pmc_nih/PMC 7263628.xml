                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>Clonal evolution of osimertinib-resistance mechanisms in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma is poorly understood. Using multi-region whole-exome and RNA sequencing of prospectively collected pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors, including at rapid autopsies, we identify a likely mechanism driving osimertinib resistance in all patients analyzed. The majority of patients acquire two or more resistance mechanisms either concurrently or in temporal sequence. Focal copy-number amplifications occur subclonally and are spatially and temporally separated from common resistance mutations such as <italic>EGFR</italic> C797S. <italic>MET</italic> amplification occurs in 66% (n = 6/9) of first-line osimertinib-treated patients, albeit spatially heterogeneous, often co-occurs with additional acquired focal copy-number amplifications and is associated with early progression. Noteworthy osimertinib-resistance mechanisms discovered include neuroendocrine differentiation without histologic transformation, <italic>PD-L1</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic> amplification, and <italic>ESR1-AKAP12</italic>, <italic>MKRN1-BRAF</italic> fusions. The subclonal co-occurrence of acquired genomic alterations upon osimertinib resistance will likely require targeting multiple resistance mechanisms by combination therapies.</p>

              <p id="p0030">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic>EGFR</italic>) mutant lung cancer as the vast majority of patients treated with EGFR TKIs derive clinical benefit. However, resistance to EGFR TKI therapy is inevitable. Acquired resistance mechanisms of first and –second generation EGFR TKIs have been extensively characterized.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> However, in a significant proportion of EGFR mutant lung cancer patients treated with osimertinib, a 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation EGFR TKI, a definite acquired resistance mechanisms has not been elucidated.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Moreover, since osimertinib was recently approved by the FDA for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung cancer, there is a pressing need to understand acquired mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib in such patients. The studies to date assessing acquired resistance mechanisms among first-line osimertinib-treated patients have largely employed targeted sequencing platforms of circulating tumor DNA from plasma,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> which may not define the full genomic landscape of alterations that likely occur upon resistance to osimertinib.</p>
              <p id="p0035">Herein, we present results of an ongoing clinical trial assessing mechanisms of acquired osimertinib resistance in <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung cancer using multi-region whole-exome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of biopsies and surgeries of pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors as well as metastases at rapid autopsy. We dissected the clonal evolution of high-confidence somatic mutations and focal copy-number amplifications in cancer-related genes that likely mediate osimertinib resistance. We found the majority of patients treated with osimertinib exhibited two or more acquired resistance mechanisms. Among first-line osimertinib-treated patients, those with early progression developed <italic>MET</italic> amplification as a major resistance mechanism. In one affected individual, although exome sequencing did not reveal a resistance mechanism, RNA-seq uncovered neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation without histologic transformation as a possible mechanism of osimertinib resistance.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="p0040">We enrolled 34 patients with histologically confirmed EGFR mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma in a prospective phase II clinical trial to evaluate osimertinib treatment and the use of local ablative therapy (LAT) for oligoprogressive disease (NCT02759835) in EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from April 2016 until data cutoff in September 2019. Patients were not selected based on oligometastatic status; rather, 32/34 patients had multiple organ involvement, including lung, liver, adrenal, brain, and bone. Biopsies or surgeries were performed pre-osimertinib treatment and at first progression on osimertinib. A subset of patients also underwent biopsies at second progression while being treated with osimertinib and following end-of-life in-patient hospice, and rapid autopsy upon death was performed<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). 63% (n = 15/24) of first-line osimertinib and 50% (n = 5/10) of second-line osimertinib-treated patients had RECIST-defined partial response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Overall, 21 patients had RECIST-defined first progression while receiving osimertinib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Two patients on this trial discontinued treatment and were lost to follow-up. Of the 21 patients who had RECIST-defined progression, 14 patients underwent LAT (8 first-line and 6 s-line) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Twelve patients had paired pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors and three had post-osimertinib-resistant tumors available for analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B; <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).

                <title>Two or More Osimertinib-Resistance Mechanisms in Individual Patients</title>
                <p id="p0045">To elucidate acquired osimertinib-resistance mechanisms, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES), targeted sequencing, and RNA-seq on 66 tumors and matched germline DNA from a total of 15 patients. Median tumor purity across all samples analyzed was 48% (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). A range of 111–435 non-silent somatic mutations were identified per patient by exome sequencing (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). We found significant mutational heterogeneity within pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors from each subject with non-truncal, non-silent variants ranging from 56% to 96% of all mutations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and 1D). We considered all high-confidence somatic mutations, focal copy-number amplifications (defined as greater than 10 or more copies, less than 5 megabases in length, in COSMIC cancer-related genes in the post- compared to pre-osimertinib tumors after adjusting for tumor ploidy and purity), and gene fusions for potential resistance mechanisms (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Tables S3</xref>, <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref> and <xref rid="mmc6" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Focal copy-number deletions (defined as homozygous deletions, less than 5 megabases in length, in COSMIC cancer-related genes in post-compared to pre-osimertinib tumors after adjusting for tumor ploidy and purity) were also assessed but not included as resistance mechanisms because focal deletions in potential tumor suppressors were not detected in this cohort of patients (<xref rid="mmc6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). Remarkably, we found an acquired osimertinib-resistance mechanism in 93% (n = 14/15) of patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Two or more resistance mechanisms co-existed in 73% (n = 11/15) of patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Importantly, a mechanism of acquired resistance was identified in all first-line osimertinib-treated patients (n = 9). Two patients, LAT016 and LAT022, had significant gene fusions; <italic>AGK-BRAF</italic> and <italic>MKRN1-BRAF</italic> in two separate progressive tumors in LAT016 and <italic>ESR1-AKAP12</italic> in LAT022 that were discovered by Oncomine assays (<xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Interestingly, for LAT016, an <italic>AGK-BRAF</italic> fusion was acquired in a lung tumor at first progression but not in the adrenal tumor that progressed concurrently. Instead, a <italic>MKRN1-BRAF</italic> fusion was identified in the adrenal tumor at first progression and also identified from the liver biopsy of a tumor at second progression (<xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). We were unable to identify an acquired osimertinib-resistance mechanism in one affected individual, LAT011, using exome and targeted sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>

Therefore, to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of somatic mutations and focal copy-number amplifications in patients treated with osimertinib, we employed phylogenetic analysis of pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant as well as post-osimertinib-resistant only tumors from each subject. Overall, our phylogenetic analysis revealed between 6 and 23 subclones per subject (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). Oncogenic <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations (L858R, deletion 19 and exon 20 insertion), were generally clonal (defined as present in all subclones). One affected individual, LAT009, carried a germline <italic>EGFR</italic> T790M mutation and developed an <italic>EGFR</italic> L858R mutation later in tumor evolution consistent with previous reports inherited susceptibility of lung cancer and heterogeneous development of sensitizing <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations in these patients.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> All <italic>RB1</italic> mutations (frameshift and nonsense) and nearly all <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations (N1044K and K111E) were clonal.

Among patients with two or more focal copy-number amplifications at the time of first progression while taking osimertinib (LAT006, LAT014, and LAT017), focal copy-number amplifications occurred in the same early subclone suggesting multiple, focal copy-number amplifications in genes such as <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>MET</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, and <italic>YES1</italic> can occur subclonally, and possibly simultaneously in the same subclone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). To validate our phylogenetic data, we performed dual <italic>EGFR/MET</italic> and <italic>KRAS/EGFR</italic> fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on tumors obtained at first progression while receiving osimertinib from patients LAT006 and LAT014, respectively. We found that focal amplifications in <italic>EGFR/MET</italic> and <italic>KRAS/EGFR</italic> occurred concurrently and subclonally; they were present together in some cells of the progressive tumor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>I and 2J). Taken together, these data suggest multiple focal amplifications occur at specific spatial and temporal sequence during the development of acquired osimertinib resistance.</p>
                <p id="p0060">In addition to focal copy-number amplifications, all patients acquired high-confidence somatic mutations in cancer genes and a subset of patients had somatic mutations implicated in EGFR TKI resistance. In two patients, focal copy-number amplifications and somatic mutations occurred at different evolutionary time points and locations. For example, in subject LAT003, <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification was subclonal and was acquired in a clone that became highly prevalent in the post-osimertinib resistant compared to the pre-treatment tumor. In contrast, an acquired, subclonal <italic>EGFR</italic> C797S mutation occurred in a separate phylogenetic branch in a clone with similar prevalence in both pre- and post-osimertinib-resistance tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Likewise, in subject LAT015, <italic>MET</italic> amplification occurred in a subclone that was present only at second progression while receiving osimertinib and was in a separate phylogenetic branch from both <italic>EGFR</italic> C797S and <italic>EGFR</italic> T790M mutations. These acquired EGFR mutations occurred in a common subclone in both sequenced tumors at first progression while receiving osimertinib, but both were absent in the tumor at second progression. (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>C). Subject LAT022 developed an acquired <italic>EGFR</italic> C797S mutation and <italic>ESR1</italic>-<italic>AKAP12</italic> fusion, but these occurred in only 1 of the 2 post-osimertinib-resistant samples that were sequenced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>G; <xref rid="mmc5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Thus, in the same affected individual, diverse osimertinib-resistance mechanisms comprising focal copy-number amplifications and acquired somatic mutations can be spatially and temporally separated.</p>

We hypothesized that the unbiased genomic sequencing performed on pre-treatment and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors would provide insight into the variation in osimertinib treatment response. Using WES data, we analyzed the differences in focal copy-number amplifications between pre- and post-osimertinib tumor tissues. Greater number and magnitude of focal copy number amplifications was associated with a short-term osimertinib response (defined as &lt;12 months’ PFS) among first-line osimertinib-treated patients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B). The most common focal copy-number amplification emerged in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene in post-osimertinib-resistance patients (n = 5 patients).

Thus, our results demonstrate that multiple focal copy-number amplifications are acquired with osimertinib resistance, and the development of such amplifications, presumably due to increased genomic instability, is associated with a shorter time to progression while receiving osimertinib in patients without prior treatment.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Multiple Acquired Focal Copy-Number Amplifications Are Associated with Short-Term Response to First-Line Osimertinib-Treated Patients</p><p>(A and B) Number (A) and magnitude (B) of acquired focal copy-number amplifications in patients with short versus long PFS.

                <p id="p0105">Using available RNA-seq data from subjects LAT001, LAT005, LAT006, LAT009, LAT010, LAT011, LAT014, and LAT017, we performed differential expression analysis between all pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors to decipher novel mechanisms of osimertinib resistance with a focus on LAT011. Pathway analysis of the post- versus pre-osimertinib transcript expression data revealed that NOTCH was one of the most significantly downregulated pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B; <xref rid="mmc7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>). Expression of <italic>HES1</italic>, a downstream effector of NOTCH signaling, was decreased in all post-osimertinib compared to pre-osimertinib tumor tissue in LAT011 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Subject LAT010, whose tumor displayed mixed NSCLC/SCLC histology, also had decreased expression of <italic>HES1</italic> upon osimertinib resistance. The level of expression of <italic>HES1</italic> was low in a post-osimertinib sample from subject LAT005, who had full SCLC transformation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). In contrast, subjects LAT001, LAT006, LAT009, LAT014, and LAT017 did not have a decrease in <italic>HES1</italic> expression upon osimertinib resistance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). Given that inhibition of NOTCH signaling is known to lead to NE differentiation,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> we hypothesized that LAT011 developed NE differentiation upon osimertinib resistance despite the lack of histologic evidence of small cell transformation. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we examined the expression of <italic>ASCL1</italic>, a downstream effector of NE differentiation, in post-osimertinib compared to pre-osimertinib tumor samples. <italic>ASCL1</italic> expression increased in post-osimertinib compared to pre-osimertinib tumor samples in subjects LAT011 (NE differentiation without SCLC transformation) and LAT010 (mixed NSCLC/SCLC transformation) and LAT005 (SCLC transformation) but not in other subjects (LAT001, LAT006, LAT009, LAT014, and LAT017 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B).</p>
                <p id="p0110">We next compared overall NE differentiation in subject LAT011 to other patients using a 50-gene expression lung cancer-specific NE expression signature.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Using a single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) analysis of this NE signature, we found the post-osimertinib tumor in subject LAT005 displayed the highest NE differentiation consistent with SCLC transformation, while the pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors of subjects LAT001, LAT006, LAT009, LAT014, and LAT017 displayed the least NE differentiation consistent with retained adenocarcinoma histology (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D). The post-osimertinib T4 tumor of subject LAT010 displayed intermediate levels of NE differentiation, as expected, for mixed NSCLC/SCLC histology (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D). For subject LAT011, the post-osimertinib-resistant liver tumor with a poorly differentiated NSCLC histology showed increased NE differentiation in comparison to the pre-osimertinib tumor and multiple post-osimertinib-resistant lung tumors that retained an adenocarcinoma histology (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>D).</p>
                <p id="p0115">We further validated our RNA-seq findings using immunohistochemistry to detect common NE markers. As expected, the SCLC transformed post-osimertinib-resistant tumor from subject LAT005 and the regions of SCLC transformation in the post-osimertinib-resistant tumor from subject LAT010 showed high synaptophysin and chromogranin expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E). For subject LAT011, tumors at first and second progression on osimertinib and corresponding PDXs showed moderately positive staining for synaptophysin with variable expression of chromogranin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>E). Together, these results provide evidence for NE differentiation of osimertinib-resistant tumors without evidence of histological transformation in subject LAT011 likely mediated by decreased NOTCH signaling.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0120">Here, we describe the heterogeneity and evolution of multiple resistance mechanisms in individual osimertinib-treated EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. Our ongoing prospective clinical study allows for the longitudinal sampling of progressive tumors, including at autopsy, to conduct multi-region/temporal exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumors from EGFR mutant NSCLC patients undergoing osimertinib treatment. The unbiased genomic analyses revealed a likely mechanism driving osimertinib resistance in all patients analyzed. Particularly, in this study we have reported the most comprehensive genomic analysis on prospectively collected multiple tumors obtained from patients undergoing first-line as well as second-line osimertinib treatment upon development of resistance. The majority of patients acquired two or more subclonal resistance mechanisms either concurrently or in temporal sequence.</p>
              <p id="p0125">Among first-line osimertinib-treated patients in our study, <italic>MET</italic> amplification was the most common mechanism of resistance, occurring in 66% of patients (n = 6/9). Acquired <italic>MET</italic> amplification, however, was subclonal and highly heterogeneous, which may explain why <italic>MET</italic> amplification was previously reported in a lower percentage of first-line osimertinib-treated patients.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Acquisition of subclonal <italic>MET</italic> amplification may predict suboptimal response to osimertinib similar to observations for patients with pre-existing <italic>MET</italic> amplification with early-generation EGFR TKIs.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Indeed, two patients in our study found to have pre-existing, clonal <italic>MET</italic> amplification had early progression on osimertinib similar to the patients in our study with acquired, subclonal <italic>MET</italic> amplification. It is plausible that first-line osimertinib treatment results in expansion of rare pre-existing MET amplified clones, as has been observed with first and second generation EGFR TKIs,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> resulting in quicker progression. Thus, while clinical trials are underway evaluating MET inhibitors upon osimertinib resistance,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> clinical testing of MET inhibitors in combination with osimertinib in treatment-naive patients will be critical as our study demonstrates the risk of acquiring <italic>MET</italic> amplified subclones in such patients is high.</p>
              <p id="p0130">The optimal treatment approach for patients upon osimertinib resistance is unclear, and treatment options are currently limited. Our clonal evolutionary analysis using multi-region/temporal sequencing revealed the subclonal co-occurrence of acquired alterations upon osimertinib resistance, suggesting treatment for patients after progression on osimertinib will likely require targeting dual resistance mechanisms. For example, in our study, subject LAT006 was found to have <italic>MET</italic> amplification upon first progression on osimertinib and was eventually treated with a MET inhibitor. However, our analyses revealed the amplification of both <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic>, suggesting patients such as LAT006 may benefit from a combination of MET inhibitor together with drugs targeting the <italic>EGFR</italic> amplified clone apart from osimertinib. Similarly, subject LAT003 developed the <italic>EGFR C797S</italic> mutation concurrently but spatial and temporally separated from <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification suggesting the potential use of a C797S inhibitor<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> would need to be combined with additional EGFR-pathway directed therapy. In contrast, although subject LAT016 developed two unique spatially and temporally acquired BRAF fusions, both are likely targetable by BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Thus, through clonal analysis of multi-region and temporal sequencing, our study suggests the number of osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with concurrent multiple resistance mechanism is likely much higher than previously reported.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These data also provide the rationale for LAT approaches and multiple longitudinal biopsies in the context of treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with osimertinib.</p>
              <p id="p0135">Our study demonstrates that many patients with acquired resistance to osimertinib remain dependent on EGFR signaling through additional <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification. Dual inhibition of EGFR signaling with a second-generation EGFR TKI together with monoclonal antibodies to the EGFR extracellular domain has shown clinical effectiveness in acquired resistance to first-generation EGFR TKIs.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Whether such a strategy would be effective upon acquired resistance to osimertinib is unknown, although there is recent evidence that targeting <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification can be an effective clinical strategy in other cancer types.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Examining the clinical activity of osimertinib with selumetinib (NCT03392246), an inhibitor of MEK among patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification upon acquired resistance to osimertinib, would also be of interest.</p>
              <p id="p0140">EGFR mutant NSCLC tumors treated with TKIs can histologically transform to SCLC or develop tumors with mixed NSCLC/SCLC histology, both of which have a poor clinical outcome.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> We identified an EGFR mutant NSCLC subject with rapid clinical progression upon osimertinib resistance whose post-osimertinib-resistant tumors displayed evidence of NE transformation but lacked histologic evidence of SCLC transformation. Acquired osimertinib resistance with NE features but with retained NSCLC histology may represent a disease transition state, further substantiated by recent reports of a subset of metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with anti-androgen therapy who develop androgen resistance with NE differentiation and adenocarcinoma features.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The use of immunohistochemistry for NE markers or RNA-seq upon acquired osimertinib resistance, in patients with rapid clinical progression, may uncover additional cases with evidence of NE differentiation but without SCLC transformation. Comparing treatment and clinical outcomes in such cases to patients with classic SCLC transformation will be important and will require larger cohorts.</p>
              <p id="p0145">In conclusion, our study, utilizing whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, reveals the clonal heterogeneity and tumor evolution of metastatic EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with osimertinib. Since the majority of patients treated with osimertinib had two or more subclonal resistance mechanisms, our data suggest combination therapies will be required to overcome acquired resistance. A MET inhibitor will be an important part of such combination therapy, particularly among first-line osimertinib-treated patients with early progression.</p>

                  <p id="p0170">Tissue samples were acquired from patients enrolled in a single-arm, single-institution, open-label phase II study of osimertinib treatment and local ablative therapy (LAT) upon progression on osimertinib in EGFR mutant metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Eligible patients were treated with osimertinib 80 mg per day daily until disease progression. A higher dose of 160 mg per day was used in patients with leptomeningeal disease. At the time of progression, patients with oligoprogressive disease, defined as no more than 5 sites of progressive disease who are amenable to treatment with LAT (surgery, radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation) underwent LAT. Osimertinib was resumed after LAT and they are followed for second progression on osimertinib (PFS2). Tumor samples were obtained at baseline by a mandatory biopsy. At the time of first progression on osimertinib, if a patient was eligible for surgery as a form of LAT, then a tissue sample was obtained for genomic studies to identify mechanisms of acquired resistance. For patients who were not eligible for LAT or a form of LAT that was not surgery (radiation, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation), then a mandatory biopsy was performed, if clinically safe, to obtain tissue for genomic studies. Patients were not selected based on oligometastatic status, rather patients had multiple organ involvement, including lung, liver, adrenal, brain, and bone. Patients undergoing LAT were subsequently re-challenged with osimertinib. Patients who progressed a second time on osimertinib following LAT or patients who were not LAT eligible were referred to other clinical studies or received standard of care second line treatments. Patients also underwent a repeat biopsy of the second progressive lesion when clinically feasible (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A). Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and had stage IV lung adenocarcinoma confirmed by pathology review by the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). All patients provided written informed consent. Gender, and age is provided for all study participants with genomic data (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). We estimated that a minimum of 10 patients would pre- and post-osimertinib resistant tumor samples would be needed to adequently assess mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib. The study was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board with the local protocol number 16C0092. Following surgery or a biopsy, tissues were paraffin embedded by standard clinical protocols in the Laboratory of Pathology at the NCI. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were then macrodissected to enrich for tumor cells with at least 20% tumor content. DNA and RNA were extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit or separately with QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit and RNeasy FFPE Kit respectively. The extraction was performed on a semi-automated instrument, QIAcube (QIAGEN), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The concentration of DNA and RNA were measured with Qubit. Blood sample from patient was used for normal (germline) sequencing.</p>
                  <p id="p0175">Rapid autopsy samples were obtained from patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer who gave informed consent for IRB approved protocol 13-C-0131 (NCT01851395) entitled ‘‘A Pilot Study of Inpatient Hospice with Procurement of Tissue on Expiration in Thoracic Malignancies.’’ The study was approved by the NCI Institutional Review Board with the local protocol number 13C0131. All patients were previously treated at the NCI and with life expectancy less than 3 months were offered inpatient hospice treatment at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health and upon death autopsies were initiated within 3 hours. Prioritization of lesions removed at autopsy was based on CT scan performed within one month before death. All tumors within each patient were removed by an experienced pathologist and macro dissected to remove surrounding non-neoplastic tissue. Punch biopsy needles were used to obtain spatially distinct cores from each tumor. One-third of each tissue core sample was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, one-third in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and the remaining tissue was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C. For each tissue sample, a 5-mm section was taken to create a hematoxylin and eosin slide to visualize neoplastic cellularity using a microscope. DNA and RNA was isolated from approximately 30 mg of snap-frozen tumor tissue using the All Prep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN).</p>

                  <p id="p0180">Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples were prepared for whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). One hundred nanograms of DNA was sheared to approximately 200 base pairs (bp) by sonication (Covaris, Woburn, MA). Exome enrichment was performed using SureSelect Clinical Research Exome Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and RNA enrichment was performed using TruSeq RNA Exome Library Prep according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 75 bp) was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500 instrument. The sequences were compared to the human reference genome hg19 using internally developed ClinOmics somatic Bioinformatic Pipeline v3.1. Peripheral blood DNA extracted from individual patients was used for germline exome sequencing. In brief, raw sequencing data in FASTQ format were aligned against the reference human genome (hg19) with BWA<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>(31)(30)(Li and Durbin, 2009)(30)(30). The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and HaplotypeCaller (HAPLOC) were used for germline SNV and indel calling; whereas MuTect and Strelka were used for somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) and small indel calling respectively. ANNOVAR was used to functionally annotate genetic variants. Tier 1 somatic variants were defined as protein coding on a hotspot codon or if on a non-hotspot codon then must consist of the following: reported as a somatic change in five or more individual tumors, loss of function in tumor suppressor gene in Cancer Gene Census or loss of function by a known mechanism in a non-tumor suppressor gene for Cancer Gene Census genes. Tier 1 somatic variants were considered “high-confidence” mutations. Other tiers were protein coding somatic variants not on a hotspot codon but a loss of function variant by an alternative mechanism (Tier 2), a rare/de-novo variant (Tier 3) or not on ClinOmics gene list (Tier 4). FACETS<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> algorithm was used to determine total and allele-specific DNA copy number from WES. RNA was extracted from FFPE tumor cores using RNeasy FFPE kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). RNA-seq libraries were generated using TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep Kits (TruSeq RNA Exome kits; Illumina) and sequenced on NextSeq500 sequencers using 75bp paired-end sequencing method (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Each sample was processed through an RNA-seq data analysis pipeline where reads were mapped to the ENSEMBL human genome GRCh37 build 71 using TopHat2. Read counts for each gene between samples were normalized using TMM method implemented in edgeR and then transformed to RPKM.</p>

Due to the constraints of the infinite sites assumption<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>, the PhyloWGS model does not account for copy number changing to multiple different aberrant states at the same genomic locus across samples. For these tumors, PhyloWGS was run multiple times with each run having the copy number artificially set to neutral in one sample. Trees were then manually curated from the parsed subclones from the single-sample, multi-sample, and artificially neutral sample runs. Focal copy number amplifications in cancer related genes were then assigned to phylogenetic nodes based on association with somatic mutations.
