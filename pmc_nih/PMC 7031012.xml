                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="P2">Monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has generally been unsuccessful in men with advanced prostate cancer. Pre-clinical data support the notion that cryotherapy may improve immune-mediated and anti-tumor responses. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and feasibility of whole-prostate gland cryotherapy combined with pembrolizumab and androgen deprivation in men with oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P3">This single-institution, pilot trial recruited 12 patients with newly diagnosed oligometastatic prostate cancer between 2015 and 2016. Patients underwent whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation (eight months) and pembrolizumab (6 doses). The primary clinical endpoints were the number of patients with a PSA level of &lt;0.6ng/mL at one year and the frequency of adverse events. Other outcome measures included progression-free survival and systemic therapy-free survival. Exploratory analyses included PD-L1 protein expression.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="P4">Forty two percent (5/12) of patients had a PSAs of &lt;0.6ng/mL at one year though only 2 of these patients had recovered their testosterone at this time point. Median progression-free survival was 14 months, and median systemic therapy-free survival was 17.5 months. PD-L1 expression was not detectable by IHC in patients with evaluable tissue. All adverse events were grade ≤2, and there were no apparent complications from cryotherapy.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="P5">Whole-prostate cryoablation combined with short-term androgen deprivation and pembrolizumab treatment was well tolerated and no safety concerns were observed in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Though local disease appeared effectively treated in the majority of men, the regimen only infrequency led to sustained disease control following testosterone recovery.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">Immunological therapies have substantially impacted cancer care. Notably, checkpoint inhibitors have revitalized the role of immunotherapy and are now first line options in many tumor types <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Prostate cancer is not highly immunogenic and is characterized by a lower tumor mutational burden than observed in other malignancies <sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. While a subset of prostate cancers harbor mismatch repair deficiencies or biallelic inactivation of <italic>CDK12</italic>, which can potentially increase responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade, this only accounts for a small fraction of patients <sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Further, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors alone has yielded minimal benefits in unselected patients with advanced prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P7">Multiple efforts are underway to help increase the immunogenicity of prostate cancer. Among these are the manipulation of the immune system through the use of combination checkpoint blockade, targeting novel immune regulators, immune agonists, utilizing androgen axis inhibitors to upregulate immune molecules or recruit inflammatory cells, and genetic engineering of T cells <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. An additional approach is to attempt to induce an abscopal effect by inducing immunogenic cell death in a way that primes a systemic anti-cancer response <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that cyroablation in particular may trigger an abscopal effect in prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Further, a recent study by our group utilizing an animal model suggested that the combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), PD-1 blockade and cryoablation could elicit distant, immune-mediated, anti-tumor responses <sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P8">Here we conduct a pilot trial of cryoablation combined with short course androgen deprivation and PD-1 blockade in men with low volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The primary goals of the study were to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this combination, as well as to assess whether this regimen could result in disease control (PSA consistent with disease control after cryoablation in the setting of a non-castrate testosterone <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>).</p>

                <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
                <p id="P9">This was a single-institution, single-arm, multi-therapy study. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Patients were eligible if they had histologically or cytologically confirmed oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostatic adenocarcinoma. Serum testosterone level had to be non-castrate (&gt;150 ng/dL). Oligometastatic disease was defined by ≤ 5 extra-pelvic metastases that could include lymph nodes, bones, or soft tissue involvement on conventional imaging. Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitor therapy or metastases involving the central nervous system.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="P10">Patients received androgen deprivation using degarelix (80mg) subcutaneously once per month for 8 months (after an initial loading dose of 240mg). Within one month of degarelix initiation, patients received pembrolizumab (200mg) intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 6 doses. Within 3 days of pembrolizumab initiation, patients underwent whole-gland cryoablation of the prostate. At least 4 months following cryoablation, patients were required to undergo a second prostate biopsy (this was achieved in 11 of the 12 men). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cryopreserved for T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing analyses. The timing of androgen deprivation prior to local therapy was based on previous neoadjuvant studies demonstrating that castration allows for an increased T cell infiltrate into the prostate <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, and that mononuclear cell infiltrates are increased by week 3 to 4 after castration <sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We also wished to determine if our regimen would provide a sustained disease response in the absence of androgen deprivation. To this end, we limited androgen deprivation to allow for testosterone recovery. A duration of 8 months (which we designate as “short-term androgen deprivation” in his manuscript) was selected empirically in collaboration with our safety monitoring board as a duration that would allow for the majority of men to have a detectable testosterone by one year without substantial risk of disease progression <sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Eight months was also the same duration of hormonal therapy used in the investigational arm of the landmark PR-7 trial of intermittent vs. continuous hormonal therapy <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p>

                <p id="P11">All prostate biopsy samples were assessed by a genitourinary clinical pathologist. Post-treatment biopsies were evaluated for PD-L1, CD4, CD8, and FoxP3 proteins by single-stain semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry performed by QualTek Molecular and Clinical Laboratories (Santa Barbara, CA). PD-L1 staining was performed using the monoclonal antibody 22C3 (Merck). In the majority of cases, viable tumor was not present on post-treatment biopsies, and thus tumor associated lymphocytes and other immune markers were not assessed. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was therefore generally performed on non-tumor prostate tissue (scored as: negative-0, low-1, moderate-2, high-3; corresponding to 0, 1–10, 11–20 and over 20 reactive lymphocytes per high power field).</p>

                <title>Outcome measurement</title>
                <p id="P14">Primary outcomes included assessments of safety and oncological outcomes. Regarding safety, two non-laboratory grade 4 or any grade 5 adverse events would have caused trial termination and a claim of futility to be made. Regarding efficacy, we aimed to determine if the protocol would allow for disease control defined as a PSA that remained low in the presence of a non-castrate testosterone level. Cryoablation causes periurethral scaring of prostate tissue and as such, PSA levels defining disease control are elevated above 0.2 ng/mL. The primary outcome measure was thus the number of patients with a PSA level of &lt;0.6 ng/mL at one year. PSA at this level has been shown to be a surrogate of disease control in men with localized prostate cancer undergoing cryoablation <sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, and the majority of men were expected have testosterone recovery (&gt;150 ng/dL) by the one-year time point <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that if the protocol were effective, it would control disease both in the primary tumor and at distant sites, and furthermore, disease control would continue after testosterone recovery due to immune surveillance. A relatively small retrospective study of stereotactic radiation in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer that included men off of androgen deprivation suggested that 29% of men would have a PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL at 1 year <sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. For this reason, we felt that this study would warrant a follow-up phase II protocol more focused on efficacy if 30% of men with a recovered testosterone had PSAs &lt;0.6 ng/mL.</p>
                <p id="P15">Other outcome measures were the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in post-treatment biopsies as well as clinical endpoints including progression-free survival (including PSA progression or progression by imaging) and systemic therapy-free survival. PSA response was defined by a ≥50% fold decrease in PSA. PSA progression was defined as a ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir PSA and confirmed by a second rise in PSA (PCWG3 definition). Systemic therapy was defined by any systemic therapy prescribed for the treatment of prostate cancer such as, but not limited to, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, or AR-targeted therapy. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) was defined as clinical, radiographic, or PSA progression despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) while on continuous ADT.</p>

Clonality and richness values were obtained through the ImmunoSeq Analyzer software. Clonality was measured as 1-(entropy)/log2(# of productive unique sequences). Simpson clonality was also performed to allow comparison between blood and tissue samples. Differential abundance analysis was assessed, as previously described <sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, to identify clones that were significantly expanded or contracted from baseline and following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment. Expanded and contracted T cell clones or clonotypes post-pembrolizumab were identified from the peripheral blood of available patients. For one patient, we then compared his expanded and contracted peripheral T cell clones to his baseline tumor sample as well as his post-cryotherapy biopsy tumor sample to determine presence and dynamics of tumor restricted T cell clones.</p>

                <p id="P20">The median follow-up time of the enrolled patients was 31.3 months, with a range between 18.1 and 39.3 months. Of the 11 evaluable patients, post-cryotherapy biopsy samples showed benign disease in 9 patients while 2 patients had residual detectable cancer (<xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). PSA response was achieved in 11 of the 12 patients (92%) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Of the three patients with RECIST measurable disease, two patients had a partial radiographic response, while the other one patient had evidence of progression during study therapy. In accordance with the study design, we evaluated PSA at 1 year as a surrogate for disease control with the assumption that the majority of men would have recovered their testosterone by this time point. At one year following therapy initiation, 5 patients (42%) achieved a PSA level of ≤ 0.6 ng/mL. However, the majority of patients, including three of the five patients with low PSAs, had not recovered their testosterone at this time. Over the course of the entire study, median PSA progression-free survival was 14.0 months, and the median systemic therapy-free survival was 17.5 months (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). The median time to developing CRPC was not reached at last follow-up (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Notably, three patients rapidly progressed and died by the time of last follow-up. Conversely, one patient had not developed progressive disease (by PSA-, clinical-, or radiographic-metrics) after 25.6 months from study initiation, despite being off all therapies for over a year with testosterone recovery (PT12; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Two additional patients had slowly rising PSAs and had yet to start a new systemic therapy for over one year after finishing androgen deprivation therapy and recovering testosterone levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P22">Whole blood was collected prior to study initiation and following pembrolizumab treatment for TCR sequencing from 10 of the 12 patients. Diversity repertoire analyses showed that clonality and Daley-Smith richness were relatively stable at baseline and following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab overall for all patients. However, pretreatment PSA was significantly correlated with baseline T cell clonality at baseline (Spearman p=0.02, R2 = 0.46), although this correlation was not observed following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment.</p>
                <p id="P23">Of the 10 evaluable patients, one patient (PT9) appeared to have a higher frequency of contracted and expanded T cell clonotypes following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We thus TCR sequenced the baseline and post-treatment prostate biopsies for this patient to quantify the presence and dynamics of tumor restricted T cell clones. In this patient, T cell fraction increased in the prostate tumor biopsy tissue following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Simpson clonality also increased in both the blood and prostate tumor tissue following 6 cycles of pembrolizumab (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Looking at specific T cell clonotypes, nine of the clones expanded in the blood by cycle 6 were found in the post-treatment tumor sample and eight clones contracted in the blood were also found in the post-treatment tumor sample (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P24">Immune checkpoint blockade may promote the development of CD8 memory cells, thereby potentially eliciting long-term responses in advanced disease. Certain tumor types appear more sensitive to immunotherapy as they either express dominant tumor-related antigens or have deficiencies in DNA regulation leading to a higher burden of tumor neoantigens. Established approaches to augment an anti-cancer immune response include cellular therapies that target tumor tissue type specific antigens, immune checkpoint blockade to promote and enhance T-cell responses, and the activation of stimulatory signaling molecules <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In less immunogenic tumor types, such as prostate cancer, it is likely that combinatorial approaches will be necessary to elicit substantial tumor responses for the majority of patients <sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Here we report the results of a pilot trial in which checkpoint blockade, androgen deprivation, and prostatic cryoablation were utilized to potentially recruit immune cells, expose tumor antigens, and elicit a systemic, long-lasting anti-tumor immune response.</p>
              <p id="P25">Our study recruited men with low volume (≤ 5 metastases) hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. We chose this population because therapy might be more efficacious in men with a lower disease burden and less immune tolerance, and it would allow for evaluation of distant tumor responses. Suggestive evidence that men with lower disease burden might have larger responses to immune based therapy comes from studies with Sipuleucel-T, the first FDA approved immune therapy for prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Notably, though an initial study of checkpoint inhibition with ipilimumab in men with CRPC showed greater survival in a subset analysis of men with a greater number of better prognostic features and more limited disease treated with bone-directed radiation therapy, this was not strongly confirmed in a subsequent trial in men with better prognostic features and more limited disease who were not treated with radiation therapy <sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P26">Androgen deprivation therapy was incorporated in the treatment regimen. Aside from its direct anti-tumor activity, androgen deprivation therapy may additionally increase anti-tumor immune responses. Androgen deprivation therapy potentially increases T cell infiltration of prostate tumors <sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> as well as mitigates immune tolerance to prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Since T cell infiltration was not quantified in pre-treatment biopsies, we were unable to conclusively delineate increased infiltration, however the majority of post-treatment samples had detectable T cell infiltrates in non-tumor tissue.</p>
              <p id="P27">Efforts to research local therapies as a means to incite an abscopal effect by causing prostate tumors to release antigens that then might allow for a systemic anti-cancer response are underway. Radiation therapy to tumor lesions has been a dominant modality tested to incite an <italic>in situ</italic> anti-tumor vaccine response. Since the initiation of this study, other clinical trials have reported oncological benefit from local therapy in men with low volume metastatic prostate cancer <sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. These studies used external beam radiation for primary tumor treatment, and a current study is ongoing to establish the effect of cytoreductive prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer patients (<related-object id="RO2" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" source-id="ClinicalTrials.gov" source-id-type="registry-name" document-id="NCT03678025" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number"/>). Cryotherapy was used for treatment of the primary tumor in our trial based on anecdotal and preclinical evidence, which identified it as potentially producing the most profound local immune response <sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Though reported in a retrospective series, this is the first report of cytoreductive cryoablation in a clinical trial setting <sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Patients in our study tolerated cryoablation well with all patients being treated in an outpatient setting, no grade 3 adverse events were observed, and low rates of urinary side effects ensued. In addition, when combined with a short course (8 months) of androgen deprivation, cryoablation resulted in an apparent eradication of local (intra-prostatic) disease in 9 of the 11 evaluated men. The low morbidity and low cost of cryoablation should prompt further study of this modality as a local immune-modulating treatment for men with low volume metastatic disease.</p>
              <p id="P28">The primary objective of this study was to evaluate feasibility and safety, and future studies would be needed to determine the clinical efficacy of whole prostate cryoablation in combination with androgen deprivation therapy and pembrolizumab for men with <italic>de novo</italic> oligometastatic prostate cancer. Regardless, this study provides an indication that although the treatment strategy was well-tolerated, there were only modest long-term responses. Our initial efficacy endpoint was the evaluation of disease control at 1 year with the assumption that the majority of men would have recovered to a non-castrate testosterone during this period. This was not the case as only the minority of men had begun to normalize their testosterone by this time. Regardless, the majority of men did achieve non-castrate testosterone during follow-up and overall, prolonged treatment responses following recovery of testosterone were not common and were observed in only one patient (with two additional patients having slow PSA elevations not requiring additional therapy to date). The responding patient had Gleason grade group 3, M1b disease and showed the highest levels of PD-L1 staining in his non-tumor associated lymphocytes. It should be noted that three patients in our study progressed rapidly to castrate-resistant disease. The standard of care for hormone naïve metastatic prostate cancer has changed over the last several years with multiple studies demonstrating that intensification of androgen axis-based therapy can prolong metastasis-free and overall survival in men with low or high-volume disease <sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P29">TCR repertoire analyses from peripheral blood showed limited changes for most patients; however, one patient had an increased number of expanded and contracted T cell clonotypes in the peripheral blood, and a subset were also present in the post-treatment tumor biopsy sample following the treatment regimen. One caveat of the TCR repertoire analyses is that sequencing depth was different between the blood and tissue samples and could possibly account for the number of expanded and contracted clones shared between these two compartments. Future studies will be needed to determine correlations between TCR repertoire changes and response.</p>
              <p id="P30">Overall, these data are hypothesis generating and highlight that alternative or modified approaches to harnessing the immune system against prostate cancer should be considered in future trials.</p>
