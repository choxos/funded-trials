                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Adaptive pharmacotherapy, ie, starting a medication regimen and then modifying that regimen based on patient response, is common in many medical domains but is not common in smoking cessation. Recently, studies have found that adaptive treatment using precessation nicotine patches is efficacious for smoking cessation; however, adaptive treatment using precessation varenicline and adaptive treatment in clinical practice settings have not been fully assessed.</p>

                  <p>This double-blinded stratified placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial compared adaptive treatment with standard treatment for smoking cessation. The study was conducted at a university health system in Durham, North Carolina, from February 2018 to May 2020 and was stopped early due to COVID-19. Data were analyzed as intent-to-treat from May 24, 2021, to February 27, 2022.</p>

                  <p>Participants were allowed to choose varenicline or nicotine patches and were then randomized to adaptive or nonadaptive (standard) treatment. Participants started on their chosen medication (adaptive) or placebo (standard) 4 weeks before their target quit day. Two weeks later, participants were assessed for treatment response. Adaptive participants who did not decrease daily cigarettes smoked by at least 50% (nonresponders) received bupropion in addition to their chosen medication. Participants in the adaptative treatment group who did decrease daily cigarettes smoked by at least 50% (responders) and participants in the standard treatment group received additional placebo bupropion. Participants in the standard treatment group received varenicline starting 1 week before the target quit date or nicotine patches starting on the target quit day. All participants received brief behavioral support.</p>

                  <p>Of the planned 300 participants, a total of 188 participants (mean [SD] age, 49.1 [12.5] years; 102 [54%] female) were enrolled before the trial was stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 127 participants chose to use varenicline, including 64 randomized to adaptive treatment and 63 randomized to standard treatment, and 61 participants chose to use nicotine patches, including 31 randomized to adaptive treatment and 30 randomized to standard treatment. At baseline, participants smoked a mean (SD) of 15.4 (7.3) cigarettes per day. At 12 weeks after the target quit day, biochemically verified 30-day continuous smoking abstinence was observed in 23 of 95 participants (24%) in the adaptive treatment group and 8 of 93 participants (9%) in the standard treatment (odds ratio [OR], 3.38; 95% CI, 1.43-7.99; <italic>P</italic>â=â.004); among participants who used varenicline, 30-day continuous abstinence was 18 participants (28%) in the adaptive treatment group, and 5 participants (8%) in the standard treatment group (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 1.57-13.15); among participants who used nicotine patches, 30-day continuous abstinence was 5 participants (16%) in the adaptive treatment group and 3 participants (10%) in the standard treatment group (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.38-7.99).

              <p>Adaptive treatment, ie, assessing the patientâs response to an initial medication and then modifying the medication regimen based on the patientâs response, is a common medical practice.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> However, this approach has not been widely adopted for smoking cessation. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved specific protocols for smoking cessation medications in which medications are started on the quit-smoking day (nicotine patch, gum, lozenge inhaler nasal spray) or 1 week before the quit-smoking day (bupropion, varenicline).<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Research has demonstrated acceptable safety and efficacy of starting medications 4 weeks before the quit smoking day for varenicline,<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> bupropion,<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and nicotine patches<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and opened the door to the exploration of precessation adaptive treatment. It may be helpful to conceptualize precessation adaptive smoking cessation pharmacotherapy as having 3 components: extended precessation pharmacotherapy, assessment of response to precessation pharmacotherapy, and adaptation of medication regimens for nonresponders.</p>
              <p>Regarding extended precessation pharmacotherapy, trials have now shown that 4, 6, and 12 weeks of precessation varenicline all show higher smoking abstinence rates than 1 week of precessation varenicline.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The efficacy of precessation nicotine patches is less certain, with the most recent meta-analysis (8 trials, 2813 participants) showing no significant association of precessation nicotine patch use with smoking abstinence (RR, 1.16, 95% CI: 0.97-1.38).<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Regarding assessment of response to precessation pharmacotherapy, studies have shown that precessation smoking reduction was associated with postcessation smoking abstinence when smokers used precessation varenicline or nicotine patches.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A study on precessation nicotine patches found that responders (ie, those who showed â¥50% precessation carbon monoxide [<sc>co</sc>] reduction) showed a 2-fold higher smoking abstinence rate than nonresponders.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A study on precessation varenicline found that responders showed a 2.95-fold higher smoking abstinence rate than non-responders.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Regarding adapting of medication regimens for nonresponders, a 2013 study<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> found that precessation nicotine patch nonresponders could be rescued by adding bupropion 150 mg twice daily, resulting in significantly higher 6-month smoking abstinence compared with participants who continued using nicotine patch alone. To our knowledge, there have been no studies assessing adaptive treatment in clinical populations with minimal exclusion criteria, nor studies assessing adaptive treatment for smokers using precessation varenicline.</p>

                  <p>Adaptive treatment participants were provided with their chosen medication (nicotine patch or varenicline) 4 weeks before the target quit day. Varenicline was up-titrated over the first week of treatment to 1 mg twice daily. The nicotine patch was started at 14 to 21 mg based on baseline cigarettes smoked per day. Standard treatment participants who chose to use varenicline were provided with a placebo during starting at 4 weeks before the target quit day, then received varenicline starting 1 week before the target quit day. Standard treatment participants who chose to use nicotine patches received placebo patches starting 4 weeks before the target quit day, then received real nicotine patches starting on the target quit day.

Similar to a previous study on adaptive treatment that directed participants to continue ad libitum smoking during precessation treatment,<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> participants in the study were directed to continue smoking as usual during precessation treatment so that precessation smoking reduction would more likely reflect a treatment response to medication rather than willful smoking reduction. Two weeks after starting medications, participants attended a medication-response visit. At this visit, adaptive treatment participants who did not decrease smoking by at least 50% were classified as nonresponders, and bupropion 150 mg twice daily was added to their precessation regimen. Adaptive treatment participants who decreased cigarettes smoked per day by at least 50% were classified as treatment responders, and placebo bupropion was added to their regimen.

Participants were paid $190 if they completed all 4 study visits. Baseline variables included age, sex, race, ethnicity, smoking history, nicotine dependence, and psychiatric diagnoses. Race and ethnicity were determined via self-report. Race was classified as American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, more than 1 race, and unknown, and ethnicity was classified as Hispanic or Latino or not Hispanic or Latino.

                <p>The primary outcome was 30-day continuous smoking abstinence 12 weeks after the target quit day, verified by expired <sc>co</sc> breath test of less than 7 ppm (ppm). We used 12-week postquit outcomes instead of 6- or 12-month outcomes in this study because the study used a clinical population with modest compensation, which may have resulted in higher attrition at later timepoints.

Statistical comparison was not conducted for these groups because responder status occurred as a postrandomization event. Intent-to-treat biochemically verified 7-day smoking abstinence at the 2-week postquit visit was 32% in the adaptive treatment group and 11% in the standard treatment group (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.49-7.28).</p>

                <p>Among all 188 participants, we identified 1 serious adverse event: 1 participant (2%) in the varenicline standard treatment group died. This death was determined to be related to stage 4 cancer and not study-related. There were no other reports of death, life threatening events, hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Among all participants, 9 reported moderate side effects (requiring medical evaluation or change in daily routine) (4 participants in the varenicline adaptive group; 1 participant in the varenicline standard group; 3 participants in the nicotine patch adaptive group; 1 participant in the nicotine patch standard group). When mild adverse events (requiring no medical evaluation or a change in daily routine) were included, 159 participants reported at least 1 adverse event (<xref rid="zoi230932t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no significant differences between the incidence of adverse events between adaptive and standard treatment groups, except for sleep problems, which were more common in varenicline participants randomized to adaptive treatment compared with those randomized to standard treatment (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.18-2.58; <italic>P</italic>â=â.03).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial found that adaptive treatment was more efficacious than standard treatment for daily smokers recruited from a smoking cessation clinic and allowed to choose between varenicline and nicotine patches. Additionally, the results suggest that adaptive treatment with extended (4-week) precessation varenicline may be more effective than standard varenicline treatment starting 1 week before the target quit date. This study contributes to the existing literature, which thus far only supports the use of adaptive treatment using precessation nicotine patches and has not assessed smokers in clinical settings. The trial used a clinical population with minimal exclusion criteria so that findings might be more readily generalizable to smokers seen in a clinical setting. A component of this trialâs design was allowing participants to select their medication. Another important element was to use minimal exclusion criteria, such that only 31% of screened participants were excluded from the trial. This resulted in a study sample with rates of psychiatric comorbidity (30.8%) similar to that in US smokers (35%).<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Of note, 72.8% of smoking cessation trials exclude some or all potential participants due to mental illness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The study sample also had a higher portion of Black or African American participants (43%) than is found in the general US population (13.6%) and in the US population of smokers (20.4%).<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p>
              <p>An important perspective on trial outcomes is provided by studies showing that varenicline plus bupropion was more effective than varenicline alone with continuous 12-week postquit smoking abstinence between groups (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.07-3.35; <italic>P</italic>â=â.03 vs OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.12; <italic>P</italic>â=â.03).<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Our study may have found a larger treatment effect between groups because in our study, the varenicline standard treatment arm did not use extended precessation varenicline.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is first trial that tested adaptive smoking cessation treatment in a clinical population with minimal exclusion criteria. As such, our best estimates for smoking abstinence in the standard treatment group were derived from randomized trials that used more restrictive eligibility criteria, eg, excluding smokers with physical or psychiatric illness.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230932r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> These studies provided estimates of smoking abstinence rates of 39.7% for adaptive treatment and 23.4% for standard treatment, an absolute difference between groups of 16.3 percentage points and a 1.7-fold increase in efficacy. To put this in perspective, nicotine patches, which are considered to have a meaningful treatment effect, lead to a 1.7-fold increase in efficacy over placebo.<sup><xref rid="zoi230932r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In this trial, the abstinence rate was 24% for adaptive treatment and 9% for standard treatment, with an absolute difference of 15.6 percentage points and a 2.8-fold increase in efficacy. Thus, although abstinence rates for all participants were lower in this trial than in our reference studies, the size of the absolute and relative effects between groups were as large as expected and large enough to be clinically meaningful.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has some limitations, including the exclusion of people with symptomatic alcohol dependence or substance use. Additionally, few or no Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian, Hispanic or Latinx, multiracial, or Pacific Islander people enrolled, limiting generalizability to these populations. Additionally, study participants were given free medications and modest compensation for study visits, which are both elements that reduce generalizability. Another limitation emerged from the fact that that the study was stopped early due to COVID-19, resulting in a sample size of 188 instead of 300, with our lower sample size resulting in the relatively wide 95% CI for our main outcome. The relatively high percentage (27%) of participants lost to follow up might be explained by modest compensation and high comorbidity. Participants with missing abstinence data were counted as nonabstinent, which adds to the uncertainty of study outcomes. An additional limitation is that the study was designed to compare adaptive treatment as a whole with standard treatment as a whole and was not designed to assess individual components of adaptive treatment (effects of extended precessation treatment, effects of adding a second medication for nonresponders). Overall, these limitations were seen as decreasing the strength of but not negating our conclusions.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial in daily smokers from a smoking cessation clinic with medication choice and limited exclusion criteria found higher smoking abstinence rates among participants randomized to adaptive compared with those randomized to nonadaptive pharmacotherapy. Specifically, these findings provide support for the use of precessation varenicline and precessation nicotine patches in an adaptive treatment regimen in which bupropion is provided to treatment nonresponders. This studyâs design provides greater generalizability to clinical populations. Our findings support an evolving body of literature on adaptive treatment.</p>
