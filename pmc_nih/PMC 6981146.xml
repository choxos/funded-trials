                <p id="Par1">Although health benefits of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet are established, it is not understood which food compounds result in these benefits. We used metabolomics to identify unique compounds from individual foods of a DASH-style diet and determined if these Food-Specific Compounds (FSC) are detectable in urine from participants in a DASH-style dietary study. We also examined relationships between urinary compounds and blood pressure (BP). Nineteen subjects were randomized into 6-week controlled DASH-style diet interventions. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was performed on 24-hour urine samples collected before and after each intervention and on 12 representative DASH-style foods. Between 66–969 compounds were catalogued as FSC; for example, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine was found to be unique to apple. Overall, 13–190 of these FSC were detected in urine, demonstrating that these unmetabolized food compounds can be discovered in urine using metabolomics. Although linear mixed effects models showed no FSC from the 12 profiled foods were significantly associated with BP, other endogenous and food-related compounds were associated with BP (N = 16) and changes in BP over time (N = 6). Overall, this proof of principle study demonstrates that metabolomics can be used to catalog FSC, which can be detected in participant urine following a dietary intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Human nutrition research includes controlled-feeding strategies to evaluate associations between consumption of specific foods or diets and health indicators. Recent advances in metabolomics make it possible to gather data on a multitude of foods and biosamples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nutrimetabolomics, which represents the intersection of metabolomics and nutrition research, offers an opportunity to investigate the effects of whole diets, specific foods, and food components on the human metabolome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For example, Rebholz, <italic>et al</italic>. applied metabolomics to identify serum markers of participant adherence to consuming a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A novel aspect of the Rebholz, <italic>et al</italic>. study was their effort to define a panel of markers indicative of a DASH-style eating pattern. Similarly, Gordon-Dseagu, <italic>et al</italic>. used metabolomics to explore the relationship between plasma markers, sleep, and a DASH-style diet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. These, and other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, support the proof-of-principle that metabolomics can discover and link biomarkers of food intake, from both whole diets and individual foods, to health outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Controlled-feeding studies are essential for understanding how diets, individual foods, and food constituents are related to indices of human health. However, the complexity of diets, limited understanding of chemical compositions of foods, shortage of food-specific biomarkers, and personalized nature of human metabolism limit the generalizability of results. Despite these challenges, nutrimetabolomics holds promise for discovering and validating food-derived biomarkers that can be assigned, for example, as biomarkers of intake and/or biomarkers of effect; either of which may associate with health indicators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The process of discovering and validating specific biomarkers of food intake is extensive, usually entailing well-controlled, acute feeding of a specific food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. An alternative is to first identify what compound(s) designate a food as unique by comparing the chemical composition of various foods using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. The patterns of these “food-specific compounds” (FSC) can then be traced in human biospecimens following whole diet interventions, again using metabolomics. FSC that associate with ingestion of specific foods from the whole diet can be classified as candidate biomarkers of food intake, potentially eliminating the need for acute feeding of a single food. While various terminologies are still being explored in the field of nutrimetabolomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, we are defining FSC as compounds detected in only one food and not in any other food present within the study diet. This alternative strategy, which in summary entails the discovery of FSC first in foods before tracing them back to biospecimens, is made possible by the comprehensive and high-throughput nature of metabolomics. Further, FSC can be associated with health indices to discover biomarkers of effect.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The purpose of this project was to provide proof-of-principle that a metabolomics-based strategy for biomarker discovery is plausible, by verifying that FSC can be found in urine following consumption of certain foods. We leveraged existing data and samples from a completed, randomized, controlled-feeding study originally designed to assess the effects of consuming a DASH-style diet containing different predominant sources of protein on changes in blood pressure (BP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The present study sought to: (1) characterize the chemical composition of selected foods consumed by participants in a DASH-style diet study using LC/MS; (2) determine if any of the compounds detected in these foods were unique to an individual food (i.e. categorize compounds as FSC); and (3) establish if FSC could be detected in 24-hour urine samples obtained from the study participants. To our knowledge, this study is unique in several ways. It is one of the first to provide a comprehensive, metabolomics-based characterization of compounds in multiple foods that were actually consumed by participants in a nutritional intervention study. Second, it is novel in using metabolomics to identify and trace compounds that are unique to foods back to human specimens. Finally, it is possibly the first to generate “food-specific signatures”, which comprise a sum of the FSC. Although not novel, we also performed association analysis between urinary compounds and BP levels. We hypothesized that FSC and/or other, food-related or endogenous compounds (i.e. non-FSC) in urine would be associated with BP and changes in BP after consuming the DASH-style diet.</p>

                <p id="Par7">Nineteen individuals (6 men and 13 women), recruited from the greater Lafayette, IN, region, provided informed consent to participate in a randomized, crossover, controlled feeding study, and completed the study protocol [mean ± SEM age: 61 ± 2 years; body mass index 31.2 ± 1.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The protocol was approved by the Purdue University Biomedical Institutional Review Board and was registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01696097 (09/26/2012). During the 18-week study period, participants initially consumed their self-chosen, unrestricted (typical) diets for two weeks. Participants were then randomly assigned to consume a DASH-style diet with either lean pork or chicken and fish as the predominant sources of dietary protein for six weeks. This time period was followed by a four-week washout period during which participants again consumed their typical diets prior to consuming the DASH-style diet containing the other predominant protein sources (Supplemental Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Samples utilized for the current research consisted of 12 individual foods consumed during the DASH-style diet and urine samples collected prior to each intervention and during the final two weeks of each controlled feeding period.</p>

                <p id="Par8">Twenty-four-hour ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured for 3 consecutive days during each of the four measurement periods using a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring system (SunTech Medical, Inc., Morrisville, NC, USA).

Twelve fresh, whole foods were selected from the menus and portions stored at −80 °C until analysis. Because the original study assessed the effects of different protein sources consumed with a DASH-style diet on BP responses, all four types of meat included in the diet (pork loin, chicken, fish, and beef loin) were analyzed. Fruits and vegetables, if not pre-washed, were washed with tap water and prepared with inedible parts (i.e. leaves or peels) removed. All foods were purchased at a grocery store in West Lafayette, IN, prepared for storage in a metabolic research kitchen at Purdue University, stored in a −80 °C freezer and shipped with dry ice to the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, where lyophilization and methanol extraction were performed.</p>

Hierarchical clustering of compounds from individual foods showed distinct differences in their compound composition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). For example, grapefruit appears to have many unique compounds compared to other foods in the study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, solid black inlaid box). Conversely, there are groups of compounds that are shared among many or all foods (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, dotted black box). The distance between foods is a rough estimation of their similarity, as visualized by the nodes and branches on the left of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>.

Depending on the food, between 66–969 compounds were classified as FSC (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column 3). For example, of the 754 compounds detected in apple, 108 of these were unique to apple when compared to the remaining 11 foods. A complete list of FSC is provided in Supplemental File- FSC. A range of 5–66 FSC had been previously reported in the food of interest (Supplemental File- FSC).

When FSC found in at least one of the 37 post-diet urine samples were considered, anywhere from 13 (tilapia) to 190 (grapefruit) FSC were also found in urine (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column 4), representing unmetabolized food compounds from these foods.</p>
                <p id="Par25">To further clarify the overlap between food-derived compounds and urine, the analysis was expanded to include all compounds that had been detected in any of the 12 foods. When compounds present in at least one urine sample were considered, the number of food compounds detected in pre- vs post- diet urine samples did not differ notably (Supplemental Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, column 2 vs 3). For example, there were 4,091 food-derived compounds present in at least one of the pre-diet urine samples and 3,744 compounds present in at least one of the post-diet urine samples. When considering inter-individual similarity, 280 compounds were found in at least 10 of the 19 participants’ post-diet urine samples (50%); between 48–95 (17–34%) of these compounds were also detected in at least one food. Finally, 44 compounds were observed in the majority of the 19 participants’ urine samples (80%); between 4–17 (9–39%) of these compounds were also found in at least one food. There was an increase in compounds from individual foods detected in the post-diet urines compared to the pre-diet urines, when compounds found in &gt;80% of urine samples are considered. For example, 17 broccoli compounds (FSC and non-FSC) were detected in at least 80% of the pre-diet urines and 20 broccoli compounds were detected in at least 80% of the post-diet urines.</p>

                <p id="Par26">Data were also used to determine if urinary levels of FSC were related to the time a food was ingested. For this purpose, urinary FSC (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, column 4) were used to determine if a linear relationship existed between a food-specific signature and time since consumption. A “food-specific signature” is defined here as an aggregate of all FSC for a food that were also detected in urine and includes the total sum of that food’s FSC abundance values in each individual. Aggregation enabled inclusion and analysis of rare FSC (i.e. those seen in only a few individuals). For example, plotting the intensity of the “grapefruit signature”, which was consumed on days 2 and 5 of both chicken/fish- and pork-based interventions, over time showed higher levels of grapefruit urinary FSC on the days of consumption <bold>(</bold>Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref><bold>)</bold>, with degradation of this signature over time. A Bonferonni adjusted significant linear relationship was found for the grapefruit- specific signature (p = 0.0007).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par29">Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of a step-wise, nutrimetabolomics approach to evaluating links between diet and health. One novel aspect of this study was the unbiased metabolomics profiling of 12 foods to generate a study-specific compound database. Although a small number of foods were profiled, all of these foods were consumed by all participants and are therefore highly relevant. The inclusion of a study specific database allowed us to assess the overlap of food compounds and to generate food-specific signatures. As expected, PCA results confirmed what is logically assumed, that fruits, vegetables, and meats cluster within their own phyla. Further, acylcarnitines were only detected in dietary protein samples while flavonoids were only found in fruits.</p>
              <p id="Par30">This study also confirmed that FSC, which were unmetabolized, can be detected in 24-hour urine samples using metabolomics. This information is valuable for understanding both an individual’s metabolism and the digestion kinetics of a particular food. Metabolism of a specific food is traditionally measured using a single, known metabolite of that food. Our current metabolomics strategy allowed us to determine how a food-specific signature, derived as an aggregate of a food’s FSC, changed over time. Only grapefruit and apple juice demonstrated differential metabolism signatures, likely due to the small sample size. In addition, in the current study, urinary FSC were observed in a few individuals, limiting our ability to associate FSC with BP. By summing a food’s FSC to create a food-specific signature we were able to include all, even rare, FSC, in our analysis of food metabolism. There are other possible aggregation techniques that could be used (e.g. a summed indicator of the presence of a compound). More research is needed to evaluate aggregation techniques for food-specific signatures.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Our hypothesis that urinary FSC would be significantly associated with BP or change in BP was not supported by the results. This may be due to the low number of FSC seen across multiple individuals, a small effect size for individual foods, or because only unmetabolized compounds were analyzed in this study. If the latter, this would suggest that BP may be more directly related to compounds that have undergone metabolic processing, including Phase I, Phase II, or microbiome-mediated metabolism. This emphasizes a challenge in our step-wise approach and in nutrimetabolomics, whereby it is currently not possible to accurately predict how a food component will be metabolized, either by humans and/or microbes, although new <italic>in silico</italic> tools to predict metabolic products, such as Biotransformer, are becoming available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Although beyond the scope of this study, results from <italic>in silico</italic> metabolism of FSC could be used to further mine the urine datasets for FSC metabolites that relate to BP; however, the potential for false positives may be high.</p>
              <p id="Par32">When all urinary compounds were considered, including FSC and other food-related and endogenous compounds (i.e. non- FSC), 16 were nominally associated with BP and 6 compounds with change in BP. Interestingly, these compounds represented both endogenous-to-human and exogenous compounds. For example, according to HMDB and FooDB, 3-(3-methylbutylidene)-1(3 H)-isobenzofuranone was previously found in green vegetables and wild celery. Celery was included as a snack item in the study diet and its presence in the participant’s urine is plausible. Similarly, 2-acetyl-3-methylpyrazine can be found in cereal and cereal products. Although metabolomics was not performed on any complex foods such as bread, both breads and cereals were included in the participants’ diets. In addition to food-related compounds, known endogenous-to-human compounds including 3-indolebutyric acid, a tryptophan metabolite, L-glutamic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and a dipeptide were associated with BP in this study. Similarly, among compounds associated with changes in BP (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), 1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-1,4-dihydronicotinamide was identified in milk; physoperuvine was found in fruits; and kynuramine is a metabolite of tryptophan. If replicable, these results suggest that unbiased metabolomics is useful for determining relationships between a wide array of urinary compounds and health indicators such as BP.</p>
              <p id="Par33">There were several limitations to this proof-of-principle study, including a relatively small number of participants and a moderate (~44%) level of compound annotation. A small sample size leads to less stable estimates of association and error in the association models that relate compounds and BP. Additionally, a larger sample size would have potentially enabled us to discover a set of compounds that could be used to define the DASH-style diet and in association analysis with BP. However, because some of the compounds that were significantly associated with BP (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) are also associated with the dietary intervention by default, these could potentially be considered “DASH-defining” compounds.</p>
              <p id="Par34">While compounds that were only annotated with mass could still be determined to be statistically significant, not knowing the identity of a compound limits the ability to interpret data. For example, mass-annotated compounds were not considered FSC and not explored further. In addition, determining if compounds were present in a food was a somewhat subjective exercise and is limited by what is currently known. However, this situation is improving as the chemical composition of more foods are elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Because of the large number of compounds surveyed, original citations demonstrating the presence of a compound in a food are not included, although these are listed in the databases used for annotation (Supplemental File_FSC). While the correctness of the database citations is presumed to be high, additional curation is needed to fully confirm the presence of compounds in individual foods. In addition, the accuracy of database annotations is not fully understood, with high potential for artifact when relying on mass alone. The possibility of inaccurate compound annotation emphasizes the need for validation of compounds as potential biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par35">A technical limitation is the use of only methanol precipitation during sample preparation of foods which biases the analysis towards hydrophilic compounds and results in relatively low representation of lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, increasing the potential for overlooking additional biomarkers. Additionally, electrospray ionization was used which is not ideal for detection of non-polar molecules. Thus, a large number of compounds present in foods, particularly plant based foods, were not included in this study. Overall, our results illustrate both the utility and limitation of metabolomics to accurately detect and identify food compounds.</p>
              <p id="Par36">This study demonstrates that the step-wise approach can also be used to discover novel candidate biomarkers of food intake, although limitations exist due to the small number of foods sampled compared to the number of foods available to consumers worldwide. While several compounds had previously been reported in the food of interest, between 9–239 of FSC were found to have been previously reported as present in any food, including foods outside our 12-food study dataset. For example, of the 969 FSC in grapefruit, 239 have been previously found in grapefruit; however, several of these have also been found in other foods, including other citrus foods. Moreover, 344 FSC were found in blueberry and 33 of these are likely to be present in blueberry based on internet searches. For example, epoxy-17-hydroxy-1-oxowitha-3,5,24-trienolide is a constituent of gooseberry and dalpanol O-glucoside is a flavonoid. While considered FSC for the purpose of the current study, these compounds could not be considered specific biomarkers of blueberry intake, but rather of berry consumption in general. As another example, one of the 108 compounds that were unique to apples within our dataset, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine, was previously detected in apples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A similar compound, diphenylamine, is used for control of superficial scald in stored apples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, these compounds have not been detected in foods other than apples and could be considered candidate biomarkers of apple intake, although further validation is required.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In summary, this study demonstrated a step-wise approach to nutrimetabolomics that can be utilized to identify and associate FSC and signatures in biofluids with health indicators. Overall, 824 of the 2009 annotated FSC were discoverable in urine, demonstrating that metabolomics can be used to effectively detect and identify FSC to serve as candidate biomarkers of food intake. Ongoing studies are expanding the food database to include a larger variety of foods and strains and using newly available informatics tools to perform <italic>in silico</italic> metabolism of FSC, to further these initial efforts in nutrimetabolomics.</p>
