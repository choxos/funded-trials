                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">More than half a million Americans died of an opioid-related overdose between 1999 and 2020, the majority occurring between 2015 and 2020. The opioid overdose mortality epidemic disproportionately impacts Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC): since 2015, overdose mortality rates have increased substantially more among Black (114%) and Latinx (97%) populations compared with White populations (32%). This is in part due to disparities in access to naloxone, an opioid antagonist that can effectively reverse opioid overdose to prevent death. Our recent pilot work determined that many barriers to naloxone access can be identified and addressed by syringe service programs (SSPs) using the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach to Naloxone distribution (SAIA-Naloxone). This randomized controlled trial will test SAIA-Naloxone’s ability to improve naloxone distribution in general and among BIPOC specifically.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will conduct a trial with 32 SSPs across California, randomly assigning 16 to the SAIA-Naloxone arm and 16 to receive implementation as usual. SAIA-Naloxone is a multifaceted, multilevel implementation strategy through which trained facilitators work closely with SSPs to (1) assess organization-level barriers, (2) prioritize barriers for improvement, and (3) test solutions through iterative change cycles until achieving and sustaining improvements. SSPs receiving SAIA-Naloxone will work with a trained facilitator for a period of 12 months. We will test SAIA-Naloxone’s ability to improve SSPs’ naloxone distribution using an interrupted time series approach. Data collection will take place during a 3-month lead-in period, the 12-month active period, and for an additional 6 months afterward to determine whether impacts are sustained. We will use a structured approach to specify SAIA-Naloxone to ensure strategy activities are clearly defined and to assess SAIA-Naloxone fidelity to aid in interpreting study results. We will also assess the costs associated with SAIA-Naloxone and its cost-effectiveness.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This trial takes a novel approach to improving equitable distribution of naloxone amid the ongoing epidemic and associated racial disparities. If successful, SAIA-Naloxone represents an important organizational-level solution to the multifaceted and multilevel barriers to equitable naloxone distribution.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">More than half a million Americans died of an opioid-related overdose between 1999 and 2020, the majority of which occurred between 2015 and 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In recent years, the mortality crisis has been exacerbated by an increased flow of synthetic opioids into the drug supply and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2021, the CDC reported that 100,306 opioid overdose deaths occurred in the 12 months prior, an increase of 28.5% from the year before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Racial disparities are prevalent in these data, with opioid overdose mortality rates having increased disproportionally among Black (114%) and Latinx (97%) populations compared to White populations (32%) since 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Further, in Americans older than 55, opioid overdose mortality rates among non-Hispanic Black men are four times greater than the overall rates among others in the same age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Despite alarming increases, opioid overdose mortality is entirely preventable with the administration of naloxone, a medication that reverses the opioid-induced respiratory depression that leads to fatal overdose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, access to naloxone remains limited, especially in populations with the most overdose deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Numerous challenges result in insufficient and inequitable access to naloxone including systemic racism and inadequate screening, refill, and data systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Despite these challenges, our recent pilot work determined that many barriers can be mitigated when addressed by syringe service programs (SSPs). Nationally, 94% of SSPs provide naloxone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and research from California has shown that SSPs reach and provide key health services for people who are disproportionately affected by health disparities, including Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">To improve naloxone distribution overall and address disparities in distribution throughout California, we designed a randomized controlled trial to test the ability of an implementation strategy (the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach [SAIA]) to enhance naloxone distribution by SSPs and ultimately reduce overdose deaths and overdose mortality disparities. SAIA is a multifaceted implementation strategy that supports frontline service providers in gaining a comprehensive view of the cascade of services they provide, identifying areas for improvement, and iteratively testing new approaches to improve their delivery of the full cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

              <p id="Par25">The present study responds to the opioid overdose mortality crisis and related disparities by determining the effectiveness of SAIA at improving naloxone distribution in general, and among BIPOC in particular, at SSPs throughout California.

                <p id="Par30">Opioid overdose mortality has shifted in California in recent years from prescription opioids to heroin and fentanyl. From 2011 through 2017, mortality due to prescription overdose decreased 6% while overdose deaths due to heroin and fentanyl increased precipitously at 89% and 320%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Ethnic disparities also persist within overdose deaths, with data from the California Opioid Overdose Surveillance Dashboard showing that Native Americans had significantly higher rates of prescription opioid and fentanyl overdose deaths compared to other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The authors concluded that data-informed interventions to address opioid overdose deaths are required to address these disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Regarding naloxone distribution in our own California-based research, we found that Black and Latinx PWID are 25% and 47% less likely, respectively, to receive naloxone compared to White PWID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our SAIA-Naloxone pilot data demonstrated that many barriers are surmountable and can be addressed by SSPs, leading to the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">SSPs provide access to and disposal of syringes and injection equipment for PWID and offer a variety of other prevention and treatment services. They are ideal organizational settings for naloxone distribution because they have staff who are culturally competent in providing services for PWID, and PWID already engage with and trust SSPs to care for their health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. By state law, only SSPs authorized by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) may possess syringes and naloxone for distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. At the time of this publication, all California SSPs authorized by CDPH have adopted naloxone distribution. However, despite this, implementation of naloxone distribution must improve to reduce population-level mortality rates and address disparities.</p>

                <p id="Par32">SSPs distribute naloxone to participants through a series of sequential steps that help ensure effective use. This typically beings with SSP staff routinely engaging participants in naloxone screening. Screening takes the form of staff-initiated discussion during service utilization to gauge participants’ awareness of naloxone and knowledge regarding its administration. If SSP staff determine that a participant would benefit from naloxone training and distribution and the participant signals interest, staff provide a brief training on effective naloxone administration. SSP staff then distribute initial doses or provide refills during participants’ subsequent visits. During each visit, staff also work with participants to determine their interest in secondary distribution so that others in their communities may benefit from their visit. There may be inefficiencies throughout this process that need to be addressed to improve naloxone distribution among PWID seeking services at SSPs.</p>

This structured yet iterative process takes place over three main steps. The first step utilizes the <italic>cascade analysis tool</italic> (CAT), a visual aid that uses clinic data to help the specialist and staff identify participant drop-offs along the delivery cascade. Gimbel and colleagues (2016) identified the CAT as adaptable in their original SAIA trial, and subsequent SAIA studies have modified the tool to fit an array of cascades across varied health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The second step focuses on <italic>process mapping</italic>, where the specialist assists staff in documenting the sequential steps of participant care to understand potential causes of participant drop-off. <italic>Continuous quality improvement</italic> (CQI) comprises the final step, which focuses on group design of “micro-interventions,” solutions intended to reduce drop-offs identified during the process mapping step.

Some solutions might involve systems redesign, streamlining services, and/or improving knowledge and beliefs among SSP staff. For example, if SSP staff designed a solution focused on increasing naloxone trainings with BIPOC participants, the specialist might encourage staff to consider system redesign; linkage of SSP staff to trainings, webinars, and other resources that address aspects of racial equity and anti-Black racism in overdose prevention; and delivery of naloxone services by BIPOC staff. The specialist will help SSP staff identify the extent to which their solution improved components of the naloxone delivery cascade. Based on those results, SSP staff may choose to further adjust the current solution, design and test additional solutions in conjunction, or test different solutions entirely. Once SSP staff make a decision, the CQI cycle repeats. Allowing time for startup, SSPs are expected to complete up to eight CQI cycles during the 12-month active phase of the trial. Some SSPs may complete fewer cycles depending on the solutions they choose to implement and test, as certain solutions may require more time to implement or a greater time horizon to observe an impact.</p>

We will ask the primary contact at each SSP about basic organizational characteristics (location, number of staff, budget, etc.). Next, we will ask the primary contacts as well as other staff involved with naloxone distribution at each SSP about contextual variables such as implementation climate and leadership engagement for improving naloxone distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par51">We will assess SAIA-Naloxone fidelity at the specialist level. Assessment will utilize descriptive statistics such as means/medians, standard deviations/interquartile ranges, and ranges given the small sample of specialists employed by the study (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Fidelity to SAIA-Naloxone focuses on assessing the domains of content, coverage, frequency, duration, quality, and participant responsiveness of SAIA-Naloxone. To monitor fidelity, all meetings between SAIA-Naloxone specialists and SSPs will be audio recorded, and the specialist will document each meeting with an SSP in a site-specific encounter log that includes the duration of the encounter, the roles of meeting attendees, and which of the three steps the specialist completed. Study staff will rate meeting content, quality, and participant responsiveness by reviewing 20% of recorded sessions using a fidelity checklist. To assess frequency, duration, and coverage, study staff will review and assess each encounter log.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome variables</title>
                  <p id="Par52">Primary outcomes center on the multidimensional variable of implementation effectiveness. Implementation effectiveness “is an organization-level construct that refers to the aggregated consistency, quality, and appropriateness of innovation use within an organization” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Implementation effectiveness fits our broad objectives, focused on the extent to which SAIA-Naloxone impacts naloxone distribution at the organizational level. Accordingly, SSPs represent the primary unit of analysis. The Proctor et al. (2011) taxonomy of implementation outcomes forms our operationalization of implementation effectiveness, focusing on SSPs’ reach of naloxone screening and fidelity to naloxone cascade completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par53">Aim 1 focuses on SAIA Naloxone’s ability to improve implementation effectiveness relative to IAU. We will assess “reach” as a proxy for the implementation effectiveness concepts of appropriateness and consistency, evaluating the number of participants screened for naloxone engagement, while accounting for the total number of participants who present for services. We will assess fidelity (i.e., fidelity to cascade completion) as a proxy for the implementation effectiveness concept of quality, evaluating the number of people who receive naloxone, again accounting for the total number of SSP participants screened for naloxone distribution. We collected similar indicators from SSPs in prior studies due to their utility in analyses and feasibility during collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Aim 2 focuses on SAIA-Naloxone’s ability to improve implementation effectiveness for BIPOC and other key participant subgroups relative to improvements in SSP participants overall. Therefore, operationalization of Aim 2 outcomes mirror those from Aim 1 but with a focus on those groups. Furthermore, our focus on the overall and disaggregated proportion of people receiving naloxone stems from a strong body of research showing that such outcomes significantly predict opioid overdose mortality rates at the SSP level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par54">We will harmonize primary outcome variable collection timing between SAIA-Naloxone and IAU SSPs, with both submitting data electronically on a fixed schedule. SSPs will receive prorated financial incentives for the number of completed data submissions at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization. Based on our prior work, we anticipate retaining 98% of SSPs’ data submissions for 12 months after randomization and 92% of submissions at 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Cost and cost-effectiveness variables</title>
                  <p id="Par55">We will collect cost outcomes using a modified version of the Substance Abuse Services Cost Analysis Program (SASCAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], widely applied and adapted to a variety of behavioral and public health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The modified SASCAP will capture resource use and costs from the SSP provider perspective, as this perspective best aligns with SAIA-Naloxone’s focus on improving the naloxone delivery cascade as measured by the number of people receiving naloxone (including disaggregated numbers for BIPOC and other key subgroups) and the number of doses distributed. To collect the resources used for each of the three SAIA-Naloxone steps, the SASCAP will systematically track the time, space resources, and any material resources utilized by SAIA-Naloxone specialists and SSP staff involved in the strategy over the active and sustainment phases. We will also collect data on the time spent training SAIA-Naloxone specialists, SSP staff wages, building costs, and material costs.</p>

                <p id="Par56">Before model fitting, we will assess whether there is significant variation across the three potential levels of aggregation for each outcome: (1) within-SSP level (repeated measures over time), (2) between-SSP level, and (3) county level. We will also examine the functional form of changes over time in outcomes. We assume that piecewise linear (i.e., linear change during the 3-month lead-in period, post-implementation linear change from baseline through 18 months, and a period of treatment effect “deterioration” (if any) between 12 and 18 months) will be the predominant functional form, though with this large number of assessments, nonlinear forms may be necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We will estimate a random intercept (<italic>π</italic><sub><italic>0is</italic></sub>), which is the estimated (conditional) mean value of the outcome at time = 0 (e.g., lead-in baseline), and two random slopes (<italic>π</italic><sub><italic>1is,</italic></sub><italic> π</italic><sub><italic>2is</italic></sub>): (1) the estimated per-year change in Y from the lead-in phase through 18 months; and (2) the “deterioration” phase, capturing how much reduction there is in change over the last year, if any, for the SAIA-Naloxone condition.</p>
                <p id="Par57">Level 2 will examine the between-SSP level effects. The key predictor included in <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>qis</italic></sub> is a 0/1 dummy indicator indicating whether SSP <italic>i</italic> was in the SAIA-Naloxone condition or IAU. <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>1s</italic></sub> will capture the average change over time in naloxone distribution (and other outcomes), which (1) should not be significantly different from zero during the lead-in period and (2) will vary by SAIA-Naloxone and IAU after implementation (by virtue of the SAIA-Naloxone × time period 1 interaction). <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>0s</italic></sub> will capture the conditional mean level of naloxone distribution, which, if it varies by implementation condition, would capture a mean shift in our study outcomes. <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>2s</italic></sub> will capture the change over time in naloxone distribution during the second year; if it interacts with the SAIA-Naloxone indicator, it will capture slope differences over time beyond 1 year between SAIA-Naloxone and the IAU condition, with Year 1 gains maintained if this parameter estimate is nonsignificant.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Level 3 will capture county-level variability in intercepts and, if necessary, slopes over time. As mentioned previously, our Aim 2 analysis will use the subset of SSPs that report outcome data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender. For both Aims 1 and 2, we will reject the null hypothesis (i.e., there are no differences between SAIA-Naloxone and IAU SSPs regarding the test statistics described above) if <italic>p</italic>-values are equal to or less than an alpha coefficient of 0.05.</p>
                <p id="Par59">We structured a Monte Carlo power analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] using the parameters from our pilot. For Aim 1, we structured a population model based on the number of weekly data submissions from SSPs) with a binary predictor structured to have the following effects, using the lead-in period standard deviation across 1 year in the pilot (15.09) as the denominator for the effect size. The mean shift in post-implementation outcomes was 22.76 additional people served under SAIA-Naloxone, yielding a Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> of 1.50. The per-week increase in number served under SAIA-Naloxone was 1.29, reaching a longitudinal Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> effect size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] of 1.0 by 11 weeks. We generated 250 synthetic samples of <italic>N</italic> = 32 and analyzed the samples in Mplus while imposing the random effect structure from pilot estimates and a county-level intraclass correlation of 0.05. Specific to Aims 1 hypotheses that pertain to the active 12-month phase, we will have at least 80% power to detect a post-implementation mean shift and differences in slopes over time. Specific to Aims 1 hypothesis that pertain to the sustainment phase, detecting treatment effect deterioration from 12 to 18 months for 80% power requires deterioration equivalent to a Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> of 0.48. The extremely large number of repeated measures offsets the sample size of 32 with regard to statistical power to detect slope differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par60">We will calculate cost estimates for each of the three SAIA-Naloxone steps. We will multiply the quantity of a resource (e.g., labor) used by its price (e.g., wage) and then calculate the average cost for each step. Our cost-effectiveness analysis approach will follow the methods our authorship group have implemented in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. We will combine our cost estimates with the estimated changes in outcomes, the number of people receiving naloxone, and the number of BIPOC receiving naloxone. To derive cost-effectiveness ratios, we will calculate the difference in costs and outcomes between the two arms. We will then calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the ratio of the difference in costs to the difference in outcomes. For example, for effectiveness defined as the number of people receiving naloxone, the ICER represents the incremental cost spent for an additional person receiving naloxone. We will also calculate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The CEACs incorporate the inherent joint variability of the cost and effectiveness estimates, and they show the probability that an intervention is cost-effective as a function of the policymaker’s intrinsic valuation or willingness to pay for the clinical outcome. We will use nonparametric bootstrap methods to calculate CEACs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par61">This trial represents several important advancements within implementation research. Since the initial SAIA trial to improve prevention services for mother-to-child HIV transmission in Kenya, Mozambique, and Côte d’Ivoire in 2014, the strategy has been adapted several times for the purposes of improving hypertension, mental health, and adult and pediatric HIV care systems across the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To our knowledge, this trial will be one of the first randomized trials of SAIA in the United States and among SSPs, and the first focused on improving the naloxone cascade and on equity-centered outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par62">The study’s U.S. focus comes at a critical moment, as the country has experienced the highest levels of opioid overdose mortality in its history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Racial disparities are present within the epidemic with BIPOC experiencing some of the least favorable outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In response to the crisis, lawmakers at the federal level and in every state have enacted some type of naloxone access legislation to improve distribution of the lifesaving treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Despite these legal efforts, naloxone distribution remains insufficient against the backdrop of persistently increasing opioid-related fatalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To combat the epidemic and the disparities within, researchers have called for multifaceted strategies focused on community-based organizations that address major barriers—such as structural racism—to improve naloxone distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. SAIA-Naloxone represents an attentive response to these calls given its focus on working within SSPs and toward equity-focused outcomes. SSPs are often community-based programs that PWID trust to provide quality health care amidst systems that criminalize and stigmatize substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. SAIA-Naloxone’s multifaceted and multilevel strategies also respond to the complex and unique needs of different SSPs throughout California. If successful, SSPs may utilize recently released federal and state funds focused on curbing the epidemic to adopt SAIA-Naloxone as a means of improving naloxone distribution.</p>
              <p id="Par63">This trial also takes a pragmatic and theory-informed approach to specifying SAIA-Naloxone and assessing its fidelity. Our approach combines Proctor et al.’s (2017) strategy specification recommendations with Carroll et al.’s (2007) conceptual framework of implementation fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In doing so, we hope to clearly report the strategy’s activities as well as assess the extent to which they were carried out as intended. Combining structured specification and fidelity assessment might improve our understanding of not only how the strategy works but also of the likelihood that impacts on outcomes are due to the strategy itself and not to other factors (i.e., assessment of a type III research error). Fidelity results may additionally highlight facets of the strategy’s implementation that future applications could harness or improve.</p>
              <p id="Par64">The current study builds upon existing evidence for the SAIA strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] as well as our own pilot work that brought SAIA into SSPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. If successful, SAIA-Naloxone may represent a pragmatic and scalable systems approach to combating the opioid overdose mortality crisis and the disparities within.</p>
