                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>In the global phase 1/2 LIBRETTO-001 trial (NCT03157128) in advanced <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic>-altered solid tumors, selpercatinib was dosed orally (160 mg twice every day) in 28-day cycles. Patients with baseline intracranial metastases had MRI/CT scans every 8 weeks for 1 year (12 weeks thereafter). In this pre-planned analysis of patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC with baseline intracranial metastases, the primary endpoint was independently assessed intracranial objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included intracranial disease control rate, intracranial duration of response, and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) independently reviewed.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Eighty patients with NSCLC had brain metastases at baseline. Patients were heavily pretreated (median = 2 systemic therapies, range = 0â€“10); 56% of patients received â‰¥1 course of intracranial radiation (14% whole brain radiotherapy, 45% stereotactic radiosurgery). Among 22 patients with measurable intracranial disease at baseline, intracranial ORR was 82% [95% confidence interval (CI), 60â€“95], including 23% with complete responses. Among all intracranial responders (measurable and nonmeasurable, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 38), median duration of intracranial response was not reached (95% CI, 9.3â€“NE) at a median duration of follow-up of 9.5 months (IQR = 5.7, 12.0). At 12 months, 55% of intracranial responses were ongoing. In all 80 patients, median intracranial PFS was 13.7 months (95% CI, 10.9â€“NE) at a median duration of follow-up of 11.0 months (IQR = 7.4, 16.5). No new safety signals were revealed in patients with brain metastases compared with the full NSCLC trial population.</p>

              <p>Brain metastases frequently occur in <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive nonâ€“small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), with an approximate 50% lifetime prevalence reported. Intracranial metastases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Thus, there is a need for novel RET-directed, targeted therapy strategies with high efficacy. Selpercatinib, a selective and potent RET inhibitor, shows compelling preliminary evidence of activity in patients with brain metastases. This phase 1/2 trial (LIBRETTO-001) evaluated the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs with intracranial metastases. In this study, selpercatinib was well tolerated, achieving high intracranial response rate, and prolonged intracranial duration of response and intracranial progression-free survival. Combined, these results support selpercatinib as a new standard of care therapy for the primary treatment of brain metastases for patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The rearranged during transfection (<italic toggle="yes">RET</italic>) proto-oncogene encodes the RET receptor tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in the development and maintenance of several tissue types (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Activating <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> alterations, such as recurrent gene fusions, lead to ligand-independent, constitutively active RET tyrosine kinase signaling that drives oncogenesis and tumor progression (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Oncogenic <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusions are found in 1% to 2% of nonâ€“small cell lung cancers (NSCLC; refs. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A global multi-institutional registry of patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC found that approximately half of these patients develop brain metastases during their lifetime (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); leptomeningeal disease has also been observed (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
              <p>Intracranial sanctuary site metastasis is a liability shared by many other oncogene-addicted cancers, including <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-mutant or <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs. A major advance in the management of these tumors has been the development of brain-penetrant tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These agents not only prevent or delay intracranial treatment failure, but are also increasingly utilized as primary therapy for patients with brain metastases instead of localized interventions such as radiotherapy, an intervention potentially associated with long-term quality of life impairment (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Selpercatinib (LOXO-292), a highly potent and selective RET inhibitor, has marked and durable efficacy in patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve or platinum chemotherapy-treated <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). On the basis of these data, selpercatinib has received approval in the United States for any line of therapy of <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive metastatic NSCLCs, and is the first RET-selective inhibitor granted EU approval (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Given that several <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive cancers harbor a proclivity for intracranial metastasis, selpercatinib was specifically designed to achieve levels in the central nervous system (CNS) necessary to inhibit RET. Consistently, selpercatinib demonstrated robust intracranial efficacy in orthotopically implanted <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive tumors in mice (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Preclinical observations, anecdotal case reports (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and preliminary experience from a prospective clinical trial (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) suggest that selpercatinib is active in patients with brain metastases. To date, however, the true intracranial efficacy of selpercatinib in a large prospective series of <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs remains unknown. To address this key evidence gap, we conducted a pre-planned analysis of selpercatinib in patents with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC and brain metastases enrolled to the global phase 1/2 LIBRETTO-001 trial (NCT03157128).</p>

                <title>Study design and treatment</title>
                <p>LIBRETTO-001 is an ongoing, global, first-in-human, open label, phase 1/2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03157128) open at 89 investigative sites in 16 countries. A total of 31 sites from 11 countries enrolled at least one patient with a <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC and investigator-assessed brain metastases at baseline in the analysis dataset used here. Full details of the trial design have been published (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Briefly, patients eligible for this pre-planned analysis were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: age â‰¥12 years; presence of a prospectively-identified <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion as determined by locally-obtained testing performed in a certified laboratory; ECOG performance status 0 to 2; adequate organ function; and a QTc interval of â‰¤470 milliseconds. Any number of prior therapies were permitted. Brain imaging was a requirement at baseline for all <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive solid tumor NSCLC patients. MRI was preferred; CT with contrast was acceptable if MRI was contraindicated. Patients with known brain metastases were eligible for the trial if neurological symptoms and CNS imaging were stable and their steroid dose was stable for 14 days prior to the first dose of selpercatinib, and no CNS surgery or radiation had been performed for 28 days [14 days for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)] prior to dosing. All prior local treatments for CNS disease (e.g., surgery, whole brain radiation, SRS), the start and stop dates for each prior local therapy, and the specific lesions treated (if SRS and/or surgery) were recorded. For patients who had received CNS radiation prior to the trial, intracranial lesions needed to show postradiation progression to be selected as a target lesion at baseline.</p>
                <p>This protocol adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization. The institutional review board of each investigative site approved the trial, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>Selpercatinib doses ranged from 20 mg once a day to 240 mg twice a day for patients enrolled in the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study. Dose escalation to dose levels determined to be safe was allowed for phase 1 patients after a minimum of one cycle of treatment. In the phase 2 portion of the study, selpercatinib was dosed orally at 160 mg twice a day in 28-day continuous cycles. Treatment continued until death, progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Patients could continue selpercatinib treatment after documented progression if they were continuing to derive clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator.</p>
                <p>The main efficacy endpoint for the current analysis was intracranial objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) determined by an independent review committee (IRC), a pre-planned secondary endpoint for the overall LIBRETTO-001 program. The IRC was composed of expert radiologists who were blinded to investigator-determined systemic response. IRC radiologists were provided with prior or on-study radiation information and a history of all prior treatments for CNS disease. Intracranial ORR (%) was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall intracranial response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the total number of patients with baseline intracranial disease. All responses were required to be confirmed by a repeat assessment performed no sooner than 28 days later. Intracranial disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage of patients who had a best overall intracranial response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) lasting 16 weeks or more after selpercatinib initiation. Consistent with RECIST 1.1, patients with exclusively nonmeasurable intracranial disease at baseline could be classified for best overall response as CR (in the case where all nonmeasurable lesions resolved), PD, or non-CR/non-PD. Another prespecified secondary endpoint was intracranial duration of response (DoR) as determined by IRC, defined as the time from start of an intracranial response until intracranial progression or death, regardless of cause. Intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) was an exploratory endpoint defined as the time from treatment start to intracranial disease progression as assessed by IRC or death from any cause. Extracranial progression was not included in the intracranial PFS assessment. Safety was another exploratory endpoint for the population with NSCLC and intracranial metastases.</p>

                <title>Trial assessments</title>
                <p>Radiologic tumor assessments (MRI, preferentially; CT, with and without intravenous contrast when MRI was clinically contraindicated) were conducted at baseline for all patients with phase 2 <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive solid tumor NSCLC. Repeat brain imaging using the same modality as at baseline was conducted for all patients with brain metastases identified by baseline imaging every 8 weeks for 1 year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. Safety was assessed according to the NCI CTCAEs (version 4.03; ref. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>All analyses were prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. The Clopperâ€“Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence interval (CI) for response rates. Kaplanâ€“Meier method was used to estimate median for intracranial DoR and PFS. Median follow up was calculated using the reverse Kaplanâ€“Meier method, that is median follow up is calculated like the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimate of the survival function, but with the meaning of the status indicator reversed so that the event of interest becomes the censor. SAS statistical software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute) was used to perform all analyses.</p>

                <p>A total of 531 patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive cancers were enrolled to phase 1 or phase 2 of the trial between May 2017 and June 17, 2019, including 80 patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC and investigator-determined baseline brain metastases (92.5% by MRI, 5% by CT, 2.5% missing) that met criteria for inclusion in the current analysis (online appendix, <xref rid="S6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Among these 80 patients, 22 patients had at least one baseline measurable intracranial lesion and 58 had exclusively nonmeasurable baseline intracranial lesions.</p>
                <p>The demographic and disease characteristics of patients with baseline brain metastases are summarized in Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The median age was 62 years (range 36â€“86 years), and most patients had an ECOG performance status of zero or one. Consistent with previous analyses, the most common <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion partner was <italic toggle="yes">KIF5B</italic> (70% of patients). Most patients had received prior systemic therapy (91%), with a median of two prior treatments (range 0â€“10), including 79% of patients who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and 41% of patients who were treated with one or more multikinase inhibitors. Prior therapy for brain metastases included surgery in 9%, stereotactic radiosurgery in 45%, and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in 14% of patients. Of the 45 patients who received prior cranial radiotherapy, 73% had completed this therapy at least 2 months prior to beginning selpercatinib treatment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Intracranial metastases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with oncogene-addicted cancers. The results of this global, multicenter study demonstrate that selpercatinib has robust intracranial efficacy by blinded independent review of patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs and brain metastases. The drug achieved a high intracranial response rate and the intracranial DoR and intracranial PFS were prolonged. Moreover, selpercatinib treatment was well tolerated in this patient population, with no new safety signals identified. Taken together, these data support selpercatinib as a new standard of care for primary treatment of brain metastases for patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC. Comprehensive molecular profiling analysis is warranted in the future to further analyze the biomarkers of intracranial response and resistance to selpercatinib.</p>
              <p>The intracranial activity of selpercatinib in this phase 1/2 trial is broadly consistent with the intracranial activity observed with other contemporary targeted therapies for genomically-driven NSCLCs. In <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic> fusion-positive lung cancers, alectinib achieved an intracranial ORR of 64%, an intracranial disease control rate of 90%, and durable disease control (median intracranial DoR of 10.8 months) among patients with measurable disease in a comparable analysis of two single-arm phase 2 trials (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). At 6 months, 58% of patients were progression/death-free. In <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-mutant lung cancers, osimertinib achieved an intracranial ORR of 54% and an intracranial disease control rate of 92% in a pooled analysis of two phase 2 trials (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). At 6 months, 72% of patients were intracranial progression/death-free. By comparison, selpercatinib treatment resulted in an intracranial ORR of 82% and an intracranial disease control rate of 100%, and at 6 months, 79% of patients were intracranial progression/death-free. Median intracranial DoR was not reached (95% CI, 9.3â€“NE). Both alectinib and osimertinib are recognized as standards of care for tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naÃ¯ve patients with <italic toggle="yes">ALK</italic> fusion-positive and <italic toggle="yes">EGFR</italic>-mutant lung cancers, respectively, similar to the role of selpercatinib in <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive lung cancers.</p>
              <p>Selpercatinib's activity in the CNS has important implications beyond <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs with brain metastases. A CR to selpercatinib in leptomeningeal disease has already been described in a patient with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLC (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), demonstrating the activity of the drug beyond parenchymal disease. Selpercatinib has been shown to be active against intracranial metastases in a patient with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive thyroid cancer (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), a patient with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic>-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and a pediatric patient with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive congenital mesoblastic nephroma (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). LIBRETTO-001 continues to enroll patients with non-lung/non-thyroid cancers that harbor <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusions or mutations. Additional confirmation of the drug's activity in this setting will help establish the overall impact of selpercatinib on intracranial disease in patients with RET-dependent cancers of any histology in both adult and pediatric populations.</p>
              <p>Although this prospective, pre-planned, independently-reviewed analysis has many strengths, it does have some important limitations. Patients in this cohort had received a variety of both systemic and local therapies for management of their <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs. Despite this, intracranial activity was observed across various treatment subgroups. In addition, at the time of analysis, a majority of patients remained progression-free and a majority of responses were ongoing; thus, stable medians could not be estimated. Ongoing follow-up will reveal more precise estimates of intracranial response durability and PFS. Moreover, this study did not specifically address whether selpercatinib can prevent or delay intracranial progression in patients with NSCLC that begin treatment without intracranial involvement. As a phase 1/2 trial, LIBRETTO-001 did not require head and neck MRI/CT scans during treatment unless intracranial disease was identified at baseline and the trial could not address this question. Intriguingly, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors with substantial intracranial activity have already been shown to prolong the time to the acquisition of CNS metastases in fusion-positive lung cancers compared with earlier-generation kinase inhibitors with less optimal intracranial activity (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, there is a lack of prospective data evaluating long-term outcomes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors alone compared with SRS and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in managing brain metastases.</p>
              <p>Selpercatinib is currently being evaluated in LIBRETTO-431 (NCT04194944), an ongoing randomized, global, phase 3 study of selpercatinib versus platinum-pemetrexed with or without pembrolizumab in treatment-naÃ¯ve patients with <italic toggle="yes">RET</italic> fusion-positive NSCLCs. This trial will allow the further characterization of selpercatinib activity in patients with NSCLC and intracranial metastases.</p>
