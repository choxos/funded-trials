                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Can laboratory data be used to predict durable response to ustekinumab among patients with Crohn disease before they commit to long-term treatment?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi190165-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this cohort study of 401 participants with active Crohn disease, a prediction model using demographic and laboratory data available after 1 dose of ustekinumab reliably identified patients with active Crohn disease who were likely to respond to treatment beyond week 42. The week-6 albumin to C-reactive protein ratio seemed to be a pragmatic predictor of future remission, but early ustekinumab serum levels appeared to add little to the predictive value of this model.</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi190165-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>Long-term ustekinumab response may be predicted using demographic and laboratory data before week 8 of treatment, without the need for costly drug-level monitoring.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been estimated to affect more than 1.6 million people in the United States on the basis of the adjusted prevalence rates in the 2010 US white population.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Although the advent of expensive biological medications revolutionized the treatment of IBD,<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> the increasing use of these agents has revealed substantial heterogeneity of treatment effect across the population with IBD and likely overuse of these medications. Antiâtumor necrosis factor drugs, still the standard therapy for moderate to severe IBD, did not induce remission in 20% to 30% of patients and lost effectiveness within a year in another 30% to 40% of patients.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Novel biological agents emerging in recent years can help some patients who do not respond to antiâtumor necrosis factor therapy,<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> but these agents are ineffective in many others.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Initial efforts to improve remission rates with these agents have focused on optimizing serum drug levels and screening for antidrug antibodies, and these efforts have had some success.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Interest has been growing in personalizing treatment strategies by using methods such as machine learning to match patients with IBD to the treatment most likely to work for them. These techniques using clinical and laboratory predictors that outperform drug levels alone may decrease avoidable drug costs, hospitalizations, surgical procedures, and complications while allowing patients with IBD to achieve symptomatic and biological remission much sooner than the typical 52-week clinical trial end point.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Such approaches have not yet been applied to ustekinumab. Previous studies of ustekinumab pharmacokinetics present mixed findings. Some suggest a dose-related association between serum drug concentrations of ustekinumab and treatment efficacy in Crohn disease similar to that seen with other novel agents<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>; others suggest that serum drug concentrations of ustekinumab are relatively poor predictors of clinical response in Crohn disease.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The purpose of the present study was to (1) identify characteristics of patients with Crohn disease at baseline and at week 8 of ustekinumab therapy (before the start of subcutaneous maintenance therapy) that predict long-term remission on ustekinumab therapy using C-reactive protein (CRP) level as a biomarker of disease activity, and (2) evaluate the incremental advantage of using these predictors compared with drug level alone.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We used publicly available data from 3 randomized clinical trials enrolling patients with active Crohn disease, UNITI-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01369329">NCT01369329</ext-link>), UNITI-2 (identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01369342">NCT01369342</ext-link>), and IM-UNITI (identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01369355">NCT01369355</ext-link>), conducted from 2011 to 2015. Trials UNITI-1 and UNITI-2 were conducted at 178 sites in 23 countries and 175 sites in 23 countries respectively. The IM-UNITI trial was conducted at 260 sites in 27 countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These data sets were obtained through the YODA (Yale Open Data Access) Project.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board confirmed that institutional review board approval for this study was not necessary because it evaluated previously collected and deidentified phase 3 clinical trial data. Informed consent was not obtained for this reason. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/">STROBE</ext-link>) reporting guideline and the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/">TRIPOD</ext-link>) reporting guideline. Data analysis was performed from November 1, 2017, to June 1, 2018.</p>
              <p>The original clinical trial cohort had 1409 participants, 668 of whom were either randomized to placebo or lost to follow-up by week 8 of the trial and therefore excluded. The remaining 741 participants received ustekinumab at week 8. Of these, 462 participants had CRP measurements of 5 mg/L or higher at enrollment, suggesting active disease, and 61 participants were excluded for missing values. The final cohort comprised 401 participants, whose data were used for the week-8 model and sensitivity analyses (eTable in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190165-1-s">Supplement</xref>). The baseline model excluded 30 additional patients for missing baseline laboratory tests and included 371 patients (eFigure 1 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190165-1-s">Supplement</xref>).</p>
              <sec id="H2-1-ZOI190165">
                <title>Predictor Variables</title>
                <p>The week-8 model included 401 patients, 5 demographic predictors (age, sex, race, ethnicity, and weight), and laboratory tests performed at week 8 (CRP level at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 8; ratio of serum ustekinumab level to CRP level at week 0 after the first ustekinumab dose, week 3, and week 6 [eTable in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190165-1-s">Supplement</xref>]). The week-8 drug level was not used in modeling because of missing values. We also tracked CRP measurement in the long term and calculated mean, maximum, minimum, and the slope of CRP level from weeks 0 to 3, weeks 3 to 6, and weeks 6 to 8.</p>
                <p>The baseline model at week 0 included 371 patients, and 30 patients were excluded from this cohort owing to missing baseline laboratory tests. This model included the 5 demographic predictors and 10 laboratory predictors (CRP level; platelet count; hemoglobin level; absolute counts of leukocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, segmented neutrophils, and basophils; and serum ustekinumab concentration measured approximately 1 hour after the first drug dose).</p>

                <title>Definition of Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the most recent available CRP measurement taken after week 42, which we used as a surrogate biological end point for Crohn disease inflammatory activity in patients with baseline CRP elevation. We dichotomized the outcome into 2 categories: CRP level lower than 5 mg/L as evidence of Crohn disease remission and CRP level of 5 mg/L or higher as evidence of continued Crohn disease activity and thus treatment failure (to convert CRP to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 9.524).<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We chose this outcome because endoscopic data (the criterion standard for disease activity) were not available from the trial cohort of interest, and CRP level was the only objective disease activity measure available at multiple time points from the clinical trials.</p>
                <p>No study visits or missing CRP measurements after week 42 were defined as treatment failures. We considered the utility of a subjective outcome measure, such as the Crohn Disease Activity Index (CDAI), but given the relatively low specificity of the CDAI, we instead chose an objective primary outcome variable. We also considered fecal calprotectin given its known high sensitivity over CRP for detection of active endoscopic disease activity.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> However, we were limited by missing fecal calprotectin data, which might bias our results; instead, we chose to include fecal calprotectin as an outcome in a sensitivity analysis.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis and Model Development</title>
                <p>Random forest is a machine learning method of prediction that uses an ensemble of decision trees<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> to classify observations. As previously described elsewhere,<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> information from a single patient (an observation) is evaluated by many decision trees (a forest) built on different bootstrap samples of the original data set. Each tree classifies the observation independently, which can be viewed as that treeâs vote. The forest then combines the votes from the individual trees to generate a summary prediction. A cutoff value of the outcome variable is typically prespecified to provide the desired balance of sensitivity and specificity for the model. We used 500 trees to build each random forest model. Random forest modeling was chosen in this case because of its ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships and to easily accommodate complexities, such as interaction terms, which may not be captured by parametric models like logistic regression. This method has been used in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>

This splitting process was replicated 100 times, and each time the model was fit on the training set and used to predict the outcome in the testing set. This 100-times replication process was used to generate an estimate of the variation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) computed on the testing set. The mean AUROC was then obtained from the 100 replication test sets. Subsequently, the 1 split that produced a representative AUROC that was closest to the mean AUROC for the week-8 model was selected as a representative split (training and testing cohorts) for both the week-8 and baseline models. This split was used to produce AUROC plots, cutoff point selection, and misclassification tables. These results were then compared across models.</p>
                <p>The AUROC was used to evaluate the performance of each model. All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical language R, version 3.3, randomForest<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and pROC packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). The optimal cutoff was defined as the point on the receiver operating characteristic plot with the highest sensitivity and specificity (ie, the point at which [1 â sensitivity]<sup>2</sup> + [1- specificity]<sup>2</sup> is minimized).</p>

Predictors providing greater combined discrimination were deemed to have higher importance. We built partial dependence plots on the entire cohort to demonstrate how each predictor affected the probability of success, defined by CRP level lower than 5 mg/L after week 42.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> For each predictor, we used the random forest model on the entire data set at that time point to predict the probability of success by patient, with that predictor set to a given value and averaged over all patients to produce a mean probability of success.

                <p>Given the complexity of random forest models, simpler models with comparable performance are typically preferred for clinical use. Because CRP<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and albumin<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> are biomarkers used in the management of IBD, we constructed pragmatic single-variable prediction models with both baseline and weeks 6 to 8 data. This decision could also be justified by these 2 predictorsâ association with the variable importance plots. We evaluated these single-variable models on the full data set and compared the resulting predictions with those generated by the random forest models. We favored a simplified model that did not require week-8 data because a week-8 model would not allow clinicians to decide whether to continue ustekinumab until after the week-8 dose had been administered. To evaluate whether the outcome accurately represented Crohn disease activity, we performed a sensitivity analysis with the same variables used in the week-8 model to predict a dichotomized version of the patientâs last CDAI score after week 42, with 150 as the cutoff point. Missing values were viewed as treatment failures. We included week-6 fecal calprotectin as a covariate in the week-8 model to evaluate prediction performance for a CRP-based outcome. We also created a model substituting dichotomized fecal calprotectin after week 42 as the outcome of interest, with thresholds of 100 Î¼g/g or 400 Î¼g/g.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Substantial heterogeneity in treatment response to costly biological therapies exists across the population with Crohn disease. For this reason, there is great interest in developing tools that can reliably identify patients who are unlikely to respond to costly medications after a short course of treatment. If effective, such tools could help clinicians identify patients who should be switched to an alternative treatment with a greater chance of success, reducing both the costs associated with an expensive but likely unsuccessful treatment and the harms associated with suboptimal disease control and avoidable steroid exposure.</p>
              <p>We applied machine learning techniques to phase 3 trial data to generate predictive models of treatment response to ustekinumab at week 42 in patients with active Crohn disease, as defined by an elevated CRP level at enrollment using dichotomized CRP as a marker of biological remission. The model we constructed with baseline data was relatively inaccurate, performing worse than baseline CRP measurement alone (AUROC for CRP alone was 67%, with 67% sensitivity and 61% specificity). Thus, the baseline model should not be used clinically. This finding suggests, as do studies on vedolizumab,<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190165r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> that predicting an individualâs response to a biological therapy before the first dose is difficult. The week-8 model provided the best performance characteristics for predicting long-term biological response with an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.69-0.87). This model also proved able to distinguish long-term biological remission (as defined by CRP &lt;5 mg/L beyond 42 weeks) from treatment failures. Simpler pragmatic models also showed good performance, with the week-6 albumin-to-CRP ratio showing an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.82) at an albumin-to-CRP ratio cutoff of 4.92. Patients with higher values of this ratio at week 6 are increasingly likely to achieve biological remission.</p>
              <p>Neither cross-sectional nor long-term measures of ustekinumab were associated with improvements in the performance of any of the models we tested, and they were associated with worse performance of week-6 pragmatic model. This finding supports previous studies demonstrating that serum ustekinumab level cannot adequately discriminate treatment responders from nonresponders in patients with Crohn disease enrolled in the UNITI clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It seems unlikely that increasing the frequency of ustekinumab dosing will provide additional advantages in early nonresponders.</p>
              <p>Knowing this finding might help clinicians decide to switch drug classes or to augment ustekinumab with an antiâtumor necrosis factor or a Janus kinase inhibitor if a substantial objective improvement in inflammation is not seen before the second dose rather than commit additional time and resources to costly monotherapy intensification, which appears unlikely to be effective. This finding allows clinicians to limit futile care with expensive biological agents such as ustekinumab 90 mg, which has a list price ofâapproximatelyâ$22â000 per dose.<sup><xref rid="zoi190165r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In clinical practice, either the week-8 random forest model or the pragmatic model using the week-6 albumin to CRP ratio could predict outcomes, although the pragmatic model appears more likely to be used at the point of care.</p>
              <sec id="H2-12-ZOI190165">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several limitations. First, we caution that the prediction performances of the pragmatic models should not be directly compared with those of the full models given that the pragmatic models were developed and tested on the entire cohort, whereas the random forest models were developed on a 70% random sample of the cohort and tested on the remaining 30%. Prior to clinical use, the pragmatic models would, ideally, be externally validated using a separate cohort. Second, we used patients with Crohn disease selected for enrollment in a clinical trial, which might not be generalizable to all patients with Crohn disease. Third, CRP is not a perfect proxy for biological remission given that up to 20% of patients with Crohn disease do not experience elevated CRP levels during a flare. Endoscopic data, which were not available for this cohort, would be ideal. To reduce the implications of this limitation, we used only the data from patients with elevated CRP levels at baseline and in whom CRP is more likely to be a reliable biomarker. Although this decision improves the reliability of these results, it might limit generalizability to patients who received ustekinumab with an elevated baseline CRP levels. Fourth, before this model can be used in a real-world setting, long-term intervention studies are needed to evaluate the best course of action for patients deemed unlikely to achieve biological remission with ustekinumab. Fifth, this test, like any other diagnostic test, is imperfect, and clinical context should be considered when making decisions about its use and interpretation.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In this study of clinical trial data, a model using demographic and laboratory data available after the first dose of ustekinumab reliably identified which patients with active Crohn disease at enrollment were likely to achieve treatment response beyond week 42. The week-6 albumin to CRP ratio is a potential predictor of future biological remission during ustekinumab therapy among patients with high baseline CRP levels. Unlike other biological agents for Crohn disease, ustekinumab serum did not appear to add substantial predictive value for future biological remission.</p>
