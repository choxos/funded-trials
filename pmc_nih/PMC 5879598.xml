                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Heart failure (HF), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, affects 6.6 million adults with an estimated additional 3 million people by 2030. More than 50% of HF patients have heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). These patients have impaired cardiac muscle relaxation and diastolic filling, which investigators have associated with cellular energetic impairment. Patients with HFpEF experience symptoms of: (1) fatigue; (2) shortness of breath; and (3) swelling (edema) of the lower extremities. However, current HF guidelines offer no effective treatment to address these underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Thus, we propose a biobehavioral symptom science study using ubiquinol and D-ribose (therapeutic interventions) to target mitochondrial bioenergetics to reduce the complex symptoms experienced by patients with HFpEF.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the overall objective is to determine if administering ubiquinol and/or D-ribose to HFpEF patients for 12Â weeks would decrease the severity of their complex symptoms and improve their cardiac function. The measures used to assess patientsâ perceptions of their health status and level of vigor (energy) will be the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Vigor subscale of the Profile of Mood States. The 6-min walk test will be used to test exercise tolerance. Left ventricular diastolic function will be assessed using innovative advanced echocardiography software called speckle tracking. We will measure B-type natriuretic peptides (secreted from ventricles in HF) and lactate/ATP ratio (measure of cellular energetics).</p>

                  <title>Discussions</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Ubiquinol (active form of Coenzyme Q10) and D-ribose are two potential treatments that can positively affect cellular energetic impairment, the major underlying mechanism of HFpEF. Ubiquinol, the reduced form of CoQ10, is more effective in adults over the age of 50. In patients with HFpEF, mitochondrial deficiency of ubiquinol results in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and reduced scavenging of reactive oxygen species. D-ribose is a substrate required for ATP synthesis and when administered has been shown to improve impaired myocardial bioenergetics. Therefore, if the biological underpinning of deficient mitochondrial ATP in HFpEF is not addressed, patients will suffer major symptoms including lack of energy, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and exercise intolerance.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">The public burden of heart failure (HF) is manifested by its staggering cost ($39.2 billion in healthcare-related costs/year) in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], while the personal burden of HF includes debilitating symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is estimated that there is a 20% lifetime risk of developing HF at age 40 and that 870,000 new cases will be diagnosed yearly in adults who are 55Â years of age or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2014, the Food and Drug Administration reported, âthe burden of HFpEF was considerable and is projected to worsenâ and âthere are no approved therapies available for reducing symptomsâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Beginning January 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began reducing payments to hospitals for HF patients readmitted within 30Â days of hospital discharge. Of the patients hospitalized with HF, more than 50% have diastolic HF, which is termed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These patients have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of more than 45 to 50% and symptoms that include lack of energy (fatigue), shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The most recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) HF guidelines for HFpEF acknowledge âhuge gapsâ in understanding effective treatments for patients with HFpEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This study will provide an opportunity to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of alternative approaches for reducing symptom burden in patients with HFpEF.</p>
              <p id="Par26">This study of ubiquinol (active form of Coenzyme Q10) and D-ribose in patients with HFpEF will significantly improve scientific understanding of myocardial bioenergetics. Ubiquinol and D-ribose are naturally produced in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One of the main functions of these products is to promote cardiac energy metabolism by increasing mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Ubiquinol and D-ribose exert this physiological benefit of enhancing cardiac function via two different bioenergetic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As an efficient electron carrier, ubiquinol plays an important role in transporting electrons in the electron transport chain (ETC), which produces the proton gradient needed for phosphorylation of ADP and creating ATP. In contrast, D-ribose provides a source for synthesis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to ensure there is sufficient ADP to form ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, administering these supplements should augment ATP synthesis, increasing both cellular and behavioral energy. The potential benefits of administering ubiquinol and/or D-ribose to patients with HFpEF are increased myocardial energy and diastolic relaxation, which would significantly reduce their cardiac symptoms. We plan to measure HFpEF symptoms using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), Vigor scale, and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Biological measures will include myocardial wall motion, lactate/ATP ratio, and B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP).</p>
              <p id="Par27">Novel discoveries in biobehavioral symptom science require integration of information from the patientâs biologic processes, physiologic pathways, and behaviors to treat and manage symptoms of diseases such as HFpEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We plan to use biobehavioral symptom science to identify complex symptoms that can be characterized with biological and clinical data. In this study, symptoms of HFpEF patients that result in a personâs feeling a lack of energy will be measured using a questionnaire to evaluate the patientâs level of vigor and overall health status. We will also measure their lactate/ATP ratio, cardiac performance, BNP, and conduct a 6MWT. This study could assist in illuminating a therapeutic clinical intervention (ubiquinol and/or D-ribose) for patients with HFpEF by quantifying subjective symptom experiences and measuring biologic and physiologic underpinnings of the symptoms.</p>
              <p id="Par28">We plan to use a sophisticated echocardiographic software program called speckle tracking to measure myocardial wall tension and motion to evaluate diastolic function. In addition, we will quantify our term âenergyâ using point-of-contact instrumentation to measure lactate/ATP ratio and BNP concentration. The two important outcomes for patients with HFpEF are improved heart function and patient energy. If a patient with HFpEF takes ubiquinol and/or D-ribose, we hypothesize that the increased cellular bioenergetics would decrease myocardial stiffness, resulting in improved cardiac output and level of vigor. With more energy, the patient should have improved health status in the five KCCQ domains (i.e., clinical summary, functional status, self-efficacy, social interactions, and quality of life). Thus, if the aims are achieved, patients with HFpEF will have successful symptom management and improved assessment of diastolic function. In addition, we will determine whether the comparative effectiveness of the treatments will maintain or increase ATP levels, prevent additional stiffness of the heart, and thus improve cardiac function, thereby reducing symptoms. A reduced myocardial tissue content of CoQ10 has been demonstrated in patients with HF, correlating with the severity of symptoms and the degree of left ventricular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. According to Sharma (2016), the pathophysiological rationale for the use of CoQ10 in HFpEF exists, and well-conducted clinical trials will be required to demonstrate how CoQ10 decreases the signs and symptoms in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This study will produce new knowledge about comparative benefits and outcomes that is significant to patients with HFpEF and that will help these patients make informed critical decisions about using ubiquinol and/or D-ribose.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Since HFpEF is related to changes in cellular bioenergetics, it is important to evaluate behavioral measures of energy such as the Vigor scale as well as biological clinical outcomes. After meeting with 30 HFpEF patients and 10 caregivers during a patient-centered focus group, we found they were extremely interested in the question of whether ubiquinol, D-ribose, or both could improve their health status (i.e., reduce their shortness of breath, increase their ability to perform daily activities, etc.) and their energy levels. With the advanced speckle tracking echocardiogram images, lactate/ATP ratio, and BNP measurements, we can answer that question. Our data will help us compare the effectiveness of ubiquinol and D-ribose with usual treatment in this patient population.</p>

Using speckle-tracking software, we will measure myocardial deformation, rotation, torsion, strain, strain rate, and tissue velocity. Changes in the early apical diastolic untwisting rate (rotR) and negativity of time from apical peak diastolic untwist (trotR) to mitral valve opening (MVO) are two major variables that reflect diastolic function. Decreases in rotR and trotR are indications of diastolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

We will examine the effects of ubiquinol and/or D-ribose on the 6MWT at baseline and 12Â weeks. Participants will be asked to wear appropriate clothes and shoes and walk the longest distance possible in 6Â min. Prior to exercising, there will be a 10-min rest period during which heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded. Subjects will walk indoors on a flat, straight 30-m path marked every 3Â m, and they will be informed that they can slow down or stop at any time. A one-lap demonstration will be completed before the test begins. The distance walked will be recorded. Following the 6MWT, heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded. Lactate concentration will be measured with a portable i-STAT handheld instrument using a CG4+ cartridge that requires 100Â Î¼L of blood and takes 2Â min to complete. Lactate provides a measure of the oxygen debt occurring during exercise and correlates directly with reported dyspnea and fatigue. The patient will also record perceived dyspnea and fatigue at baseline and at the end of each walk by using the Borg scale, where 0â=ânothing at all, 5â=âsevere, and 10â=âvery severe. Words of encouragement will be offered during the walk and water provided afterward.</p>

                <p id="Par54">B-type natriuretic peptides are a cardiac neurohormone secreted from the atria and ventricles in response to volume expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Serum levels of BNP increase in cardiac disease conditions associated with increased atrial and ventricular stretch and left ventricular diastolic filling pressures. BNP concentration will be measured using a portable i-STAT handheld analyzer. A blood sample (100Â Î¼l) will be obtained from a finger stick after the subjects have completed the questionnaires at baseline and 12Â weeks. We will measure BNP concentration at each visit. Prior to running the BNP test, the cartridge initiates a series of preset quality control diagnostics, from monitoring the quality of the sample to validating the reagent.</p>

                <p id="Par55">CoQ10 is a key component in mitochondrial bioenergy transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Its enzymatic processes facilitate electron transfer in the generation of ATP. CoQ10 functions in ETC from enzyme complex I and enzyme complex II to complex III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Thus, CoQ10 is critical in ATP generation because 95% of ATP generation is via ETC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. D-ribose is a naturally occurring compound and a simple sugar molecule that has been shown to increase cellular energy synthesis in the heart. The myocardiumâs ability to resynthesize ATP is then limited by the supply of D-ribose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and supplementing D-ribose would increase ATP production.</p>
                <p id="Par56">We plan to measure the effects of ubiquinol and/or D-ribose on mitochondrial ATP production by using an indirect measure (serum lactate/ATP ratio). A capillary finger stick blood sample will be obtained after subjects have completed the questionnaires and echocardiograms. We will use 5Â Î¼L of blood for the ATP measurements and place it in distilled water. Using a probe called the AquaSnap Total system, ATP in solution will be measured.</p>

                <p id="Par57">Our power computations described suggest including 62 subjects in each of the four study groups (ubiquinol, D-ribose, ubiquinol + D-ribose, and placebo). Since we expect about a 10% attrition rate, we will include 69 subjects in each group for a total of 276 subjects who will be randomized to one of the four groups. Efforts will be made to recruit 50% females. We will oversample minority populations to increase the generalizability of data for minority groups (30% Black/AA, 30% Hispanic/Latino, 30% White, and 10% Other). In each group there will be Black/AAâ=â21, Hispanic/Latinoâ=â21, Whiteâ=â21, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanderâ=â6 (Totalâ=â69).</p>
                <p id="Par58">For hypotheses #1 and #2<bold>,</bold> the change in the KCCQ Clinical Summary score from baseline to the end of the 12Â weeks of treatment will be computed for each patient as KCCQ score at 12Â weeks minus KCCQ score at baseline. A two-tailed independent samples t-test will test the null hypothesis of no difference in mean change between patients on ubiquinol and patients on placebo. Similar tests will be used to compare D-ribose with placebo, ubiquinol + D-ribose with placebo, and ubiquinol versus ubiquinol + D-ribose. Our pilot study with ten subjects also found that, after 12Â weeks of treatment, all subjects with ubiquinol or ubiquinol + D-ribose had an increase in the KCCQ Clinical Summary score of at least 10 points. The combined estimated standard deviation for the increase was 12.3 points. This implies that Cohen effect sizes of at least 0.81 (= 10/12.3) are clinically important. Therefore, a sample size of 62 subjects per group will provide at least 98% power to detect this or larger effect sizes at a nominal significance level of 0.05 (with Bonferroni correction for four comparisons). Analogous two-tailed independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests will be used to compare changes in POMS scores. According to a linear regression of changes in POMS Vigor scores versus changes in the KCCQ Clinical Summary scores using our pilot data, a 10-point increase in KCCQ Clinical Summary scores predicted about a 6.5 point increase in Vigor scores. Thus, we believe that a 6.5-point increase in vigor in our subjects will be of clinical importance. Our pilot study also yielded an estimated standard deviation of 3.6 for 12Â week changes in Vigor score, which implies that Cohen effect sizes of at least 1.8 are clinically important. Our sample sizes will provide 99% power to detect this or larger effect sizes at a nominal 0.05 significance level with Bonferroni correction for four comparisons. If assumptions of the t-test are not satisfied, transformations or the Mann-Whitney test will be applied. The five subjects of our pilot study who received ubiquinol showed a significant increase of 16.3 points in KCCQ Clinical Summary scores with respect to baseline (<italic>t</italic>â=â5.23, dfâ=â4, two-tailed paired samples <italic>p</italic>â=â0.0064). Similarly, the other five subjects of our pilot study who received ubiquinol + D-ribose showed a significant increase of 30 points with respect to baseline (<italic>t</italic>â=â5.10, dfâ=â4, two-tailed paired samples <italic>p</italic>â=â0.007). The 13.7-point increase produced by the independent effect of D-ribose was borderline significant (<italic>t</italic>â=â2.06, dfâ=â9, two-tailed independent samples <italic>p</italic>â=â0.08). These results from our small pilot study suggest a high likelihood that ubiquinol, and probably D-ribose, will produce clinically important increases of 10 points in KCCQ scores, which gives additional confidence in the success of our proposed study and in the potential clinical applications of ubiquinol.</p>
                <p id="Par59">For hypothesis #3, the change in the E/eâ ratio from baseline to the end of 12Â weeks of treatment will be computed for each patient as E/eâ ratio at 12Â weeks minus E/eâ ratio at baseline. A two-tailed independent samples t-test will be used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in mean E/eâ ratio change between patients on ubiquinol and patients on placebo. Analogous computations and tests will be made to examine the effects of ubiquinol, D-ribose, and the combination of ubiquinol with D-ribose on PAP changes. Our pilot data showed a substantially strong and clinically important Cohen effect size of ubiquinol on E/eâ ratio (ââ3.5). With 62 subjects per group, our t-test will have a very large power of 99% to detect this or larger effect sizes with a 0.05 level of significance (with Bonferroni correction for 4 comparisons, since both D-ribose alone and combined with ubiquinol will additionally be compared with placebo, and ubiquinol will be compared with ubiquinol + D-ribose). However, our sample sizes will be able to detect effect sizes of at least 0.7 in absolute value with at least 90% power. Analogous computations and tests will be made to examine the effects of ubiquinol, D-ribose, and the combination of ubiquinol with D-ribose on PAP changes. The large and clearly clinically important effect size of ubiquinol on PAP observed in our pilot study (ââ2.8) suggests that our sample sizes will provide 99% power for at least the ubiquinol-placebo comparison.</p>
                <p id="Par60">For hypothesis #4, a two-tailed independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test will be used to test the null hypothesis that the mean change in the 6MWT from baseline to the end of 12Â weeks in patients taking ubiquinol is different from the mean change for placebo. Comparisons of D-ribose versus placebo, of ubiquinol + D-ribose versus placebo, and of ubiquinol versus ubiquinol + D-ribose will likewise be made. Our proposed sample sizes (62 per group) will allow detecting Cohen effect sizes on the 6MWT of at least 0.7 with at least 90% power at a nominal 0.05 level of significance with Bonferroni correction for four comparisons.</p>
                <p id="Par61">For hypothesis #5, our pilot data suggested that ubiquinol has a large effect size on BNP (ââ1.5). Thus, two-tailed independent samples t-tests comparing changes in BNP from baseline to the end of 12Â weeks will have a large power (99%) for investigating Hypothesis #5 using Bonferroni corrections. In general, our sample sizes will be able to detect effect sizes of at least 0.7 in absolute value with at least 90% power.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Finally, hypothesis #6, the change in lactate/ATP ratio from baseline to 12Â weeks will be computed for each patient. A one-tailed independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test will examine the null hypothesis of no differences in mean changes between ubiquinol and placebo groups against the alternative that the mean change in patients on ubiquinol will be numerically smaller, which includes the possibility of a negative change. Similar tests will compare D-ribose versus placebo, the combination of ubiquinol + D-ribose versus placebo, and ubiquinol versus ubiquinol + D-ribose. Our sample sizes will give us a power of at least 90% to detect effect sizes of at least 0.7 in absolute value by using a 0.05 significance level and Bonferroni correction for the four comparisons.</p>
                <p id="Par63">We will also examine whether there is an interactive effect with synergism on KCCQ scores when simultaneously administering ubiquinol and D-ribose. To investigate whether ubiquinol and D-ribose interact synergistically, a linear regression model of KCCQ score change from baseline to week 12 will be built. The model will include indicators for ubiquinol and D-ribose treatment as independent variables, as well as the product of these two indicators (the interaction term), gender, and race/ethnicity demographics. Analogous regressions will be conducted with KCCQ subscales, with the POMS Vigor score, as well as with indicators of left ventricular diastolic function. In addition, this study will allow us to: (1) examine the mediating role of the lactate/ATP ratio in the effect of ubiquinol on left ventricular diastolic function in patients; and (2) examine whether there is an interactive effect with synergism on this function when simultaneously administering ubiquinol and D-ribose. A structural equation model will be built to explore our mechanistic hypothesis that a reduction in lactate/ATP ratio mediates the association between ubiquinol treatment and reduction in E/eâ ratio. We will control for potential confounders such as demographics, baseline lactate/ATP ratio, and baseline E/eâ ratio. This modeling approach will take full advantage of the fact that subjects will provide measures of lactate/ATP and E/eâ ratios at two time points (baseline and 12Â weeks), which will allow disentangling the dynamic effects of time, a crucial variable in causality analyses. Similar models will be built by using the other indicators of left ventricular diastolic function in place of E/eâ. To investigate whether ubiquinol and D-ribose interact synergistically, a linear regression model of E/eâ change from baseline to week 12 will be built that will also include as independent variables indicators for ubiquinol and D-ribose treatment, as well as the product of these two indicators (the interaction term), gender, and race/ethnicity. Analogous regressions will be conducted with other indicators of left ventricular diastolic function. If necessary, transformations will be performed to achieve the assumptions of regression models.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par70">The prevalence of HF is increasing, and it is estimated that there will be 8.0 million U.S. adults who have HF by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. More than 50% of HF patients have a type of HFpEF, also termed diastolic HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The hallmark symptoms of HFpEF are lack of energy, fatigue, shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and decreased quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, patients with HFpEF suffer with severe lack of energy and other debilitating symptoms that affect their overall health-related quality of life. We have pilot data on patients with HFpEF showing that two supplements (ubiquinol and D-ribose) added to their usual HF care enhanced their myocardial energetics and diastolic function resulting in decreased symptom burden. Both ubiquinol (active form of coenzyme Q10) and D-ribose play a vital role in mitochondrial ATP production.</p>
              <p id="Par71">This study will provide us an opportunity to translate what we have observed in the laboratory and in the cardiovascular clinic to decrease patientsâ debilitating symptoms of HFpEF. In a rat model, we have observed a significant decrease in myocardial nuclear damage (apoptosis) and mitochondrial superoxide production associated with ubiquinol administration during an acute oxidative stress condition. Mitochondrial damage as assessed by electron microscopy was greatly reduced with the administration of ubiquinol. In the clinic setting, we have observed significant improvements in cardiac function leading to improved symptoms in patients with HFpEF who received ubiquinol and/or D-ribose. Translating these significant findings via a human study will provide essential data to support the use of these supplements in clinical practice.</p>
              <p id="Par72">With the new advances in bioenergetics, clinicians can better understand HFpEF and the debilitating symptoms that accompany this illness. We are proposing research to develop improved, personalized strategies to treat the adverse symptoms of chronic HFpEF by comparing the effectiveness of usual care with alternative treatments. By measuring both biological and behavioral dynamics of symptoms, the sentinel data from this proposed study could change the trajectory of HFpEF.</p>

                <p id="Par75">The University of Kansas Medical Center IRB has reviewed and approved implementation of this study. The PI and research staff including Project Director and Research Associate will participate in recruitment of subjects (patients with diastolic heart failure, or HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF will be asked for permission to be contacted, have the study explained, be invited to participate, and be provided written informed consent. The potential subjects will be informed that the purpose of the study is to examine the effects of oral ubiquinol, D-ribose, or a combination of the two in treating patients with HFpEF. Consent forms will be given to all subjects and their signatures will be obtained and witnessed, if they agree to participate. The consent forms will include a description of the study, nature of the data collection, the potential benefits and adverse reactions anticipated, and the methods used to ensure confidentiality. The standard care of subjects will not be changed, withdrawn, or reduced for any subject in this study.</p>
