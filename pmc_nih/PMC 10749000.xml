                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Sustainable approaches to support care coordination and symptom management needs of critically ill adults living with multimorbidity are needed to combat the challenges and complexity that multimorbidity presents. The study aims to test the feasibility of the Care cOORDInatioN And sympTom managEment (COORDINATE) intervention to improve health outcomes of adults living with multimorbidity.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A multicomponent nurse-driven intervention was developed using experience-based co-design and human-centred design. Inclusion criteria include (1) age 55 years and older, (2) admitted to an intermediate care unit, (3) presence of two or more chronic health conditions and (4) signed informed consent. Data collection will occur at baseline (time of recruitment predischarge) and 6 weeks and 3 months following hospital discharge. Outcome of interest from this feasibility study is to evaluate the financial, technical and logistic feasibility of a full-scale study including data collection and protocol adherence. Additionally, Cohen’s d effect sizes for the change in outcomes over time will be computed to establish power calculations required for a full-scale study. The protocol was prepared in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. Given the success of this feasibility study, the potential for the COORDINATE intervention to decrease the symptom burden and improve participant quality of life among critically ill people with multimorbidity will be tested in a full-scale study, and findings will be actively disseminated.</p>

              <p>Multimorbidity is common and is the coexistence of two or more chronic conditions in the same individual.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These individuals live with a higher symptom burden and accelerated functional decline that affects quality of life,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> which can lead to higher caregiver strain and burden.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the USA only, the prevalence of multimorbidity is estimated to be 50% for individuals under 65 years of age, 62% for those aged 65–74 years, 75.5% for those aged 75–84 and 81.5% for those 85 years and older.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6</xref> With the population ageing, advances in medical care, and increased longevity, the prevalence of multimorbidity is expected to increase globally.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> With this comes a rise in the utilisation of healthcare and costs of care.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8 9</xref> People with multimorbidity create a particular challenge to care coordination, because they require more holistic person-centred approaches that balance many competing priorities, needs and goals.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Moreover, most healthcare specialties are configured around single diseases and organs. Hospitalisation can be a window of opportunity to initiate interventions to promote recovery, resilience and care coordination, decrease symptom burden and in turn enhance quality of life.</p>
              <p>Intermediate care units (IMCUs), also known as high dependency units (HDUs), are widely used to care for critically ill patients requiring more intensive monitoring or nursing care than is provided on hospital acute care wards but who do not have intensive care needs (such as advanced airway management or mechanical ventilation).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Half of the patients admitted to intermediate care have multimorbidity<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> and have higher symptom burden. Preliminary data suggest intermediate care patients do not necessarily access comprehensive care services because of the organ-centred arrangement of programmes (eg, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive airway disease and chronic renal failure). Further, individuals living with multimorbidity are not often categorised into single disease-specific categories such as cardiac, respiratory and gastrointestinal because of multiple comorbid conditions and symptoms and have a greater potential for complications, including worse overall management of chronic disease needs.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although the challenges of efficiently and effectively managing care among those with multimorbidity have been recognised, the complexity of the care coordination and possible strategies to help manage these issues are not well identified. Hence, person-centred interventions focused on care coordination and symptom management by empowering patients to interact effectively with the complex care system could be a promising method for improving the health outcomes of critically ill patients living with multimorbidity.</p>

                <p>The paper discusses the rationale and design of a single-arm pilot feasibility study of a nurse-driven multicomponent intervention, Care cOORDInatioN And sympTom managEment (COORDINATE), to improve health outcomes among patients living with multimorbidity. The programme includes five individualised, synchronous sessions for patients conducted in person (visit 1) and followed by phone calls (visits 2–5) over 6 weeks. The COORDINATE intervention was developed using experience-based co-design (EBCD) and human-centred design (HCD). The EBCD and HCD methodologies facilitated the person-centred approach of intervention components by considering the needs and preferences of patients, family caregivers and healthcare providers in improving health outcomes when living with multimorbidity. The innovation in this intervention is embedded in the heterogeneity of the population, the locus of care and the need for transitional and supportive care strategies for multimorbidity management. The study flow process followed to help identify, develop and pilot test the COORDINATE intervention is summarised in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.</p>

The process started with the preparation for the study (Stage 1) followed by the narrative interviews (Stages 2 and 3) to understand the disease trajectories in the context of multimorbidity and identify improvement priorities for multimorbidity management with patients, family caregivers and healthcare providers. The co-design part (Stages 4 and 5) of the process was the innovative aspect of validating needs and identifying improvement priorities for the multimorbidity management programme. All the inputs from the interviews and co-design events were analysed and summarised<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> as a multimorbidity management toolkit and disseminated to the stakeholders (Stage 6).

                <title>Use of human-centred design (HCD)</title>
                <p>The use of HCD in this project complemented the EBCD process. HCD is a person-first, collaborative process used to understand and define problems, identify opportunities, generate ideas and make tools that support positive change.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This process prioritises end users’ and important stakeholders’ needs, values and lived experiences. Human-centred methods such as storytelling, journey mapping, priority ranking and intervention prototyping were used to identify end users’ needs and preferences and design the intervention’s components. Storytelling is a narrative tool that is currently used in a diverse range of fields to elicit personal narratives that capture experiences, processes and contexts.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Individual narrative interviews in Stages 2 and 3 of EBCD process followed a storytelling approach of HCD to help identify what were the good and bad experiences of study participants when living with and caring for patients with multimorbidity. The co-design event used the journey map and priority ranking exercise with the participants. The patient experience journey mapping is known to use for a better understanding of patients’ journey with a phenomenon, their pain points and successes.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The journey mapping activity helped validate and identify improvement priorities for multimorbidity management. The ranking exercise was valuable to understand the priority of improvement strategies.</p>
                <p>Findings from the interviews, co-design events and components of the multimorbidity management toolkit developed from EBCD were analysed using the intervention prototype methodology. Key challenges and recommendations from the early work were grouped into key themes. Then the ideas under each theme were mapped based on their importance and feasibility and identified as intervention components. Evidence-supporting intervention components were also explored to help identify interventions to which these components were used that could be adapted for this population. Key findings from this work identified five improvement priorities: communication, patient-provider relationship, caregiver support, availability of resources for symptom/disease assessment and management and care coordination, and follow-up care.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Through an extensive process of EBCD, HCD and evidence evaluation, the final identified COORDINATE intervention components include need assessment, question prompt list, goals discussion, and symptom assessment and tracking.</p>

                <p>This trial is developed with deliberate attention towards minimising the risk of harm to participants. There are no physical risks to participants. However, the potential risks of the study include time involvement, fatigue and emotional distress because of the severity of the disease, recall of their experience and the nature of some questions in the survey. All participants are informed about the potential risks of participating during the informed consent process. Participants are allowed to withdraw or stop the study at any time. The research team including the PI and research assistants are and will be registered nurses or graduate nursing students who are experienced in caring for patients living with chronic and complex disease conditions. Any adverse events, unanticipated problems and study deviations will be documented on designated forms and reported within 48 hours, by the PI to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee of the study monitoring entity, PROMOTE centre (Promoting Resilience in Persons with Multiple Chronic Conditions) and IRB. If deemed necessary by the monitoring entity or IRB, study activities will be paused until problems are resolved.</p>
                <p>The study procedure will provide an opportunity to discuss and empower patients for care coordination, symptom tracking and symptom management. The pilot test of the intervention is anticipated to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life. Additionally, the intervention is expected to decrease pain and fatigue, enhance resilience, self-efficacy and social support and reduce healthcare utilisation among participants involved in the study. Participants are compensated for their time and involvement with a $25 gift card given at three time points: baseline, 6-weeks and 3-month follow-up survey completion.</p>

                <p>The study is being conducted to determine the feasibility of a COORDINATE intervention for patients living with multimorbidity to establish power calculations and evaluate the financial, technical and logistic feasibility of a full-scale study to help improve quality of life and decrease symptom burden. This intervention is novel in its use of EBCD and HCD for its development, focus on individualisation with diverse disease/condition and flexibility of standard intervention components to address the specific person-centred needs of the patients living with multimorbidity.</p>
