                  <p>This is a phase 2b, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. Participants will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation ratio, stratified by Functional Independence Measure and age, to either attentional control or the intervention. Community Participation Transition After Stroke (COMPASS) is a complex intervention that uses 2 complementary evidence-based interventions: home modifications and strategy training delivered in the home. Community participation after stroke, measured by the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include quality of life after stroke, measured by the Stroke Impact Scale, and daily activity performance and magnitude of environmental barriers in the home, both measured by the In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used. A total of 180 participants, who are 50 years or older, were independent in activities of daily living prior to stroke, and are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation following stroke with a plan to be discharged home, will be included in the study.</p>

                  <p>Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States. The COMPASS study is ongoing. To date, 99 participants have been recruited and 77 randomized, with 37 in the treatment group and 40 in the control group. Resumption of previous activities immediately after discharge can improve immediate and long-term community participation. Results from this study will fill a critical gap in stroke rehabilitation evidence by providing important information about the long-term community participation and daily activity performance among stroke survivors as well as environmental barriers in their homes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Stroke is highly prevalent, costly, and disabling. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Half of stroke survivors are dependent on caregivers to perform their activities of daily living (ADLs).<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190472r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Unless a solution is identified to improve the long-term outcome of stroke survivors, annual costs attributed to stroke in the United States are projected to increase to $240.67 billion by 2030.</p>
              <p>The transition from inpatient rehabilitation (IR) to home is an important window of opportunity for intervention.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190472r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Resumption of previous activities immediately after discharge,<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> at a time when people with stroke report struggling to reestablish daily routines,<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> can improve immediate and long-term community reintegration. Providing environmental support improves performance of ADLs but is unproven among stroke survivors. Strategy training enables patients to identify and prioritize ADL problems, barriers to performance, and strategies to resolve the barriers.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190472r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Community Participation Transition after Stroke (COMPASS) is a novel program that combines environmental modifications and strategy training during the transition from IR to home to facilitate community reintegration after stroke. If effective, this program will reduce disability in ADL performance and improve participation outcomes.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of COMPASS with an equivalent dose of attentional control (AC; stroke education) for significant improvements in the primary outcome (community participation) and secondary outcomes (ADL performance and a reduction in environmental barriers in the home after stroke). Secondary objectives of this study include evaluating alternative outcome measures of participation, function, patient-reported quality of life, and caregiver burden that permit comparison with other stroke clinical trials and confirm the safety of COMPASS and evaluating process outcomes such as reach, cost, fidelity, and adherence.</p>

                <p>This study takes place in the homes of participants living within 60 miles of the St Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area. We are recruiting patients who have had an acute stroke, are 50 years or older, were independent in ADL performance prior to stroke, plan to discharge to home, and are medically stable. Our initial recruitment plan included only participants with ischemic stroke. We modified our inclusion criteria to include participants with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke based on recommendations from reviewers and from physicians on the study team. We are excluding survivors with terminal diseases that limit life expectancy to less than 6 months, previously diagnosed cognitive disorders (eg, dementia) or cognitive impairment after stroke that makes interpretation of the self-rated scales difficult (ie, Short Blessed Test<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> score of â¤10), moderate to severe aphasia (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Best Language rating of â¥2), or who reside in a congregate living facility. We are also recruiting the primary informal caregivers of enrolled participants. Caregivers must be 18 years or older and speak English to participate. Participant flow is outlined in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190472f1">Figure</xref>.</p>

                <p>Participants are recruited near the time of transfer from acute care to IR and during IR. A study team member visits all patients who meet the inclusion criteria and invites them to participate in the study. Written informed consent is obtained.

                <title>Randomization and Blinding</title>
                <p>Participants are allocated into the education control group or the home modification intervention group using a 1:1 ratio via randomization sequences generated a priori by the study statistician using a computerized formal probability model. Functional status is a strong predictor of recovery.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Therefore, randomization is balanced using the participantâs IR admission Functional Independence Measure<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> score. There are 3 allocation strata for Functional Independence Measure scores; each strata corresponds with a level of functioning, ie, low, moderate, or high. Age is also a predictor of stroke outcomes, so randomization is balanced on age as well. There are 5 allocation strata for age, with each age block divided into 10-year increments, starting with age 50 years. There are a total of 15 strata, and we randomly allocate participants into 1 of 2 groups: treatment or control. Randomization sequence concealment will be achieved by query of the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> After the baseline assessment (T1a), results are securely uploaded and stratification variables (ie, Functional Independence Measure score and age) are entered and locked. The interventionist completing the T1a elicits the treatment assignment in the field in real time using a secure data connection to REDCap, allowing in-home treatment of the participants assigned to the intervention group to begin immediately.</p>
                <p>Inpatient rehabilitation staff from The Rehabilitation Institute of St Louis (TRISL) are blinded to allocation so that they do not modify their inpatient or discharge treatment plans. Follow-up raters are blind to allocation. To determine the effectiveness of our single-blinded protocol, we ask the rehabilitation therapists to complete a brief assessment to determine whether group assignments were revealed during evaluation. All incidents of unblinding are documented as protocol violations.</p>

Additional environmental supports are provided as needed, and the occupational therapy interventionist and participant work together on poststroke community reintegration by using strategy-training techniques.

                  <p>For secondary analyses of the change in Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> score and I-HOPE score at 12 months, we will use the same approach as for the primary analysis because these 2 outcomes are also continuous. We have overall type I error control for testing the 12-month change in these 3 analyses at the design stage. The significance level for testing is <italic>P</italic>â&lt;â.016, and all tests will be 2-tailed. In addition to comparing the 12-month change, we will extend the model by including scores immediately after intervention and at 6 months to see whether the difference in outcomes is achieved at those points. Depending on the form of the time variable in the model, we will use appropriate regression coefficients or a linear combination of the regression coefficients to determine the difference in change of these scores between arms at certain points. Interpretation of these results should be cautious because we have not controlled for the type I error in these analyses. Because it is possible that severity of functional impairment after stroke may affect response to treatment, we will analyze impact of functional impairment on response to treatment. We will examine functional impairment by group interaction to examine possible differential intervention effects of functional impairment on community participation and performance of daily activities.</p>

                  <p>To determine whether the intervention poses no greater risk than AC, we will examine the differences in number of falls and rehospitalizations between groups. The statistical models for count data will be used for analyses of these 2 outcomes. Using the number of falls as an example, we will fit a Poisson regression model (with overdispersion adjustment if necessary), in which a dummy variable for the intervention arm is used. The regression parameter estimate for this dummy variable is the log of rate ratio of falls for COMPASS intervention vs control arms, and the exponentiation of the regression parameter estimate is the rate ratio. Using the parameter estimate and its standard error, we can construct a 2-sided 95% CI for the rate ratio. We expect the confidence interval for rate ratio will include 1, indicating no significant difference in the fall rate between the 2 groups.</p>

                <p>The study is designed to have 80% power to reject 3 null hypotheses of equal mean changes in the primary and secondary endpoints (RNLI, SIS, and I-HOPE) using a 2-sided, 2-sample, unequal-variance <italic>t</italic> test with overall type I error less than .05. Based on our preliminary study data,<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> the 3 alternative mean (SD) changes in intervention and control populations are 15.3 (22.6) vs 1.3 (23.4), respectively, for RNLI, 15.7 (16.1) vs 5.6 (9.1), respectively, for the SIS ADL domain, and 62.1 (26.1) vs 46.2 (18.8), respectively, for the I-HOPE. With a 1:1 allocation ratio, 130 patients (65 in each group) are needed for the RNLI outcome, 84 are needed for the SIS outcome, and 100 are needed for I-HOPE outcome. We will enroll 180 patients to account for a 30% attrition rate. This magnitude of between-group difference is considered clinically meaningful based on prior relevant literature and is achievable based on our pilot study. The sample size calculation includes the correlation between baseline and follow-up measures and is based on analysis of change scores, which is equivalent in efficiency to the proposed analytic model. Based on the number of participants with stroke, we will enroll an equivalent number of caregivers.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Most stroke survivors report the inability to perform ADLs, decreased quality of life, and reduced community participation.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190472r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190472r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Inpatient rehabilitation does not typically address the environmental barriers stroke survivors face when returning to the community.<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As a result, patients leave IR without the necessary skills to successfully return home. Emerging evidence, including our pilot study,<sup><xref rid="zoi190472r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> demonstrates that it is possible to intervene during the transition from IR to home using compensatory approaches. However, it is unknown if an environmental modification intervention to reduce excess disability and improve community participation in the stroke population is effective. The findings of this phase 2b COMPASS trial will fill a critical gap in stroke rehabilitation evidence by providing important information about the long-term participation and environmental barriers of stroke survivors. If effective, this program will reduce disability in ADL performance and improve participation outcomes. We anticipate findings will resolve significant unmet need among stroke survivors with residual disability. At the conclusion of this study, we will understand the interventionâs efficacy, acceptance, safety issues, and optimal end points.</p>
              <p>There are significant strengths of this study. First, COMPASS is designed for rapid translation. The intervention incorporates the elements of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance dissemination framework. The intervention was designed to facilitate rapid uptake in everyday practice, and it has standardized protocols for delivery with high fidelity. Second, patients at TRISL are enthusiastic about participating. Patient satisfaction surveys at TRISL indicate patient requests for home modifications and continued stroke education after discharge. Staff therapists and attending physicians at TRISL are excited about the study and are eager to make referrals to the study.</p>
              <sec id="H2-15-ZOI190472">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>There are potential limitations to this study. This is a single-site design, which reduces the generalizability of the findings. Patients at TRISL are comparable nationally regarding length of stay and treatment; however, our pilot sample had a higher percentage of African American participants than in the general population of stroke survivors. It is also possible that baseline severity of disability may affect the response to the intervention. It may be that those with the most severe functional impairment derive the greatest benefit. Conversely, it is possible that the response to the intervention will be blunted in more impaired participants. We will conduct subanalyses to explore if a differential effect exists.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>We designed this randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel enhanced rehabilitation transition program to reduce environmental barriers and improve daily activity performance and community participation. This study targets individuals 50 years and older who have experienced an acute stroke. Trial findings have the potential to provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of a transition program designed to increase the independence of stroke survivors. If this study finds that the novel enhanced rehabilitation transition program is successful, future research could be extended to other IR sites and populations in a phase 3 trial.</p>
