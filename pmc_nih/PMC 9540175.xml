              <abstract>
                <p>Observational studies are often considered unreliable for evaluating relative treatment effectiveness, but it has been suggested that following target trial protocols could reduce bias. Using observational data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (SRQ), between 2006 and 2020, we emulated the protocol of the Swedish Farmacotherapy trial (SWEFOT) and compared the results. SWEFOT was a pragmatic trial nested in SRQ, between 2002 and 2005, where methotrexate (MTX) insufficient responders were randomized to receive additional infliximab or sulfasalazine (SSZ) + hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with RA initiating infliximab (<italic toggle="no">N</italic>¬†=¬†313) or SSZ + HCQ (<italic toggle="no">N</italic>¬†=¬†196) after MTX were identified in SRQ and the Prescribed Drugs Register, mimicking the SWEFOT eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was the proportion of European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) good responders at 9 months, classifying patients who discontinued treatment as ‚Äúnonresponders.‚Äù Through sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of relaxing eligibility criteria. The observed proportions reaching EULAR good response were close to those reported in SWEFOT: 39% (vs. 39% in SWEFOT) for infliximab and 28% (vs. 25%) for SSZ + HCQ. The crude observed response ratio was 1.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04‚Äì1.86), increasing to 1.48 (95% CI 0.98‚Äì2.24) after confounding adjustment, compared to 1.59 (95% CI 1.10‚Äì2.30) in SWEFOT. Results remained close to SWEFOT when relaxing eligibility criteria until allowing prior disease‚Äêmodifying anti‚Äêrheumatic drug (DMARD) use which reduced the observed difference between treatments. By applying a prespecified trial emulation protocol to observational clinical registry data, we could replicate the results of SWEFOT, favoring infliximab over SSZ + HCQ combination therapy at 9 months.</p>

                <p>Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of adding TNF inhibitors vs. adding conventional synthetic disease‚Äêmodifying drug combinations to methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) showed mixed results. Observational studies assessing the same question indicated that TNF inhibitors in combination with MTX might be more effective, but they are often considered biased.</p>
                <p>
                  <bold>WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?</bold>
                </p>
                <p>This study emulated the protocol of one of the trials using observational data and compared the results with those of the trial.</p>
                <p>
                  <bold>WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?</bold>
                </p>
                <p>The results of this observational emulation were close to those of its target trial, supporting an increased effectiveness of TNF inhibitors plus MTX compared with conventional synthetic disease modifying drug combinations, within the first year of RA treatment.</p>
                <p>
                  <bold>HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?</bold>
                </p>
                <p>Emulating target trials (conducted or theoretical) could reduce bias in observational studies allowing them to credibly answer more questions about treatments in clinical use, at lower costs than possible with trials.</p>

              <p>Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating the relative efficacy and safety of drugs, but practical constraints preclude well‚Äêpowered head‚Äêto‚Äêhead RCTs of all therapeutic options in all clinically relevant patient groups. Whereas ‚Äúreal‚Äêworld studies,‚Äù providing evidence on treatment outcomes in clinical practice are increasingly recognized as necessary complementary information sources for patients not included in clinical trials,<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> they are also criticized for their susceptibility to bias.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Comparative effectiveness studies using real‚Äêworld data are the main target of such criticism because in clinical practice treatment decisions are mainly based on perceived predictors of treatment benefit, introducing confounding by indication.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for example, switching to a second conventional synthetic disease‚Äêmodifying drug (csDMARD) or to a combination of csDMARDs is recommended for patients who have failed initial methotrexate (MTX) and who do not have indicators of a poor prognosis, whereas switching to a biological DMARD (bDMARD) is recommended for patients with poor prognosis.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> To adjust for confounding, measurements of prognosis indicators which influenced treatment decision and are also associated with the outcome (e.g., disease activity at treatment initiation) must be available to the investigator. Nonetheless, even if sufficient data are available to adequately adjust for confounding, more insidious biases, such as selection bias or immortal time bias, may still occur in observational studies, especially when these are based on secondary longitudinal data which allow conditioning on events that happened after treatment initiation.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> It has been argued that selection and immortal time biases could be avoided if observational studies were designed to explicitly follow target RCT protocols,<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> thus aligning eligibility assessment, treatment assignment, and the start of follow‚Äêup. Additionally, harmonizing definitions of eligibility criteria, exposure, outcome, and causal contrast of interest between observational emulations and existing target RCTs facilitates their comparison. Sensitivity analyses aimed at explaining persisting differences in results could then be informed by any remaining differences in key protocol elements.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Finally, formally adopting and recording pre‚Äêanalysis study plans increases the transparency and credibility of observational studies.</p>
              <p>A sensible approach for testing if observational studies following the trial emulation methodology can produce valid results is to emulate published RCTs and compare the results. One such recent effort is the DUPLICATE initiative where US claims data were used to emulate 10 cardiovascular outcome RCTs, with mixed results.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Also in the field of cardiology, a pragmatic trial nested in a Swedish register has been emulated in an observational study using the same register as data‚Äêsource, and the results were broadly comparable.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>A recent review aimed at assessing how many comparative effectiveness observational studies in RA emulated target trials found only one study which explicitly described the target trial in some detail and no study was designed to replicate an existing trial.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Thus, in the current study, we aim to evaluate how closely we are able to mimic the protocol and replicate the primary end point results of the Swedish Farmacotherapy trial (SWEFOT)<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> in an observational study using Swedish register data. SWEFOT was an open‚Äêlabel RCT which recruited patients with early RA from Sweden between October 2002 and December 2005 and treated them with MTX monotherapy for 3 months, subsequently randomizing nonresponders to either the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) infliximab or a combination of sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) added to MTX. At 9 months after randomization a 59% higher European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) good responder proportion was observed among patients who received additional infliximab. We identified SWEFOT as a good candidate for emulation since it was nested in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (SRQ) which allowed for identification of other patients initiating the same treatments in clinical practice. Thus, we could emulate the trial in a non‚Äêoverlapping population defined using the same data source, with access to the necessary primary outcome data. The secondary aim of our study was to explore if and how treatment effect estimates changed when relaxing eligibility criteria.</p>

                <p>We used patient‚Äêlevel data from the SRQ<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> linked via the personal identity number of each patient to several Swedish national registers<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>‚Äîthe Prescribed Drugs Register (PDR), the National Patients Register (NPR), the Cancer Register‚Äîand demographic data from Statistics Sweden.

                <p>We identified patients with a primary diagnosis of RA which debuted after July 2005, as recorded in the SRQ, in order to have complete prescription data for all patients from RA debut onward and to reduce overlap with the SWEFOT population. We then identified study treatment initiations (i.e., baseline) and excluded patients not fulfilling the emulation eligibility criteria at baseline, patients who, due to migrations, lacked full 5‚Äêyear data before baseline, and patients with &lt;‚Äâ9 months of follow‚Äêup to January 2021 (end of study period). The main eligibility criteria were: a Disease Activity Score (DAS)28‚ÄêESR (disease activity score using 28 joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) &gt;‚Äâ3.2, use of MTX for &gt;‚Äâ30‚Äâdays before baseline, and no use of other DMARDs before baseline (details in <bold>Table</bold>

                  <p>The baseline in this arm was the first decision to initiate infliximab, as recorded in the SRQ. Protocol treatment was ended at the recorded infliximab treatment stop or at the initiation of a DMARD (other than infliximab or MTX), whichever came first. Consecutive infliximab treatment episodes on the same or different products, with less than 90‚Äâdays in between, were merged.

                  <p>Prescriptions for SSZ (ATC¬†=¬†A07EC01) and HCQ (ATC¬†=¬†P01BA02) were identified in the PDR. We included patients who initiated both drugs no more than 180‚Äâdays apart, and who collected at least one prescription for the first drug after the initiation of the second drug. The decision to allow a sequential initiation of the two drugs within this time window encountered in clinical practice was based on feasibility analyses with the goal of achieving sample sizes of ~‚Äâ200 patients per arm. The dispensation date for the second drug in the combination was considered the baseline in this arm (i.e., the date when the patient started being treated with both drugs). The end of each treatment in the combination was estimated at the first gap in the sequence of prescriptions. To identify such gaps, the duration of each prescription was first calculated using the dispensed quantity and assuming a daily dose of 2,000‚Äâmg/day for SSZ and 200‚Äâmg/day for HCQ. Then, a gap in the sequence of prescriptions was defined as not collecting a subsequent prescription within 90‚Äâdays after the current dispensed duration. If the patient stopped both SSZ and HCQ and initiated cyclosporin A within 90‚Äâdays, the end of protocol treatment was extended to the end of the cyclosporin A treatment. Protocol treatment was ended at the initiation of another DMARD.</p>

                <p>Similar to SWEFOT, outcomes were evaluated at 9‚Äâmonths after baseline using data from the SRQ (rheumatology visits). The primary outcome measure was the achievement of a EULAR good (vs. moderate or no) response defined as a DAS28‚ÄêESR ‚â§‚Äâ3.2 at evaluation and a decrease in DAS28‚ÄêESR larger than 1.2‚Äâunits at evaluation compared with baseline.

                <p>The baseline DAS28‚ÄêESR was measured within a window spanning from 90‚Äâdays before to 30‚Äâdays after baseline and end point DAS28‚ÄêESR was measured between 180 to 360‚Äâdays after baseline. The closest measurement to baseline and day 270 (end point), respectively, was picked.

                <p>Confounding was adjusted for by stabilized inverse‚Äêprobability of treatment weighting (IPTW), where the conditional probability of receiving infliximab (vs. SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ) as a function of baseline patient characteristics (PS) was modeled using logistic regression.

                <p>A series of analyses tested how altering the pre‚Äêrecorded analysis plan would change the results compared with the protocol analysis.</p>
                <p>The first analysis was identical to the main analysis but included several additional covariates which were excluded from the protocol due to their low prevalence (congestive heart failure, renal or liver diseases, interstitial respiratory disease, and inflammatory bowel disease), and did not allow treatment continuation on etanercept or cyclosporin A.</p>
                <p>The next analysis included only observations with complete baseline and outcome data where treatment responses of all patients included at baseline were measured around the 9‚Äêmonth end point regardless of treatment discontinuation/switch (without nonresponder imputation).</p>
                <p>Subsequently, eligibility criteria were relaxed one by one: first, a baseline DAS28‚ÄêESR‚Äâ‚â§‚Äâ3.2 was allowed; second, no restriction on the timing of MTX initiation relative to RA debut and baseline was imposed (but MTX had to be initiated between RA debut and baseline); third, the use of other non‚ÄêMTX DMARDs before baseline was permitted (but not after baseline). Baseline DAS28‚ÄêESR, RA duration, and use of DMARDs before baseline were adjusted for. Trimming of observations based on the PS, as suggested by St√ºrmer <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.,<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> was used to improve comparability of treatment arms and avoid extreme IPTW after allowing use of DMARDs before baseline. The PS was estimated separately in each imputation and observations with PS lower than the 5th percentile in the infliximab arm or higher than the 95th percentile in the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ arm were excluded.</p>
                <p>Finally, the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ arm was restricted to patients who initiated the two drugs simultaneously to avoid potential selection and immortal time biases built in the protocol definition.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Selection bias occurs when initiation of the first drug in the combination is allowed before baseline only in the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ arm. Patients in this arm who respect inclusion criteria (i.e., high enough baseline DAS28‚ÄêESR) after an initial treatment with the first drug may have a higher prevalence of other common causes of baseline DAS28‚ÄêESR and later treatment response compared with those in the infliximab arm. Immortal time bias occurs when a prescription for the first drug is required after baseline (to ensure addition of the second drug over the first and not just a treatment switch). This decreases the probability that patients in the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ arm stop protocol treatment (thus be classified as nonresponders) because protocol treatment continues until both drugs are stopped/replaced. Time when the outcome (i.e., nonresponse) cannot occur is deemed ‚Äúimmortal.‚Äù No similar ‚Äúimmortal time‚Äù is introduced in the infliximab arm, biasing results in favor of SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ. There was no need to ensure continued treatment with one drug after baseline when both drugs were initiated at baseline, thus avoiding immortal time bias.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Using the same source population (SRQ) as in SWEFOT and striving to harmonize eligibility criteria, treatment definitions, outcome measurements, and causal contrasts between the nonrandomized emulation and the trial, we obtained similar results in both primary and secondary end points despite remaining differences between protocols. These results indicate an increased effectiveness of infliximab compared to SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ when initiated after unsuccessful treatment with MTX monotherapy.</p>
              <p>Several other observational studies also found combinations of TNFi<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> or other bDMARDs<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> with MTX superior to the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX at 6‚Äâmonths and 1‚Äâyear. One of the studies used data from the SRQ within a time period overlapping with SWEFOT, but substituted infliximab for a wider bDMARD group, defined different outcomes and identified the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX group using a different algorithm and data source than in our study.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Another study of Norwegian patients compared EULAR good response proportions at 6‚Äâmonths and found 40% in the TNFi‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX arm and 20% in the SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX arm. An American study was able to stratify the analysis into bDMARDs‚Äêexposed and bDMARDs‚Äêna√Øve patients and observed reduced proportions of responders in both arms and a lower contrast among the biologics‚Äêexposed.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Due to very few patients who had used any non‚ÄêMTX DMARD before SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ, we were unable to replicate this analysis. However, the lower contrast in the analysis allowing DMARD use before baseline could indicate such effect modification. Alternatively, the low contrast in this analysis could be explained by residual confounding given the extreme IPTW (up to 400) which had to be truncated, but ameliorating comparability and extreme weights by initial PS trimming yielded similar results. The possibility of obtaining extreme weights may be seen as a downside of IPTW because they lower the precision of estimation. However, extreme weights can alert the analyst to the presence of population strata where the use of one treatment is unlikely. Such strata hold little information about the outcome under the unlikely treatment (therefore the imprecision in effect estimation) and may harbor unmeasured confounding, thus they could be trimmed away.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Not all studies agree that TNFi‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX are superior to SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX. Two RCTs did not find etanercept‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX superior to SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ‚Äâ+‚ÄâMTX.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> It could be argued that these results are not directly comparable to SWEFOT because etanercept was used instead of infliximab. Besides, the two trials were blinded whereas SWEFOT was open‚Äêlabel (as were of course the observational studies). Whereas limiting the interpretability of results in terms of ‚Äútreatment efficacy,‚Äù the open‚Äêlabel design was a reason for choosing SWEFOT as the emulation target in our study because blinding is impossible in observational data, and cannot be emulated by statistical means.<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Being able to use similarly collected data from the same context (Swedish rheumatology) but from a non‚Äêoverlapping calendar period allowed us to emulate SWEFOT in most respects. Emulating a trial using real‚Äêworld data from different settings would impose additional challenges for the emulation, requiring creative solutions to overcome them (for example, treatment response measured via proxies, such as an increase in the dose of glucocorticoids in the absence of RA disease activity measurements).</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, we could not emulate the SWEFOT protocol perfectly. Most difficult was identifying a sufficiently large SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ arm, as this has gradually become a less common treatment choice in clinical practice. In order to increase the size of our study population, we allowed the initiation of the drugs in sequence, as long as they were not initiated more than 180‚Äâdays apart and as long as the first drug was not stopped before initiating the second. This treatment definition may introduce selection bias by initiating a treatment component before baseline and immortal time bias by demanding treatment continuation on one component during follow‚Äêup. Restricting to patients who initiated both drugs simultaneously produced similar effect estimates as in the main analysis since it turned out that 67% of the 196 patients initiating SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ in the main analysis initiated the drugs at the same time and 50% stopped SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ due to initiation of another DMARD regardless of continuation of the first drug in combination.</p>
              <p>Other compromises were made in the interest of sample size. First, the protocol analysis was not restricted to treatments initiated within the first year of RA debut. However, the median RA duration was 1‚Äâyear in both arms. Second, continuation of MTX treatment to baseline was not imposed. Nonetheless, more than 90% of patients in both arms were on treatment with MTX at baseline. Finally, no patients were excluded based on study treatments contraindications (such as congestive heart failure, chronic infections, porphyria, or retinopathies) or baseline glucocorticoid use. Instead, these covariates were measured and considered for adjustment.</p>
              <p>Despite relaxing eligibility criteria, an important limitation of our study (as of SWEFOT) remains the small sample size. Due to small sample size, the lower confidence limit reached 0.98 in our IPTW adjusted main results and would be interpreted as ‚Äúno statistically significant difference between treatments‚Äù based on a binary hypothesis test, disagreeing with SWEFOT. Additionally, outcome data was incomplete due to the unstructured follow‚Äêup in real clinical practice. We used a window spanning from 90‚Äâdays before to 90‚Äâdays after the 9‚Äêmonth end point to capture as much DAS28‚ÄêESR data as possible but we still had to impute outcome data for ~‚Äâ25% of observations, adding uncertainty to our estimates.</p>
              <p>Analyzing only observations with complete data and using the observed 9‚Äêmonth treatment response regardless of protocol treatment discontinuation produced higher response proportions and a lower response ratio. Such results are expected in the absence of bias because patients who discontinued due to ineffectiveness would switch to alternative treatments which may improve response.</p>
              <p>The foremost strength of our emulation is the access to the same source population as the target trial and to disease activity data which is arguably the most important confounding factor. In addition, adjusting for confounding via IPTW produces effect estimates averaged (marginalized) over the entire study population, thus comparable to RCT estimates. Our results were not sensitive to minor deviations from the protocol and the impact of confounding was modest after applying broad exclusion criteria.</p>
              <p>To conclude, we observed a 48% increased EULAR good response proportion for infliximab vs. SSZ‚Äâ+‚ÄâHCQ compared with 59% increase observed in SWEFOT, with largely overlapping CIs. The fact that this emulation managed to obtain similar results to its target trial is not a guarantee for observational studies in general. Nevertheless, previous observational studies comparing similar treatment strategies but not emulating SWEFOT obtained results with similar qualitative interpretation (despite some heterogeneity in treatments, outcome measures and effect estimates).<xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>, <xref rid="cpt2673-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The current study shows that close emulation of a trial protocol using similar data can also produce quantitatively similar results. This holds promise for conducting in parallel pragmatic trials and observational trial emulations in large healthcare registries in order to broaden the scope of evidence to the entire population requiring treatment in real‚Äêworld clinical practice. Observational extensions could also include additional comparator arms, outcome measurements, and longer follow‚Äêup, all with the purpose of better informing clinical and regulatory decisionmaking.</p>
