                <p>Dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R obviates the need for radiotherapy in most patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. End-of-treatment PET, however, does not accurately identify patients at risk of treatment failure, thereby confounding clinical decision making. To define the role of PET in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma following dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R, we extended enrollment and follow up on our published phase II trial and independent series. Ninety-three patients received dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R without radiotherapy. End-of-treatment PET was performed in 80 patients, of whom 57 received 144 serial scans. One nuclear medicine physician from each institution blindly reviewed all scans from their respective institution. End-of-treatment PET was negative (Deauville 1-3) in 55 (69%) patients with one treatment failure (8-year event-free and overall survival of 96.0% and 97.7%). Among 25 (31%) patients with a positive (Deauville 4-5) end-of-treatment PET, there were 5 (20%) treatment failures (8-year event-free and overall survival of 71.1% and 84.3%). Linear regression analysis of serial scans showed a significant decrease in SUV<sub>max</sub> in positive end-of-treatment PET non-progressors compared to an increase in treatment failures. Among 6 treatment failures, the median end-of-treatment SUV<sub>max</sub> was 15.4 (range, 1.9-21.3), and 4 achieved long-term remission with salvage therapy. Virtually all patients with a negative end-of-treatment PET following dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R achieved durable remissions and should not receive radiotherapy. Among patients with a positive end-of-treatment PET, only 5/25 (20%) had treatment-failure. Serial PET imaging distinguished end-of-treatment PET positive patients without treatment failure, thereby reducing unnecessary radiotherapy by 80%, and should be considered in all patients with an initial positive PET following dose-adjusted-EPOCH-R (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier 00001337</italic>).</p>

              <p>Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that is clinically and biologically related to nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma (nsHL).<sup><xref rid="b1-1031337" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1031337" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> As such, it primarily presents as a bulky mediastinal mass in adolescents and young adults and is more common in females.<sup><xref rid="b3-1031337" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="b8-1031337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> R-CHOP is commonly used to treat PMBCL but retrospective studies indicate that this therapy alone is inadequate for many patients,<sup><xref rid="b9-1031337" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> resulting in the frequent use of consolidative mediastinal radiotherapy, as part of combined modality treatment.<sup><xref rid="b6-1031337" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1031337" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10-1031337" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> It is well documented, however, that mediastinal radiotherapy is associated with significant late toxicity including premature death due to cardiovascular complications and second malignancies,<sup><xref rid="b11-1031337" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="b14-1031337" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> which has led to efforts to minimize its use in mediastinal lymphomas.<sup><xref rid="b15-1031337" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="b18-1031337" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In an effort to reduce mediastinal radiotherapy in PMBCL, we conducted a prospective study of DA-EPOCH-R based on hypothesis-generating evidence that dose-intensive regimens may be more effective and showed DA-EPOCH-R obviated the need for radiotherapy in most patients.<sup><xref rid="b4-1031337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>An important, albeit preliminary observation from this study, was that most patients with a positive end-of-treatment (EOT) <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan achieved durable remissions without further therapy, calling into question the positive predictive value (PPV) of EOT FDG-PET following DA-EPOCH-R.<sup><xref rid="b4-1031337" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This is in line with several other retrospective studies as well as the prospective IELSG-26 study that have eluded to the low PPV and high false-positive rate of EOT FDG-PET imaging in PMBCL; however, a variety of induction chemoimmunotherapy regimens were utilized with most EOT FDG-PET positive patients going on to receive salvage radiotherapy or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation, making the results inapplicable to DA-EPOCH-R or chemotherapy alone.<sup><xref rid="b19-1031337" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="b22-1031337" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> While it is routine clinical practice to consider a positive (Deauville 4-5) EOT FDG-PET scan indicative of persistent disease and the need for radiotherapy,<sup><xref rid="b23-1031337" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-1031337" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> our findings raise a potential paradigm shift whereby singular EOT FDG-PET scans are inadequate following DA-EPOCH-R.

EOT FDG-PET was performed a median 3 weeks (range, 1-10) from day 1 of the final cycle of therapy. Scans were retrospectively scored per the 5-point Deauville scale<sup><xref rid="b26-1031337" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> with scores 1-3 negative and 4-5 positive.<sup><xref rid="b23-1031337" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-1031337" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Thirty-five of 55 (64%) and 22 of 25 (88%) patients with negative and positive EOT scans, respectively, underwent serial FDG-PET imaging. Tumor biopsy and salvage therapy was implemented per investigator discretion. Surveillance CT scans were performed for up to 5 years post-therapy. One nuclear medicine physician from each institution reviewed and scored all FDG-PET scans from their respective institution without knowledge of clinical outcome. Calculation of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG = MTV × SUV<sub>mean</sub>) was performed on all NCI FDG-PET scans using Osirix version 8.50 (Pixmeo SARL, Bernex, Switzerland).</p>

In contrast, retrospective studies suggest R-CHOP alone is inadequate for many PMBCL patients due to an unacceptable rate of primary induction failure up to 21% in one series,<sup><xref rid="b9-1031337" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> necessitating the frequent use of post-treatment radiotherapy, as part of combined modality treatment.<sup><xref rid="b5-1031337" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="b10-1031337" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b15-1031337" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b19-1031337" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21-1031337" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> A recent multicenter, retrospective study comparing R-CHOP to DA-EPOCH-R as front-line therapy for PMBCL showed no significant difference in 2-year PFS or OS between the two treatments; however, this was achieved through significantly greater radiotherapy use with R-CHOP (59% <italic>vs</italic>. 13%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).<sup><xref rid="b28-1031337" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Although excellent outcomes can be achieved via combined modality treatment, routine mediastinal radiotherapy use significantly increases the risk of late toxicity, including premature death from cardiovascular disease and second cancers.<sup><xref rid="b11-1031337" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="b14-1031337" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Unfortunately, due to the absence of prospective studies of R-CHOP in PMBCL, an accurate assessment cannot be made of its curative potential and who requires post-treatment radiotherapy. Nonetheless, it is presently accepted that patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET scan following R-CHOP require consolidation radiotherapy, and it remains uncertain if patients with a negative EOT FDG-PET benefit from radiotherapy, which is the endpoint of the IELSG-37 phase III randomized study (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier 01599559</italic>).</p>
              <p>Our results indicate that very few patients require post-treatment radiotherapy following DA-EPOCH-R, irrespective of their EOT FDG-PET scans. These findings provide substantial evidence that patients with negative EOT FDG-PET scans rarely recur and are unlikely to benefit from additional mediastinal radiotherapy. Furthermore, they provide evidence for our initial observation that most patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET achieve long-term remission following DA-EPOCH-R and, as a group, would not benefit from empirical consolidation radiotherapy. Indeed, the discrepancy between our findings that routine consolidation radiotherapy is unnecessary following DA-EPOCH-R, and the accepted need for post-treatment radiotherapy in patients with positive EOT FDG-PET scans following R-CHOP has led to uncertainty. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET following DA-EPOCH-R to receive post-treatment radiotherapy. Such an approach in our study would have resulted in 31% (25/80) of patients receiving radiotherapy, most of whom (80%) were already cured with DA-EPOCH-R alone.</p>
              <p>A clinically important aspect of our study is distinguishing treatment failures following DA-EPOCH-R. Given the worse outcome of PMBCL compared to DLBCL with salvage therapy,<sup><xref rid="b29-1031337" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> early recognition of patients with persistent disease is critical to optimize the curative potential of radiotherapy while averting its use in patients already cured with DA-EPOCH-R. We first looked at tumor mass reduction based on EOT CT, and observed no predictive value on outcome or any relationship with EOT FDG-PET. We also assessed the ability of single EOT and serial FDG-PET imaging to detect treatment failure. Following DA-EPOCH-R, 69% of patients had a negative EOT FDG-PET. Notably, 98% of these patients never progressed, indicating such patients rarely require radiotherapy. Among the 31% of patients with positive EOT scans, only 5 ultimately had treatment failure of which 4 occurred in patients with Deauville 5 scans. These results are consistent with the prospective IELSG-26 study, which revealed a significantly worse outcome in patients with Deauville 4-5 EOT FDG-PET scans (5-yr. PFS 68% <italic>vs</italic>. 99%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001; 5-yr. OS 83% <italic>vs</italic>. 100%, <italic>P</italic>=0.003), with the greatest number of treatment failures in Deauville 5 patients.<sup><xref rid="b22-1031337" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In contrast to our study, however, variable chemoimmunotherapy was used and most patients (89%) received consolidation radiotherapy.</p>
              <p>We found serial FDG-PET imaging to be a highly effective strategy to distinguish persistent disease from post-treatment inflammatory changes. Linear regression analysis in 17 non-progressing patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET and serial imaging showed an overall decrease in SUV<sub>max</sub> across serial scans. In contrast, serial FDG-PET imaging in 5 treatment failures with serial scans showed an increase in SUV<sub>max</sub> that was statistically greater than patients who never progressed, regardless of EOT FDG-PET response (<italic>P</italic>=0.011 and <italic>P</italic>=0.0037 for positive and negative EOT FDG-PET non-progressors, respectively). Overall, use of serial FDG-PET imaging effectively reduced radiotherapy from a potential 31% (25/80) of patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET scan to only 5 (5%) patients with confirmed treatment failure.</p>
              <p>We also explored the use of quantitative FDG-PET parameters (i.e., MTV and TLG) to assess if they improved upon SUV<sub>max</sub> in identification of treatment failures. These methods were limited by the overall low volume of disease following therapy as well as inability to exclude nonmalignant causes of FDG uptake, resulting in a wide variability in value between patients. Although these parameters were not superior to monitoring SUV<sub>max</sub> in our study, other recent reports indicate these quantitative parameters may be beneficial for baseline prognostication as well as when combined with EOT Deauville score.<sup><xref rid="b30-1031337" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-1031337" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our findings are supported by a recent retrospective multi-center analysis of 156 PMBCL patients treated with DA-EPOCH-R which reported a 3-year EFS and OS of 85.9% and 95.4%, respectively.<sup><xref rid="b32-1031337" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Overall, 14.9% of patients received post-treatment radiotherapy, which was administered at the discretion of the treating physician. In that study, 75% of patients achieved a negative EOT FDG-PET and 95.4% remained progression-free, consistent with our findings that consolidation radiotherapy is virtually never indicated in this patient group. Less clear are their results in patients with positive EOT FDG-PET scans. Among the 31 patients with positive EOT scans, 19 received no further treatment with 68% progression-free at a median follow up of 17 months, indicating that a substantial subset of these patients are likely cured with DA-EPOCH-R alone.<sup><xref rid="b32-1031337" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Twelve patients with a positive EOT FDG-PET received post-treatment radiotherapy and 33.3% remain progression-free at 2 years.</p>
              <p>It is important to note that serial FDG-PET was not a prospective endpoint of our trial and decisions regarding which patients should receive serial scans and the timing of those scans was left to the discretion of the treating physician. Indeed, the aim of this study was to provide a descriptive look at EOT and serial PET imaging in PMBCL following DA-EPOCH-R as it occurs in the real-world clinical setting, where decisions are often left to clinical judgement. The notion, however, that physician discretion influenced these observational findings is obviated by the extended follow up, which showed who did and did not recur and by the absence of late recurrences.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our results indicate that a negative EOT FDG-PET following DA-EPOCH-R in PMBCL is highly predictive of cure and radiotherapy in these patients is unnecessary. The unique biology of PMBCL results in a high rate of false-positive EOT FDG-PET scans indicating the need for a paradigm shift in clinical decision making for this group of patients when receiving DA-EPOCH-R. A singular EOT FDG-PET did not accurately identify treatment failure but serial FDG-PET imaging effectively discriminated residual disease from post-treatment inflammatory changes. Serial FDG-PET imaging should be considered in all patients with an initial positive EOT FDG-PET to identify treatment failures that require radiotherapy.</p>
