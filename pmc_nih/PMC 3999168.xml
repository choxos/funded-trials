              <abstract>
                <p>Acquisition of adaptive mutations is essential for microbial persistence during chronic infections. This is particularly evident during chronic <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Thus far, mutagenesis has been attributed to the generation of reactive species by polymorphonucleocytes (PMN) and antibiotic treatment. However, our current studies of mutagenesis leading to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mucoid conversion have revealed a potential new mutagen. Our findings confirmed the current view that reactive oxygen species can promote mucoidy <italic>in vitro</italic>, but revealed PMNs are proficient at inducing mucoid conversion in the absence of an oxidative burst. This led to the discovery that cationic antimicrobial peptides can be mutagenic and promote mucoidy. Of specific interest was the human cathelicidin LL-37, canonically known to disrupt bacterial membranes leading to cell death. An alternative role was revealed at sub-inhibitory concentrations, where LL-37 was found to induce mutations within the <italic>mucA</italic> gene encoding a negative regulator of mucoidy and to promote rifampin resistance in both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The mechanism of mutagenesis was found to be dependent upon sub-inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 entering the bacterial cytosol and binding to DNA. LL-37/DNA interactions then promote translesion DNA synthesis by the polymerase DinB, whose error-prone replication potentiates the mutations. A model of LL-37 bound to DNA was generated, which reveals amino termini Î±-helices of dimerized LL-37 bind the major groove of DNA, with numerous DNA contacts made by LL-37 basic residues. This demonstrates a mutagenic role for antimicrobials previously thought to be insusceptible to resistance by mutation, highlighting a need to further investigate their role in evolution and pathoadaptation in chronic infections.</p>

                <p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are produced by the mammalian immune system to fight invading pathogens. The best understood function of AMPs is to interact with the membranes of microbes, thereby disrupting and killing cells. However, the amount of AMP available during chronic bacterial infections may not be sufficient to kill pathogens (sub-inhibitory). In this study, we found that at sub-inhibitory levels, AMPs promote mutations in bacterial DNA, a function not previously attributed to them. In particular, we found that in the bacteria <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, one AMP called LL-37 can promote mutations, which enable the bacteria to overproduce a protective sugar coating, a process called mucoid conversion. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mucoid conversion is a major risk factor for those suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal, heritable disease in the US. We found that LL-37 is able to produce these mutations by penetrating the bacterial cell and binding to the bacterial DNA. DNA binding disrupts normal DNA replication and allows mutations to occur. Furthermore, we observed LL-37 induced mutagenesis in processes apart from mucoid conversion, in both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. This suggests that AMP-induced mutagenesis may be important for a broad range of chronic diseases and pathogens.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal, heritable disease in the US and results from mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. One of the most concerning effects of this mutation is altered anion transport of the airway epithelial cells resulting in increased susceptibility to infections and enhanced innate immune responses (reviewed in ref. <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Boucher1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). The combinatorial effect of defects in the CF airway and chronic bacterial infections results in a hyper inflammatory environment dominated by an influx of polymorphonucleocytes (PMNs). Chronic pulmonary infections with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are a leading cause of death in CF patients <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Doull1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Gaspar1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. During the course of infection, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> often undergoes a phenotypic change from a non-mucoid to a mucoid appearance, which directly correlates with a worsening clinical prognosis <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Doull1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Fick1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Mucoid conversion is characterized by the overproduction of the polysaccharide alginate, which confers a selective advantage for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the CF lung by providing recalcitrance to currently available therapeutics and host antimicrobials (reviewed in refs. <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Govan1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Ramsey1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>).</p>
              <p>Mucoid conversion occurs when the negative regulator of alginate synthesis, MucA, is genetically or physiologically disrupted <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Damron1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Up to 84% of mucoid isolates from patients possess mutations within <italic>mucA</italic> resulting in constitutive overexpression of alginate <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Fyfe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004083-Fyfe2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Hyper inflammation in the CF lung environment generates an abundance of mutagenic factors, which may be responsible for directly inducing <italic>mucA</italic> mutations. For example, PMNs and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) elevate mucoid conversion <italic>in vitro</italic> by promoting mutagenesis <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Mathee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, the robust adaptive nature of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome in chronic CF infections is evident and perpetuated by the appearance of mutator strains, which likely contribute to selection of mucoid variants (reviewed in <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Ciofu1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004083-Mathee2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>). Therefore, it will be of therapeutic utility to determine if specific host factors in CF promote <italic>mucA</italic> mutagenesis and investigate if intervention at this initial stage would prove effective.</p>
              <p>This study aimed to examine the specific role of host inflammatory factors in promoting <italic>mucA</italic> mutations leading to mucoid conversion. PMNs derived from both healthy and CF individuals stimulated mucoid conversion independent of selection. Surprisingly, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) have the capacity to induce mucoid conversion <italic>in vitro</italic>, PMNs still efficiently promote mucoid conversion in the absence of an oxidative burst response. This led to the discovery that non-oxidative PMN components, including the antimicrobial peptide LL-37, are important for promoting mucoid conversion in CF. Importantly, LL-37 also elevated spontaneous rifampin resistance in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, indicating a new role for LL-37 as a bacterial mutagen. LL-37-induced mutagenesis required the translesion DNA polymerase, DinB (Pol IV); whose error-prone replication is responsible for generating <italic>mucA</italic> mutations. Using several independent methods, it was determined that, at sub-inhibitory concentrations, LL-37 enters <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells, interacts with DNA, and promotes <italic>mucA</italic> mutations. Finally, conversion of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to the mucoid phenotype then protects the bacterial cells from killing by lethal concentrations of LL-37. These data reveal a novel mechanism to describe how antimicrobial peptides interact with bacterial cells and demonstrate that LL-37 may promote mutations leading to persistence and chronic infection.</p>

To circumvent this problem, a system for selecting mucoid colonies was developed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). A promoterless gene encoding chloramphenicol-resistance (<italic>cat</italic>) was placed under control of the promoter of the alginate biosynthetic operon (<italic>algD</italic>) <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Wozniak1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and integrated into the chromosome of non-mucoid, chloramphenicol sensitive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1 to generate PAO1<italic>algD-cat</italic> (WFPA934). Under this system, mucoid bacteria that are producing alginate and therefore transcribing <italic>algD</italic> will be chloramphenicol-resistant, allowing for selection of mucoid variants by growth on chloramphenicol-containing media (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). By comparing the numbers of colonies on non-selective versus chloramphenicol media the relative frequency of mucoid conversion was determined.</p>
                <p>To investigate the utility of this selection strategy, non-mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were exposed to a sub-inhibitory concentration (1/10 the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; 0.1 ÂµM)) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for one hour, followed by overnight recovery in media alone. Cultures are then serially diluted and plated on non-selective media to determine the total number of bacteria (â¼1Ã10<sup>10</sup>) and whole culture plated on chloramphenicol containing media to determine the number of mucoid colonies (0â300 depending on treatment). The mucoid conversion frequency is then determined by dividing the number of mucoid colonies by the total. There was no significant difference among treatments in the total number of bacteria after the one-hour treatment or after the overnight recovery period, therefore changes in mucoid conversion frequencies are a direct result of induction of mucoid variants. In agreement with previous studies <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Mathee1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Moyano1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sanders2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> significantly increased the frequency of mucoid conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). While non-mucoid chloramphenicol isolates were observed, the frequency was very low (â¼1.9Ã10<sup>â10</sup>) and was not altered by the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (or any of the other mutagens used in this study, see below). Since the translesion DNA polymerase DinB (Pol IV) and defects in the mismatch repair protein MutS contribute to mucoid conversion <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Moyano1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sanders2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, the role of these proteins was also examined. As predicted, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates lacking <italic>mutS</italic> exhibited increased mucoid conversion frequencies and <italic>dinBâ</italic> deficient isolates had severely impaired mucoid conversion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Importantly, no reduction in growth was observed during the short treatment periods utilized and resulting mucoid variants were stable upon multiple passages, where approximately 80% possessed mutations in <italic>mucA</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s006">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, we were able to identify mucoid variants, which acquire mutations by direct induction versus selection based on resistance. This selection strategy now provides a unique opportunity to interrogate the CF factors that directly promote mutations leading to mucoid conversion.</p>

                <p>To investigate the mechanism(s) by which PMNs induce mucoid conversion, we first sought to determine if bacterial uptake is necessary. Phagocytosis was blocked by the addition of cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; confirmed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s002">Figure S2A</xref>)), or by separating PMNs from the bacteria with transwells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Efficient mucoid conversion was maintained when phagocytosis was inhibited by either method, demonstrating the factors promoting mucoid conversion are released from the PMN. Since we hypothesize ROS generation is responsible for PMN-induced mucoid conversion, we sought to determine if inhibition of bacterial uptake affected the oxidative burst response. Surprisingly, both cytochalasin D and separation by transwells blocked the PMN oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, C respectively), suggesting PMNs can promote mucoid conversion in the absence of ROS. To confirm this, PMNs were specifically inhibited by pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). While treatment of PMNs with DPI significantly inhibited ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), this did not lead to inhibition of mucoid conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Inhibition of oxidative burst was further confirmed with lucigenin and scopoletin, which measure O<sub>2</sub>â¢ generation, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively (data not shown). Collectively, these data demonstrate that PMNs deficient in generating ROS can still efficiently induce mucoid conversion.</p>

                <p>Despite the presence of elevated LL-37 in CF sputum, it has been argued that in the CF pulmonary environment some AMPs may not function optimally due to high salt concentrations <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Bals1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Felgentreff1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> or may be sequestered by extracellular DNA and F-actin bundles <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Bucki1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Therefore, to determine if LL-37 mediated mucoid conversion is a process capable of functioning in the CF pulmonary environment, the impact of sputum isolated from CF patients on mucoid conversion was investigated. Sputum isolated from four different CF individuals induced an average mucoid conversion frequency of 3Ã10<sup>â9</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). To determine if LL-37 contributes to sputum induced mucoid conversion, LL-37 was immune-depleted from each sputum sample. The mucoid conversion frequency decreased significantly upon depletion with antibodies directed toward LL-37, compared to an isotype control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), demonstrating LL-37 contributes to mucoid conversion in CF sputum. However, immune-depletion of LL-37 did not completely abolish mucoid conversion. This is likely a combination of incomplete elimination of LL-37 from CF sputum, as well as potential contribution of other inflammatory factors in sputum to mucoid conversion (oxidative and nitrosative stress, other AMP, etc). Moreover, after incubation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with CF sputum, no change in the overall viability of the bacteria was observed (data not shown). These data suggest that antimicrobial factors present in CF sputum may not be present at bioavailable levels sufficient to control <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections, but are sufficient to promote conversion to the mucoid phenotype.</p>

Lande <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that LL-37 is capable of trafficking into dendritic cells, providing evidence that LL-37 can penetrate eukaryotic cells <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Lande1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. While multiple reviews have generalized this observation to include all cell types, it has yet to be formally determined if LL-37 can enter the cytosol of bacterial cells <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Fjell1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Seil1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Therefore, the capacity of sub-inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 to enter the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cytosol was examined utilizing fluorescent confocal- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). Non-mucoid PAO1 was treated with LL-37, fixed, and labeled with anti-LL37. For confocal microscopy, the localization of anti-LL37 labeling of permeabilized PAO1 (to allow antibody access to the cytosol) was compared to non-permeabilized cells. Non-permeabilized cells showed a weak, diffuse signal on the surface, compared to permeabilized cells, which demonstrated a stronger, punctate signal in the center of the cell (indicated by white arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This was clearly visible only in the cytosol, when sequential images where taken along the extent of the Z plane of the cells (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s005">Movie S1</xref>). With transmission electron microscopy (TEM), LL-37 labeling was visible in the cytosol of approximately 28% (white arrows) of cells and in the membrane of 11% (black arrows)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, center).</p>

                <p>These data reveal for the first time that LL-37 can gain entry to the cytosol of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, intracellular LL-37 was visualized in only a subset of cells. Of note, 43% of cells with cytosolic LL-37 labeling, as visualized by confocal microscopy, appeared to be actively dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). At lethal concentrations, LL-37 readily interacts with the septum of diving cells <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sochacki1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>; therefore active replication may also play a role in LL-37 gaining access to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cytosol at sub-inhibitory concentrations. Several models have been proposed to explain how AMPs interact with bacterial membranes, but accumulating evidence for LL-37 supports the Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang model <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Vandamme1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Zasloff1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1004083-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. In this model, peptides carpet the outer leaflet of the bacterium and integrate into the membrane. This is followed by a transient pore forming stage, where lipids and peptides are transported to the inner leaflet, resulting in collapse of membrane fragments and disruption of the membrane. In some cases, transient pore formation results in diffusion of peptides into the cytosol, where peptides can then interact with intracellular targets <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Zasloff1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. At sub-inhibitory concentrations, transient pore formation may occur without significant disruption of the membrane or loss of cell viability.</p>
                <p>To determine if bacterial DNA might be an intracellular target of LL-37, TEM experiments were performed as described previously, with a second label added for double-stranded DNA. 76% of intracellular LL-37 was localized with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom panel). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were also performed, where LL-37 treatment resulted in a shift of all DNA tested with similar affinity (apparent K<sub>D</sub>â=â12.8 ÂµM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004083.s004">Figure S4</xref>), further demonstrating that LL-37 binds non-specifically to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> DNA. It was observed that upon the addition of increasing amounts of LL-37 a threshold concentration was reached where no migration of DNA was observed, instead of a step-wise migration, a phenotype that has been observed for other short DNA binding peptides <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Hsu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p>
                <p>To investigate how LL-37 may interact with DNA and whether DNA binding is necessary for mucoid conversion, a structure-based search of LL-37 revealed homology to eukaryotic transcription factors containing basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) motifs. A three-dimensional model of LL-37 bound to DNA suggested that the amino-terminal basic residues of LL-37 occupy positions suitable for interactions with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). To investigate LL-37/DNA interactions, two synthetic peptides were generated: an LL-37 variant with the amino acid sequence randomly scrambled and a variant with the basic residues in the predicted DNA binding region replaced with glutamate residues (K/R7-19E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Scrambled LL-37 had a moderate loss of DNA binding, as well as a decrease in the ability to induce mucoid conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). When basic residues within the putative DNA binding region were modified, a complete loss of both DNA binding and mucoid conversion was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g005">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These data suggest that LL-37/DNA interactions are required for LL-37 to promote mucoid conversion. Studies are currently underway to further define LL-37/DNA interactions, their impact upon DinB and/or the DNA replisome, and the precise mechanism of mutagenesis.</p>

                <title>LL-37 contributes to pathoadaption of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
</title>
                <p>Herein, we show that LL-37 induces mucoidy but it is unknown if this conversion provides <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> adaptive protection from lethal concentrations of LL-37. We observed a 10-fold increase in survival of two mucoid isolates derived from LL-37 treatment when compared with parental non-mucoid PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). To determine if protection was dependent upon prior treatment with LL-37, a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-derived mucoid isolate, and a genetically engineered mucoid strain, PDO300 (PAO1Î<italic>mucA22</italic>) were examined and both showed enhanced resistance to LL-37 mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These data demonstrate that conversion to the mucoid phenotype provides <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> protection from lethal concentrations of LL-37, independent of prior exposure to LL-37. Since <italic>mucA</italic> inactivation and subsequent <italic>algT/U</italic> induction controls an entire regulon, of which only a subset are dedicated to alginate production, it was necessary to determine if alginate overproduction is specifically responsible for LL-37 protection. FRD<italic>mucA22</italic>Î<italic>algD</italic> (deficient in alginate production) was 10-fold more susceptible to LL-37 compared to the isogenic mucoid parental strain FRD1 (<italic>mucA22</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These data demonstrate that alginate overproduction contributes to protection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from LL-37 killing and this might promote <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathoadaptation in the CF pulmonary environment.</p>

                <p>Collectively, these data provide evidence for an additional role for LL-37 beyond the antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, and immunomodulatory functions previously described. We demonstrate that at sub-inhibitory levels, LL-37 promotes bacterial mutagenesis, which may contribute to evolution and pathoadaptation during chronic infections. Importantly, LL-37 induced mutations within <italic>mucA</italic> mimic what is observed in mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains isolated from the CF airway and the sub-inhibitory conditions utilized may be representative of the level of bioavailable peptide present in the CF pulmonary environment. Furthermore, LL-37 induced mutagenesis of <italic>mucA</italic> leading to mucoid conversion was modulated exclusively by the error-prone polymerase DinB. We were intrigued by the stringent dependence upon DinB in this process, particularly since previous studies demonstrate DinB is not required for spontaneous or UV-induced Rif<sup>R</sup>
<xref rid="ppat.1004083-Sanders1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We observed that LL-37 can promote Rif<sup>R</sup> in both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, suggesting perhaps the mechanism for acquisition of LL-37-induced <italic>mucA</italic> mutations and Rif<sup>R</sup> occur via different pathways. Moreover, LL-37 did not increase the expression of DinB under these conditions demonstrating basal levels of DinB are sufficient to promote mutagenesis. Typical translesion DNA synthesis occurs when the replisome stalls upon encountering damaged DNA or a challenging template and low-fidelity polymerases like DinB will displace Pol III in order to perpetuate replication <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Friedberg1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Since LL-37 interactions with DNA are required for LL-37-incuded mutagenesis we postulate that LL-37 presents a physical barrier that stalls Pol III, inducing a switch to DinB, whose error-prone replication promotes mutagenesis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004083-g007">Figure 7</xref> for model). EMSAs suggest that LL-37 non-specifically interacts with DNA; however, peptides have been identified which specifically interact with DNA repair intermediates, such as Holliday junctions <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Kepple1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-SuDLWAMS1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis could be that LL-37 perturbs effective DNA repair by binding to repair intermediates. In this regard, Overhage <italic>et al</italic> performed microarray experiments with sub-inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and identified changes in expression of genes involved in alginate regulation and DNA repair <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Overhage1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, differences in the conditions utilized in these experiments and a lack of convergence upon a single pathway do not support any one hypothesis. Additionally, sub-inhibitory levels of LL-37 have been found to stimulate expression of the capsule synthesis operon in Group A Streptococci <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Induction1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Together these studies suggest additional functions for sub-inhibitory levels of LL-37 impacting the expression of virulence genes. While the current study identified stable variants generated by mutagenesis, it is interesting to speculate how transient gene expression may impact their generation and selection in the host environment and further studies are clearly warranted.</p>

                <p>While data presented here demonstrate PMNs can promote mucoid conversion in the absence of an oxidative burst response, it is likely that mucoid conversion in the CF lung results from a combination of non-oxidative, oxidative, and nitrosative stresses. Moreover, other chronic pneumonias, such as COPD, are also characterized by elevated levels of PMNs, generally on the order of two to three-fold higher than healthy controls <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Stockley1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Hoenderdos1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Mucoid <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> have been isolated from patients with COPD, therefore, the mechanisms elucidated in this study may be important in other infections where chronic inflammation ensues <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Murphy1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid recovered from CF patients can have up to a 380-fold increase in PMNs recovered compared to healthy patients, even in patients without symptoms of an active infection <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Konstan1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Moreover, elevated levels of PMNs are detectable in CF newborns, which persist and undergo cycles of exacerbation throughout the life-time of the patient <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Dhooghe1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that persistent exposure of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to chronic inflammation for decades significantly contributes to microbial pathoadaptation in CF patients. Future investigation of how these inflammatory factors function in combination to promote <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> pathoadaptation will be important for comprehensive understanding of these processes and the development of rational therapeutics for chronic infections.</p>
                <p>Aggressive antibiotic and anti-inflammatory use over the past decade has drastically improved the life expectancy and disease outcome for CF patients. However, increased acquisition of antibiotic resistance mechanisms is presenting a significant challenge for future treatment options <xref rid="ppat.1004083-McCaughey1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Many are turning towards cationic antimicrobial peptides as a promising alternative for developing antimicrobials, as they are thought to be relatively insusceptible to the development of resistance mechanisms by mutations <xref rid="ppat.1004083-Mercer1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. This study demonstrates that some antimicrobial peptides may instead act to promote mutagenesis and the acquisition of resistance at sub-inhibitory levels. These data reinforce how important it is to consider the impact of current and novel treatments and the host immune response on evolution of microbial communities during chronic infections.</p>

                <p>For determination of localization of sub-inhibitory concentration of LL-37 by confocal microcopy, PAO1<italic>algD-cat</italic> was grown to mid-log phase and 1Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated with 0.25 ÂµM LL-37 or SPB for one hour. Cells were washed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X for 1 min, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stained with anti-LL-37 antibody (Santa Cruz) (1â¶100) conjugated directly to Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Bacteria were wet-mounted onto coverslips and visualized by confocal microscopy (Olympus FV 1000 Spectral) using a 100Ã oil objective. For quantification, 100 cells were chosen at random and intracellular and membrane-associated peptides counted and averaged by two readers blinded to the treatment conditions. For transmission electron microscopy, PAO1 was grown to mid-log phase and 1Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated with 0.25 ÂµM LL-37 or SPB for one hour. Cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h. Free aldehyde was quenched by the addition of 0.1 M glycine for 20 min and cells were resuspended in 0.2 M sucrose and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. Samples were embedded in LR white, cut into ultrathin sections (Leica EMU 6 ultramicrotome) (60â90 nm) and collected into formvar-coated nickel grids. Sections were stained by anti-LL37 (Santa Cruz) antibody conjugated to Protein-G colloidal gold (20 nm)(1â¶500)(EY Laboratories) and/or anti-dsDNA (Abcam) conjugated to Protein-G colloidal gold (10 nm, 1â¶100, EY Laboratories). Sections were viewed by transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit) operating at 80 kV. Twenty images were chosen at random and intracellular and membrane-associated peptides counted and averaged by two readers blinded to the treatment conditions.</p>
