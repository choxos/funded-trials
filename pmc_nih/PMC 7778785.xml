                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) experience impaired gross motor skills, limiting their capacity to engage in physical activities and participation in activities. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of supported physical activity interventions. This study aims to evaluate the effects of a telehealth-delivered physical activity programme on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and quality of life in RTT.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre study, conducted in Australia, Denmark and Israel. It is a randomised waitlist-controlled trial comparing an intervention to support physical activity with usual care. Participants are children and adults with RTT, recruited from the Australian Rett Syndrome Database, the Danish Center for Rett Syndrome and the Rett Syndrome Association of Israel. The intervention duration is 12 weeks, including fortnightly telephone contact to plan, monitor and develop individual activity programmes. Outcomes are measured at baseline, at 13 weeks and then at 25 weeks. The primary outcomes are sedentary behaviour assessed with an activPAL accelerometer and the number of daily steps measured with a StepWatch Activity Monitor. Secondary outcomes include sleep, behaviour and quality of life. Caregiver experiences will be assessed immediately after the intervention using a satisfaction questionnaire. Group differences for each outcome will be evaluated with analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values on an intention-to-treat basis.</p>

                  <p>Ethics approval has been obtained in Western Australia from the Child and Adolescent Health Services (RGS3371), in Denmark from the Capital Region Ethics Committee (H-19040514) and in Israel from the Ariel University Institutional Review Board (AU-HEA-ML-20190331). Manuscripts on the development of the intervention from pilot work and the results of the intervention will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. Results will be presented at conferences and consumer forums. We will develop an online resource documenting the physical activity programme and available supporting evidence.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Rett syndrome (RTT, MIM:312750) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 1 in 9000 live female births.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is characterised by largely normal early development followed by loss of acquired hand and communication skills. There are four main criteria: loss of hand skills, loss of communication skills, hand stereotypies and gait abnormalities.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> RTT is caused by a mutation in the X-linked <italic>MECP2</italic> gene,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> it is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> impacting multiple body systems<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> and associated with severe functional impairments. The clinical spectrum is broad and varied and closely linked to the type of genetic mutation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> The clinical presentation is severe for some children who are unable to walk or go on to require enteral feeding, whereas it is milder for others who can walk, negotiate stairs and self-feed. Communication is most often non-verbal, although a range of abilities is seen. Across the literature, findings are consistent that much of the clinical spectrum relates to the type of genetic mutation. For example, the Arg270*, Arg255* and Arg168* mutations are associated with more severe symptoms, whereas the Arg133Cys, Arg294* and C-terminal deletions are associated with less severe symptoms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref></p>
              <p>Specifically, early gross motor impairments may include delay in the acquisition of gross motor skills prior to regression,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> loss of balance during the regression period<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and difficulty in walking.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Gross motor skills are variable<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; the majority of individuals are able to sit, fewer than half learn to walk independently and less than one quarter can transfer from sitting to standing independently.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Recent systematic reviews of physical therapy interventions for individuals with RTT have reported mostly positive effects on gross motor skills, motor endurance and fitness within therapy settings.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> Opportunities for training have been observed as enjoyable for the child when accompanied with a microswitch that delivered a light and sound sensory response to walking.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We note that the majority of studies were case studies, case series and single-case design studies, and only one study used randomisation in a stepped wedge design.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>Use of gross motor skills as physical activity during everyday living is also an important component of health<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and quality of life.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We have previously investigated sedentary time and physical activity in RTT.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref> Girls and women recruited from the Australian Rett Syndrome Database (ARSD, n=64)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> wore a StepWatch Activity Monitor (SAM) during waking hours. An average of 62% (SD 19%) of time was sedentary and approximately 20% (SD 8%) of time was spent in light-intensity walking, with the volume of activity influenced by whether walking was independent or required assistance or even close supervision, older age and the presence of comorbidities such as epilepsy and scoliosis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We found similar results in Denmark, again using the activPAL to measure sedentary time and the SAM to count steps.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> On average, 83% of waking hours were sedentary (n=48), the median daily step count was 5127 (n=28) and older age and lower levels of gross motor skill were strong predictors of reduced activity levels.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
              <p>Individuals with RTT are mostly dependent on others for support in daily activities.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> Providing support for the individual to engage in additional activities could reduce sedentary time and increase physical activity. Reducing sedentary time by increasing the number and duration of episodes of standing and walking, especially in individuals with more severe mobility limitations, has been suggested.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Providing support for more light activities in RTT could be an important focus for intervention. More recently, we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of an individualised 12-week intervention using a pretest–posttest design that aimed to increase standing and walking activity in 14 girls and women with RTT.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The intervention involved working with caregivers and service providers to identify standing and walking activities using strategies developed to meet activity goals<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and that were consistent with the concept of participation in home, school and community settings.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> An important focus was the collaborative efforts with families in selecting meaningful and engaging goals and in implementing and evaluating the individual intervention plan. It was well received and considered feasible by caregivers and therapists. Some positive effects were found including reduced sedentary time, increased daily step count and a small but significant increase in quality of life.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p>
              <p>In sum, individuals with RTT live sedentary lives and engage in low levels of physical activity relative to the general population, which has shown to reduce functional abilities throughout adulthood in people with disabilities.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Programmes of support for increasing participation in meaningful activities are feasible and have been proven to increase function,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> but the level of evidence is low. As RTT is a rare condition, individuals are geographically dispersed but telehealth methods are being used increasingly across distances for the delivery of rehabilitation services such as for individuals diagnosed with cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and across a range of domains to improve adaptive skills in those with multiple disabilities.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> To build on previous research and inform practice, we designed this ActivRett clinical trial protocol.</p>
              <p>The primary aim is to evaluate the effects of a telehealth-delivered physical activity programme on sedentary behaviour and physical activity in RTT. Our secondary aims are to evaluate the effects of the programme on quality of life, sleep and behaviour. We will also seek to evaluate the acceptability of the physical activity programme for caregivers and to explore the characteristics of individuals who are more responsive to the programme and the adaptability of activities in accordance with family resources. Following trial completion, we aim to provide the study manual as an attractive and freely available online resource for physical activity support in RTT, for use by families, caregivers and therapists wherever they live.</p>

                <p>This study is funded by the peak international patient advocacy organisation for RTT (Rettsyndrome.org) and our proposal has been subject to scientific and consumer review. Prior to our previous feasibility study,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> we held a teleconference with Australian parents who shared their experiences of enjoyable physical activities for their daughters. When developing our manual for the current study, we conducted an international survey of caregivers and professionals who support individuals with RTT about how they supported their daughter to be physically active and what they would want in a physical activity programme. These ideas and perspectives informed the study intervention manual. Insights from the survey will be published to share with parents and therapists key insights on facilitators and barriers to individuals with RTT being physically active. The dissemination plan will include presentations to families at consumer and community forums for their feedback.</p>

                <p>The intervention aims to increase the quantity of standing and walking activities, collectively termed ‘uptime’,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> for girls and women with RTT. The increased ‘uptime’ activities will be codesigned with the caregivers and service providers for use in their own environments (home, school, community) and supported by the usual caregivers and service providers in those environments. These will primarily be parents, but may also include others such as siblings, carers and service providers. The intervention will be delivered over a 12-week period, supported by fortnightly telehealth video/telephone calls with a physiotherapist (the site investigators) who will consult and provide recommendations for strategies to increase the quantity and frequency of ‘uptime’ activities. The activity recommendations will be formed into goals and evaluated at the next session using Goal Attainment Scaling.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The research therapists will also be available between scheduled fortnightly video calls for support via email, phone call or video call. Throughout, the investigators and carers will discuss physical activity needs, determine and adapt relevant activities, modify the programme as necessary and plan additional goals. For example, goals will articulate what the activity is (eg, increased opportunities for standing or walking as suitable for the individual’s ability), where (eg, in the home, garden, at school or in the community) and when the activity will happen (eg, the new activity could be scheduled at particular times in the day to suit routines) and with whom (eg, parent, sibling, carer) and why the goal is meaningful and of value. At any time during the intervention period, an individual will have two to four goals which could change, as more suitable and challenging goals are identified. The interactive nature of the delivery of the programme is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.</p>

Enjoyment is paramount to engagement in activities and through choice people can identify preferred activities.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Determinants of participation include: (1) child-related attributes—combination of body function and personal factors, (2) family-related and caregiver-related attributes—socioeconomic status and family functioning, and (3) environmental attributes—supportive of the physical, social, attitudinal and service environments.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>

                <p>At each contact, investigators delivering the intervention will check with the caregiver as to the well-being of the individual with RTT and how the intervention activities have progressed. The intervention aims to increase the volume of everyday activities under the supervision of primary caregivers and there is the risk of a fall. Any adverse events will be reported to the study data safety monitor, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon and the ethics committee. The data safety monitor will use clinical judgement as to the circumstances around any adverse events and will advise whether the individual can continue in the trial or not. Participants who have an adverse event will be followed up by the site investigator as required to ensure they are receiving appropriate medical care.</p>
                <p>RTT is associated with increased risk of fracture and we have previously determined that the incidence of any fracture episode was 43.3 episodes per 1000 years.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> We will be observing 60 individuals with RTT over a period of 6 months per individual, and this would equate to 30 person years. We would expect that up to two episodes of fracture could occur during the study period, associated with either activity or a pathological fracture. The stopping rule for this study will be the occurrence of two episodes of fracture that are associated with a study activity-related fall. The risk of adverse events is low and a data monitoring committee is not needed, additional to the data safety monitor, for this study.</p>

Difference in values of each outcome variable by intervention status at assessment 2 will be analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusted for baseline values, age, walking status and country. Analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis with the last known value carried forward in the event of missing data. Further within-group analyses on treatment effect will be conducted by combining data collected immediately pre intervention and immediately post intervention from both groups. In this analysis, the independent variables will be factors that could influence the magnitude of change, such as age and walking ability, and the dependent variables will be the change scores of the primary outcomes (ie, sedentary time and step counts). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models will be conducted. For the group which receives the intervention in the first time period, we will evaluate change in outcomes between assessment 2 and assessment 3 using a paired t-test. The analyst will be blind to treatment allocation.</p>

Information will be suitable for families, caregivers and therapists, and will also be suitable for a wide range of disabilities in addition to RTT. Strategies will be illustrated with line drawings. Draft content will be presented to the Consumer Reference Groups of the Australian Rett Syndrome Study and InterRett, open also to Danish and Israeli families, for review prior to being finalised and translated.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Many individuals with a developmental disability including those with RTT experience low levels of physical activity in their daily lives, threatening both their health and quality of life. There is a need for scalable, flexible and accessible interventions to promote activity programmes in RTT. Yet, the current level of evidence for interventions that guide how to achieve this is low. This study will be the first clinical trial investigating strategies to increase physical activity in RTT. Participants will be children and adults. The literature over the years has suggested the need to develop management plans that can translate from research designs to the daily life of the participants and across their life span.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55–57</xref>Our proposal represents affirmative action in this regard.</p>
              <p>Telehealth is being used in many fields of medicine and rehabilitation and our proposal will be one of the first to apply this method in RTT. This is a particularly attractive modality because RTT is rare, families live in widespread geographic locations and telehealth can bring specialist skills to the affected individual in her own environment. Particularly, in light of the social isolation and disruption to traditional therapy delivery caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth represents an attractive method to provide therapy to populations that are likely to be disproportionately negatively affected, such as individuals with RTT and their caregivers. Families, carers and therapists will guide the setting of goals and be responsible for implementing activities that they have had a role in determining. Their grass roots involvement will facilitate the continuation of programmes beyond the immediate study period. Our proposal will be build on available resources and strengths, respond to locally identified needs and empower those working in local communities to improve physical activities and participation of the individuals with RTT under their care.</p>
              <p>The intervention is in alignment with participation<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and quality of life<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> frameworks, developed by our team of international investigators, to enable the intervention to be applicable across diverse settings. As follow-up to the proposed evaluation, there is also a critical need to develop mechanisms by which evidence-based practice can be readily available to the community. We also propose the translation of available strategies including those tested in the current study and their level of evidence into an online resource, in order that physical activity strategies are available to those in need wherever they live. There is potential for the findings of our study to provide evidence of how individuals with RTT can live more active lives, in order that they may gain health and well-being benefits from greater levels of meaningful activities, within their home, school and community environments.</p>
