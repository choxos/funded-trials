                <p id="P1">In the phase III study RESONATE, ibrutinib reduced the risk of progression and improved overall survival versus ofatumumab in previously treated patients with CLL/SLL. In this novel analysis of patient well-being including patient-reported outcomes, ibrutinib reduced disease burden while preserving parameters of hematologic and immunologic function in RESONATE. These results suggest that ibrutinib can improve quality of life while prolonging survival.</p>

FACIT-F is a validated instrument that assesses tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting daily activities owing to fatigue. Scores range from 0 to 52, with high scores indicating less fatigue.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A change in FACIT-F score of â‰¥ 3 points<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> was considered clinically meaningful. FACIT-F forms and other PRO instruments were generally completed by patients prior to any study procedures. Per protocol, patients were not required to complete the questionnaire following PD/crossover or after completing treatment if assigned to the ofatumumab arm.</p>
                <p id="P11">Prespecified exploratory endpoints included improvement of investigator-assessed disease-related symptoms (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 [CTCAE] grade decrease of â‰¥ 1 post-baseline, reported for â‰¥ 2 consecutive assessments of weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, abdominal discomfort owing to splenomegaly, and/or anorexia), PRO as measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30; clinically meaningful change defined as &gt; 10 points<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>), and medical resource utilization associated with therapy including number of hospitalizations, any blood product transfusions (red blood cells, platelets, whole blood), and use of any hematopoietic growth factors. Compliance rates for FACIT-F and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire completion were monitored (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref> in the online version).</p>
                <p id="P12">To evaluate disease burden, lymph nodes and splenic enlargement were quantified by IRC-assessed computed tomography; reduction was defined per iwCLL criteria.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The effect of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab on white blood cell count and differential was evaluated over time. Lymphocyte subsets (B cells, T cells, natural killer [NK] cells [see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref> in the online version]) were evaluated by flow cytometry for patients with baseline samples.

                <p id="P26">At a median treatment duration of 16 months for ibrutinib versus 5 months for ofatumumab, 13 ibrutinib patients and 7 ofatumumab patients discontinued study drug primarily due to AEs. In total, 23 and 16 patients, respectively, had AEs associated with discontinuation, most frequently pneumonia; among patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to AEs, longer duration of therapy appears to be associated with increased time to progression (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref> in the online version). AEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation occurred in 12 of 195, 9 of 172, 1 of 159, and 1 of 39 patients at 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, and 19 to 24 months, respectively. AEs leading to ibrutinib dose reduction occurred in 7 of 195, 4 of 172, and 2 of 159 patients at 0 to 6, 7 to 12, and 13 to 18 months, respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P27">Ibrutinib is a selective first-in-class irreversible inhibitor of Brutonâ€™s agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase with an important role in multiple cellular functions including B-cell antigen receptor signaling. A high frequency of durable responses and acceptable safety associated with ibrutinib in the previously treated population with CLL has been demonstrated in the RESONATE study with enhanced PFS, OS, and ORR as compared with ofatumumab, including in high-risk subgroups.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This report demonstrates that in addition to its known efficacy, prolonged administration of ibrutinib confers patients additional benefits as assessed by multiple measures of well-being, including preservation of parameters of hematologic and immunologic function. At a median of 16.4 months follow-up, the present data are among the first reports from a randomized phase III study to demonstrate significant improvement in hematologic and immunologic parameters in parallel with QoL improvements. In the majority of patients with baseline cytopenias, ibrutinib led to early and sustained platelet and hemoglobin improvements (82% and 69%, respectively), which were markedly better than for the patients randomized to ofatumumab.</p>
              <p id="P28">With up to 2 years of follow-up, the positive hematologic effects of ibrutinib resulted in sustained normalization of hemoglobin in 69% and of platelet count in 82% of patients with baseline anemia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Transient increase followed by sustained decrease in percentage of lymphocytes over time is expected given the known pharmacodynamic â€˜redistributionâ€™ phenomenon of B-cell receptor inhibitor treatment-related lymphocytosis. Malignant B cell counts decreased dramatically with ibrutinib and approached normal limits by week 72, and median CD4+, CD8+, and NK cell counts remained within normal limits throughout treatment. Reduction in regulatory T cell counts to the LLN was observed in ibrutinib-treated patients consistent with preclinical studies of ibrutinib and other clinical data sets.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Future analyses discriminating normal from neoplastic B cells would be beneficial to ascertain any modulatory effects of ibrutinib. An increase in IgA levels was also observed with ibrutinib over time, without significant decrement in IgG or IgM.</p>
              <p id="P29">In a National Institutes of Health study of patients with CLL â‰¥ 65 years of age or with <italic>TP53</italic> aberration, the infection rate overall was lower in treatment-naive (TN) versus relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients, but rates declined over time in both TN and R/R populations<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>; data that suggest clinically relevant improvement in humoral immunity with ibrutinib treatment. In an integrated analysis of patients from the RESONATE and RESONATE-2 (ibrutinib vs. chlorambucil in older patients with TN CLL/SLL) trials, infection rates were also shown to decrease with time on ibrutinib.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Although the decreased incidence of various infections over time seen during ibrutinib treatment in this and other reports may reflect these positive hematologic effects on lymphocytes and immunoglobulin levels, future detailed analyses of these infections may be warranted, given recent descriptions of opportunistic infections occurring during ibrutinib treatment.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P30">PROs, including health-related QoL, are increasingly assessed in clinical trials as a measure of effectiveness and to help with decision-making. Analysis of FACIT-F outcomes showed that a clinically meaningful improvement from baseline was reached in &lt; 24 weeks with ibrutinib and ofatumumab, with mean improvement sustained through 60 weeks of follow-up on ibrutinib. Similarly, fatigue was improved as measured with the EORTC fatigue subscale PRO as well as investigator-assessed disease-related symptoms. Additionally, 100% of patients treated with ibrutinib experienced improvements in weight loss and anorexia. The magnitude of improvement (mean change from baseline to week 24) in EORTC QLQ-C30 was greater with ibrutinib compared with ofatumumab for domains including global health status, physical functioning, fatigue, dyspnea, and constipation, whereas the improvement was greater with ofatumumab for role functioning, social functioning, and appetite loss. When considering the threshold for clinically meaningful improvement, only dyspnea was improved with ibrutinib (mean change, âˆ’11.0) and appetite loss with ofatumumab (mean change, âˆ’13.0). Notably, comparative data between treatment groups are limited due to the ofatumumab arm fixed duration of treatment (maximum 6 months) and relatively short PFS (median, 8.1 months),<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> but the overall effects of ibrutinib on QoL reflect clinically meaningful gains that were sustained throughout the 60 weeks of follow-up. Irrespective of this disparity in drug exposure time, the majority of positive ibrutinib benefits were also observed at the time of the primary analysis when treatment durations were comparable.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> For safety and medical resource utilization data, this imbalance in follow-up would generally favor ofatumumab. Despite this, medical resource utilization as a prespecified exploratory endpoint, including hospitalizations in the first 30 days and growth factor usage after day 30, was higher in the ofatumumab group versus the ibrutinib group. Cost implications were not analyzed, although one recent real-world analysis of front line CLL treatment showed reduced medical resource utilization and reduced costs of care are incurred with ibrutinib compared with chemoimmunotherapy.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> That analysis did not evaluate pharmacy costs, and it remains unknown how these will contribute to the balance of costs for ibrutinib versus chemoimmunotherapy options. Such evaluations will be of further interest in the real-world setting.</p>
              <p id="P31">No new safety signals were identified in this study versus earlier phase II studies,<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and new events of diarrhea, certain infections, and cytopenias, including grade â‰¥ 3 events, were observed less frequently over time. These data suggest that, except for the appearance of grade 3 hypertension, the likelihood of new onset treatment-emergent AEs may be reduced with long-term ibrutinib therapy.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="P32">Clinical data describing psycho-oncologic endpoints in studies of patients with CLL treated with new small targeted molecules or biologics are sparse. These novel RESONATE findings are among the first randomized data to assess multiple measures of overall patient well-being with treatment, including PROs, disease burden, hematologic function, and benefits to patients with regard to disease management and reduced requirement for supportive care. A survival benefit with ibrutinib, together with sustained improvements in hematologic endpoints and patient-reported outcomes, suggest that ibrutinib can improve QoL while prolonging survival.</p>
