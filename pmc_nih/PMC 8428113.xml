                <title>SUMMARY</title>
                <p id="P3">Neuronal oscillations are suggested to play an important role in auditory working memory (WM), but their contribution to content-specific representations has remained unclear. Here, we measure magnetoencephalography during a retro-cueing task with parametric ripple-sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to speech but resist non-auditory memory strategies. Using machine learning analyses, with rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, we show that memorized sound content is strongly represented in phase-synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and frontoparietal cortices. These phase-synchronization patterns predict the memorized sound content steadily across the studied maintenance period. In addition to connectivity-based representations, there are indices of more local, “activity silent” representations in auditory cortices, where the decoding accuracy of WM content significantly increases after task-irrelevant “impulse stimuli.” Our results demonstrate that synchronization patterns across auditory sensory and association areas orchestrate neuronal coding of auditory WM content. This connectivity-based coding scheme could also extend beyond the auditory domain.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Auditory working memory (WM) refers to our capability to maintain and manipulate sound information in our minds over brief periods of time, which has co-evolved with the auditory-vocal communication skills that set humans apart in the animal kingdom (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Aboitiz, 2018</xref>). How neurons maintain information in WM and how different parts of the brain contribute to this process continue to be unresolved and debated questions, irrespective of stimulus modality (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Constantinidis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2017</xref>). A specific complication in the auditory domain has been that many of the available WM tasks have been based on complex stimuli that allow or even facilitate non-auditory WM maintenance strategies (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Lutzenberger et al., 2002</xref>), such as verbal rehearsal (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Jonides, 1997</xref>). The fundamental mechanisms of how purely auditory attributes are maintained thus constitute one of the least understood aspects of human WM (<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Scott and Mishkin, 2016</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">WM research has long been influenced by a hypothesis that there is a dedicated area of prefrontal (PFC) or posterior parietal (PPC) cortices, which maintains information via the sustained firing of neurons (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Goldman-Rakic, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Jonides, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2017</xref>). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that activation patterns that carry the information of WM content occur at many areas of the brain (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>), ranging from early auditory or visual cortices to the highest cognitive areas (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bigelow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Christophel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gottlieb et al., 1989</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Grimault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Linke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Serences, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Uluç et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). Many current theories thus view WM as an emergent property of functionally interconnected brain areas that represent different sensory, perceptual, and cognitive stages of the task-relevant content (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Postle, 2006</xref>). However, although these distributed models are gaining wide support, relatively few studies have examined information content in interregional patterns of brain activity per se during WM maintenance (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Salazar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Soreq et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P8">An ideal way to examine the role of interregional functional connectivity patterns in human WM is to analyze interregional phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations estimated from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. In previous visual studies, indices of long-range synchronization effects that depend on task attributes such as the amount of maintained information, or “WM load,” have been reported both using human MEG (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Daume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Palva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2018</xref>) and non-human primate neurophysiology (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Buschman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Salazar et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, accumulating neurophysiological evidence suggests that functional collectivity of more local neuronal networks, mediated by bursts of neuronal oscillations that modulate and refresh synaptic plasticity, play a crucial role in supporting WM maintenance (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether phase synchronization across the broader network of brain areas involved in human WM carries information of its memory content is still uncertain.</p>
              <p id="P9">Here, we tested the hypothesis that auditory WM content is encoded and maintained in transient changes of functional connectivity between brain areas involved in auditory perception and cognition. To this end, we examined frequency-specific changes in phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations using MEG, a non-invasive measure of synaptic currents in the human brain. Unlike EEG, MEG readily dissociates signals from the auditory cortices and frontocentral regions in the sensor space (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Hamalainen et al., 1993</xref>), which significantly facilitates the cortical source estimation needed for our hypothesis testing. To ensure that the effects reflect purely auditory WM, we designed a task with dynamic ripple sound stimuli, which are spectrotemporally similar to human vocalizations but resist non-auditory memory strategies (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Visscher et al., 2007</xref>). We developed a multivariate machine-learning pipeline to predict the ripple-sound content maintained in WM using the patterns of subregional functional connectivity as well as spectral and temporal brain activity measures. In addition, we tested for the existence of “activity silent” WM representations in auditory cortices (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2015</xref>) by examining the content specificity of oscillatory power patterns elicited to task-irrelevant impulse stimuli (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>, <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>

            <sec id="S2">
              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p id="P10">Using machine learning, we show that phase synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and frontoparietal cortices predict the content of auditory WM with high accuracy. In most of these functional connectivity patterns, the decoding accuracy of memory content remained stable across the studied maintenance period. Furthermore, the connections that revealed the WM content during the later stage of maintenance consisted of a subset of those found during the earlier part of maintenance. In addition to these connectivity-based results, we found indices of activity silent WM representations in auditory cortices, as suggested by enhanced decoding of memorized sound content from patterns of oscillatory power after task-irrelevant impulse sounds.</p>

                <title>Behavioral performance</title>
                <p id="P11">Auditory WM was examined using a “retro-cueing” paradigm, a strategy that helps control for the differing accounts of recent stimulus history (i.e., passive sensory memory) and actively maintained WM content (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Sprague et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Uluç et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The memory items consisted of six ripple velocities separated by 1.5 of their just noticeable differences (JNDs), which was determined in a separate session to control for individual differences in sound discrimination (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Visscher et al., 2007</xref>). MEG data were measured from 20 participants while subjects were performing the WM task. All of the subjects were capable of performing the task according to the instruction. The mean proportion of correct responses was 0.84 (standard deviation = 0.1).</p>

                <p id="P12">We selected six regions of interest (ROIs) based on the previous studies on auditory WM (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Buchsbaum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Crottaz-Herbette et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Jimenez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Uluç et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Vallar et al., 1997</xref>), as specifically defined by using the Freesurfer Desikan parcellation (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>). These ROIs included the superior temporal cortex (STC; superior temporal and Heschl’s gyri combined) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), as well as the caudal middle frontal (CMF), lateral orbitofrontal (LOF), rostral middle frontal (RMF), precentral (PC), and supramarginal (SM; overlapping with intraparietal lobule [IPL]) areas in each hemisphere. Given that different parts of STC are sensitive to different spectrotemporal properties (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Schönwiesner and Zatorre, 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that the memorized ripple-sound content is represented in the subregional phase-synchronization patterns between the auditory cortex and other ROIs. Therefore, we focused on the connections between STC and other ROIs to tap into the role of networks involving sensory cortices in WM. We developed an approach that uses sub-ROI functional connectivity patterns to predict the WM content with a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As the functional connectivity measure, the imaginary part of the coherence (ImCoh) between sub-ROI pairs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) was used to minimize spurious connectivity due to the field spread effect (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Nolte et al., 2004</xref>). We considered early (0.5–1.25 s from memory cue) and late (1.25–2 s) time windows in the maintenance period. The data from all of the subjects were merged together within the classification, which was cross-validated by permuting the data 100 times. This means training the model with data from 75% of the subjects and testing on the remaining data. The statistical significance of the classification accuracy was determined by comparing the original accuracy with a null distribution created by using a randomized classifier by permuting the labels 500 times. To control for multiple comparisons, from each permutation, the maximum statistical value across the studied 60 connections (12 STC-ROI pairs in 5 frequency bands) was assigned to this null distribution. To further test the validity of our results, we conducted a similar connectivity-based decoding analysis with the visual cortex area lateral occipital cortex (LOC) as the seed region (for further details of the statistical analyses, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P13">During maintenance, decoding accuracies were significantly above chance level in 12 frequency-specific connections within the early time window (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and in 8 connections within the later time window (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Significant connectivity-based decoding results were found in both hemispheres at the alpha and gamma ranges, with the strongest effects emerging at the high gamma band in the right hemisphere (for details of the statistical inference, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). Importantly, all connections that revealed WM content within the late time window showed significant decoding results also within the early time window (labeled with an asterisk in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In the right hemisphere, WM content was stably decodable from both time windows from the high gamma-band connection patterns between STC versus LOF, IFG, RMF, CMF, and PC, as well as from the alpha-band connection patterns between STC and IFG. In the left hemisphere, the WM content could be stably decoded from the alpha-band STC-PC and high gamma-band STC-SM connectivity patterns (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In the control analysis with LOC as the seed, none of the estimated decoding accuracies was significantly above chance level (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; for details of the statistical inference, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). The results of additional connectivity-based analyses, which decoded the stimulus content during the WM encoding, are presented in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>. Examples of confusion matrices related to the decoding analyses during the maintenance period are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P14">To rule out power-related biases in our coherence estimates, we conducted another control analysis, in which the power values in each ROI were used as features in the SVM classifier (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, in contrast to the connectivity-based analysis, the control analysis aiming to classify the memorized ripple-sound content based on oscillatory power patterns at the same five frequency ranges provided no significant results in any of the ROIs (for details of the statistical inference, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>).</p>

                <title>Probing the activity-silent WM traces in auditory cortex areas</title>
                <p id="P15">Recent electroencephalography (EEG) studies suggest that task-irrelevant impulse stimuli help amplify the readout of neural memory traces from distributed brain activation patterns (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In addition to the connectivity -analysis, we therefore probed for activity silent WM representations in the auditory cortex by examining content-related changes of responses to task-irrelevant auditory impulse stimuli, which were unrelated to the stored attributes, per se: a 50-ms white-noise burst was randomly presented in 50% of the trials after 2.5 s into the delay period to induce a brief transient activation in auditory cortices (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We then attempted to decode which of the six ripple sound items was maintained in WM from the frequency band x sub-ROI patterns of oscillatory power in left and right STC, with versus without the impulse sound (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The effect of impulse sound was tested by using a linear mixed effect (LME) model with fixed effect factors “impulse sound” (with versus without) and the MEG frequency band center frequency, as well as the random effect of subject identity, using the MATLAB function fitlme (for details of the statistical inference, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>). In support of our hypothesis, the content of auditory WM could be decoded significantly more accurately from STC from trials that included the impulse sound versus those not including the impulse sound (<italic>t</italic><sub>187</sub> = 4.0, <italic>p<sub>Bonferroni</sub></italic> = 0.001; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The best-fitting model furthermore suggested that the decoding accuracy generally increased as a function of the increasing MEG frequency band (<italic>t</italic><sub>187</sub> = 3.1, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>Bonferroni</italic></sub> = 0.03; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that the impulse sound improves the decoding accuracy of WM content in STC areas that encompass the human auditory cortex.</p>
                <p id="P16">We hypothesized that the readout of WM content would be enhanced by the impulse sound specifically in auditory cortices. However, in a confirmatory control analysis, we tested the effect of the impulse sound also in the frontal and parietal ROIs using a sub-ROI power pattern of spectral power in the five frequency bands (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction across 13 t-statistics. In contrast to the significant effects bilateral STCs, the impulse sound did not improve the decoding accuracy in our parietal and frontal ROIs.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P21">Our results provide evidence that parametric attributes of auditory WM content are represented in behaviorally relevant neuronal phase-synchronization patterns, which connect auditory areas of STC with inferior-lateral frontoparietal cortices. According to our machine-learning analyses, which used rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, most of these connectivity-based WM representations remained stable across the studied maintenance period. Stable and significant connectivity-based decoding results were found at the alpha and high gamma bands in both hemispheres, with the strongest WM content representations emerging at the high gamma band in the right hemisphere. These findings support a hypothesis that auditory WM content is maintained in long-range synchronization patterns of neuronal oscillations.</p>
              <p id="P22">It has long been debated whether WM involves a dedicated storage region or whether the maintenance process is distributed across multiple brain areas and hierarchical levels (for reviews, see <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Goldman-Rakic, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Postle, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2017</xref>). Our results provide an alternative perspective to this theoretical question: WM maintenance could be supported by a broader interregional connectivity architecture, in which each dynamic ripple sound memory is represented by a content-specific combination of functional connections across different aspects of auditory cortex, premotor cortex, and frontoparietal association areas. The content specificity of these connectivity patterns could be built upon an intrinsic connectivity topography in which the “best ripple velocity” differs across different subareas of the auditory cortex (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Massoudi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Schönwiesner and Zatorre, 2009</xref>) and also across frontoparietal neurons that are connected to different parts of the auditory cortex (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>). This connectivity-based coding hypothesis receives indirect support from a recent fMRI study, according to which the content of human visual WM can be decoded more precisely from functional connectivity than local hemodynamic activation patterns (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Soreq et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P23">The theoretical idea that WM content could be represented in functional connectivity has been described previously at the level of a local network of nearby neuronal units (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Barak and Tsodyks, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2015</xref>). A candidate mechanism for such local connectivity-based effects is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP): During encoding, the stimulus-driven activity temporarily changes the synaptic efficacy within the neural network, which leaves behind a temporary synaptic memory trace via STSP (<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). These STSP effects could then change the functional connectivity of the neural network and result in a transient item-specific circuit for the WM memoranda (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Erickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Stokes, 2015</xref>). It is possible such effects could also modulate the intrinsic connectivity of larger-scale networks that are observable in MEG source estimates. In other words, the content specificity of large-scale functional connectivity, which we observed in the linear classifier analysis of MEG source estimates, could reflect an altered state of the underlying synaptic connections.</p>
              <p id="P24">Content-specific interregional synchronization in WM could also be intuitively explained by the communication through coherence theory (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fries, 2005</xref>). According to this theory, frequency-specific coherence provides a mechanism for information transfer by phase-aligning periods of excitability to maximize the opportunity for communication (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fries, 2005</xref>). During WM encoding, the intrinsic oscillatory activity of groups of neurons, which are sensitive to the to-be-remembered auditory attributes, could become synchronized or “entrained.” During maintenance, the entrained (interregional) oscillatory activity could then increase the temporal coherence of activations that, for example, help periodically refresh synaptic traces of the maintained information (for a review, see <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P25">In auditory cortices, we found a significant increase in the decoding accuracy of the memory content after task-irrelevant impulse sounds, when compared to maintenance trials with no such impulse stimuli. This finding is broadly consistent with previous EEG studies of activity silent representations in visual (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Ten Oever et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and auditory WM (<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>). However, as the previous non-invasive human studies were focused on the EEG electrode space analysis, the underlying sources of activity silent WM representations, and particularly the contribution of sensory areas, had remained ambiguous. Our MRI-constrained cortical MEG source analysis results thus significantly extend these previous findings by showing that activity silent WM maintenance takes place in the sensory areas of the human cortex as well.</p>
              <p id="P26">In our connectivity-based decoding analyses, we found content-specific WM effects at alpha and high gamma ranges. Previous studies in both visual (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Medendorp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Palva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">van Vugt et al., 2010</xref>) and auditory domains (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Lutzenberger et al., 2002</xref>) have suggested functional specificity of different oscillatory frequency ranges. In these studies, gamma band oscillations have often been associated with active maintenance of WM information (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Roux and Uhlhaas, 2014</xref>). Previous neurophysiological work suggests that gamma activity is closely linked to spiking patterns that carry information about WM memoranda (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>). Although often considered predominantly a local phenomenon (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Fries et al., 2007</xref>), gamma-range synchronization patterns occur also across longer distances (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Buzsáki and Schomburg, 2015</xref>), including between the primate PFC and sensory areas during active attention tasks (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, alpha-band activity has been linked to protecting WM items from non-relevant information (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Roux and Uhlhaas, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that these frequency-specific changes in functional connectivity show content-specific variability, which can be decoded using machine-learning techniques.</p>
              <p id="P27">In conclusion, our results provide converging evidence that auditory WM information is maintained in patterns of functional connectivity between subregions of frontoparietal and temporal cortices. The content specificity of these connectivity-based WM representations fundamentally relies on sensory areas of the human auditory cortex. It is conceivable that the principles of our connectivity-based perspective on the neural coding of WM extend beyond the auditory domain.</p>

                  <title>Stimuli and WM task</title>
                  <p id="P34">The majority of previous studies on auditory WM use stimuli that allow non-auditory maintenance strategies. Here, to eliminate verbal and other non-auditory rehearsal strategies, we used moving ripple sounds, which are spectrotemporally similar to speech but not contaminated by semantic properties or perceptual categories (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Visscher et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). An individualized set of 17 stimuli with different ripple velocities, separated by intervals of <bold>Δ</bold>ω = 0.5 × the just noticeable difference (JND) were generated for each subject in a separate behavioral session, to control for individual differences in sound discrimination (<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Visscher et al., 2007</xref>). The dynamic ripple sounds were generated by superimposing 20 sinusoids/octave ranging from <italic>f</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.2 kHz to <italic>f</italic> = 1.6 kHz. Their intensity at any time and frequency was defined by <italic>s(g,t</italic>) = <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> + <italic>D</italic> cos[2π(<italic>ωt</italic> + Ω<italic>g</italic>)) + <italic>ψ</italic>], where g = log(<italic>f/f<sub>0</sub></italic>), D is the modulation depth, and ψ is the phase of the ripple (duration = 1 s, Ω = 1 cycles/octave). JND of ω was approximated as the minimally detectable base 2 logarithmic ripple-velocity interval within a range of 3-48 cycles/s based on an adaptive 2 down/1 up staircase algorithm. The sounds were delivered at a comfortable level via a headphone.</p>
                  <p id="P35">A “retro-cueing” paradigm was utilized to control for the differing accounts of recent stimulus history and actively maintained WM content (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Sprague et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Uluç et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The subject was first presented with two sound items in a row. A subsequent retro-cue indicated which of the two items was to be maintained in memory. Four seconds after the retro-cue, the subject heard a probe stimulus and was asked to press one button if the probe matched the relevant item and another button if not. In 50% of the trials, the probe matched the maintained item. In 50% of the remaining non-matching trials (25% of total count), the probe matched the irrelevant item, to confirm that subjects were maintaining only the relevant item. Notably, the subject was not informed that whereas the probes were selected from the entire individualized pool of 17 possible stimuli, the pairs of items consisted of only 6 possible classes. To increase the physical variability to minimize any long-term learning effects, there was also a half-JND offset between the possible relevant versus irrelevant item classes. Finally, in half of the trials, a task-irrelevant impulse stimulus, a 50-ms white-noise burst, was randomly presented 2.5 s into the delay period. This impulse stimulus was utilized to tap into the hidden states of WM, as inspired by previous EEG studies (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Rose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>

The signals were filtered between 0.1 and 200 Hz and sampled at 1000 Hz. The position and orientation of the head with respect to the MEG sensor array was recorded continuously with help of four head position indicator coils. To allow co-registration of the MEG and MRI data, the locations of three fiduciary points (nasion and pre-auricular points) that define a head-based coordinate system, a set of points from the head surface, and the sites of the four head position indicator coils were digitized using a Fastrak digitizer (Polhemus) integrated with the Vectorview system. MEG Data were recorded in four 24-minute runs, with 96 trials within each run. The ECG and electrooculography signals were recorded simultaneously to identify epochs containing heartbeats as well as vertical and horizontal eye movement and blink artifacts. During data acquisition, online averages were computed from artifact-free epochs to monitor data quality in real time. All offline analysis was based on the saved raw data. In addition, 5 minutes of data from the room void of a subject were recorded before each experimental session for noise estimation purposes.</p>

SVM is widely used in comparable neuroimaging studies because of its suitability for analyses with relatively small number of samples (&lt; 10,000). Another advantage of linear SVM over other suitable classifiers, such as linear discriminant analysis, is the regularization parameter (known as C in the equation), which helps to adjust or penalize for the large number of features when estimating the cost function in the optimization process (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). SVM can be described as a hyperplane that separates the classes as best as possible. Specifically, we trained a SVM classifier with linear kernel and cost equal to one (<italic><bold>C</bold></italic> = <bold>1</bold>). To increase the impact of the analysis to larger population, we merged the data from all subjects together and performed the classification across the subjects.

These difficulties in finding direct correlations between MVPA and behavioral WM measures may stem from both cognitive (the additional contribution of recall/matching, decision making processes) and neuroimaging signal-processing (e.g., individual variable SNR) confounds. An inherent property of our between-subject connectivity-based SVM analysis, further, is that it outputs only group-level decoding accuracies, which limits correlation analyses to the variability of behavioral performance. Here, to examine the behavioral relevance of our connectivity-based measures, we therefore adapted a different strategy: The relationship between each subject’s proportion correct responses and functional connectivity patters was analyzed during the early (0.5 to 1.25 s) and late (1.25 – 2 s) maintenance time windows using a support vector regression (SVR) implemented in libsvm (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>) and provided in the COSMOMVPA package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cosmomvpa.org/">http://www.cosmomvpa.org/</ext-link>) in MATLAB.</p>

                    <p id="P55">MVPA Connectivity analysis: We used nonparametric permutation approach to test the significance of the accuracy values. First, we created 500 unique permutations of the true labels of the classifier. A null distribution of the accuracy was generated using the training data with randomized item-content labels. This null distribution helped us determine the classification accuracies that emerge by chance with 6-classes. The null distribution was generated for each connection and frequency bands separately. To correct for multiple comparisons across all connections and frequency bands (total 60), we used maximum statistics. We took the maximum value of the null distribution across all 60 tests which provided a final null-distribution. To assign a p value for each connection, the original accuracy value (found from a classifier with true labels) was compared with this null-distribution.</p>

                    <p id="P56">MVPA Power analysis: Similar to MVPA connectivity we followed a permutation approach. We generated a null distribution of accuracies with a classifier with randomized labels. We replicated this process for each subject and averaged the values. This was done separately for each frequency band. Lastly, we took the maximum across 5 frequency bands to correct for multiple comparisons. In addition, to compare decoding accuracies from with and without the impulse sound, we used LME modeling, as implemented using the MATLAB functions fitlme. The best fitting model was selected in a stepwise fashion by using likelihood ratio tests (compare.m): The complexity of the model was increased starting from the simplest possible model, which contained only the intercept and the random effect of subject identity, toward the full factorial model (containing all possible main effects and interactions) until we reached a point where no significant improvement was achieved. In addition to the random effect of subject identity and intercept, the LME analysis considered the fixed effects of Impulse Sound (impulse sound versus no impulse sound), the MEG Frequency Band (represented by each band’s center frequency) that was transformed by base-2 logarithm before the analysis. For the practical implementation, the accuracy values were rescaled by subtracting 1/6. We corrected for multiple comparisons by applying Bonferroni correction across 13 t statistics.</p>

                    <p id="P58">Cortical activation temporal decoding: To assess statistical significances, we used cluster-based statistics with 1,000 permutations, initial alpha value of 0.05 and one-sample t test as test statistics comparing the decoding accuracy against the chance level of 1/6 in whole cortex across all subjects (n = 19). Cluster-based statistics is a nonparametric, permutation-based method (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>) that inherently corrects for multiple comparisons. The cluster statistics was used to compare the decoding accuracy against the chance level during WM encoding, WM maintenance, and impulse sound response.</p>

                    <p id="P59">Behavioral relevance of functional connectivity during WM maintenance: The RMSE values averaged across the four folds were compared to a null distribution, which was accumulated by repeating the same SVR procedure in 1000 permutations with training-set labels (i.e., proportion correct values) being randomly shuffled within each subsample. To manage the multiple comparisons problem, from each permutation, we selected the minimum RMSE across all sub-ROI frequency connectivity pairs, across the early and late time windows, to be entered into the null distribution. The alpha was set to p &lt; 0.05 (two tails): the sub-ROI frequency connectivity patterns whose RMSE value was smaller than in 97.5% of those in the combined null distribution during both the early and late time window were deemed as statistically significant predictors of the behavioral performance.</p>

                <p id="P66">(B) Trial design. After an alerting cue, subjects heard 2 ripple sound stimuli (i.e., memory items) in a row. A brief visual cue then followed, to instruct which of the previous items was to be actively memorized for a period of 4 s. After hearing the probe, the subject was asked to press one button (“yes”) if the probe matched the relevant item and another(“no”) if it did not. In half of the trials, a brief broadband auditory noise burst called “impulse stimulus” was presented during the maintenance period, to help decode item-specific activations.</p>

                <p id="P67">We used an automatic routine to break each large ROI into smaller, approximately equal-size sub-ROIs (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Mamashli et al., 2019a</xref>) to increase the spatial specificity, allowing us to capture the spatio-spectral WM activation variability.</p>
                <p id="P68">(A) Imaginary coherence (ImCoh) was estimated between 9 × 13 sub-ROIs pairs within STC and IFG across each ¼ of the total number of epochs. An example of the ImCoh is shown at right. The ImCoh were averaged in early (0.5–1.25 s) and late (1.25–2 s from memory cue) time windows and each frequency band.</p>
                <p id="P69">(B) The ImCoh value of each sub-ROI pair was used to generate the connectivity matrix. The connectivity pattern matrix was then converted to a vector (e.g., here consisting of 9 × 13 = 117 features) to classify the 6 sound classes. We then combined all subjects’ data, fed them into a linear support vector machine, trained the model on the data from 75% of the subjects and tested it on the remaining subjects. For cross-validation, we permuted the data 100 times and replicated the classification. The accuracy was used as the performance metric.
