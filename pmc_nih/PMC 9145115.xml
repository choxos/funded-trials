                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Cognitive reserve has been hypothesized as a mechanism to explain differences in individual risk for symptomatic expression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Inappropriate medications may diminish cognitive reserve, precipitating the transition from preclinical AD (pAD) to a symptomatic state. To date, there is limited data on the potential impact of medication optimization as a potential tool for slowing the symptomatic expression of AD.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The medication therapy management intervention resulted in significant improvement in Medication Appropriateness Index scores. Overall, there was no beneficial effect of the medication therapy management on Trail Making Test B scores, however stratified analysis demonstrated improvement in Trail Making Test B challenged scores associated with the medication therapy management for those with elevated amyloid β positron emission tomography levels consistent with pAD.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Medication therapy management can reduce inappropriate medication use in older adults at risk for AD. Our study indicated beneficial cognitive effects in those with preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease. No statistically significant effects were evident in the study group as a whole, or in those without preclinical cerebral amyloidosis. Further work designed to improve the effectiveness of the medication therapy management approach and defining other preclinical pathologic states that may benefit from medication optimization are readily achievable goals for promoting improved cognitive health and potentially delaying the onset of symptomatic AD.</p>

              <p><bold>I</bold>t is estimated that about 40% of the risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) may be due to modifiable, lifestyle-based, and medical risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). The biological disease course of AD includes a 10–20-year preclinical period (pAD) during which time amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles accumulate in the brain leading to neuronal injury and loss without apparent cognitive or functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). The time of onset for the clinical signs and symptoms may be dependent on the balance of the underlying pathologic burden and compensatory mechanisms, collectively referred to as cognitive reserve (CR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>).</p>
              <p>While hypothesized modifiable risk factors are numerous, one that been less explored from an intervention standpoint are medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Specifically, those medications shown to increase the risk of ADRD diagnosis, perhaps by compromising CR mechanisms, should be targeted for treatment optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Age-related changes that increase susceptibility to adverse effects of medications include the decrease in renal and hepatic function affecting drug metabolism and clearance, the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and the increase in the brain’s sensitivity to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>).</p>
              <p>Inappropriate medication use in the aging population often leads to polypharmacy and prescribing cascades that result in drug interactions and adverse drug effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). This suggests that inappropriate medications, alone or in combination, might compromise CR, thus leading to an earlier clinical expression of cognitive and functional impairment (i.e., core clinical features of overt ADRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). Older adults at risk for such complications, and who have biomarker evidence for pAD—defined as elevated brain amyloid beta positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr)—CR may be even more vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>The present study was a proof of concept, phase IIa-style, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a multidisciplinary medication therapy management intervention targeting potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults without dementia. We designed the study to test the following hypotheses: (1) the intervention targeting potentially inappropriate medication will optimize medication treatment regimens in older adults without dementia; (2) optimizing medication treatment regimens will augment CR; and (3) the impact of medication optimization on CR will be different based on baseline pAD status (i.e., SUVr ≥ 1.4 vs SUVr &lt; 1.4). We saw the testing of these hypotheses as necessary first steps in investigating the potential for medication optimization to prolong the asymptomatic pAD phase and delay the onset of clinical signs and symptoms of ADRD in this at-risk population. In this manuscript we report results related to the primary outcomes in the INCREASE study.</p>

While we hypothesized that the impact of medication optimization on CR will be different based on baseline pAD status (i.e., SUVr ≥ 1.4 vs SUVr &lt; 1.4), for randomization we chose to further stratify SUVr &lt; 1.4 at SUVr = 1.2 to promote balance between the treatment groups at baseline with regard to amyloid burden.

                <p>Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding was not possible. However, to minimize the effect of the open-label design, medication review at baseline was conducted for all study participants prior to group allocation through randomization, and data analysis was blinded to the intervention.</p>
                <p>Study Intervention: For participants randomized to the intervention, our approach focused on optimizing the individualized risk-benefit balance through a team intervention that actively involved the patient as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>) (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

                <p>Demographic and health history data, as well as detailed information on every medication used by the participant, including prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements were collected during screening and baseline visits. Based on the data available, the study pharmacists provided preliminary prioritized written recommendations with proposed actions for each medication taken by the participant: discontinuation, treatment modification (switch to a safer alternative or dose change), or treatment continuation when medically necessary and appropriate.</p>
                <p>During the intervention, the participant discussed the proposed changes with the pharmacist and the study clinician, and the plan was finalized, centered around the patient’s needs, values, and preferences. The intervention was delivered at baseline to those randomized to the active study arm and was reinforced at 3-month intervals throughout the one-year study intervention phase (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p>
                <p>All study participants, including those randomized to the control group, received educational materials on medication appropriateness and risks of polypharmacy including “Avoiding overmedication and harmful drug reactions” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.HealthinAging.org">https://www.HealthinAging.org</ext-link>), “Ten medications older adults should avoid or use with caution” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.HealthinAging.org">https://www.HealthinAging.org</ext-link>), and “Be an active member of your health care team” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you/be-active-member-your-health-careteam-article">https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you/be-active-member-your-health-careteam-article</ext-link>). No active intervention was pursued by the study team to optimize medicines used in the control group, but participants and other healthcare providers were not restricted in modifying medications on the basis of this information or other changing health conditions and needs throughout the duration of the study.</p>

                <title>Protocol Changes related to the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
                <p>In March 2020, several changes to the protocol were implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a first phase, in-person university-wide non-essential research activities for non-drug interventional studies were suspended with restart planned in a phased manner. During this transition we modified the protocol to allow for remote data collection while maintaining the study windows for each visit. For instance, medication optimization interventions and active data collection on adverse events were switched from in-person to remote using Zoom or telephone, based on each participant’s preference and ability. For evaluations for which remote modalities were not feasible (e.g., cognitive testing, including those under scopolamine challenge), we extended the follow-up until in-person visits could resume. When in-person visits were resumed, COVID-19 screening of symptoms was implemented, along with social distancing, masks, and the use of PPE and plexiglass barriers between the tester and the participant during cognitive testing. Furthermore, we shortened the visit duration to reduce in-person contact with study staff by collecting information that only required reporting rather than active study procedures beforehand over the telephone or televideo wherever possible. We also implemented COVID-19 testing for all staff and participants before entering the clinic with the goal of keeping the clinic a zero COVID zone.</p>

                  <title>Cognitive reserve</title>
                  <p>To evaluate the effect of the medication optimization intervention on CR, the planned analysis was based on the hypothesis that participants would perform the same or worse when tested under the scopolamine challenge; CR would be defined as the difference in TMTB score between the challenged and unchallenged conditions, with the analysis evaluating the difference in CR between baseline and EOS. However, about one-third of participants (non-differentially distributed across treatment groups, SUVr strata, and baseline vs. EOS TMTB scores) demonstrated better scores in the scopolamine challenged testing visit than they exhibited in the unchallenged state 4 weeks later. An explanation for this remains speculative. Because the goal of the intervention was to minimize the difference between challenged and unchallenged TMTB scores observed at study baseline, the unexpected, better performance under the challenged conditions meant that the difference in scores (our measure of CR) could be minimized either by an increase in the challenged score if the challenged score was worse, or a decrease in challenged score if the challenged score was better. Thus, it was not possible to interpret the planned analyses. To address this problem, we restricted these analyses to the data obtained under the challenged conditions at baseline and EOS and did not use the unchallenged data. Using ANCOVA, we set the challenged TMTB z-score at EOS as the dependent variable and included the challenged TMTB z-score at baseline as a covariate. The mean and standard used to compute the TMTB z-scores were taken from a sample of cognitively intact older adult research volunteers (Weintraub et al. 2009; mean = 90.3, SD = 50) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Z-scores were then multiplied by −1 to facilitate interpretation, since higher TMTB scores are worse. We also included pre-specified covariates age, sex, education, baseline MAI, and baseline North American Adult Reading Test (NAART) score.</p>

              <p>These data demonstrate that targeted medication therapy management is both safe and effective in reducing inappropriate medication use in the older adults at risk for AD beyond that achieved pragmatically in routine clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). Despite myriad redundant systems built into modern day electronic health monitoring systems that engage the provider, the pharmacist, and the patient, as well as an increasing awareness of the broad spectrum of potential adverse side effects and drug interactions, a large percentage of the older adult population remain at risk for polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). While the present study used a targeted recruitment design to identify such individuals, it was not difficult to reach our recruitment goals. Participants in our current study required only a single questionable medication to meet enrollment criteria and yet, on average, an INCREASE participant was taking 12 medications, with approximately 2 to 3 inappropriate medications at enrollment despite increasing awareness of issues related to polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). These data are not significantly different from those derived from the general population of older adults in the US that are subject to polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>).</p>
              <p>The Beers’ Criteria list of medications that should be avoided or used with caution in the older adults has provided a framework for assessing polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). This list has been popularized by health care providers with substantive older adult patients and has been updated regularly to reflective a changing pharmacopeia and treatment options for the aging population that are most in need of medical treatment for both acute as well as a chronic healthcare conditions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Despite advances in our knowledge and awareness of such problems, the Beers’ Criteria list has accomplished little in regards to stemming the tide of polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use in the aging population today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). While many clinical intervention programs have been designed to provide oversight and protections against polypharmacy and medication inappropriateness, patient specific interventional programs are few and far between and have not been proven to be superior to standard of care in successfully employed gold-standard, randomized, control interventional trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). The present study represents one of the first high-quality studies supporting an individualized MTM approach to optimize medications in the aging population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>).</p>
              <p>Despite the statistically significant reduction in MAI because of the MTM demonstrated in this study, it is noteworthy that we could not reduce the MAI to zero. There are many reasons why even targeted MTM programs may fall short of their ultimate goals to eliminate all potentially inappropriate medications that deserve discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). These include often limited therapeutic alternatives for some symptomatic disease states, as well as reticence by some prescribers and patients to alter therapy that they do not recognize as problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Many of the reasons for not seeking appropriate alternative therapy that have emerged throughout the course of the trial include the chronic use of such agents irrespective of the recognition and or education of age-related changes in cognitive sensitivity to such medications, renal and hepatic metabolism alterations, and importantly for our pre-dementia patients, a lack of perceived benefit as they continue to maintain function without repercussions of medication inappropriateness in their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Further understanding and education on these critical issues is needed to support widespread changes in health behaviors for both patients and providers are needed to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use in the aging population.</p>
              <p>Yet, for many, the opportunity to have their medications scrutinized in order to reduce the number of pills they take daily appeared to be a pivotal factor that engaged participants in our clinical study. The opportunity to engage in research that takes away medications rather than simply adding another was attractive to our recruited subjects. Balancing such desires with the need for certain medications, including some that may be considered inappropriate in a generalizable sense, yet appropriate for a specific patient’s needs, is going to require further education and engagement of the patient-provider-pharmacist team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>Deprescribing efforts are not without consequence, and potential risks of stopping and or substituting alternative medications can come with many risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). While such concerns should be taken seriously, the present data supports the safety of individualized MTM intervention as none of the SAEs seen in this study were related to study participation. Of the total reported AEs, only 3 were considered to be possibly related to changes in medication as a result of the MTM intervention, and all of these AEs related to changes in medication were mild and resolved with further medication adjustment. These data clearly demonstrate the safety of an individualized MTM approach to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use. The data presented further demonstrate that beneficial cognitive effects can be seen in those with preclinical AD but are not apparent in those without preclinical cerebral amyloidosis.</p>
              <p>Use of a scopolamine challenge to unmask preclinical AD represents a novel approach to interventional trials in the area of pAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). This approach appeared safe and effective in the majority of patients but was not without temporary consequences. While a substantial number of reported AEs, were determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the administration of scopolamine (n=97), including mild dizziness, dry mouth, headache, and temporary slowing of cognition these were all considered mild and resolved with removal of the scopolamine patch. Such adverse events were anticipated to occur, and participants were monitored carefully to ensure safety during the challenged phases of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). The majority of patients performed more poorly on cognitive testing in the challenged vs. unchallenged conditions as anticipated. However, a small subset of patients actually performed better on their cognitive testing, at least on the primary outcome measure of executive function captured by TMTB performance. This paradoxical response to cholinergic challenge was not anticipated, and an explanation for such occurrences can only be speculated. The study coordinator noted that the subjects with such a paradoxical response to cholinergic challenge appeared calmer and more comfortable during the cognitive testing procedure compared to their affective state during testing in the unchallenged condition although the study did not include measures of subjective or objective affective state that might have allowed an evaluation of such a phenomenon. Another possible explanation could be related to state-dependent learning wherein performance on the subsequent unchallenged testing might have been lowered by interference effects of initial testing in an altered state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). It is also possible that the anticholinergic properties of scopolamine contributed to enhanced extrapyramidal motor function allowing improved performance on TMTB which is reliant on motoric performance in addition to executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). This phenomena created statistical problems with the preplanned analysis of a TMTB CRR, and so an alternative approach was employed using an analysis of pre-to-post MTM challenged scores alone in relation to effects of the MTM.</p>
              <p>Detection of pAD using global Aβ-PET SUVr scores allowed stratification of participants into low risk (Aβ SUVr &lt; 1.2), moderate risk (Aβ-PET SUVr between 1.2 and 1.4), and high risk (Ab SUVr ≥ 1.4) groups that were approximately balanced in the cohort studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The present distribution of AD risk is similar to that seen in other studies such as ADNI and the NIH funded A4 study, further supporting prior findings of the frequency of pAD in the aging population to be approximately 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). While our primary analysis of MTM impact on TMTB CR effects failed to reach statistical significance across the combined Aβ-PET SUVr strata, there was a trend for improved cognitive performance on scopolamine-challenged TMTB performance (p=0.068), and consistent with our hypothesis, subgroup analysis using Aβ-PET SUVr cut-offs of 1.4 demonstrated cognitive benefit in the pAD group (SUVr ≥ 1.4; p=0.02). These data support the hypothesis that higher Aβ levels negatively impact cognitive reserve in a meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>Limitations of the present study included a relatively homogenous group of highly educated, predominantly White participants that may limit the generalizability of the findings. While only 10 participants who reported Black or Asian race (11% of the total cohort) were recruited into the study, this relative percentage is comparable to population demographics in our recruitment area (12.5% non-White in Kentucky according to the 2020 US Census). Our choice of a CR challenge using an anticholinergic could also be considered a limitation as neurotransmitter imbalances and or deficits in pAD span many neurotransmitter systems including monoaminergic, glutamatergic, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Our MTM did not focus on reducing anticholinergic burden specifically, but rather targeted all potentially inappropriate medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). As such, it is possible that the cognitive benefits of the MTM in bolstering CR may be much broader than those identified in the current study. Furthermore, our inability to detect an effect of the intervention on the primary cognitive outcome could be explained by the broad range of medications targeted by the intervention and the limited sample size. Our sample size calculation was based on limited preliminary data to estimate a plausible effect size and was further impacted by the cost of performing amyloid PET scans on study participants. Despite its inability to determine whether an MTM intervention can improve executive function on older adults, INCREASE now stands to contribute information about potential effect sizes for cognitive outcomes that could help with the development of future studies.</p>
              <p>Strengths of the current study include an optimized study design that addressed the use of all potentially inappropriate medications, rather than limiting the MTM to specific medication classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). The use of a multidisciplinary clinician-pharmacist team that partnered with study participants, encouraging engagement of the participant in medication related healthcare decisions based on our theoretical model can also be considered a major strength of our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). Operationalizing CR with objective measures of actual performance rather than using surrogate measures such as education is a distinct strength of the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). Importantly, the safety measures incorporated in the protocol ensured participant safety and further provide a framework for the safe implementation of CR challenges that may augment further work in the area of CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). Further work designed to improve the effectiveness of the MTM across the continuum of dementia in persons that may benefit from medication optimization are readily achievable goals for promoting improved cognitive health and potentially not only delaying but also mitigating the symptoms that contribute to functional decline and reduced quality of life in persons with even fulminate AD.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>A multidisciplinary medication optimization intervention can reduce inappropriate medication use for non-demented persons, irrespective of pAD status (SUVr ≥1.4). As hypothesized, some CR benefits were seen in those with pAD, but it remains unclear if the augmentation of CR by a medication optimization intervention can truly delay the onset and or progression of dementia based on the study data. Given the small sample of participants included in the INCREASE study and the importance of this question, larger, multi-site, longer-duration studies with adequate power to evaluate the impact of the medication optimization in pAD are warranted.</p>
