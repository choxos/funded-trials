                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most frequent comorbid medical conditions in pregnancy. Glycaemic control decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the pregnant individual and infant. Achieving glycaemic control can be challenging for Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals who experience a high burden of unmet social needs. Multifaceted provider–patient-based approaches are needed to improve glycaemic control in this high-risk pregnant population. Mobile health (mHealth) applications (app), provider dashboards, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and addressing social needs have been independently associated with improved glycaemic control in non-pregnant individuals living with diabetes. The combined effect of these interventions on glycaemic control among pregnant individuals with T2D remains to be evaluated.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In a two-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the combined effects of a multicomponent provider–patient intervention, including a patient mHealth app, provider dashboard, CGM, a community health worker to address non-medical health-related social needs and team-based care versus the current standard of diabetes and prenatal care. We will recruit 124 Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals living with T2D, who are ≤20 weeks of gestation with poor glycaemic control measured as a haemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5% assessed within 12 weeks of trial randomisation or within 12 weeks of enrolling in prenatal care from an integrated diabetes and prenatal care programme at a tertiary care academic health system located in the Midwestern USA. We will measure how many individuals achieve the primary outcome of glycaemic control measured as an A1c&lt;6.5% by the time of delivery, and secondarily, adverse pregnancy outcomes; patient-reported outcomes (eg, health and technology engagement, literacy and comprehension; provider–patient communication; diabetes self-efficacy; distress, knowledge and beliefs; social needs referrals and utilisation; medication adherence) and CGM measures of glycaemic control (in the intervention group).</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most frequent chronic comorbid conditions in pregnancy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Every year in the USA more than 100 000 pregnancies are complicated by T2D, which is anticipated to double in the next 10 years, affecting 1 in 20 pregnancies.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> T2D increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the pregnant individual, including severe maternal morbidity, caesarean delivery, preeclampsia and severe maternal morbidity, and infant, including large for gestational age at birth, preterm birth and neonatal hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> Inadequate glycaemic control further increases the risk of these adverse outcomes by at least two-fold.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref></p>
                <p>Improving glycaemic control as measured by haemoglobin A1c decreases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 12</xref> Guidelines recommend achieving an A1c target in pregnancy of at least &lt;6.5% to optimise outcomes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Glycaemic control for pregnant individuals with T2D can be achieved with insulin pharmacotherapy, consistent glucose monitoring, lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise and interdisciplinary, team-based diabetes and prenatal care.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Pregnant individuals living with T2D who experience a higher burden of adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) and unmet non-medical health-related social needs (social needs),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> including food insecurity<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and inadequate physical activity,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> are less likely to achieve glycaemic control.</p>
                <p>More than half of pregnant individuals with T2D are insured by Medicaid.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals experience a higher burden of T2D, adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse SDoH.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> Addressing modifiable social needs that affect glycaemic control in this population could improve pregnancy outcomes by addressing maternal health inequity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 21–25</xref> A model that addresses unmet social needs for individuals with chronic comorbidities is the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Pathways Community Hub model.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The Hub model leverages care coordination with community health workers (CHWs) to facilitate social need-related screening and referrals through the use of social needs pathways.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
                <p>Mobile health (mHealth) applications (app) can address health disparities in prenatal access and care due to adverse SDoH.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> mHealth apps are pervasive among reproductive-age female individuals, and &gt;90% actively engage in their use.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> mHealth apps include access to digital information, reminders and convenient communication modes with healthcare providers. Electronic data linked to patients’ mHealth apps can allow the care team to actively engage with patients in their care and help them to achieve treatment goals.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> In addition, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a personal mobile technology that allows identification of precise, individualised patterns of dysglycaemia.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> CGM has been shown to improve glycaemic control and decrease the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes for individuals with type 1 diabetes,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> but its impact among pregnant individuals with T2D remains largely unstudied.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
                <p>Current mHealth apps for diabetes management typically lack user-centred design (UCD) features and are not holistically focused on the combination of addressing unmet pregnancy and social needs, CGM integration and team-based care supported with provider dashboards. Whether an integrated, theory-driven and user-centred intervention can result in improved glycaemic control and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals with T2D remains to be answered.</p>
                <p>The proposed ACHIEVE intervention integrates new and existing technologies to develop an innovative ecosystem, including a mHealth patient app, provider dashboard, CGM device, social needs referrals and team-based care.</p>

                <p>ACHIEVE is a randomised, controlled, single-centre superiority trial to determine whether Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals with T2D enrolled in a multicomponent intervention (mHealth app, provider dashboard, CGM device, social needs referrals and team-based care) will improve glycaemic control compared with those receiving standard prenatal and diabetes care (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Each subcomponent of the proposed intervention is grounded in social cognitive theory (SCT) and aims to address an individual’s skills, knowledge and beliefs and self-efficacy to achieve glycaemic control.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Data management and coordination will occur by an independent team at the clinical site of the ACHIEVE trial and will be led by the study statistician (XP). Participant data will be collected, stored and maintained Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure and confidential data management system. Randomisation by computer-generated random numbers by the study statistician will be performed with a 1:1 non-blinded allocation between intervention:standard care groups. The allocation will be kept in a sealed envelope until the research staff enrols and assigns a participant to a study group. An independent data safety monitoring board will monitor and audit trial conduct, including review of any adverse events, annually during the clinical trial.</p>

Health Impact Ohio CHWs will perform a comprehensive social needs assessment and connect the participant to community resources through Hub pathways.</p>

              <p>In this RCT, we will examine the effect of a multicomponent intervention (mHealth app, provider dashboard, CGM device, social needs referral and team-based care) versus current standard of care for prenatal and diabetes care on glycaemic control, patient-reported outcomes and pregnancy outcomes among Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals with T2D. The ACHIEVE trial brings together multiple technologies in an integrated and theory-driven framework to facilitate comprehensive, tailored, patient-centred and team-based T2D management in pregnancy. If effective, ACHIEVE will advance health equity by addressing the pregnancy and diabetes care needs of a high-risk and underserved patient population.</p>

                <p>ACHIEVE is an intervention to address glycaemic control and consequently adverse pregnancy outcomes and to improve the patient experience among Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals living with T2D. This is an at-risk population that experiences a high burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and inadequate glycaemic control that are related to unmet social needs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> While clinical care is critical, it is insufficient as social needs, such as food security, adequate housing, safe environment and access to healthcare, also impact diabetes and pregnancy outcomes.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The ACHIEVE intervention aims to provide an integrated care ecosystem that incorporates digital communication, education and remote care management to address the structural challenges faced by Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals living with diabetes and poor glycaemic control.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p>

                  <title>Limitations</title>
                  <p>First, this study is non-blinded to providers and patients as they need to be aware of intervention allocation. However, study arm will be blinded to those assessing and analysing the association between the intervention and primary outcome (A1c), including both the laboratory staff and biostatistician. Second, this study is powered for a primary clinical outcome of glycaemic control that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes but is not specifically powered for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Should this intervention demonstrate efficacy for glycaemic control, the next step would be larger clinical trial powered to detect whether adverse pregnancy outcomes can be prevented. Third, this intervention is focused on glycaemic control during pregnancy, and periconception and postpartum glycaemic control are not primarily addressed by this intervention. In the future, this intervention could be expanded to include these critical time periods. Finally, this single-site study is restricted to Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals with T2D and poor glycaemic control. Hence, these findings may not necessarily be generalizable to all pregnant individuals with T2D.</p>

                  <title>Strengths</title>
                  <p>T2D is one of the most frequent chronic comorbid conditions in pregnancy. Medicaid-insured pregnant individuals experience a higher burden of T2D, associated adverse pregnancy outcomes and unmet social needs.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> We aim to develop a scalable model of care that addresses modifiable social needs that directly affect glycaemic control.
