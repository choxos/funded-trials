                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>HIV epidemic is increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, yet HIV testing uptake remains low. As an emerging approach, HIV self-testing (HIVST) has the potential to promote HIV testing coverage and frequency in this population. However, evidence of the effectiveness on implementation of HIVST among Chinese MSM and their sexual partners is scarce.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The randomised controlled trial will be performed in Changsha, Changde, Shaoyang and Yiyang, Hunan province, China, recruiting 184 recent testers (men who had at least one HIV test within the past 2 years) and 26 non-recent testers (men who did not have HIV tests within 2 years or never had an HIV test). Eligible men will be randomly divided 1:1 into two groups: intervention (with free HIVST kits plus site-based HIV testing services) and control (site-based HIV testing services only). Participants in the intervention group will be provided with two free finger-prick-based HIVST kits, and can apply for two to four kits every 3 months for 1 year.</p>
                  <p>Participants in both groups will complete questionnaires via WeChat at five separate times: baseline, third, sixth, ninth and twelfth month. The primary outcome is the mean number of HIV tests for MSM over the 12-month study period. The secondary outcome is the mean number of HIV tests for sexual partners of MSM over the 12-month study period. The tertiary outcomes are the self-reported proportion of consistent condom usage for anal sex, and the numbers of sexual partners during the 12-month study period.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, HIV remains a major public health threat, with a total of approximately 36.7 million individuals infected at the end of 2015.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite great efforts to improve HIV prevention and treatment, the annual number of newly HIV-infected individuals remains around 2.2 million over the past 5 years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Notably, the transmission rate of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) is alarmingly high globally, accounting for 30% of all infected individuals.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> China has also faced a severe HIV epidemic among MSM,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> with the HIV prevalence among MSM increasing nearly nine times from 0.9% in 2003 to 8.0% in 2015,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> and 25.5% of new infections were attributed to MSM in 2017.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) set up the ‘90-90-90’ goal aiming to control the HIV epidemic by 2020, with 90% of HIV-infected individuals getting tested and diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed individuals receiving treatment and 90% of individuals under treatment achieving viral suppression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, only 60% of HIV-positive individuals have been tested around the world,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> far from reaching the first goal. The situation in China is similar. A recent meta-analysis showed that 62% of MSM had not taken an HIV test over the past 12 months, and nearly 50% had never been tested in their lifetime.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Lack of adequate HIV testing services, multiple sexual partners and frequent high-risk sexual behaviours have exacerbated HIV prevalence among MSM and may lead to further transmission to the general population via sexual contacts with female sexual partners.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Moreover, delayed HIV testing and delayed antiretroviral treatment may increase the probability of HIV/AIDS-related deaths.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thus, it is essential to promote HIV testing, especially among MSM.</p>
              <p>As a complementary approach, HIV self-testing (HIVST) has significant potential to scale up HIV testing coverage. It can be used by individuals to collect specimens (their own blood or saliva), perform a test and read the test results by themselves.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> With the characteristics of convenience, privacy and confidentiality,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref> HIVST may be very attractive to MSM who are impacted by HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination; limited transportation; and/or reluctance to wait when taking the test at the traditional sites, such as the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), sites of voluntary counselling and testing services for AIDS and hospitals.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A recent review indicated that HIVST kits had high acceptability (&gt;67%) among MSM of the 14 included studies,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> not specific to oral fluid based or blood based. However, the usage rate of HIVST kits among MSM was low in certain countries, with reported rates of 3.5% in France, 6.1% in China and 11.6% in the USA.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref> The barriers to use included worry about a positive result, the relatively high cost of kits and concerns about correct usage of the kits.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
              <p>Data released by UNAIDS (2017) underlines that reaching MSM and their partners with HIV testing services may have the potential to control the HIV epidemic.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In the USA, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that the availability of HIVST could increase HIV testing uptake among MSM.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A previous RCT in Australia also indicated that HIVST could increase the HIV testing frequency among MSM, especially in delayed testers (those who had never received HIV testing or had not been tested within 2 years).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Moreover, a previous US study showed that 79%–91% of MSM were willing to distribute HIVST kits to their sexual partners.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Serostatus disclosure to their regular or casual sexual partners after testing with HIVST kits would promote safe sexual practices if the testing results were positive.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> Thus, distribution of HIVST kits from MSM to their sexual partners could be an effective way to expand HIV testing and reduce high-risk sexual behaviours among MSM.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref></p>
              <p>In accordance with this strategy, a guideline on HIVST was issued by the WHO in 2016 to promote HIV testing and partner disclosure.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, in the guideline, there was only evidence from two RCTs to support the effectiveness of HIVST kits for improving HIV testing frequency among MSM.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Further research is urgently needed to determine the effects of providing free HIVST kits to MSM and their sexual partners in China.</p>

                <title>Study objectives</title>
                <p>This RCT is designed to determine whether the distribution of HIVST in an intervention group compared with a control group improves the frequency of HIV testing among MSM (primary aim) and their sexual partners (male and female) (secondary aim). The study also aims to explore whether HIVST reduces high-risk sexual behaviours of MSM (tertiary aim). Outcomes will be compared between participants in the intervention and control groups who have histories of recent and non-recent HIV testing.</p>

                <title>Study settings</title>
                <p>This study will be conducted in four cities within Hunan Province, namely Changsha (the capital of the province), Changde, Shaoyang and Yiyang. The settings include urban and rural areas. Delivery services of free HIVST kits are unavailable through any organisations in these cities. HIV prevalence in Hunan Province ranks ninth nationally in mainland China.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The number of patients with HIV/AIDS in Hunan Province was about 24 000 in 2016, with 4974 newly infected.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Notably, 64.8% of the new patients were infected through male-to-male sexual intercourse.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In our unpublished cross-sectional study, 37.7% of MSM had never tested for HIV in Hunan Province.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Two subgroups of MSM will be recruited: recent testers (men who had at least one HIV test within the last 2 years) and non-recent testers (men who did not have HIV tests within the last 2 years or never had an HIV test). Zuo An Cai Hong, a gay-friendly community-based organisation (CBO), with seven sublocations in the participating settings of Hunan Province, will collaborate in this study. The CBO provides rapid HIV tests, counselling and referral for MSM, and it conducts around 1500–2000 HIV tests each year. Thus, the feasibility of the study recruitment is supported.</p>

For participants’ convenience, these kits can be obtained at study sites or through express delivery. With 24 hours’ notice, the kits will be delivered in private packages without any information about HIV/AIDS or testing visible on the packaging. To encourage MSM to send back the photos of their results, participants will be charged a 30¥ (the equivalent of US$5) deposit for each kit, which will be returned immediately after the RA receives the result photos. Each kit will be numbered sequentially on the outer packing before distribution for monitoring purposes. In addition, MSM can also purchase HIVST kits online if they need more than four kits every 3 months.</p>

An account with <italic>sojump</italic> will be set up, and the password will only be accessed by the RAs. Participants in the intervention and control groups will receive and complete the questionnaires via WeChat five times, at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups.</p>
                <p>The content validity of the baseline questionnaire was obtained by expert review (including two experts from CDC, two experts on clinical psychology and one expert on HIV/AIDS prevention and control). Included in this questionnaire are items related to social-demographic information, HIV testing history (number of HIV tests, test results and reasons for site-based HIV tests/self-tests), partner testing history (number of tests with HIVST kits distributed by MSM and site-based HIV tests recommended by MSM, test results and number of sexual partners refusing to test) and high-risk sexual behaviour history (number of sexual partners, number of and reasons for condomless oral or anal sex), during the past year and last 3 months. Two previously pilot-tested items assess HIV testing self-efficacy (Cronbach’s α=0.74) with statements about confidence in HIVST and confidence in regular HIV testing (every 6 months). Response choices are based on a 10-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1=not at all confident to 10=completely confident.</p>
                <p>The follow-up questionnaires, to be administered at 3-month intervals, include items from the baseline measure evaluating HIV testing, partner testing, high-risk sexual behaviour during the past 3 months and self-efficacy for HIV testing. In addition, data will be collected from men in both groups about the sources of obtaining HIV self-test kits, such as from our study, online purchase or their friends. Participants who report positive or uncertain results on HIVST will be asked whether they have linked to care for confirmatory laboratory HIV test and antiretroviral treatment.</p>
                <p>At the 12-month follow-up, participants will also be asked questions about their experiences with self-testing and their willingness to use HIVST kits in the future. Compensation (US$16 per person) will be provided to participants for their time spent after filling out the questionnaires each time.</p>
                <p>If any follow-up questionnaires have not been completed, we will remind participants via WeChat and/or text messages three times at intervals of 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the questionnaires have been sent.</p>

              <p>The HIV epidemic is rapidly growing among MSM,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> yet HIV testing uptake remains far below the recommended level in China and other countries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 9</xref> Due to diverse socioeconomic status, the coverage of site-based HIV testing services differs by country and region. As a complementary approach, HIVST has the potential to expand availability of basic HIV testing services and broader HIV testing coverage.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> However, HIVST has not been widely used around the world.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> One of the main reasons is lack of enough rigorous evidence on the implementation of HIVST to promote HIV testing, which will aggravate the concerns for potential hazards of HIVST without supervision.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>
              <p>This study is designed to explore the effectiveness of free HIVST kits availability on increasing HIV testing frequency among MSM in a resource-limited country, as previous RCTs have been performed only in developed countries.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Several types of HIVST kits have been approved by China’s regulation department.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, there are no relevant policies for use and regulation of the self-testing kits. China is exploring strategic approaches to integrate HIVST with site-based HIV testing services. This RCT study target<bold>s</bold> both recent testers and non-recent testers and HIV testing frequencies for the latter group are far below the recommended level. If successful, the study will provide evidence for policymakers to scale up the HIVST approach to reach more high-risk individuals. The evidence from this study could also be used to develop tailored and contextualised HIV prevention strategies for Chinese MSM.</p>
              <p>A major innovation of this study is to determine the effects of distribution of HIVST kits from MSM to their sexual partners on enlarging HIV testing coverage. HIV-positive MSM who were infected through regular or casual sexual partners accounted for an increasing proportion of newly infected individuals.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Although partner testing (encouraging MSM to bring their partners to have HIV tests) has been recommended by WHO since 2012,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> few data are available to assess the implementation of this policy.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The approach of self-testing has the potential to improve partner testing for HIV due to its convenience and privacy. However, to our best knowledge, there is no study reporting the effectiveness for partner testing with distribution of free HIVST kits among MSM in China. Evidence from this study will help to guide the application of HIVST kits to promote partner testing and scale up HIV testing coverage.</p>
              <p>The major challenge of this study is to maintain our participants for 12 months. Previous longitudinal studies reported about 18% of participants were lost to follow-up among MSM in China.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> To address this problem, we will enlarge the sample size by 20%, and contact participants every 3 months by asking them to fill out the follow-up questionnaires. Moreover, data from the sequenced follow-up evaluations could demonstrate dynamic changes in HIV testing frequency, and high-risk sexual behaviour, which may expand understanding about implementation of HIVST among MSM and their sexual partners.</p>
              <p>This study has several limitations. First, participants must have a rapid HIV test (only HIV negative individuals will be enrolled) at recruitment settings prior to entering the study, which will exclude some MSM who live far from study settings or are concerned about stigma. Second, free HIVST kits will be provided, and thus the result cannot be generalised directly to the community, where HIVST kits are not free or may be expensive. Third, finger-prick-based testing kits will be used, so the results may not apply to oral-fluid-based kits. A fourth limitation is that data about sexual partners’ use of HIVST kits will be obtained indirectly by report of MSM without direct verification. A final limitation is that the sample of non-recent testers is small (n=26) which may limit generalisability for this group.</p>
