                  <p>This community-based randomized clinical trial found that the visitation program was implemented with 76% penetration and 90% adherence to the protocol, leading nurses to address minor problems for 52% of families and connect an additional 42% to community resources. Analyses of interviews and administrative records indicated that families assigned to the intervention had more community connections, fewer cases of maternal anxiety or depression, and fewer investigations for child abuse.</p>

                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial, births were randomly assigned to receive FC or treatment as usual. Independent evaluation was conducted through parent interviews and review of health and child protective services records. Interviewers were blind to the experimental condition of participants, and participants were blind about the purpose of the interview as an intervention evaluation. A total of 936 consecutive residential births at Duke University Hospital from January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2014, were included. Data were analyzed preliminarily for reporting to funders in early 2015 before all birth-record covariates were scored and were analyzed more comprehensively in mid-2019 after administrative birth and child protective service records became available.</p>

                  <p>The goals of the FC brief universal program were to assess family-specific needs, complete brief interventions, and connect families with community resources. Community agencies and families were aligned through an electronic data system.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 936 births, 451 infants (48.2%) were female and 433 (46.3%) were from racial/ethnic minority groups. In all, 456 births (46.5%) were randomized to the intervention and 480 (53.5%) were randomized to the control. All analyses were based on intention to treat. The impact analysis included 158 intervention families and 158 control families. Intervention penetration was 76%, adherence to the protocol was 90%, and independent agreement in scoring (κ) was 0.75. Nurses identified and addressed minor problems for 52% of families and connected an additional 42% to community resources. Analysis of the primary outcome of child abuse investigations revealed a mean (SD) of 0.10 (0.30) investigations for the intervention group vs 0.18 (0.56) investigations for the control group (<italic>b</italic> = −0.09; 90% CI, −0.01 to −0.12; 95% CI, −0.18 to 0.01; <italic>P</italic> = .07). The intervention group’s rate of possible maternal anxiety or depression was 18.2% vs 25.9% for the control group (<italic>b</italic> = −7.70; 90% CI, −15.2 to −0.1; 95% CI, −16.6 to 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = .09).</p>

                  <p>This study indicates that a nurse home visitation program for families of newborns can be implemented by a community agency with high penetration and quality. Other communities could benefit from wider dissemination of the program provided that quality remains strong and evaluation continues.</p>

              <p>Home visitation programs promoting healthy development in early childhood have proliferated based on promising empirical evidence.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The federal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home-Visiting (MIECHV) Program<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> allocates $400 million annually to programs with positive impact demonstrated through randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Simultaneously, the field is challenged by failures to replicate findings when university-developed programs are implemented by community agencies, known as the <italic>scale-up penalty</italic>. The need for studies of implementation and impact of intervention in community settings is one of the highest priorities in medicine.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The study we report here evaluated implementation and impact of the MIECHV-approved Family Connects (FC) program during its community dissemination following a university RCT.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The FC program is a systems-based approach to supporting families at birth by combining engagement and alignment of community resources with voluntary home visits for all families of newborns, including brief interventions, assessments of family needs, and connections to community resources to meet family-specific needs.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Trained nurses offer mothers one to several home visits for support, clinical assessment, and referrals, as needed. They use motivational interviewing techniques to help families clarify needs in each of 12 empirically based risk domains and to facilitate referrals to community agencies. A community specialist aligns service agencies and makes available to nurses an annotated directory that includes service description, eligibility criteria, fees, and waiting lists. Agencies include formal service providers (eg, substance abuse, maternal depression, parenting support); government and nonprofit programs (eg, housing assistance, childcare subsidies); and paraprofessional parent support groups. An integrated electronic data system documents visits, family needs, and outcomes of referrals to community services. The FC program is unique among MIECHV programs in emphasizing population impact, short-term duration, and low cost (about $500 per family).</p>
              <p>A university-based RCT yielded 5 sets of empirical findings.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190560r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> First, the program penetrated a high proportion of the population. Second, the program was implemented with high fidelity. Third, the program achieved its proximal goal of connecting families with community services. Fourth, intervention-assigned families displayed more positive parent mental health and parenting behaviors at age 6 months than control parents. Fifth, hospital records at ages 6 months and 12 months showed that intervention-assigned infants accessed less emergency health care than control infants.</p>
              <p>Following the first trial, FC began dissemination to communities across the country.<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Concern about possible scale-up penalties on program implementation and impact motivated an RCT of FC when implemented by a community agency. After the first trial, the administration of FC in Durham, North Carolina, transferred to a local nonprofit entity. Funding was provided by county government, Medicaid reimbursement, and philanthropy. Hiring and supervision of nurses and implementation of the program was administered by the local community agency. This study tested 5 assertions undergirding the logic of FC: (1) FC can penetrate a large proportion of the birthing community; (2) FC can be delivered with high quality; (3) families assigned to FC will become more connected to community resources; (4) families assigned to FC will demonstrate better parent mental health and parenting; and (5) families assigned to FC will have lower rates of investigation for child maltreatment and better infant and maternal health care participation and outcomes.</p>

                <p>All procedures were approved by the Duke Medicine institutional review board. Written informed consent was required of intervention and control participants for outcome evaluation data collection. Intervention families were required to provide consent to participate in the intervention and to allow access to intervention implementation data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190560f1">Figure 1</xref> provides the CONSORT flow diagram of participants through the trial. From January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2014, of the 977 hospital discharge records that were examined, all 936 county resident births at Duke University Hospital constituted the possible population for assignment to intervention. This sample size was determined based on minimal size needed to detect hypothesized effects. Identical to the design of the first FC RCT,<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> random assignment to intervention was based on date of birth. Intervention staff members at a community agency attempted to deliver FC to all 456 odd-date births. The 480 even-date births were not approached for FC and instead received treatment as usual (the reverse of the prior trial). Implementation performance was evaluated for the 456 odd-date births.

                <p>Implementation followed a detailed manual<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> that included 3 major components. The first was direct intervention with a family beginning in the birthing hospital and continuing with 1 to 3 postpartum home visits. A nurse assessed and scored family need for intervention for each of 12 key domains assessed during home visits: parent health, infant health, medical home, child care planning, parent-infant relationship, management of infant crying, material supports, family violence, mother’s past experience of maltreatment, maternal depression and anxiety, parental substance abuse, and parental social support from others. Risk for each domain was scored on a 4-point scale: 1 for no risk; 2 for risk that is addressed by a brief intervention; 3 for significant ongoing risk that requires a connection with a community resource to resolve; and 4 for an emergency requiring crisis intervention. For domains scored as 2, the nurse attempted prescribed brief interventions. For domains scored as 3, the nurse facilitated a connection to a community resource for ongoing intervention. The second component of intervention was alignment of community resources to serve families at birth through an electronic directory of agencies. The third component was an integrated data system that documented all services and assessments.</p>
                <p>To examine impact of random assignment to intervention, a research assistant blind to experimental condition and unaffiliated with the community agency solicited written informed consent to participate in a research study of infant development, consisting of a single in-home interview at age 6 months (range 4-8 months). These families were blind to the goal of evaluating an intervention. Of the 456 odd-date births, 302 were located and confirmed as eligible (based on Durham residency at age 6 months), and 185 (61% of eligible) completed interviews. Of the 480 even-date births, 303 were located and confirmed as eligible residents, and 182 (60%) completed interviews. For the 15 families with twins, 1 member of each pair was randomly excluded from analysis. Administrative data indicated that 51 families had participated in FC for a prior birth (intervention and control conditions), and these families were excluded from analysis. The final sample included 316 infants (158 intervention and 158 control).</p>
                <p>Measures of FC penetration and quality were taken from case records. Baseline covariates for consenting families were collected from hospital discharge records, and measures of intervention impact were taken from parent interviews and administrative records.</p>

                <p>Records documented the number of families who initiated FC participation and the number who completed the program. Adherence to the manualized protocol was assessed by having an independent expert accompany the nurse on a home visit for 19 randomly selected families and check adherence to each model element. Reliability of scoring of risk between the nurse and the expert was measured by Cohen κ,<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which corrects for chance agreement. Clinical records were inspected to score (1) the proportion of families with at least 1 identified need and referral to a community agency (scored as 3 for any of the 12 domains of need); and (2) the proportion of families with identified needs for whom community services were initiated within 1 month after referral. Family consumer satisfaction with the experience of FC was measured during a follow-up telephone call 1 month after case closure. The interviewer asked the parent whether they found the experience helpful (scored 1) or not (scored 0).</p>

State administrative records were examined for all consenting participants for the period from birth through age 24 months to code the number of documented investigations for maltreatment per infant. Reports could also be coded as “substantiation” if proof of maltreatment was documented, but no cases were so coded (primarily owing to a reform that referred cases to clinical services instead of prosecution and therefore did not code documentation as substantiation), so the substantiation variable was not tested.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial found that when implemented by a community agency, the FC program achieved a high level of penetration to the full population of birthing families with a high degree of fidelity to the program model. It achieved its proximal goals of identifying family needs, responding to those needs with high parental satisfaction, and connecting families to community resources for major needs. Families randomly assigned to FC had 44% lower rates of investigation for child maltreatment by child protective services. The FC-assigned families had more connections to community resources and better mental health. Not all analyses confirmed program goals or met statistical significance criteria, indicating the need for caution and continued evaluation of this program as it is disseminated to new communities.</p>
              <p>As a public health program aiming for population impact, the first goal of FC is to reach as many families giving birth as possible. The community agency was able to reach about as many families as had been reached in the university trial with similar follow-through to program completion, despite forces cited by Welsh et al<sup><xref rid="zoi190560r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> that would otherwise promote degradation. The second goal of FC is to deliver the program with high adherence and fidelity to the manualized protocol. The community agency was able to reach similar quality as exhibited in the university trial.</p>
              <p>The third goal of FC is to identify and respond to clinically assessed family needs with connections to community resources. Nurses were able to identify needs and respond through brief interventions or connections to community resources, and have those connections continue for at least 6 months at rates that were similar to those in the prior trial. This function might be called primary psychosocial care, similar to the primary health care function served by pediatricians. Well-baby pediatric health care is universally delivered, assessments are completed, modest interventions respond to clinically identified needs, and referrals are made to specialists when warranted. The FC intervention is a step toward a new system of universal primary psychosocial care for families of newborns.</p>
              <p>The primary hypothesis guiding this study is that if the FC program can reach most families with high quality and connect them to community supports, then impact will be observed on rates of child maltreatment. We found positive impact on lowering official rates of child maltreatment investigations, by 44%.</p>
              <p>It was secondarily hypothesized and found that the FC program had a positive impact on maternal mental health, replicating the previous trial. In contrast with the previous trial, there was no impact on parenting behavior or nonparental care. Further scrutiny is necessary to understand whether subtle degradation in the aspect of the program related to parenting behavior occurred and could be corrected or the generalizable impact on parenting behavior is fragile. The impact of the FC program on infant and maternal health care utilization was mixed. As birth risk increased, assignment to FC was associated with fewer emergency department visits and more hospital overnights. This pattern was not hypothesized, nor was it found in any other trial, and it may not be reliable. Finally, assignment to FC was associated with higher maternal emergency department visit rates, possibly reflecting greater attentiveness by mothers to their own health needs as a function of FC.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has some limitations. The findings of this study highlight both replicated and nonreplicated effects of the FC program when implemented by a community agency. One limitation of the study is that it occurred in only 1 community; thus, it will be important to conduct additional studies with new communities, contexts, and populations. Another limitation is that the active ingredients and mediational processes through which the intervention has impact were not tested and are left to further inquiry. A third limitation is that the evaluation was conducted by the same team of investigators that evaluated the first trial; independent evaluators should be identified for future trials.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This trial indicates that it is possible to transfer delivery of a university-based universal postnatal nurse home visitation program to community leadership while maintaining high program penetration, quality, and impact. The FC program substantially reduced child maltreatment investigations through the first 24 months of life. We recommend continued dissemination of this public health program in new communities when accompanied by ongoing implementation evaluation and, when possible, impact evaluation.</p>
