                <p id="P3">Recently, mRNA-expression signature enriched in LSCs was used to create a 17-gene leukemic stem cell (LSC17) score predictive of prognosis in adult AML. By fitting a Cox-LASSO regression model to the clinical outcome and gene-expression levels of LSC enriched genes in 163 pediatric participants of the AML02 multi-center clinical trial (<related-object id="RO1" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" source-id="ClinicalTrials.gov" source-id-type="registry-name" document-id="NCT00136084" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number">NCT00136084</related-object>), we developed a 6-gene LSC score of prognostic value in pediatric AML (pLSC6). In the AML02 cohort, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients within low-pLSC6 group (n=97) was 78.3 (95% CI=70.5–86.9%) as compared to 34.5(95% CI=24.7–48.2 %) in patients within high-pLSC6 group (n=66 subjects), p&lt;0.00001. pLSC6 remained significantly associated with EFS and overall survival (OS) after adjusting for induction 1-MRD status, risk-group, <italic>FLT3</italic>-status, WBC-count at diagnosis and age. pLSC6 formula developed in the AML02 cohort was validated in the pediatric AML-TARGET project data (n=205), confirming its prognostic value in both single-predictor and multiple-predictor Cox regression models. In both cohorts, pLSC6 predicted outcome of transplant patients, suggesting it as a useful criterion for transplant referrals. Our results suggest that pLSC6 score holds promise in redefining initial risk-stratification and identifying poor risk AML thereby providing guidance for developing novel treatment strategies.</p>

              <p id="P4">Resistant and relapsed disease remain the most prevalent forms of failure in both pediatric and adult AML. Persistence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) is a primary cause of AML relapse(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). LSCs are also associated with drug resistance. Thus, there is an unmet and urgent need to identify and quantify LSCs to predict prognosis and improve risk classification in AML.</p>
              <p id="P5">Recently, Ng et al, 2016(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) identified 48 genes that were over-expressed in LSC enriched cell population (LSC positive) as compared to LSC-negative cell fractions. A sparse Cox model regression analysis of the mRNA expression of 43 of the 48 LSC enriched genes with survival data from adult AML patients was used to develop and validate a 17-gene stemness score (LSC17) that was predictive of outcome in adult AML patients(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">The LSC17 was developed using adult outcome data and though the LSC enriched genes may overlap between adult and pediatric AML, the prognosis of pediatric AML is typically much better than that of adult AML(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this study, we applied the regression modeling to the mRNA expression of LSC enriched genes and outcome data for the multicenter pediatric AML02 clinical trial (<related-object id="RO2" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" source-id="ClinicalTrials.gov" source-id-type="registry-name" document-id="NCT00136084" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number">NCT00136084</related-object>(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)) and developed a six-gene LSC score for pediatric AML (pLSC6). We confirmed the predictive power of pLSC6 in a separate cohort of pediatric AML patients with publicly available data from the pediatric AML TARGET project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/target-publication-guidelines">https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/target-publication-guidelines</ext-link>).</p>

Details of study design and clinical outcome were described elsewhere(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Patients with t[8;21], inv[16], or t[9;11] chromosome abnormalities were classified as low-risk AML. High-risk AML classification included presence of −7, <italic>FLT3</italic>-ITD mutation, t[6;9], acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), treatment-related AML, or AML arising from MDS. Absence of low or high-risk group features was classified as standard-risk AML. Patients were randomized to receive high (3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, given every 12 h on days 1, 3 and 5) or low dose (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given every 12 h on days 1–10) cytarabine along with daunorubicin and etoposide as a first course of chemotherapy with subsequent treatment tailored to response and risk classification. MRD positivity was defined as one or more leukemic cell per 1000 mononuclear bone-marrow cells (i.e., ≥0.1%). Event free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from study enrollment to induction failure, relapse, secondary malignancy, death, or study withdrawal for any reason, with event-free patients censored on the date of last follow-up. OS was defined as the time from study enrollment to death, with living patients censored on the date of last follow-up(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). St. Jude Institutional Review Board approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians and consents/assents from the individuals.</p>

The MAS 5.0 algorithm was used to obtain normalized gene expression signals. All the gene expression data was log<sub>2</sub> transformed before analysis. For the validation cohort, we downloaded publicly available RPKM (Reads per kilo base of transcript per million mapped reads data from TARGET database. We included 205 patients from AAML0531 and AAML03P1 clinical trials with gene expression data available from diagnostic specimens (RNAseq data from specimen obtained at relapse were not included in this analysis). We used log2(RPKM+1) values for subsequent statistical analysis, it should be noted that TARGET dataset was enriched for patients with poor outcome.</p>

Among the 48 LSC enriched genes previously identified by Ng and colleagues(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), 32 were represented in the AML02 U133A microarray expression data set. We fit a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model, as implemented in glmnet package of the R3.4.1 statistical software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</ext-link>), to the expression of 32 genes and the event-free survival data of the AML02 study. LASSO regression penalizes the data fitting criteria in a way that eliminates less informative predictor variables to yield simpler and more interpretable models. To evaluate the variability and reproducibility of the LASSO Cox regression model estimates, we repeated the LASSO Cox regression fitting process for each of 1,000 leave-10%-out cross-validation evaluations. We chose to retain genes with non-zero coefficient estimates in at least 950 of these 1,000 evaluations. For each of these genes, the final model coefficient was the average of the coefficient estimates obtained for the set of cross-validation evaluations. We further utilized recursive partitioning survival model, as implemented in the rpart package, to dichotomize pLSC6 scores into “low” and “high” score groups to simplify reporting and graphing the association of pLSC6 with survival outcomes.</p>

Six genes were identified as important in at least 950 of 1,000 leave-10%-out cross-validation replications of this analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This rigorous model-development process defined a six-gene pediatric LSC score (pLSC6) which was computed for each patient using gene expression weighted by the regression coefficients as defined in the equation pLSC6 = (DNMT3B x 0.189)+(GPR56 × 0.054)+(CD34 × 0.0171)+(SOCS2 × 0.141)+ (SPINK2 × 0.109)+(FAM30A × 0.0516).</p>

Recursive-partitioning Cox regression model was used to dichotomized pLSC6 with patients classified into low-pLSC6 score group (n=97 patients, 60%) or high-pLSC6 score group (n= 66 patients; 40%).

Nevertheless, pLSC6 provided additional prognostic information beyond that available from these two factors widely used in clinical practice. In the AML02 cohort, the five-year EFS was 80.8 ± 4.6% in MRD- patients with low-pLSC6 score; 58.8 ± 11.9% in MRD+ patients with low- pLSC6 score, 55 ± 11.1% in MRD- patients with high-pLSC6 score, and 24.1 ± 6.4% in MRD+ patients with high-pLSC6 scores. A Cox model with dichotomized pLSC6 score and MRD as predictors found that high-pLSC6 score is associated with a 2.67-fold increased rate of EFS failure (95% CI= 1.48- 4.81, p = 0.001) and 3.31-fold increased rate of death (95% CI = 1.58- 6.97, p = 0.0015) relative to low-pLSC6 score in the AML02 cohort holding MRD constant. A similar model found high-pLSC6 score associated with a 2.38-fold increase in EFS failure rate (95% CI = 1.64–3.46, p &lt; 0.0001) and 2.72-fold increase in death rate (95% CI = 1.71–4.36, p &lt; 0.0001) in the TARGET cohort. <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows EFS and OS in both AML02 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>) and Target cohorts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>) by pLSC6 and MRD status.

              <p id="P24">Unique properties of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) such as quiescence, self-renewal and chemo-resistance contributes to relapse and treatment failure in AML patients. Though efforts for identification and quantification for LSCs has been a prime area of research to advance AML treatment strategies, this is still not used in clinical setting(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Recently Ng et al(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), defined and validated prognostic value of a leukemic stemness score derived from expression levels of 17 genes (LSC17) score in adult AML patient cohorts(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This LSC17 signature demonstrated potential for risk stratification and identification for high risk adult AML patients. A follow-up study in the pediatric AML cohort- ELAM02, with the assumption that pediatric and adult LSCs share common gene expression programs further demonstrated prognostic value of LSC17(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Future studies directed towards generation of gene-expression profiles in fraction of pediatric CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>−</sup> LSC cells is warranted to further refine the gene-expression score specific to pediatric AML.</p>
              <p id="P25">Given that cure rates with standard intensive chemotherapy vary between pediatric vs. adult AML patients(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) in the present study, we utilized the genes reported to be enriched in the LSC+ cell fraction(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and applied regression model against event free survival (EFS) in a pediatric AML cohort-AML02, the model-generation cohort. A six-gene LSC score of prognostic significance to pediatric AML was defined and designated as pLSC6. pLSC6 though had different coefficients as compared to the original LSC17 score equation, shared 4 genes DNMT3B, GPR56, CD34 and SOCS2 with LSC17. Two new genes, SPINK2 and FAM30A were part of the pLSC6 score. Of these genes DNMT3B codes for DNA methyltransferase B and its prognostic and biological significance has been previously established in adult AML(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and recently our results demonstrate its prognostic value in pediatric AML(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Specifically, we have shown that DNMT3B methylation levels correlate with its expression levels which was further associated with global methylation burden of leukemic cells. Further, we observed that DNMT3B expression, methylation and genome-wide methylation burden was significantly associated with survival in pediatric AML(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). GPR56, a G protein coupled receptor has been established as a novel LSC marker and high-GPR56 levels have been shown to associate with poor clinical outcomes in AML patients(<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). GPR56 has been also been associated with HOXA9 induced leukemeogenesis(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) as well as is a marker of EVI1-high-AML(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Among other genes, CD34 a cell surface antigen is a marker for hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. SOCS2 codes for suppressor of cytokine signaling-2, which negatively regulates cytokine signaling and has been associated with poor outcome as well as poor risk group features in pediatric children’s oncology group AAML03P1 cohort(<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). SPINK2, codes for a serine-proteinase inhibitor Kazal-type 2, its role in AML or cancer is not yet established. However, high SPINK2 expression has been reported in leukemia cell lines and it is speculated that SPINK2 potentially interacts with cancer related proteinase essential for tumor progression(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). FAM30A is an RNA gene affiliated with a non-coding RNA and at present its role in AML is not known.</p>
              <p id="P26">We acknowledge that generation of enriched gene expression profile from pediatric LSC would be most appropriate for developing pediatric specific score. Nonetheless evaluation using previously reported list of LSC enriched genes and statistical rigor, our results demonstrate prognostic value of pLSC6 score driven by expression levels of 6 genes in prediction of induction 1 MRD, EFS and OS in two independent pediatric AML patient cohorts. It should be noted that despite Target cohort being enriched in poor performing AML we observed consistent and significant association of pLSC6 with outcome. Further pLSC6 score holds prognostic value in redefining high and low risk AML patients who are currently assigned to the standard risk group category. This will be a significant step forward in developing treatment regimens for poor performing standard-risk group patients based on pLSC6 scores. MRD levels hold- significant prognostic implication in AML and are being used for risk stratification of patients after initial response to chemotherapy(<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, limitations associated with its routine use include the lack of standardized methods for MRD detection, precise timing for determination of MRD, and well-established universally defined thresholds. Our results show that a pLSC6 not only predicts MRD status post induction 1 but also provides prognostic value beyond MRD status and initial risk group classification, which are the two most commonly used methods utilized for monitoring response. Our results further suggest that risk stratification using pLSC6 can identify patients within high-pLSC6 score category who are less likely to benefit from transplant and thus may be candidates for investigational therapies.</p>
              <p id="P27">In summary, we believe that pLSC6 score generated specifically using outcome data from pediatric AML holds promise in redefining initial risk stratification and identifying poor risk AML. pLSC6 score enhances clinical utility by reducing the panel of genes without losing the effectiveness of the predictive power thus providing potential for developing guidance for developing novel treatment strategies.</p>
