                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Is tele-delivered behavioral activation (tele-BA) treatment by bachelor’s-level lay counselors for older adults who are depressed and homebound with low income clinically effective?</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi200581-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial with 277 participants, tele-BA by lay counselors and tele-delivered problem-solving therapy by licensed clinicians were significantly more effective than telephone support calls in improving depressive symptoms, disability, social engagement and activities, and satisfaction with participation in social roles. Tele-BA was significantly less effective than tele-delivered problem-solving therapy in reducing depressive symptoms, but there were no differences in other outcomes.</p>

                  <p>This 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of 15 or greater between February 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019. Tele-BA and tele-PST participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills.</p>

                  <p>The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, ≥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD &lt;10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The number of older adults who are disabled and homebound is increasing. Of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, 8.3% were chronically homebound between 2011 and 2017, and 26.2% were at rapid risk of becoming homebound over the 7-year period.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Older adults who are homebound (three-quarters of whom are women and one-third of whom are not White) tend to be socioeconomically disadvantaged.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In addition, their rates of depression are 2- to 3-fold higher than their nonhomebound peers.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> While pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for geriatric depression, its effectiveness is especially low for these older adults, as it does not address their multiple life stressors that are depression risk factors.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Pharmacotherapy has also been found inadequate for treating older adults with persistent depressive disorder with cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative comorbidities.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our previous randomized clinical trial (RCT)<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> found that brief, videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) delivered by licensed clinicians was highly effective for older adults with low income who were depressed and homebound. However, given geriatric mental health workforce shortages, a more scalable approach to improving access to depression treatment for these older adults could be to deploy lay counselors.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Lay counselor interventions have been found effective for depression prevention and treatment in other countries.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Lay counselors, also known as <italic>psychological well-being practitioners</italic>, are critical to the stepped care model of the UK’s National Health Service’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies program.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the US, bachelor’s-level lay counselor–provided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was as effective as PhD-level expert–provided CBT for older adults with generalized anxiety disorder.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="zoi200581r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Behavioral activation (BA) is the most widely used lay counselor–provided depression treatment, as its simpler approach compared with more complex treatment modalities (eg, CBT) is well suited for lay counselors without professional mental health training.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> A large RCT in the UK<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> compared BA delivered by mental health workers without professional training in psychotherapy with CBT delivered by psychotherapists and found that BA was not inferior to CBT in depression, anxiety, and physical health outcomes, while costs were lower and quality-adjusted life-year outcomes were better.</p>
              <p>In this RCT, we tested the clinical effectiveness of a brief, videoconferenced BA (tele-BA) delivered by bachelor’s-level counselors for older adults with low income who were depressed and homebound. Tele-BA was compared with tele-PST delivered by master’s-level clinicians and an attention control (AC) consisting of telephone support calls by research assistants. All interventionists were embedded in a large aging service agency that provides home-delivered meals and case management for older adults who are disabled. The rationales for integrating depression treatment in an aging service agency were that aging service case managers are well situated to identify depression because of their close and supportive contacts with older adults who are homebound and that coordinating depression treatment and case management is necessary for older adults with low income who tend to have multiple comorbid health, financial, and other life stressors.</p>
              <p>Study hypotheses were that both tele-BA and tele-PST would be more effective than AC at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline, resulting in lower depressive symptoms (primary outcome), and lower disability, higher social engagement and social activities, and higher satisfaction with social roles (secondary outcomes) and that tele-BA would be less effective than tele-PST, but both would result in clinically meaningful outcomes in terms of response and remission rates and effect sizes.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to test the effectiveness of aging service–embedded tele-BA by lay counselors for older adults with low income who are homebound. This analysis could have significant implications for training the geriatric mental health workforce in a rapidly aging society and improving access to depression treatment for growing numbers of older adults who are homebound.</p>

                <p>In an RCT design with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>), a random assignment sequence generated by the project’s biostatistician (C.N.M.) was used to assign referred, potentially eligible individuals into 3 RCT groups prior to screening: (1) five 1-hour weekly sessions of tele-BA, (2) five 1-hour weekly sessions of tele-PST, or (3) five 30- to 45-minute weekly AC telephone support calls (to control for any social interaction effect). Five sessions meet the PST’s 4-session minimum dose.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Most of the participants in our previous tele-PST study were able to master training content in 4 to 5 sessions.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p>
                <p>All participants received home-delivered meals and case management services as usual and 2 monthly booster calls. To reflect real-world practice, the tele-BA, tele-PST, or AC interventionist assigned to work with the participant conducted an in-home baseline assessment 1 week prior to treatment or AC calls. Following the baseline assessment, tele-BA and tele-PST participants received tele-delivery equipment (a secure laptop with a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant videoconferencing platform and a 4G wireless card) plus instructions and all written session materials (for psychoeducation, handouts, and worksheets). Only a few participants had their own computers or internet service.</p>
                <p>Trained assessors conducted follow-up assessments at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline, mostly at participants’ homes, with a few exceptions (eg, telephone assessments for participants no longer residing in the area at time of follow-up). Blinding of treatment conditions was not possible, as we also assessed treatment acceptability for tele-BA and tele-PST participants. However, assessors were not informed of study hypotheses. No tele-BA or tele-PST participants dropped out during treatment owing to dislike of or disagreement with treatment modalities or sessions, but a few participants were terminated during the intervention phase owing to a long-term hospitalization or hospice admission. In total, 25 participants (9.1%) were not assessed at 12 weeks, 48 participants (17.3%) were not assessed at 24 weeks, and 55 participants (19.9%s) were not assessed at 36 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi200581f1">Figure 1</xref>). Attrition rates did not significantly differ by treatment condition. There were no trial-related adverse events.</p>

Before working with participants, lay counselors, one with a bachelor’s degree in social work, the other with a bachelor’s degree in communication, received a 50-hour didactic training in depression, BA, and care coordination and practiced tele-BA sessions with 3 older adults who were homebound and depressed under the supervision of a licensed clinical social worker (L.S.). The licensed clinical social worker also provided clinical supervision and fidelity monitoring of 20% of all sessions during the intervention phase.</p>

Linear mixed models were estimated using maximum likelihood under the missing at random assumption. Models included the pretreatment assessment of the outcome as a covariate and a random intercept for participants (ie, time points were nested within participant). All follow-up assessments were included as outcomes. Prior to entering treatment effects in the models, we fit the following models to establish an unconditional growth model: (1) an unconditional time (ie, no time variables) model that contained only the mean-centered baseline assessment of the outcome, (2) a linear time model, (3) a quadratic time model, and (4) a natural log time model. The unconditional growth models were compared using Akaike information criterion values to determine which unconditional growth model was the best fit to the data. Models whose Akaike information criterion was lower than a comparison model by 2 or more were substantially better models.<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>

In addition to the primary models, we examined age at baseline as a covariate and the treatment group by age interaction but found no significant effect. As an additional sensitivity analysis, we fit the final models using log-transformed values of the outcomes and found an identical pattern of significant effects. In the final models, mean estimates across all follow-ups were computed and pairwise differences between the conditions were estimated (ie, AC vs tele-BA, AC vs tele-PST, and tele-PST vs tele-BA) using estimated marginal means implemented with the R <italic>emmeans</italic> package<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> to obtain model-predicted mean differences.

                <p>At the 12-week follow-up, tele-PST participants had the highest response rate (51.8% [95% CI, 40.7% to 62.7%]), followed by tele-BA participants (32.1% [95% CI, 22.4% to 43.2%]) and then AC participants (12.0% [95% CI, 6.6% to 21.0%]) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Remission rates were significantly higher in the tele-BA (29.8% [95% CI, 20.3% to 40.7%]) and tele-PST (35.3% [95% CI, 25.2% to 46.4%]) groups (<italic>P</italic> = .52) compared with AC participants (9.6% [95% CI, 4.9% to 18.2%]) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Assessment of longitudinal models based on the intent-to-treat approach indicated that the unconditional time model did not differ from models containing time parameters with the exception of the HAMD model, which exhibited a significant negative linear effect for time (<italic>t</italic><sub>463</sub> = −2.43; <italic>P</italic> = .02), indicating a linear decrease in HAMD scores between the 12- and 36-week assessments. Despite the linear time effect, we present the HAMD model without a time parameter for consistency of presentation. Sensitivity analyses indicated that treatment main effects were consistent in models with and without time. The unconditional time model pools the 3 follow-up assessments so that treatment group differences represent the mean group difference across all follow-up assessments.</p>
                <p>Compared with participants in the AC group, participants in the tele-BA and tele-PST groups had significantly reduced HAMD scores across all follow-up assessments (tele-BA: estimate, –3.56 [95% CI, –5.09 to –2.03]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; tele-PST: estimate, –5.72 [95% CI, –7.23 to –4.20]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Scores for WHODAS scores across all follow-up assessments were similarly reduced among the tele-BA and tele-PST groups compared with the AC group, and scores for SEAQ and SPSR were significantly increased (<xref rid="zoi200581t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The findings of this RCT suggest that that lay counselors can deliver evidence-based treatment with fidelity to achieve clinically meaningful changes in depression, disability, and activity levels, with the effects persisting at 36 weeks, among older adults with low income who are homebound. Although tele-BA participants’ HAMD score reduction at follow-up was 2 points less than that among tele-PST participants, the 0.62 effect size for tele-BA compared with AC is an impressive outcome, especially since AC participants also experienced some symptom reduction, likely owing to caring social interactions for these socially isolated older adults. This effect size compares favorably to that found in a meta-analysis of 27 psychotherapy trials for late-life depression (0.73 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.95]).<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> The 30% remission rate among tele-BA participants also compares favorably with the rate of remission found in a meta-analysis of 51 double-blind RCTs of antidepressants vs placebo for older adults (33.7% vs 27.2%).<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, there was no evidence that the effects of tele-BA significantly differed from those of tele-PST on secondary outcomes. As noted, almost two-thirds of participants had persistent depressive disorder, which tends to be resistant to pharmacotherapy. These positive outcomes show that tele-BA or tele-PST could be offered in combination with or in lieu of pharmacotherapy.</p>
              <p>These findings are important given high rates of depression among increasing numbers of older adults who are homebound, which in turn contribute to further physical and mental deterioration and higher health care costs. Especially with the tragic sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 in nursing homes,<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> the number of older adults who are homebound is likely to increase more rapidly in the future.</p>
              <p>One strength of this study is that participants were racially/ethnically diverse, reflecting the increasing diversity among older adults in the US population. Along with shortages of licensed mental health professionals, older adults who are depressed, homebound, and members of racial/ethnic minority groups and have low income face even more barriers to accessing psychotherapy than their peers who are more socioeconomically advantaged, as they often lack transportation. In-home psychotherapy is rarely available. Given these challenges in providing depression treatment to older adults who are at increased risk, aging service–integrated tele-BA by lay counselors is a viable option. During routine screenings, aging service case managers are best situated to identify depression and refer older adults to treatment. Older adults with low income also need case management and other supportive services along with depression treatment, given the many stressors they face owing to limited financial resources and multiple health problems. The Older Americans Act<sup><xref rid="zoi200581r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> stipulates funding for aging-service agencies to provide mental health services directly or to purchase these services. This funding may be used to employ bachelor’s-level mental health workers who can expand the reach of mental health services for older adults at increased risk who are not being adequately served by the existing mental health service systems.</p>
              <p>Tele-delivery is also necessary because travel costs associated with in-person sessions are significant barriers to treatment scalability and sustainability. The combined costs of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant videoconferencing platform, which was minimal for each participant, and hot spot internet connection for those without an existing internet connection are significantly less than travel time and mileage reimbursement for interventionists. Therefore, tele-delivery is less resource intensive than in-person delivery regarding travel times and economies of scale (ie, higher interventionist-to-client ratio).</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has some limitations, one of which is that all participants resided in a single, large metropolitan area, which may limit generalizability of the findings to non-metropolitan areas. Another limitation is the lack of a longer (ie, beyond 9 months) follow-up period.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This RCT found that the effects of tele-BA by lay counselors for older adults who were housebound with low income compared favorably with the effects of tele-PST delivered by licensed clinicians. Faced with licensed mental health clinician shortages, tele- and lay counselor–delivered services have potential for easy replication and sustainability and can improve access to evidence-based depression treatment for large numbers of underserved older adults.</p>
