                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of infants in the USA. Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis are at high risk for recurrent respiratory symptoms and wheeze in the subsequent year, and longer-term adverse respiratory outcomes such as persistent childhood asthma. There are no effective secondary prevention strategies. Multiple factors, including air pollutant exposure, contribute to risk of adverse respiratory outcomes in these infants. Improvement in indoor air quality following hospitalization for bronchiolitis may be a prevention opportunity to reduce symptom burden. Use of stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units is a simple method to reduce particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), a common component of household air pollution that is strongly linked to health effects.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">BREATHE is a multi-center, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Two hundred twenty-eight children &lt; 12 months of age hospitalized for the first time with bronchiolitis will participate. Children will be randomized 1:1 to receive a 24-week home intervention with filtration units containing HEPA and carbon filters (in the child’s sleep space and a common room) or to a control group with units that do not contain HEPA and carbon filters. The primary objective is to determine if use of HEPA filtration units reduces respiratory symptom burden for 24 weeks compared to use of control units.

                  <title>Study rationale</title>
                  <p id="Par55">Acute viral bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization of infants less than 2 years of age in the USA, with ~ 130,000 admissions per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of bronchiolitis is between 18 and 32% in the first year of life and between 9 and 17% in the second year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Children hospitalized for bronchiolitis are at high risk for shorter-term (recurrent respiratory symptoms and wheeze in the subsequent year) and longer-term (persistent childhood asthma) adverse respiratory outcomes for which there are no effective secondary prevention strategies. The majority of hospitalizations for bronchiolitis (78–87%) occur in children &lt; 1 year old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], among whom bronchiolitis constitutes 18% of all hospitalizations. In these children &lt; 1 year old, there may also be higher risk of recurrent wheeze and development of asthma relative to older children hospitalized with bronchiolitis.</p>
                  <p id="Par56">The early life event of the first episode of severe (hospitalized) bronchiolitis may be a critical time point to implement prevention strategies to reduce respiratory symptom burden in this high-risk population. Multiple factors, including environment, contribute to risks of adverse outcomes. Indoor air pollution is a known modifiable environmental risk factor for respiratory conditions, and improvement of IAQ following hospitalization for bronchiolitis may be a prevention opportunity to improve health outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par57">Numerous treatments have been evaluated to prevent symptoms and longer-term respiratory effects in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but no effective strategies have been identified to date. Observational studies have repeatedly indicated that the environment, and air pollution in particular, is an important target for intervention with decades of research showing that air pollution adversely impacts respiratory health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Infants are particularly susceptible to respiratory impacts of air pollution because their lungs are not fully developed; they have a high respiratory rate, and their intake of air relative to bodyweight is greater compared to adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In healthy infants, associations have been observed between exposure to higher air pollution and increased risk of respiratory symptoms following respiratory tract infections as well as respiratory infections that are longer in duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In its 2021 policy statement, “Ambient air pollution: health hazards to children,” the American Academy of Pediatrics highlights the role of air pollution in respiratory diseases, lung development, and asthma incidence and the importance of reducing these harmful exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par58">Fine particulate matter (particulate matter &lt; 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) is one of the air pollutants most strongly and consistently linked to health effects. Ambient sources include traffic, industry, and wildfires. Examples of indoor sources include outdoor PM2.5 that has infiltrated appliances, woodstoves, and pets. Infants, on average, spend approximately 90% of their time indoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As a result, it is critical to maximize the quality of indoor air.</p>
                  <p id="Par59">Portable air cleaners (PACs) effectively reduce PM2.5 concentrations in indoor air, with the vast majority of studies indicating reductions of at least 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. PACs are appealing as interventions because they are commercially available and can be universally implemented. PACs do not disrupt home infrastructure and do not require specialized expertise or medical prescription. HEPA is a type of filter in a PAC that is highly efficient in removing PM2.5. In interventional trials, use of HEPA filters has been associated with improvement in respiratory outcomes such as asthma in children and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. Specifically, HEPA filtration resulted in improvements in pulmonary function and asthma control test scores and decreases in asthma-related healthcare visits and symptom scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In a recent study of HEPA efficacy in former smokers with COPD, those assigned to the active filter group, relative to placebo, had greater reduction in respiratory symptoms and a lower rate of moderate exacerbations and rescue medication use after 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par60">In summary, air pollution is associated with respiratory symptoms and disease, particularly in sensitive populations, including infants. Air pollution is, therefore, a key intervention target. HEPA filters are efficacious in cleaning the air and improving multiple indicators of health. To date, however, no clinical trial has tested the efficacy of HEPA filtration units in increasing symptom-free days (SFDs) in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Our study aims to address this important gap and improve the health of infants who have experienced this severe and common respiratory event.</p>
                  <p id="Par61">Reduction in these symptoms may lead to decreased healthcare utilization and improve QOL for a large population. The current bronchiolitis care guidelines lack recommendations for post-hospitalization symptom reduction. If effective, HEPA filtration intervention can help fill this gap.</p>

                  <title>There is a high burden of respiratory sequelae for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis</title>
                  <p id="Par63">In addition to the recognized morbidity and mortality associated with the acute infection, children often experience subsequent, recurrent respiratory symptoms with a high burden of symptomatic days, especially children who are less than 12 months old. Furthermore, 30–40% of children who are hospitalized for bronchiolitis progress to have recurrent episodes of wheezing with or without lower airway infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There is also an increased risk of these children developing asthma compared to children without a history of bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with 30–50% of these children developing asthma by 5 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Data suggest that the airways can be affected into adulthood, resulting in an increased incidence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in those with a history of infantile bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing in this age group also impact QOL. Domains that are negatively impacted include overall health, discomfort, and physical abilities of the child, and parental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The frequency of other respiratory illnesses, respiratory symptoms, and the parental impacts of increased anxiety and associated medical costs is also increased in families with a child who has bronchiolitis and recurrent wheeze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Bronchiolitis is a heterogeneous disease in both presentation and later childhood outcomes, but post-acute recurrent respiratory symptoms are a common element</title>
                  <p id="Par64">The case definition of acute bronchiolitis is based on clinical criteria. The American Academy of Pediatrics’ definition of infectious bronchiolitis includes children under the age of 2 years with “a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs including a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is recognized heterogeneity of the disease presentation and outcomes. For example, most infected children are not admitted to the hospital, and only a small percentage require intensive care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Also, time to recovery varies from several days to persistent symptoms past the duration of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Several conditions other than infections can present with wheezing in this age group, so there is confusion in the literature as several terms have been used interchangeably, such as reactive airway disease or infantile asthma or wheezy bronchitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, there appears to be a dose–response relationship between the severity of the infectious episode and risk of recurrent wheeze as infants with bronchiolitis who are hospitalized are at increased risk for recurrent wheeze and asthma compared to those not hospitalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The viral load (based on quantitative analysis of genomic material in secretions) trends with the severity of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These data support the notion that reducing insults to the respiratory tract might have a long-term impact on airway health. Even though cases of bronchiolitis are heterogeneous, cases of bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization of <italic>any</italic> severity are a risk factor for recurrent respiratory symptoms and asthma.</p>
                  <p id="Par65">A number of infectious agents are associated with bronchiolitis. The most commonly identified pathogens are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), although there are several other infectious agents, including influenza, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and uncommonly, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> that can cause bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Both the long-term sequelae and presentations of bronchiolitis appear to vary among agents, although there is significant overlap, including increased risk of recurrent respiratory symptoms in the subsequent year and increased preschool asthma risk. RSV (the most common etiology in infants less than 1 year of age) tends to present with more severe illness, increased risk of respiratory failure, and longer hospitalization than RV but may be associated with a lower incidence of longer-term wheezing and asthma compared with RV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. RV, in turn, tends to have a milder course than RSV but the subsequent development of asthma that persists later in childhood is more common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. It is unclear if the long-term consequences of bronchiolitis (recurrent wheezing or asthma) occur because of a genetic predisposition or as a result of damage to the airways from the initial or repeated infections, and what role household environment may play in exacerbating these factors. Certainly, the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, regardless of infectious agent, could lead to long-term airway damage since the virally induced process causes airway inflammation and plugging from cellular necrosis and mucous. For safety reasons, it is impractical to sample small airway specimens from infants who have fully recovered from the acute infection to study the structural or cellular mechanisms accounting for repeated episodes of wheezing or asthma. Evidence for long-term pathologic changes can be extrapolated from a rat model of RSV bronchiolitis where airway inflammation and cellular debris in the acute phase of infection precede a prolonged period of airway remodeling with airways scarring, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and mucosal thickening. In this animal model, there are also increased numbers of eosinophils. These changes would implicate both structural narrowing and cellular- or cytokine-mediated sensitization to foreign antigens as mechanisms of wheezing post-recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Environmental exposures, including indoor air quality, influence respiratory health and are unstudied targets for prevention of recurrent respiratory symptoms after bronchiolitis</title>
                  <p id="Par66">Because there are no effective treatments for viral bronchiolitis and long-term effects can be serious and/or burdensome, disease sequelae prevention is important. Interventions that reduce the risk of recurrent wheeze and other respiratory symptoms after the initial episode can immediately affect the burden of illness on the child, family, and healthcare system. Interventions that disrupt harmful interactions among the host, subsequent respiratory viruses, and the environment might also impact the risk and severity of wheezing illness in the very young, and the long-term risk of airway damage and asthma. One preventative measure to reduce respiratory symptoms widely supported in the literature is avoidance of air pollution. Predisposition to bronchiolitis appears to increase with exposure to environmental air pollution from either outdoor or indoor sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Numerous studies show a clear contribution of indoor air pollution to childhood lung disease, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Of the six air pollutants regulated by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA), particulate matter (PM) is most frequently identified in causing or worsening conditions such as COPD, asthma, cardiovascular events, and infections in adults, and low birth weight, asthma, and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children. Similarly, methods of lowering both short- and long-term exposure lessen the ill effects of PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. PM decreases are associated with improved health outcomes in children with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. PM has various components depending on the source, including elemental carbon, semi-volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals, all of which have oxidative potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. PM also can contain antigenic particles from animal dander, mites, cockroaches, and mold spores, among others, each of which can provoke airway sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. PM is also a major component of tobacco smoke with a separate set of components, but still with major health impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The type of PM most frequently associated with health impacts is particulate matter &lt; 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), which travels deep into the lungs and into the circulatory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Sources of indoor PM2.5 include infiltration of ambient PM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], as well as biomass combustion (from indoor or outdoor sources). PM2.5 generated from biomass combustion has a high percentage of carbonaceous material, which also has pro-oxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. An extensive body of research indicates that it is the small size of these particles that is most important to respiratory health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Unless removed, PM2.5 can persist in the air for extended periods of time.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">A reliable method for decreasing PM2.5 in residential environments is portable air-cleaning units containing HEPA or HEPA-type filters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Most studies show reductions of 50% or greater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, larger-sized airborne particulate matter, such as pollen and dust, is also effectively cleared by HEPA filters. HEPA filters have greater than 90% removal efficiency for airborne particles from multiple sources between 0.001 and 10 microns in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In addition to a HEPA filter, the proposed system for this study, the Winix 5500–2, also contains a carbon filter, which removes gaseous pollutants including nitrogen dioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], a combustion-generated pollutant and respiratory irritant.</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Filter efficacy in removing particles, especially PM2.5, from the air has been demonstrated convincingly, but what is also clear is that the unit needs to be turned on for it to work. Filtration units that are too noisy or consume too much electricity may be unsustainable long term. We have selected the Winix 5500–2 for this study because it is relatively quiet, energy efficient, and with demonstrated efficacy in lowering PM2.5 concentrations.</p>
                  <p id="Par69">We will measure home levels of PM2.5 in this study because it is a main component of indoor air pollution with a clear relationship to respiratory symptoms. It is the most likely component of indoor air pollution to be related to respiratory symptoms. PM2.5 is expected to be present in all homes, which is not true for all other types of air pollution. With the development of low-cost and easily installed sensors, it is now feasible to continuously measure and remotely monitor PM2.5 in homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. In addition to HEPA filters, the filtration units used for this study’s intervention will also be equipped with carbon filters, a common component of stand-alone commercially available HEPA filtration units. Carbon filters may reduce exposure to non-PM indoor air pollutants, including NO<sub>2</sub>, thereby potentially enhancing the air-cleaning benefit of filtration units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Therefore, users of HEPA units additionally equipped with carbon filters may experience respiratory benefit even if PM2.5 is ultimately not the main or only factor driving symptoms.</p>
                  <p id="Par70">Although it is beyond the scope of this protocol, children in this study may be followed longer term to determine whether this intervention reduces asthma rates or improves asthma outcomes. It is plausible that reducing respiratory symptom burden in early life, improved air quality in early life, or both can decrease childhood asthma rates after bronchiolitis.</p>

                  <title>Summary</title>
                  <p id="Par71">Bronchiolitis and respiratory sequelae can cause lasting health and cost consequences with no currently identified effective secondary prevention. Accordingly, secondary preventive measures might significantly reduce the incidence of recurrent respiratory symptoms and long-term pulmonary consequences such as asthma. Indoor air pollution, specifically PM, affects airway health and is associated with childhood respiratory diseases. Therefore, this is a reasonable prevention target. However, it is unknown whether an intervention to reduce indoor air pollution can effectively reduce symptoms and improve symptom-free days among infants with severe bronchiolitis. Because HEPA filters reliably decrease these components of household air pollution and are easy and cost-effective to use, we propose to study HEPA filtration to decrease respiratory symptom burden in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.</p>

                  <title>Overall design</title>
                  <p id="Par101">This is a multi-center, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Two hundred eighteen children &lt; 12 months old with their first hospitalization for bronchiolitis will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by site) to receive 24 weeks of home intervention with active HEPA filtration units to improve IAQ or to a control group without a HEPA or carbon filter inside identical-appearing units. Children will be followed for respiratory symptoms during a pre-intervention period of up to 2 weeks following randomization and during an intervention period of 24 weeks.</p>
                  <p id="Par102">This study is designed to reduce barriers to participation for rural participants in that there will be no required study visits to a distant study site, and all study activities and data collection will be conducted remotely. Participants will be identified in hospitals in ISPCTN states, maximizing the chances that rural and medically underserved populations are represented. It is common for rural children with bronchiolitis to be transferred to tertiary care centers in urban/suburban locales, so inclusion of urban hospitals will allow for recruitment of this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is important for rural children to be represented in a bronchiolitis study in order to increase generalizability. Rural and underserved children have a higher risk of decreased access to medical care for symptoms and illness episodes, and a higher burden of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. These families may have air pollutant exposure profiles distinct from those residing in urban areas. For example, they might experience less exposure to traffic-related pollutants but may have more wood stove use or exposure to agricultural pollutants or wildfires. With its diversity of sites, the ECHO ISPCTN is well-positioned to enroll rural children that might otherwise be excluded.</p>

                  <title>Scientific rationale for study design</title>
                  <p id="Par103">We propose a parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) as the most scientifically robust design to determine the efficacy of HEPA filtration in improving the number of SFD over 24 weeks following hospitalization for bronchiolitis. We considered two alternative study designs to increase acceptability of an inactive filtration unit: randomized crossover and stepped wedge. Parallel, crossover, and stepped wedge designs each allow for a control or placebo group, which is critical as there is genuine uncertainty regarding the efficacy of the intervention in reducing SFDs in the 6 months following hospitalization for bronchiolitis. The parallel design is distinct from the other two in that homes randomized to the control arm will not receive the intervention during follow-up.</p>
                  <p id="Par104">Both the crossover and stepped wedge designs are appealing in that they allow all participants to receive an intervention that we expect will improve IAQ. However, with a crossover design, it is critical that the participant’s disease characteristics are the same at time zero of each time period. Since the eligibility for this study is based on hospitalization for bronchiolitis, there is no way that can be achieved. Moreover, the relevant time window of exposure, washout duration, and appropriate point in time to crossover is unclear. Although an early benefit of HEPA filtration is possible, the intervention may be more effective over a longer duration rather than the immediate period post-hospitalization, which would require a lengthy study.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">The stepped wedge is a variant of an interrupted time series design in that a site starts in the control arm and switches over to the intervention arm at a specific point in time. While participants may be blinded, staff are not, so this might be difficult to implement.</p>
                  <p id="Par106">We considered a 1-year study intervention period. However, due to family burden, risk of missing data, and risk of nonadherence to the intervention over such a long duration, we ultimately decided that a 24-week intervention targeting the time period of highest respiratory burden was preferable. Although a 1-year study period is appealing due to capturing potential variability in air quality (heating season, etc.) and viral exposures (cold seasons), the severity of respiratory symptoms is not static in rapidly growing infants, and most of these children will be recruited in the same seasons and have similar opportunity for repeat viral exposures and heating seasons between the groups.</p>
                  <p id="Par107">We considered including children up to 2 years of age (per the definition of bronchiolitis). However, the under 12 months age group has the highest symptom burden and likelihood of demonstrating an effect.</p>
                  <p id="Par108">We chose the primary outcome of symptom-free days because assessing the number of wheezing episodes alone can underestimate the burden of chronic symptoms (including cough) and prolonged symptoms with illness episodes. In addition, clinically it can be difficult to determine the discrete number of wheezing episodes for children with prolonged or chronic wheeze (which is a higher risk in this population).</p>
                  <p id="Par109">The KidsAir study at the ISPCTN Montana site successfully implemented and completed a study similar in design to the one we propose here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The proposed study benefits from methods used in the KidsAir study, lessons learned, and the study team’s expertise. Although the current study population is different from that of the KidsAIR study, the KidsAIR study targeted for intervention the same exposure to PM2.5 as the current study using the same method, namely HEPA filtration, and collected similar covariate data successfully over two winters of study participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In the KidsAIR study, field technicians visited homes approximately six times per winter season. Data collection procedures were more burdensome for participants and more frequent than those proposed here; however, participant retention in the other study was still 87% in the first year of the 2-year KidsAIR study. The current study requires a relatively shorter duration of study participation (6 months versus 2 years) and less burdensome procedures for outcome ascertainment that do not require participating families to accommodate home visits by field technicians.</p>
                  <p id="Par110">The HEPA unit intervention will take place over the approximately 6 months after hospitalization because this period is when the majority of post-bronchiolitis respiratory symptoms occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The intervention involves the placement of two HEPA units within the home. The rationale for the placement of one HEPA unit in the child’s sleep space is that infants typically spend a continuous number of hours daily in this space. The rationale for placement of a second HEPA unit in a common area of the home is to increase the child’s exposure to the intervention during waking hours.</p>

                  <p id="Par128">We will exclude homes with smokers to maximize our ability to determine the efficacy of the HEPA intervention in increasing SFDs. Multiple studies have demonstrated efficacy of HEPA filtration units in reducing non-nicotine particle-bound components of tobacco smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. However, we propose to exclude households with a smoker because even if HEPA filtration units reduce tobacco smoke components in the home, the secondhand smoke (SHS) exposures the child experiences with the smoker outside of the home (e.g., in the car) may be sufficient to reduce or eliminate any health benefits of the indoor HEPA unit. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 studies showed that passive smoke exposure is a major risk factor for lower respiratory tract infections and, in particular, bronchiolitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], as well as increased respiratory symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In addition, infants who live with a smoker may be exposed to more sources of SHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The exclusion of homes with smokers is consistent with the majority of RCTs that have evaluated the impact of portable air cleaners on health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par129">We acknowledge that excluding children living in households with a smoker will reduce the number of eligible participants. Nonetheless, including children from households with a smoker may increase sample size requirements if the intervention is less efficacious in smoking households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. We emphasize that the proposed trial is an efficacy study. Our primary objective is to determine if HEPA filtration increases SFDs in children hospitalized for bronchiolitis under ideal circumstances. There is genuine uncertainty regarding this research question. Although smoking may be more prevalent in IDeA states, the percentage of homes with children and non-smokers is still clearly the majority, making the study still generalizable to a very large population of children with bronchiolitis.</p>
                  <p id="Par130">If the intervention is efficacious, a next step would be to evaluate if these findings are generalizable to other populations, including children living in households with a smoker.</p>

                  <p id="Par134">Recruitment and retention of eligible participants will be critical to study success. Within a multi-center network, optimal recruitment approaches may vary from site to site, and network success may require sharing best practices among clinical sites. Though each clinical site is responsible for recruiting, enrolling, and retaining study participants, the Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) will assist each site in creating a site-specific recruitment and retention plan. Site initiation visits will include a review of the individual site’s recruitment and retention plans. All recruitment and retention materials, general and site-specific, must be approved by the IRB of record, which for all sites except Native American sites will be the UAMS IRB.</p>

                    <p id="Par135">Eligible children will be identified during a primary hospitalization for bronchiolitis. We will request a partial waiver of consent/HIPAA for the recruitment screening portion of the study, i.e., to allow sites to review medical records for potentially eligible participants that meet minimum inclusion criteria. This partial waiver will be required to reach the appropriate study population.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par136"><italic>Screening</italic>. Local sites will obtain a daily list or receive notification of admissions to their pediatric units with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis (of the days where the research team is available). This information will be obtained in accordance with individual institutional policies and procedures as well as IRB approval from the IRB of record. For non-Native American populations, the UAMS IRB (as central IRB), will be the IRB of record.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par137"><italic>Recruitment</italic>. Each potential participant on the list should be approached for recruitment if the child meets eligibility criteria from prescreening their medical record.

                    <p id="Par138">Screening and enrollment ideally will occur during hospitalization, but enrollment can occur after discharge to home <italic>if the family can receive and set up the air quality monitoring equipment within 7 days of discharge.</italic> Other procedures can occur at home. Day of hospital discharge is defined as day 1.</p>
                    <p id="Par139">If an eligible child is readmitted within 1 week of discharge to home from the initial hospitalization, this can be considered part of the same hospitalization and timeframe to obtain the consent (if not already done). The start of study activities resets to begin after the second discharge to home.</p>
                    <p id="Par140">If a potential participant appears to meet eligibility requirements (i.e., based on pre-screening assessment) but declines participation, the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be asked why they do not want to participate. These data will be recorded in a screening log without any identifiers that could link responses back to an individual or family. The individual/family will be told they do not have to answer any questions they do not want to answer.</p>

                    <title>Action if recruitment is low/risk mitigation plan</title>
                    <p id="Par141">Methods for screening and recruitment at individual sites will be reviewed to determine if there are gaps in offering the study or other factors leading to low recruitment. Sites will submit recruitment data (number of bronchiolitis admissions, number approached, number consented, reason for declining the study) to the DCOC every 2 weeks. Individual site action plans may be made to improve recruitment.</p>
                    <p id="Par142">Using data from nine ISPCTN sites, we observed 3209 admissions for bronchiolitis in infants less than 12 months of age during the 2019–2020 season. We estimate that we will have a minimum of 10–14 sites in this trial. Therefore, we will have a population of approximately 3500–5000 infants hospitalized from bronchiolitis to recruit from per year. Given that the recruitment period for this study is estimated at 2 years, we should have 7,000–10,000 eligible infants during the study period in our recruitment sites. Assuming a conservative recruitment rate of 20% would give us 700–1000 infants, which is far greater than the recruitment targets for this trial. Additional sites could be added to the trial if recruitment falls short, as the ISPCTN has 18 awardees, some with multiple available recruitment sites.</p>

                    <p id="Par143">Some studies reported decreased HEPA filtration unit usage over the course of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Study participants indicated noise and electricity costs as reasons for turning off the filtration unit or using it below the recommended setting. To address these challenges, we selected a filtration unit model that emits low decibels and has low electricity demands. A similar unit was used in the KidsAIR study. Evaluation of kilowatt (kW) meter data in KidsAIR indicated strong compliance with filtration unit usage recommendations. In addition, we will compensate participating families for electricity costs. Our intervention period of 6 months is favorable for adherence relative to a year(s)-long intervention. Additionally, coordinator contacts will provide problem-solving strategies and support for continued use of the HEPA filtration unit.</p>

For example, in a study in homes with wood stoves in the western U.S., baseline median PM2.5 was 17, 41, and 16 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in filter, wood stove change out, and placebo arms, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Preliminary results from an ongoing RCT (NCT02240069) have shown a similar pattern with median baseline PM2.5 ranging from 23 to 41 to 30 μg/m<sup>3</sup> in homes assigned to different intervention arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Note we will not exclude homes based on baseline PM2.5 measurements because even at low levels (i.e., below U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards), PM2.5 has demonstrated adverse health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p>

                    <p id="Par200">Participants (within each site) will be randomized 1:1 (stratified by site) to receive HEPA filtration (intervention group) or control filtration. Permuted block randomization of participants (selected at random) will be employed. The block size and block permutation will be selected at random for each site. After selecting the block size and block permutation, a participant is assigned to the first control/intervention in the block, and the remaining slots are assigned as participants continue to randomize within the site. As randomizations continue and no more slots are available in the previously assigned block, a new block is assigned and participants are randomized accordingly. The mechanism of the allocation is computer-generated assignment. This assignment is not made until the eligibility of the participant and informed consent has been obtained. Both the participant and study staff at the site are masked as to which intervention was assigned. The study statistician generates the allocation sequence in advance of the study initiation and loads it into the electronic data capture system by the data coordinating center for use in the allocation. Site study staff enroll the participants and request the intervention assignment from the computer file.</p>

These meters enable assessment of power consumption and estimate corresponding costs for energy usage. Actual kWh usage during the intervention period will be compared to the usage predicted from laboratory tests. The actual kWh used will be divided by the predicted usage and this quantity multiplied by 100 to determine adherence. Weekly surveys will also include prompts for parent(s)/guardian(s) to report whether they used the HEPA/control unit that week and on what setting it was most commonly used. Note that the kW meters require three-prong outlets. If a home has only two-prong outlets, they will not use the kW meter.</p>

The policy is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://irb.uams.edu/irb-policies/current-irb-policies/">https://irb.uams.edu/irb-policies/current-irb-policies/</ext-link>.

The consent form, including site-specific local context, will be IRB-approved and the parent or legal guardian of the potential participant will be asked to read and review the document. The site investigator or qualified delegate will explain the research study in language that the parent/legal guardian of the participant can understand and will answer any questions that may arise. The explanation will include the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and include the rights of their child as a research participant. Parents/legal guardians of participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw their child from the study at any time, without prejudice. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by emphasizing to parents/guardians of participants that the quality of their child’s medical care will not be adversely affected if they do not allow their child to participate in this study.</p>
                    <p id="Par377">Parents/legal guardians of participants will be given the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The parent/guardian of the potential participants must also be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to allow their child to be a participant. The parent/legal guardian of the participant must sign the informed consent form prior to any study-specific procedures being done.

A listing of applicable UAMS IRB policies will be provided in the MOP. If local requirements conflict with UAMS IRB policies, sites will consult with DCOC to help determine which policies and procedures need to be followed. Each site will follow the trial-specific MOP and any applicable site-specific SOPs and/or local (site-specific) IRB policies. The clinics and ECHO ISPCTN site awardees will provide direct access to all their facilities, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring or auditing by the DCOC and inspection by local and applicable authorities with oversight responsibilities. When electronic health records are source data/documents, sites must provide read-only access for anyone authorized to inspect or verify records.</p>
                    <p id="Par414">Following the applicable monitoring SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and that data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, the trial-specific Site Performance Plan, site-specific SOPs, the ICH GCP E6(R2), and applicable requirements.</p>

The data management plan and associated documentation will specify all operations performed on data from origination to database lock, including detailed descriptions of source documentation, CRFs, instructions for completing forms, data handling and record keeping procedures, procedures for data monitoring, and reconciliation procedures and coding dictionaries to be used, if applicable. The data management plan will also describe the specific data collection and management responsibilities required of the sponsor, study PI(s), the sites, and the DCOC. The contents of the data management plan will be consistent with those described in the Good Clinical Data Management Practices (GCDMP).</p>
                    <p id="Par419">Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the individual ECHO ISPCTN sites under the supervision of the site investigator. The site investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported and will carefully monitor study procedures to protect the safety of research subjects, the quality of the data, and the integrity of the study. All source documents must be completed using standard good documentation practices (i.e., the ALCOA-C method [attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete]).</p>
                    <p id="Par420">It is best practice for ECHO ISPCTN site coordinators to use hard copies of any data recorded on paper CRFs or trial visit worksheets/assessment forms as source document worksheets recording data for each participant consented in the trial. Study personnel will enter clinical data into an EDC system that complies with HIPAA regulations, provided by the DCOC at UAMS. The EDC system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study personnel will enter clinical data directly from the source documents. Data recorded in the EDC derived from source documents must be consistent with the data recorded on the source documents.</p>

The instance of failure may be on the part of the participant, the investigator, or other study staff personnel. When deviations occur, the sponsor, and/or site team(s) will ensure actions are taken to correct the problem and, as needed, prevent the deviation from recurring.</p>
                    <p id="Par424">These practices are consistent with ICH E6(R2) (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/E6%28R2%29-Good-Clinical-Practice--Integrated-Addendum-to-ICH-E6%28R1%29.pdf">https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/E6%28R2%29-Good-Clinical-Practice--Integrated-Addendum-to-ICH-E6%28R1%29.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
                    <p id="Par425">Sites must record all deviations in the trial source documents. Whenever a deviation occurs, the DCOC will ensure an appropriate assessment is conducted. The assessment should include documentation of the severity and risk of the deviation. Sites that have a system set up for assessing deviations and doing their own corrections via corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plans will do so according to their site SOPs/system. The site will send copies of their CAPA plan documentation to the DCOC. If a site does not have their own quality assurance system to complete adequate deviation review and assessments, corrections, and CAPA plans, then the DCOC will provide that function for the sites. Details of these processes will be provided in the MOP and/or trial-specific SOPs. Essentially, the site and/or the DCOC will request/ensure that there is either a CAPA plan initiated or a simple one-time correction is performed, as appropriate.</p>
