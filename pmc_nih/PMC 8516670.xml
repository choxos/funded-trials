              <title>Introduction.</title>
              <p id="P5">The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment includes experiences of procedural touch/handling, movement, smell, sound, light, frequent nociceptive pain, and disruption of sleep (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). For preterm infants, there is also an interruption in the predictable pattern of sensory exposures during a critical period of brain development (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Intense or poorly-timed sensory exposures in the NICU environment may be harmful to the developing sensory system (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Further compounding preterm infants’ altered sensory experiences is the change in NICU architectural design to private rooms, which may be instrumental in decreasing stressors during periods of acute medical compromise and extreme immaturity (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, our research team has observed poorer cerebral maturation scores, alterations in cerebral structure, and poorer language outcome at 2 years among infants in low stimulation private rooms compared to noisier open wards in an urban NICU with decreased parent involvement (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Further study demonstrated variation in auditory exposure across room type, with an average of 3 hours more silence in a 16-hour period among infants in private rooms. Much of the sound exposure in the NICU was high volume and from non-natural sounds, with very little language exposure (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although auditory experiences are important, the NICU environment is made up of multisensory stimuli, and one sensory exposure impacts the others (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), making it important to address the full scope of sensory experiences impacting the high-risk infant in the NICU.</p>
              <p id="P6">Just as poorly timed or noxious sensory exposures can negatively impact the development of the preterm infant, appropriately timed and positive sensory experiences enhance healthy brain development. Functional relatedness of different brain regions is immature in preterm infants, and prematurity can lead to a reduction in neuronal activity. Neuronal growth and connectivity increase in strength and organization as postmenstrual age (PMA) advances, and this can be optimized with appropriate multisensory experiences (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Because the neonatal brain is highly susceptible to external stimuli (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), positive early experiences drive electrocortical activity that facilitates healthy brain development. Electrocortical activity from positive sensory experiences promotes structural plasticity, axonal sprouting, and formation of dendritic spines and synapses in the primary sensory cortex (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P7">There is a body of evidence supporting the use of tactile (touch, holding, skin to skin), auditory (maternal voice, singing, music), visual (cycled light), kinesthetic (movement), and gustatory/olfactory (breast milk or maternal scent) stimulation for preterm infants in the NICU (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, positive and appropriate sensory exposure within the NICU is a modifiable factor that can be used to optimize brain development and reduce the high rates of morbidity. Further, the infant’s need for human contact and nurturing has long been understood. Parent involvement is also an important modifiable factor, as infants whose parents are present and engaged in the NICU demonstrate more favorable outcomes (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although parents can be important drivers of the early sensory environment, even when they are present in the NICU, parents may still have difficulty engaging with their infant, not knowing how or when to interact. Despite favorable evidence for positive multisensory exposures in the NICU (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), such as skin-to-skin care and music, there is significant variation in practice across different NICUs and even within the same NICU (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The result can be months of hospitalization in a sensory-deprived environment, which can alter the long-term developmental trajectory of the infant (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P8">In response to the need for improved intervention, our research team has defined a multisensory program, <underline>S</underline>upporting and <underline>E</underline>nhancing <underline>N</underline>ICU <underline>S</underline>ensory <underline>E</underline>xperiences (SENSE<bold>)</bold> (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The SENSE program combines the need for parent engagement in the NICU environment along with the infant’s daily need for positive multisensory exposures into a cohesive, evidence-based, parent-delivered guideline for consistent application of positive multisensory exposures every day in the NICU. The guideline ensures that appropriate doses of exposure are provided across all the senses. Education materials help parents understand how to implement the guideline for positive sensory exposures within the daily NICU routine and instructs them in how to apply the different sensory exposures in a unimodal (e.g. one sense at a time) or multimodal manner. The SENSE program was developed using a stepwise, rigorous, and scientific process that included evidence on sensory exposures with preterm infants, combined with expert opinion and parent input regarding developmentally appropriate and timed exposures (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The SENSE program includes specific doses of tactile, auditory, vestibular, kinesthetic, olfactory, and visual exposures designed to be delivered by parents with oversight by from a neonatal therapist, nurse, or experienced staff member. In addition, the types, frequency, and duration of appropriate exposures are tailored to the infant’s PMA and modified based on medical status and behavioral cues. A feasibility study demonstrated that providing the defined doses of SENSE interventions, which include substantive amounts of added positive sensory exposures, is feasible to carry out in a level IV NICU. A pilot study demonstrated that SENSE programming was related to increased parent confidence on the Maternal Confidence Questionnaire (p&lt;0.001), better infant neurobehavior with less asymmetry on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (p=0.02; mean difference 0.90) and higher scores on the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Evaluation (p=0.001; mean difference 4) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This current report extends our prior published work and reports on a randomized clinical trial of the SENSE program and its effect on infant neurodevelopment as well as maternal mental health and confidence. We hypothesized that the SENSE program would relate to more maternal confidence at NICU discharge and better language outcome at one-year corrected age.</p>

                <p id="P10">Seventy parent-infant dyads of very preterm infants born ≤ 32 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA) were recruited within the first week of life from consecutive admissions at St. Louis Children’s Hospital NICU, an 85-bed (that expanded to 132-bed during the course of the study) level IV NICU from August 2017 to June 2018. Infants were excluded if they had a suspected or confirmed congenital anomaly, were assigned to the NICU’s open ward (rather than a private room), or had parents who did not speak English. They were withdrawn if they became wards of the state or were transferred to a different NICU prior to discharge home.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S8">
                <title>Power.</title>
                <p id="P11">We defined primary outcome variables for each time point (at term equivalent age and one-year corrected age) and did a power analysis, to estimate sample size, incorporating both. The primary outcome variable at term equivalent age (35–41 weeks PMA) was the Excitability subscale score on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). Excitability is a combination of both motor and behavioral responses, and previous work in our lab has demonstrated it to be a good predictor of later motor, cognitive and language outcomes. We estimated the variance of the Excitability subscore using data from preterm infants born &lt; 30 weeks gestation enrolled in a longitudinal cohort from 2007–2010 and evaluated with the NNNS at term age. For this trial, a total sample of n=46 (23 in each group) will provide 80% power when the true NNNS group difference is 2.2 (2-sided test with alpha= 0.05). In a sample of typical full-term infants, the Excitability subscale score has a mean of 4.3 and a standard deviation of 2.4 (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). A group difference of 2.2 would be a difference of almost 1 standard deviation. Our primary outcome variable at one-year corrected age was the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) Communication score. This was chosen as our primary outcome of interest, due to previous findings of poorer language outcomes in preterm infants hospitalized in low stimulation environments with poor parent engagement (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The variance of the Communication score was estimated using a sample of preterm infants enrolled in our lab in 2011 who received the ASQ at age 3 years. A sample of n=46 provides 80% power when the true group mean ASQ difference is 9.5 (2-sided test with alpha= 0.05). In a normative sample, the Communication score on the ASQ has a mean of 52.9 with a standard deviation of 11.1 (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). A total sample of n=46 (23 in each group) would be a large enough sample to detect a difference of less than 1 standard deviation across groups at the one-year follow-up assessment. Seventy infants were enrolled to account for 15% attrition during the course of the NICU hospitalization (for n=60 at term age) and another 20% attrition by the one-year follow-up assessment (n=48 at one-year of age).</p>

                <title>Overview of procedures.</title>
                <p id="P12">Parent-infant dyads, enrolled within 7 days of birth, were randomized to either the standard-of-care group or SENSE multisensory program group. The randomization scheme was stratified on level of immaturity (≤ 28 weeks EGA or &gt; 28 weeks EGA) and was uploaded to REDCap prior to study initiation. The biostatistician, who was not involved in other study procedures, established the randomization allocation sequence. Various members of the research team (research coordinator, principal investigator, neonatal therapist) enrolled families, pulling a sealed envelope that disclosed the group assignment after enrollment. Parents with infants in the SENSE group were provided with SENSE program education and daily support by a neonatal therapist to engage in the SENSE program (described below) in addition to receiving standard-of-care. Sensory exposures were tracked on bedside logs that contained sensory exposure dose targets for each day. The monitored standard-of-care group received standard NICU care at the study site (described below) and tracked sensory exposures on bedside logs.</p>
                <p id="P13">Standardized measures of maternal mental health and infant development were contained in a questionnaire that was completed by mothers at 35–41 weeks PMA in the NICU and at one-year corrected age. The questionnaire has been used in our longitudinal studies of preterm infants since 2007 (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p>

                <p id="P14">At the time of this study, much like other contemporary NICUs, parents were allowed to be present in the NICU 24 hours per day, with significant variability in the amount, types and timing of actual parent engagement (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Infant holding was supported, provided the infant could maintain physiological and temperature stability. Infants were held while on mechanical ventilation, but holding was not encouraged when infants were on oscillatory ventilation and/or when chest tubes were in place. Nurses and therapists fostered parent participation through instruction on caregiving and developmentally appropriate interactions, but these were balanced with other priorities of medical care. No specific amount of positive sensory exposures was targeted, and practices varied based on the comfort level of nurses, the medical team, and the parents. Suboptimal parent presence, holding, and language exposure have previously been reported at the study site (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The study site is consistent with other hospitals, where there is significant variation in use of sensory based interventions and decreased parental involvement (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The SENSE program addresses the current lack of a national standard for positive sensory exposures and the resultant inconsistency of application of these exposures across hospitalization.</p>

Parents could choose to provide one sensory exposure at a time or could provide multisensory interventions, based on the infant’s tolerance. Parents were able to choose different types of each sensory exposure from options that have evidence to support their use and are appropriate at each PMA. The parents and medical team also opted for exposures within an infant’s range of tolerance (such as using gentle human touch for an infant too sick to be transferred out of the bed to be held). Parents also received verbal education by the neonatal therapist on the research team within one week of enrollment and at least weekly thereafter to reinforce content in the booklet.</p>

The neonatal therapist on the study team assessed the infant’s tolerance each week, or more often if needed, and adjusted the multisensory interventions accordingly when not tolerated. The infant assessment used for the SENSE program is part of the manualized intervention (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and consists of infant observations, evaluation, and collaboration with the medical team.

              <title>Discussion.</title>
              <p id="P38">The key findings of this study were that infants randomized to the SENSE program demonstrated more lethargy at term equivalent age, but had better language outcome at one-year of age. However, when controlling for social risk and medical risk, relationships with lethargy remained, but relationships between SENSE programming and language outcome were no longer observed. We also did not observe relationships between SENSE programming and maternal confidence.</p>
              <p id="P39">The SENSE program was developed to address the role of the sensory environment on appropriate brain development (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). As the SENSE program was developed by combining available evidence, stakeholder input, and expert guidance (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), our current findings parallel other studies investigating positive sensory exposures such as skin-to-skin care and language exposure (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Similar to previous findings showing relationships between quiet and low-stimulation private rooms and poorer language outcomes, we were able to demonstrate an effect of the multisensory SENSE program on better language outcomes at one-year of age on univariate analysis. Due to multifactorial influences on language outcomes (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), we conducted a secondary multivariate analysis. We were not able to demonstrate relationships between SENSE programming and language outcome on multivariate analysis. The randomized clinical trial design aims to balance out confounding factors across groups within the assignment of groups, and stratification on EGA was further employed to aid in group homogeneity. The multivariate analysis enables additional attention to the significant number of confounding conditions that preterm infants experience which can impact the results. An issue with adding more variables to control for in a multivariate model is that it increases the risk of a Type II error and becomes unclear if inadequate power affects the ability to detect differences across groups. This concern is also magnified by a sample size at follow-up that is lower than the original univariate power calculation. Due to these complex issues, we have chosen to include all the results of both analyses to enable clinicians to make their own interpretation of the results.</p>
              <p id="P40">In this project, the SENSE program was related to more lethargy at term equivalent age, even after controlling for PMA at the time of testing, sibling effect, medical risk, and social risk. This parallels previous work that has found more lethargy among infants whose parents were present more often. Although lethargy is largely depicted as a negative marker of neurobehavioral performance, there are some obscurities worth mentioning. Other studies have demonstrated that lethargy scores have marked reductions across PMA (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and lethargy scores have been observed to decrease from birth to one month of age (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), which could make it more difficult to isolate an effect as a response to an intervention. Further, lethargy may correlate with sleep, making our findings consistent with studies that have identified better electroencephalographic sleep-wake cycle organization and sleep behaviors among infants who received skin-to-skin care (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear if increased activity or multisensory stimulation being associated with lethargy and sleep is a positive or negative sign.</p>
              <p id="P41">We were unable to demonstrate an impact of the SENSE program on maternal mental health and confidence. Although positive trends in the data can be interpreted cautiously, we were unable to demonstrate the same improvements in maternal confidence that were previously observed among mother-infant dyads receiving the SENSE program during a pilot study (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Our pilot study demonstrated a positive increase in maternal confidence among mothers receiving the SENSE program (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), which is consistent with other educational and intervention-based studies that target parents to engage with their infants with demonstrated improvements in confidence and mother-child interaction, as well as reductions in stress (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This study was not powered to investigate differences in maternal mental health and confidence, and therefore, it remains unclear if a larger sample size may have resulted in different findings.</p>
              <sec id="S32">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="P42">There were several limitations to this randomized clinical trial. More infants than expected were transferred to other NICUs after enrollment, leading to a smaller sample size than planned (10 fewer infants). This could have impacted the findings, particularly multivariate results. This study was not powered on all outcome variables. The assumption of homogeneity across groups due to randomization could not fully be appreciated in this study of preterm infants with multiple social and medical confounds that could impact the results. We attempted to address this statistically, but fully untangling these factors to isolate the effect of an intervention remains complex and imperfect, especially with a small sample size. While excluding infants with significant co-morbidities would address this issue in future studies, it is important that the impact of the SENSE program is evaluated on the medically complex infants it is designed for.</p>
                <p id="P43">There could have been bias and suggestion introduced due to the way that parents were approached for enrollment. Parents were approached very early after birth and informed that this was a study of sensory exposures in high-risk infants. They were told each parent-infant dyad would be randomized to one of two approaches to sensory stimuli (standard-of-care or the SENSE program). This could have been suggestive of the importance of sensory exposures and led to heightened awareness of the need to provide positive sensory exposures, resulting in parents providing more sensory exposures than they would have otherwise, impacting the ability to observe differences across groups. In addition, parents in the control group also had log sheets at the bedside to document their infant’s sensory exposures, which could also have been suggestive and led to increased provision of sensory exposures. Some parents in the control group (1/4 of the sample) achieved the full doses identified in the SENSE program without receiving the specific information and education related to the SENSE program. The use of statistical interactions to assess the effect of the SENSE program in the midst of different levels of parent engagement could aid in evaluating this, however, a much larger sample size would be needed to establish power. There were times within the complex, level IV NICU when sensory interventions had to be put on hold (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). While 100% of infants in the SENSE group received &gt;75% of the SENSE program doses, only 65% received 100% or more of the dosage across all of hospitalization. Untangling the impact of this necessary hold on sensory exposures and assessing the impact of medical instability is complex.</p>
                <p id="P44">The study site NICU is the location of previous work that identified lower language scores in infants hospitalized in private NICU rooms. These findings, as well as research conducted after it, could have impacted clinical interventions and behavior just prior to and during the trial, impacting the results of this study. It is also unknown how the transition from an 85-bed to 132-bed NICU during the study time period may have impacted behavior and the results of this study.</p>
                <p id="P45">Early neurobehavioral assessments are impacted by the PMA at the time of assessment in addition to concurrent medical factors (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), which adds nuance to their interpretation. We also had multiple measures across different constructs over time (infant behavior, one-year child outcome, maternal mental health, maternal confidence), which can increase the risk of a Type I error. In addition to the measures reported here, we video recorded infant movement, feeding, and parent-infant interaction in the NICU and attempted to evaluate these constructs using standard measures from the videotapes. Immediate interpretation was limited due to issues with the camera angle, the length of the video, and other perspectives about the environment that are missing from a video clip. Further analysis is underway.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p id="P46">The SENSE program was developed using a systematic and scientific process to enable a strategy that reflects best practice in tailoring the sensory environment, and this randomized clinical trial provides more evidence to support the SENSE program. However, clinical practice continues to change as new evidence emerges. Therefore, it will be important to update the SENSE program, based on current evidence and/or to continue to evaluate its efficacy, including whether and how efficacy is altered in different types of NICU environments (e.g. open ward vs. private room). Further consideration of the unique contribution of each type of sensory exposure (tactile, auditory, olfactory/gustatory, visual, kinesthetic/vestibular) could also benefit from further inquiry. The relative contribution of each sensory modality could be assessed with the Multiphasic Optimization Strategy, which ultimately could lead to further optimization the SENSE program. Additional research regarding implementation, at the individual and organizational level, would help determine how adaptations made in real-world practice impact the administration of the program across different NICUs. Despite the need for more research, the SENSE program continues to be adopted by NICUs worldwide and its implementation is another step in optimizing the early sensory environment and providing neuroprotective care to fragile infants who start their lives in the NICU.</p>

Due to having information about family income and not family employment status and occupation of primary income earner, family income was weighted to represent both of those variables which were previously part of the social risk score. Variables that contributed to the social risk score for this study then included: family structure (0 points: child living with both parents, 1 point: separated/dual custody or cared for by other family such as grandparents, 2 points: single caregiver or foster care), education of primary caregiver (0 points: college education, 1 point: completed year 11 or 12 of high school, 2 points: completed &lt; year 11 of high school), family income (0 points: &gt; $50,000, 2 points: $25,000–50,000, 4 points: &lt; $25,000), and maternal age at infant birth (0 points: &gt; 21 years, 1 point: 18–21 years, 2 points: &lt; 18 years). Income level was weighed heaviest due to its ties to employment, education level, as well as living situation.</p>
