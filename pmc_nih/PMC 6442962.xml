                <p>Unlike unrelated donor registries, transplant centers lack uniform approaches to related donor assessment and deferral. To test whether related donors are at increased risk for donation-related toxicities, we conducted a prospective observational trial of 11,942 related and unrelated donors aged 18â€“60 years. Bone marrow (BM) was collected at 37 transplant and 78 National Marrow Donor Program centers, and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected at 42 transplant and 87 unrelated donor centers in North America. Possible presence of medical comorbidities was verified prior to donation, and standardized pain and toxicity measures were assessed pre-donation, peri-donation, and one year following. Multivariate analyses showed similar experiences for BM collection in related and unrelated donors; however, related stem cell donors had increased risk of moderate [odds ratios (ORs) 1.42; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001] and severe (OR 8.91; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) pain and toxicities (OR 1.84; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) with collection. Related stem cell donors were at increased risk of persistent toxicities (OR 1.56; <italic>P</italic>=0.021) and non-recovery from pain (OR 1.42; <italic>P</italic>=0.001) at one year. Related donors with more significant comorbidities were at especially high risk for grade 2â€“4 pain (OR 3.43; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and non-recovery from toxicities (OR 3.71; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) at one year. Related donors with more significant comorbidities were at especially high risk for grade 2â€“4 pain (OR 3.43; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and non-recovery from toxicities (OR 3.71; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) at one year. Related donors reporting grade â‰¥2 pain had significant decreases in Health-Related Quality of Life (HR-QoL) scores at one month and one year post donation (<italic>P</italic>=0.004). In conclusion, related PBSC donors with comorbidities are at increased risk for pain, toxicity, and non-recovery at one year after donation. Risk profiles described in this study should be used for donor education, planning studies to improve the related donor experience, and decisions regarding donor deferral.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Donation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the form of bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) is a commonly performed procedure, with more than 40,000 donations from both volunteer unrelated donors (URD) and related donors (RD) each year.<sup><xref rid="b1-1040844" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1040844" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Over the past decade, donor registries such as the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) have published detailed data describing the URD experience, identifying individuals at increased risk for pain and collection-related symptoms, slower recovery, and severe adverse events.<sup><xref rid="b3-1040844" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“<xref rid="b7-1040844" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Data describing the RD experience, however, are limited, with only one large recent study.<sup><xref rid="b8-1040844" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This may be because URD are handled by registries that have a mandate to collect and report safety data, whereas RD are cared for by local transplant centers, whose primary focus is care for the recipient and, in most countries, RD safety data are not systematically collected. Inadequate data regarding RD is a cause for concern for many reasons. While URD registries have rigorous standards for donor approval, supported by internal quality initiatives and efforts at international standardization,<sup><xref rid="b9-1040844" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> there are no generally accepted guidelines about deferral of a RD.</p>
              <p>With these concerns in mind, North American Investigators teamed with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) to conduct a prospective observational trial of RD who donated at 53 transplant centers in the United States between January 2010 and July 2014. This report describes our primary end point comparing pain, toxicities and recovery of RD with URD collected concurrently at 78 BM and 87 PBSC NMDP collection centers.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Prior to donation, RD underwent a medical evaluation including a detailed history, physical examination, blood tests, and additional work up as necessary according to center standards. RD approved for donation were approached for consent for this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study.</p>
              <p>Unrelated donors provided written informed consent for participation as required by the NMDP IRB. URD were evaluated for medical suitability and comorbidities that would require further evaluation or qualify for deferral for BM or PBSC donation as specified by NMDP standards.<sup><xref rid="b10-1040844" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1040844" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <sec sec-type="methods">
                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>A pre-donation form including history of pre-existing medical conditions (comorbidities) was completed. Detailed collection-related symptoms and pain were collected at five time points: pre-donation, peri-donation [day +5 from start of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for PBSCs and 1â€“2 days after BM collection], and 1, 6 and 12 months post donation. Toxicity was defined by Common Toxicity Criteria measures for symptoms commonly noted during PBSC and BM collection (fever, fatigue, skin rash, local reactions to an injection, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, insomnia, dizziness, and syncope) and is called the Modified Toxicity Criteria (MTC). This approach was validated by the NMDP and has been published previously.<sup><xref rid="b4-1040844" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-1040844" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b12-1040844" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-1040844" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Pain was graded from 0â€“4 as none, mild, moderate, severe, or disabling. Pain and toxicity measures were assessed by the transplant center at pre- and peri-donation time points; the CIBMTR Survey Research Group was responsible for follow-up assessments.</p>
                <p>A product-specific collection form detailed information on the collection procedure. A subset of donors underwent assessment of long-term psychological recovery by established Health Related Quality of Life instruments (reported previously<sup><xref rid="b14-1040844" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â€“<xref rid="b16-1040844" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>).</p>

              <sec>
                <title>End points</title>
                <p>Pain was assessed for the following sites: back, bones, head, hip, intravenous injection (IV) site, joints, limbs, muscles, neck, throat, or other. Severity of pain was defined as the maximum grade among these pain sites. Body symptoms were assessed using the MTC outlined above and the peak toxicity level across symptoms was analyzed. Recovery to pre-donation levels by one year was defined as a pain or symptom score less than or equal to the score at pre-donation.</p>
                <p>Pre-donation comorbidity ascertainment included: assessment of bleeding, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hematologic, hepatic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, psychiatric, central nervous system (CNS), endocrine, autoimmune disorders, or other significant coexisting diseases (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S1</italic>). We divided comorbidities into three categories: 1) comorbidities that would not result in deferral from URD donation according to NMDP standards;<sup><xref rid="b10-1040844" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-1040844" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> 2) comorbidities that would have resulted in deferral; and 3) comorbidities that could possibly have led to a deferral, but more detailed donor clinical data would be needed to make that judgment.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Analyses were conducted separately for BM and PB donations. Pre-donation baseline variables were compared between RD and URD groups using the Pearson Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables.</p>
                <p>Ï‡<sup>2</sup> tests or Fisherâ€™s Exact tests as appropriate were used to compare the incidences of skeletal pain and MTC symptoms as well as recovery to pre-donation levels between RD and URD groups. Multivariate analyses using logistic regression models were conducted to compare the RD and URD groups accounting for differences in donor characteristics. The following donor characteristics were examined for inclusion in the multivariate model: donor type, race, gender, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), collection year, comorbidity status among related donors, pre-donation counts [white blood cell (WBC) count, platelets, neutrophils, mononuclear cells, hemoglobin], and pre-donation symptoms (skeletal pain or maximum MTC grade). Additional PB donation-specific variables considered were: placement of a central venous line, total blood volume, absolute CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and WBC pre-collection, and daily GCSF dose (absolute and per kg).</p>
                <p>The effects were estimated <italic>via</italic> odds ratios (OR). In all multivariate models, donor type was forced into the model and stepwise model selection was used to determine additional donor characteristics to be included. Interactions between donor type and each donor characteristic were tested for in all multivariate models.</p>

Although males donated more often in both RD and URD groups, a higher percentage of females donated in the RD group. There was a trend toward higher BMI in RD <italic>versus</italic> URD giving BM (BMI 30+, 39% <italic>versus</italic> 29%; <italic>P</italic>=0.07), and a significant difference in obesity in RD <italic>versus</italic> URD giving PBSC with 41% <italic>versus</italic> 28% (BMI 30+; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

                <p>There are several notable differences between RD and URD involving collection procedures (<xref rid="t1-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While 90% of URD PBSC donations occurred in a single day, and no collection took more than two days, 30% of RD required two days, and 2% and 1% took three and four days, respectively, with collection for one donor taking place over five days (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Notably, more RD were collected with lower volume procedures (&lt;18L, 40% <italic>vs</italic>. 26%; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). A major difference in RD <italic>versus</italic> URD practice was noted in the increase in central venous line placement in RD for both female and male donors (female RD 38%, female URD 17%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; male RD 12%, male URD 2%, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). Of note, the differences were not impacted by age, although obesity had an impact in female donors, and number of collection procedures performed impacted both male and female donors (<italic>Online Supplementary Table S2</italic>).</p>

                <p>Risk factors for pain and MTC symptoms after PBSC collection included both new and previously described clinical characteristics (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="t4-1040844" ref-type="table">4</xref>). A new finding is that high CD34<sup>+</sup> counts (â‰¥80.5/Î¼L) prior to day 1 of collection was associated with more grade 2â€“4 collection pain (OR 1.25; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Another novel finding was that there was a dose level of G-CSF above which pain levels increased significantly. If a donor received an average daily dose exceeding 960 Î¼g/day, reported pain levels were higher (OR 1.21; <italic>P</italic>=0.006). This increase in pain levels was not noted when analyzed by dose per/kg.</p>
                <p>Females undergoing PBSC collection had twice the risk of moderate and severe pain and MTC symptoms (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). They were also more likely to have persistent symptoms and to fail to recover to pre-donation levels at one year after BM collection (<xref rid="t4-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The age effect varied, with PBSC donors aged 30â€“39 years having higher risk for grade 3â€“4 pain with collection (OR 1.50; <italic>P</italic>=0.021) (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and older donors (aged 50â€“60 years) having lower risks for grade 2â€“4 pain with collection (OR 0.61; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.00) (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and higher risks of reporting grade 2â€“4 pain at one year (aged 50â€“60 years: OR 2.72; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="t4-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Importantly, donors who started with grade 1 or 2â€“4 pain or grade 2â€“4 MTC symptoms were more likely to report higher grades of pain or symptoms with collection (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These donors also had higher levels of pain and MTC symptoms at one year, but most of them had returned to pre-donation levels. Obesity was important in pain and MTC symptom risk, as donors with 30+ BMI had increased risk of peri-collection grade 2â€“4 and 3â€“4 pain and grade 2â€“4 MTC symptoms, along with grade 2â€“4 pain at one year.</p>
                <p><xref rid="t4-1040844" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows additional factors other than RD/URD status associated with higher levels of late pain/MTC symptoms and lack of recovery to pre-donation levels at one year. Older BM and PBSC donors, and Black and multiple-race PBSC donors were less likely to recover to their pre-donation level of pain. Hispanic and multiple-race PBSC donors were less likely to recover to pre-donation level of MTC symptoms. As might be expected, donors with pre-donation levels of pain or symptoms at grade 1 or grades 2â€“4 were more likely to recover to that level at one year.</p>

              <p>Unrelated HSC registries have a responsibility to ensure the safety of volunteer donors performing an altruistic act.<sup><xref rid="b17-1040844" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> They routinely defer donors with minor health problems, erring on the side of safety. Transplant centers, whose primary task is treatment of patients with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses, must also evaluate the medical fitness of donors and advise them about risk, in some cases deferring them. Although recent changes in accreditation requirements for transplant centers emphasize donor education and autonomy, requiring an independent donor advocate,<sup><xref rid="b18-1040844" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>â€“<xref rid="b20-1040844" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> RD may or may not listen to advice to forgo donation, being highly motivated and willing to take medical risks for their family member.</p>
              <p>Studies have shown that a matched sibling is generally the best HSC donor;<sup><xref rid="b21-1040844" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>â€“<xref rid="b23-1040844" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and recent expansion of haploidentical approaches<sup><xref rid="b24-1040844" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> have put even more family members into a donor role. Over the past decade, however, improvements in URD procedures have led to comparable outcomes using RD and URD in patients with hematologic malignancies,<sup><xref rid="b25-1040844" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“<xref rid="b27-1040844" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> offering reasonable HCT alternatives if a RD is unable to donate. With this in mind, when should a transplant center counsel a RD against donation?</p>
              <p>Our study shows that the choice to donate by a RD with comorbidities can have consequences. We show by multivariate analysis that RD have more intense early pain and toxicities than URD, and because these symptoms are temporally associated with PBSC collection, there is little doubt that the toxicities are related to the donation procedure. There is a question, however, about whether our observation that RD have more pain and non-recovery to pre-donation levels at one year is due to the procedure itself, or other aspects associated with being a RD. Although attempting to link observed pain at one year directly to PBSC donation was not one of our objectives, an observation that we made may shed light on this question. We performed additional assessments of RD at one and six months; we noted that the donation pain levels do not fully recover at one month, and remain at heightened levels at six and 12 months (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.001) (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S3</italic>), suggesting that persistently elevated pain levels are a consequence of donation.</p>

              <p>Given that elevated post-donation pain levels were only grade 1 or 2 (mild/moderate), are these findings clinically significant? This is an important question because self-reported pain from individuals can vary based on characteristics such as gender or cultural differences. To define whether the persistent pain we detected was clinically meaningful, we performed an analysis of the relation of reported pain to donor HR-QoL. In a companion study imbedded in our protocol, 186 RD and URD were randomly chosen for assessment of HR-QoL. We noted that at one month and one year after donation, those reporting grade 2 pain or toxicities had significantly lower physical scores measured by the SF36 multidimensional HR-QoL measure compared to those not reporting pain or toxicities [<italic>P</italic>=0.002 (1 month) and 0.004 (1 year)] (<italic>Online Supplementary Figure S4</italic>). The findings of our HR-QoL companion study (reported separately) support the outcomes we report (e.g. RD reported the donation to be more painful than URD; at 1 year RD were less likely to feel back to normal and reported a longer period of recovery). These observations allow us to conclude that the persistent pain is clinically meaningful, but the cause of higher levels of persistent pain in RD is unclear. Future studies could explore potential contributing factors, such as the possibility of G-CSF increasing inflammation in donors with comorbid conditions or the relationship of persistent pain to psychological stressors experienced by family donors.</p>
              <p>With this in mind, should RD at highest risk of pain or non-recovery consider deferral? Deferring RD who would have been deferred by the NMDP (our highest risk group) is in line with a recent Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation task force recommendation to screen RD using URD registry standards.<sup><xref rid="b9-1040844" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b28-1040844" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It is likely that unless transplant centers collecting RD accept limits on screening and collection similar to URD registries, RD will remain at higher risk for pain/toxicity and lack of recovery. But should pre-donation standards for deferral of a RD be similar to those for URD? Although there is no clear medical benefit from donation, there is evidence that both URD and RD may experience psychosocial benefits, including feelings of enhanced self-worth. For RD, there are additional benefits of alleviating the suffering or saving the life of a loved one and closer family relationships.<sup><xref rid="b29-1040844" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â€“<xref rid="b31-1040844" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> While some family members may willingly accept increased medical risk in exchange for psychosocial benefits, others may hesitate and feel coerced by family obligations. Striking a balance is a challenge, as transplant centers should support the wishes of RD who are ambivalent about donation and protect those in whom donation could be a serious risk. But at the same time, RD should have the choice as to whether to shoulder some level of increased risk.</p>
              <p>This study identified a series of risk factors that could either motivate a transplant center to recommend against use of a given donor, or allow a donor with multiple risk factors to understand their risk and choose to forgo donation (<xref rid="t3-1040844" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="t4-1040844" ref-type="table">4</xref>). A desired outcome from this study is to motivate transplant centers to test interventions aimed at minimizing discomfort or preventing persistent pain or symptoms experienced by high-risk RD. The data on risks presented herein should be shared with RD as part of their counseling regarding the donation process.</p>
              <p>In summary, this study showed for the first time that adult RD of PBSC are at increased risk for higher levels of pain and symptoms in the short-term after a collection procedure and one year later compared to URD. The presence of comorbidities in a prospective donor heightens this risk, and comorbidities in combination with other factors described in this study should be carefully considered as transplant teams and individuals make decisions regarding BM or PBSC donation.</p>
