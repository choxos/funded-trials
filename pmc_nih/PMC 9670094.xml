                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Our community-based participatory research partnership aims to expand understanding of the social, ethical and behavioural implications of COVID-19 testing and vaccination to inform the development of an integrated intervention that harnesses community-based peer navigation and mHealth strategies to improve COVID-19 testing and vaccination; test the intervention; and develop and disseminate practice, research and policy recommendations to further increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine communities in the USA.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will conduct 50 individual in-depth interviews with health providers, who have conducted COVID-19 testing and/or vaccination activities within Spanish-speaking communities, and with representatives from Latine-serving community-based organisations. We will also conduct six focus groups with 8–12 Spanish-speaking Latine community member participants each for a total number of about 60 focus group participants. Next, we will develop the <italic toggle="yes">Nuestra Comunidad Saludable</italic> intervention based on findings from interviews and focus groups and use a longitudinal group-randomised trial design with two arms (intervention and delayed intervention) to evaluate the impact of the intervention. We will recruit, enrol and collect baseline data from 20 community-based peer navigators (<italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic>) and their social network members (n=8 unique social network members per <italic toggle="yes">Navegante</italic>). <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> (coupled with their social networks) will be randomised to intervention or delayed intervention groups (10 <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> and 80 social network members per group).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval for data collection was granted by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Following the description of study procedures, we will obtain consent from all study participants. Study findings will be disseminated through an empowerment theory-based community forum, peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings, and reports and briefs for lay, community and practitioner audiences.</p>

              <title>Background and rationale</title>
              <p>Latine (a gender-neutral term similar to ‘Latinx’ that is increasingly used within Latine lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities) communities in the USA are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Latine persons comprise 18.5% of the US population, and as of October 2022 comprised 25% of US COVID-19 cases.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Latine persons are two times more likely to contract COVID-19 than their non-Latine White counterparts, 2.8 times more likely to be hospitalised from COVID-19 and 2.3 times more likely to die from COVID-19.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These disparities are even more profound among Spanish-speaking Latine persons in the USA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5–7</xref></p>
              <p>Ongoing testing and vaccination are critical to effective control of the pandemic; however, complex issues contribute to low rates of COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Spanish-speaking Latine communities.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 7–10</xref> Latine persons may lack access to culturally congruent information about COVID-19 testing and vaccination, including eligibility and ways to access these services; and assume that they must pay for testing or vaccination. They may believe they are not at risk for COVID-19, worry about missing work due to a positive test result or vaccine side effects and/or be concerned with the long-term health implications of testing and vaccination. Challenges to testing and vaccination also include institutional and structural barriers (eg, discrimination, limited transportation, conflicts between job and testing and vaccination programme scheduling and fear of engaging with government systems, including public health). These barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccination are greater among those who do not speak English, are immigrants, are undocumented and/or live in mixed-immigration status households.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> A profound need remains to better understand and intervene on the factors that challenge and facilitate COVID-19 testing and vaccination interventions within these communities.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 6 7 14–16</xref></p>
              <p>Natural helping through community-based peer navigation is potentially effective in addressing health issues in underserved communities<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–22</xref> and has potential to increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Latine communities. Community-based peer navigation harnesses relationships and social networks to help individuals engage with prevention or care services. Community-based peer navigators have advantages over other strategies because they can reach those who are considered ‘hard-to-reach’ by traditional service providers with targeted, tailored and personalised messaging and support. As trusted community members, peer navigators can be the first people turned to for assistance. Effective peer navigators are part of the networks in which they work, in terms of self-identity, socioeconomic status and lived experience; understand community needs and strengths and what is meaningful to members and communities; communicate in the language of network members; and incorporate culture to promote positive behaviours.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 23</xref> In addition, community-based peer navigation strategies can be sustainable, as peer navigators often continue their work after a study or intervention implementation, and related funding end.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 24 25</xref></p>
              <p>mHealth, a portmanteau of ‘mobile health’, describes medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> mHealth can be a powerful tool to reach Spanish-speaking Latines. Spanish-speaking Latines have high rates of social media use, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and texting, for acquiring health information,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref> and this use extends to COVID-related information.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 30 31</xref> These rates are related to increased proliferation of mobile devices, including among Spanish-speaking Latine persons.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref> Social media platforms can be powerful health promotion tools because they are widely available, inexpensive and instantaneous; thus, they can be effective at promoting behaviour change.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–38</xref></p>
              <p>Because the health-related views of Latine persons are strongly influenced by trusted social network members,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 31 39 40</xref> and because Spanish-speaking Latines tend to be active users of social media, combining peer navigation with mHealth holds particular promise for increasing COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Spanish-speaking Latine communities. Moreover, studies suggest that Latine persons report substantial willingness to be tested and vaccinated.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> For example, in a national survey, eagerness to receive vaccination was more pronounced for Spanish-speaking Latine persons than English-speaking Latine persons (27% vs 11%), but Spanish-speaking Latines reported greater information gaps and uncertainty about how or where to seek vaccination.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Thus, focused support that addresses barriers and builds on facilitators could be highly effective.</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The objectives of this community-based participatory research (CBPR) study are to expand understanding of the social, ethical and behavioural implications (SEBI) of COVID-19 testing and vaccination to inform the development of an integrated intervention that harnesses community-based peer navigation and mHealth strategies to improve COVID-19 testing and vaccination; test the intervention using a group-randomised trial design; and develop and disseminate practice, research and policy priorities and recommendations to further increase COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine communities in the USA.</p>

                <p>This study is part of the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Underserved Populations (RADx-UP) initiative of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The goals of RADx-UP are to understand and address COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality disparities for populations that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs%23radx-up" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/radx/radx-programs%23radx-up</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>This study is being implemented state-wide in North Carolina, USA. North Carolina has more than 1 million Latine persons, many of whom are Spanish speakers,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and the COVID-19 experiences of the Latine population in North Carolina reflect experiences nationally, supporting study generalisability.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref> In North Carolina, the rate of COVID-19 infections is higher within the Latine community, and fewer Latine persons have been vaccinated, compared with other racial/ethnic groups.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p>

                <p>Throughout this study, we will continue to use CBPR. CBPR is a critical approach to increase health equity and reduce disparities among underserved populations. Blending the lived experiences of members of the public; the expertise of service providers, clinicians and public health practitioners; and sound science can ensure the feasibility and acceptability of research studies; develop deeper and more informed understandings of health and related phenomena; and yield interventions that are more relevant, more culturally congruent and more likely to be effective and sustained, if warranted.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47 48</xref> The partners conducting this study have worked together for nearly 20 years and represent lay community members, health departments, free clinics, universities, two regional health systems and community organisations.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 49–51</xref> We have engaged in intensive decision-making about all aspects of this study, including the qualitative methods (ie, in-depth interviews and focus groups), the intervention strategies (ie, peer navigation and mHealth), evaluation methods (ie, the longitudinal group-randomised trial design) and priority-setting and dissemination plans (ie, empowerment theory-based community forum).</p>

                  <title>Explore the SEBI of COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Spanish-speaking Latine communities</title>
                  <p>We will collect, analyse and interpret exploratory ‘deep’<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> qualitative data to expand our understanding of the SEBI of COVID-19 testing and vaccination within Spanish-speaking Latine communities. We will conduct 50 individual in-depth interviews with two categories of participants: (1) health providers (including administrators, clinicians, community health workers and safety-net clinic staff), who have planned, managed or conducted COVID-19 testing or vaccination activities for Spanish-speaking communities; and (2) representatives from Latine-serving community-based organisations. While we cannot predict saturation a priori, our previous research suggests that 50 interviews will provide us sufficient range and scope of perspectives across interview groups,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> and we have the flexibility to expand the number of interviews and/or focus groups if warranted. We expect to interview more providers (about 70%) than representatives from Latine-serving community-based organisations (about 30%) because of the fewer number of Latine-serving community-based organisations overall.</p>
                  <p>We will also conduct six focus groups with 8–12 Spanish-speaking Latine community member participants each for a total number of about 60 focus group participants. We chose the size of focus groups based on standard focus group guidelines; focus groups that are larger than 12 become difficult to manage, and it is difficult to hear from each participant.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> We will screen focus group participants to ensure we obtain representation by gender, age, documentation status, county of origin and those with and without experiences of COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</p>
                  <p>A low-literacy assessment will collect demographic data from each interview and focus group participant. Interview and focus group guides will be developed iteratively with a project-specific steering committee through ongoing literature review; brainstorming of domains and constructs; and drafting, review and revision of potential questions. Our conceptual framework (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) will guide interview and focus group guide development. Because this phase is exploratory and designed to be inductive, the framework is subject to revision. Interview and focus group guides will adhere to best practices (eg, creating non-leading/open-ended questions, ordering from general to specific, maintaining neutral tone and depersonalising behaviours by ‘third-person-ing’ questions) to elicit knowledge, descriptions of experiences, opinions and values.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54–58</xref> The outcome of this phase will be an increased understanding of the SEBI of COVID-19 testing and vaccination among Spanish-speaking Latine communities.</p>

                <p>To participate in the in-depth interviews as a health provider, a participant must (a) be employed at a clinic, health centre or other organisation that has planned, managed or conducted COVID-19 testing or vaccination activities for Spanish-speaking communities, (b) be ≥18 years old and (c) provide informed consent. To be eligible to participate in the interviews as a Latine-serving community-based organisation representative, a participant must (a) be affiliated with a Latine-serving community-based organisation, (b) be ≥18 years old and (c) provide informed consent. To be eligible to participate in the focus groups, a participant must (a) self-identify as Hispanic/Latine, (b) be Spanish speaking, (c) be ≥18 years old and (d) provide informed consent. Potentially eligible participants will be identified through our community and clinical partners. Those who express interest will be screened to determine eligibility. Each participant who completes the interview or focus group will receive $50 compensation.</p>
                <p>Because each <italic toggle="yes">Navegante</italic> must be a leader within existing social networks, we will recruit <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> primarily through our partnership’s extensive community networks across North Carolina and through word of mouth. We have had much success with both of these strategies.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> To be eligible to participate as a <italic toggle="yes">Navegante</italic>, a participant must (a) self-identify as Hispanic/Latine, (b) be Spanish speaking, (c) be ≥18 years of age, (d) provide informed consent and (e) report having been vaccinated against COVID-19. Our partnership chose the vaccination requirement because <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> serve as role models within the community. Access to a smartphone will not be an inclusion criterion. We have some flexibility to provide smartphones and data plans for <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> without them, though given smartphone proliferation and our past research experiences, this will likely be unnecessary.</p>
                <p>To be eligible to participate as a social network member, a participant must (a) self-identify as Hispanic/Latine, (b) be Spanish speaking, (c) be ≥18 years of age and (d) provide informed consent. We will screen and enrol eight unique members of each <italic toggle="yes">Navegante’s</italic> social network. If a <italic toggle="yes">Navegante</italic> cannot recruit eight unique social network members, we will recruit, interview and select other <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> until we have 20 <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> each with eight unique social network members. After 20 <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> and 160 unique members of their social networks enrol and complete the baseline assessment, group-level randomisation will be done using nQuery software to generate random numbers.

                <title>Sample size and power</title>
                <p>Sample size calculations are based on a follow-up baseline-adjusted (analysis of covariance, ANCOVA) model. We estimated the sample size needed (20 <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> and 160 social network members) by performing calculations in nQuery V.8.7. We assume a within-social network correlation coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)) of 0.01 (although the observed ICC in previous studies of Latine persons was lower (ie, ICC=0.005)<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), type I error rate of 0.05 and a repeated measures correlation of 0.40. A typical assumption in sample size calculations for longitudinal modelling is that adjacent time points are moderately correlated at 0.50, although they typically decrease with increasing time separation.<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref> Our previous studies with Latine populations have demonstrated smaller repeated measures correlations, especially among categorical outcomes<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 76</xref>; we therefore attenuated the assumed correlation to 0.40 as a compromise. We also assume a 10% dropout rate at follow-up, given our previous studies have had very high retention rates within Latine communities due to our CBPR approach.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> We will be able to detect a range of improvements from 13% (from 5% to 18%) to 20% (from 50% to 70%) in past 6-month COVID-19 testing with at least 80% power under the above assumptions. These estimates are conservative if ICCs are lower or dropout is less. Our intervention also seeks to increase COVID-19 vaccination. Based on current data, it is estimated that 32% of Latine persons nationally (and 31% in North Carolina) have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> For our calculations, we have raised this baseline percentage to 40% given ongoing US vaccination efforts. Under the same ICC, repeated measures correlation and missing data assumptions as for COVID-19 testing, we will be able to detect an increase in COVID-19 vaccination from 40% to 60.5% (a 20.5% improvement) with at least 80% power. Testing data within Latine communities is much less precise; thus, we assumed baseline testing rates of 5%–50%, maximising the sample size required to detect differences in testing over the 6 months.</p>

                  <p>We will analyse the qualitative data from the in-depth interviews and focus groups using constant comparison, a systematic approach to developing grounded theory that is well suited to uncovering participants’ meanings and experiences. It combines inductive coding with simultaneous comparison; initial observations are continually refined throughout data collection and analysis.<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> The goal is to identify themes, not to quantify participant experiences. Analytical steps include interviewers documenting postinterview and focus group impressions (eg, content, process and themes); professionally transcribing and translating (if needed) interviews and focus groups; and verifying transcripts by reviewing and correcting discrepancies while listening to the recording. Transcripts will be managed using NVivo software (Chicago, Illinois) and examined to identify and code domains for theme development. This will begin with the analysts developing and refining an analytical coding scheme system and data dictionary. For data triangulation, analysts will develop, compare, then revise matrices that identify similarities and differences and explore emic and etic perspectives within and across participant categories (eg, health providers vs Latine-serving community-based organisation representatives; and health provider/organisation representative interview vs Spanish-speaking Latine community member focus group). Finally, members of our CBPR partnership will review themes for validity (eg, rigour, credibility and trustworthiness).<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></p>

                  <p>To test our hypothesis that participants in the intervention group, relative to their counterparts in the delayed intervention group, will demonstrate increased past 6-month COVID-19 testing and vaccination, we will compare rates of past 6-month COVID-19 testing (defined as at least one test) and vaccination completion (defined as complete dosage of approved vaccination (eg, two Pfizer or Moderna doses or one Johnson &amp; Johnson dose, plus boosters as recommended and eligible)) between intervention and delayed intervention group social network members at immediate postintervention (6 months after the intervention group <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> are trained), adjusting for baseline rates. This ANCOVA approach has the advantage of being unaffected by baseline differences; if baseline rates, by chance, were different, the intervention effect would be overestimated by looking at change scores and underestimated by a follow-up score analysis. The ANCOVA approach is robust even with baseline imbalance, and generally has greater statistical power to detect an intervention effect than the other methods.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> Statistical analysis will be performed using generalised linear mixed modelling<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> for binary outcomes (random-effects logistic regression).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Spanish-speaking Latine communities face a myriad of challenges related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination resulting in disparities in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 7–10</xref> Innovative, culturally congruent interventions are critically needed to reduce disparities. This study will increase understanding of the SEBI of COVID-19 testing and vaccination and translate these exploratory data into a novel evidence-based intervention. Based on our partnership’s <italic toggle="yes">weCare</italic> intervention that increased care engagement among persons living with HIV,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 35 63 64</xref> the <italic toggle="yes">Nuestra Comunidad Saludable</italic> intervention integrates two evidence-based strategies: community-based peer navigation and mHealth. Based on natural helping, peer navigation harnesses relationships and networks to help individuals engage with prevention and/or care services; however, peer navigation remains largely untapped within this context. The intervention also leverages social media via existing platforms that Spanish-speaking Latine persons already use (eg, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and texting). Thus, the behaviour change focuses on testing and vaccination behaviours, not the antecedent behaviour of downloading, learning and using a new ‘app’, which some mHealth strategies rely on for implementation. We hypothesise that participants randomised to the <italic toggle="yes">Nuestra Comunidad Saludable</italic> intervention, relative to their counterparts randomised to the delayed intervention, will demonstrate increased past 6-month COVID-19 testing and vaccination.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we also include a novel strategy to dissemination that our partnership has developed. Designed to be low burden for attendees, our theory-based community forum brings together community members, partners and other stakeholders to review study findings and develop next steps for both practice and research.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68–70</xref></p>
              <p>It is important to note the potential limitations of this study. This study sample size will not permit meaningful comparisons by population subgroups such as country of origin, immigration status, sexual orientation or gender identity. Second, there is potential for contamination (also known as diffusion of intervention effects) in Aim 2, although we will assess information sharing from <italic toggle="yes">Navegantes</italic> (directly or through social media) to delayed intervention group or with non-enrolled persons through the Activity Logs and the postintervention assessment, and these will be controlled for as covariates in sensitivity analyses if warranted. Finally, results may be generalisable to other Spanish-speaking communities; however, the healthcare systems and the provision of COVID-19 testing and vaccination in other states might be different and thus require slight revisions to the intervention. Given the strategies used in the intervention (peer navigation and mHealth) and the ability to have content that is targeted, tailored and personalised, the intervention may also be useful for other communities facing barriers to testing and vaccination, but again, tweaks to the intervention will be required.</p>
              <p>In sum, the <italic toggle="yes">Nuestra Comunidad Saludable</italic> intervention may fill an important gap in supporting COVID-19 prevention efforts within a community disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Spanish-speaking Latine persons are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in the USA, and to date, interventions designed for this unique population are limited. There is a dearth of effective interventions to increase testing and vaccination within this population. Reducing the burden borne by Spanish-speaking Latine communities also will benefit larger communities in general because there will be fewer infections and the virus will become weaker and not mutate as rapidly. In fact, the potential for the COVID-19 pandemic to end increases as more and more people are tested and vaccinated. Thus, it is imperative that effective strategies be identified and disseminated to promote testing and vaccination among those most impacted.</p>
