                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Reports of clinical improvement following mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) infusions in refractory lupus patients at a single centre in China led us to perform an explorative phase I trial of umbilical cord derived MSCs in patients refractory to 6âmonths of immunosuppressive therapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Six women with a SLEDAI &gt;6, having failed standard of care therapy, received one intravenous infusion of 1Ã10<sup>6</sup> MSCs/kg of body weight. They maintained their current immunosuppressives, but their physician was allowed to adjust corticosteroids initially for symptom management. The clinical endpoint was an SRI of 4 with no new British Isles Lupus Activity Guide (BILAG) As and no increase in Physician Global Assessment score of &gt;0.3 with tapering of prednisone to 10âmg or less by 20 weeks.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of six patients, five (83.3%; 95%âCI 35.9%âto 99.6%) achieved the clinical endpoint of an SRI of 4. Adverse events were minimal. Mechanistic studies revealed significant reductions in CD27IgD double negative B cells, switched memory B cells and activated naÃ¯ve B cells, with increased transitional B cells in the five patients who met the endpoint. There was a trend towards decreased autoantibody levels in specific patients. Two patients had increases in their Helios+Treg cells, but no other significant T cell changes were noted. GARP-TGFÎ² complexes were significantly increased following the MSC infusions. The B cell changes and the GARP-TGFÎ² increases significantly correlated with changes in SLEDAI scores.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>This phase 1 trial suggests that umbilical cord (UC) MSC infusions are very safe and may have efficacy in lupus. The B cell and GARP-TGFÎ² changes provide novel insight into mechanisms by which MSCs may impact disease.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have significant immune modulatory effects. There are to this point primarily small case series and uncontrolled trials of MSCs in lupus, almost all are from China. Thus, the efficacy of MSCs in lupus is unknown overall and safety unproven in non-Asian patients.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>This study adds assessment of MSC safety and immunological activities in a mixed ethnic cohort. The B cell and GARP changes following MSC infusion are novel and previously unreported. Although no efficacy assessments can be made from this phase I trial, the lack of attributable adverse events and the achievement of an SRI4 in 5/6 patients supports the need for further assessments of efficacy and toxicity in a larger controlled trial.</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>If further controlled trials show efficacy, given their safety profile, MSCs would be a new therapeutic approach to treating lupus with a better safety profile compared with current therapies. The extensive immunological studies also provide important insight into lupus pathogenesis and mechanisms of action of MSCs on the immune system.</p>

              <p>SLE is a heterogeneous disease affecting young women in their childbearing years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The hallmark of disease is production of autoantibodies with immune complex deposition in target organs. Despite research progress and recent clinical trialsâ success, there is still a need for more effective safe treatments.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Current immunosuppressive and biological therapies have therapeutic effects, yet a significant number of lupus patients remain inadequately responsive to current therapies. An additional issue with current therapies is the side effect profile especially for women of childbearing potential.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Cellular therapies, such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are an emerging area of interest as to their therapeutic efficacy in immune diseases including lupus.</p>
              <p>MSCs are derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cords/placentas.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5â7</xref> Their local autologous use in plastic and orthopaedic surgery is proven beneficial.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> There is growing literature on the immune properties of MSCs and their use in immune-mediated diseases.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Trials of MSCs in refractory graft versus host disease (GvHD), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and lupus have had variable results.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12â17</xref> Most were uncontrolled trials with small numbers of participants. There is a benefit of MSCs for steroid refractory paediatric GvHD<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and local use in healing fistulas in Crohnâs disease.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The efficacy in other diseases remains unproven due to a lack of placebo-controlled trials.</p>
              <p>There are a number of publications regarding use of MSCs in refractory lupus from a single centre in Nanjing, China.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 20 21</xref> The reports provide both short-term and long-term follow-up of dozens of patients treated with MSCs. There was an overall response rate of 60%â65% at 6âmonths following a single MSC infusion of 1 million cells per kilogram. Long-term beneficial effects on disease activity were reported.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 21 22</xref> The patients primarily had lupus nephritis, but other manifestations of lupus were also improved. The length of response varied from 6 months to 5âyears.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> None were placebo controlled. The one controlled trial of MSCs in lupus nephritis, enrolling treatment naÃ¯ve patients, was small (18 patients) and based on a high response rate to cyclophosphamide alone versus cyclophosphamide plus MSCs did not detect an added benefit of MSCs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>MSCs advantages are they are easily obtained, have a low side effect profile and can be given without histocompatibility matching or preconditioning.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The reported âimmune privilegeâ of MSCs is based on their not expressing MHC Class II or immune cofactors, rendering them initially hidden from the host immune system.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> There are literally dozens of proposed mechanisms for the immune effects of MSCs, though none are proven in humans.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref></p>
              <p>Due to the promising results out of China, we initiated studies of MSCs in lupus, starting with murine models, that demonstrated efficacy of MSCs from human controls in reducing renal disease.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Allogeneic MSCs were used in this phase I trial as autologous MSCs from lupus patients are not as immune active as allogeneic MSCs.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In a limited study of autologous bone marrow MSCs, two lupus patients did not have a beneficial effect on their disease.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Based on the lack of definitive evidence of MSC efficacy and lack of safety data in non-Asian patients, we performed a phase I safety trial in treatment refractory lupus in a multiethnic cohort as a stepping stone to a larger phase II efficacy trial. Assessing safety and potential mechanistic effects are an important first step in development of a new therapy.</p>

                <title>Preparation of UC MSCs</title>
                <p>The MSCs were derived from UCs of two healthy donors under FDA IND 16377. The donors were mothers in the OB/GYN clinic undergoing elective C-sections. After informed consent, the motherâs blood was tested using the infectious testing battery required for allogeneic bone marrow donors within 1âweek of delivery. ANA screening was done. Potential donors were excluded if they had personal or family history of autoimmune disease or any positives on infectious and autoimmune testing of their blood. The cords came from one male and one female infant. The UCs were obtained using sterile technique and transported to the MUSC Center for Cellular Therapy. The derived cord cells were plated and incubated in a minimal essential medium (MEM, GIBCO) with glutamine and 10% sterile pooled human platelet lysate (Cook Regenec Inc). Aliquots were tested for bacterial, fungal, endotoxin and mycoplasma. MSC immune potency was measured by T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma induced IDO expression.

                <p>Patients had a historical presence of at least 4 of 11 of the ACR Lupus Classification Criteria.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Further inclusion criteria included: age between 18 and 65 years old, either sex, any race, evidence of a positive ANA (â¥1:80 titre) or positive dsDNA antibody test within 6 months of screening, clinically active SLE determined by SLEDAI score â¥6âand â¤12 and the presence of one BILAG A or one BILAG B at screening, despite standard of care (SOC) therapy. If the BILAG A or the BILAG B was in the renal organ system, the patient must have completed 6 months with either mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. Non-nephritis patients had active disease despite 3 months of SOC therapy. Patients were able and willing to give written consent.

There were no lab-related AEs in the six participants. One patient dropped out (patient 3) and was treated with rituximab by her primary rheumatologist 4âmonths post-MSC infusion for refractory symptoms. Her SAE was an anaphylactic reaction to the rituximab. She lived in California and did not want to make the cross-country trips post-week 8. This was the only SAE in the trial and was judged not due to MSC treatment given a prior history of multiple anaphylactic reactions to intravenous medications.

All the participants had increased titres of anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60 and anti-RNP greater than control. Participants 5 and 6 had titres of anti-Sm elevated above control. In participants 2 and 6, there was a log-fold decrease in anti-Ro60 antibodies between week 0 and week 4 that remained through week 24. Other titres remained stable over the time of the study. The assay for these measures is the LIP assay, which has a broader dynamic range than standard ELISA measures perhaps explaining the changes seen in these assays over time.</p>

                  <p>GARP is a cell surface protein that is a repository for latent TGFb and plays a key regulatory/tolerance role in immunity via modulating TGFÎ² activation.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is primarily expressed on platelets, Tregs, activated B cells and MSCs.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> Lack of GARP expression on murine B cells or Treg cells resulted in lupus-like autoimmunity.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We postulated that GARP was involved in the impact of MSCs on the immune response. We assessed the presence of soluble GARPâTGFÎ² complexes in the serum of lupus patients from our biorepository that were not in the trial. There was a significant (p=0.023) decrease in serum levels of circulating GARPâTGFÎ² complexes in lupus patients versus controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3D</xref>). We then assessed if there was a correlation between circulating GARP-TGFÎ² levels and disease activity in these biobank patients. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>, there was a significant inverse correlation (p=0.034) between serum levels of soluble GARP-latency-associated peptide (LAP) and SLEDAI scores in patients with active disease (SLEDAIs &gt;10). In <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3E</xref>, prior to infusion, serum GARP levels were undetectable in the six participants. At week 4, GARP-TGFÎ² serum levels were significantly increased from baseline in all patients. At week 8, levels fell in all the patients but remained above baseline. At week 24, there was an upward rebound or stability of GARP levels in four of the five patients that completed the study (1, 2, 3 and 5).</p>

              <p>This phase I trial is the first of allogeneic MSCs performed in multiethnic lupus patients. The results indicate that infusion of allogeneic UC MSCs appears safe short term, as we had no serious adverse events that were attributed to the UC MSC infusions, and all the AEs were grade 2 or less. We were encouraged that five of the six patients treated met the primary endpoint of an SRI 4, justifying performing the phase II double-blind multicentre efficacy study currently in progress. We were also encouraged by the marked B cell changes and increased serum GARP-TGFÎ² measures noted indicating the MSCs had a systemic immune effect paralleling the clinical effects.</p>
              <p>The patients in this trial were of mixed ethnicity with a range of ages. The patients had variable lupus manifestations. The prior studies in China by Dr Sun included patients with primarily refractory lupus nephritis, but also included patients with significant hematological involvement and pulmonary haemorrhage.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 21 22</xref> In a recent review of his cohort, Dr Sun reported that younger male patients and those with musculoskeletal symptoms were not as responsive to UC MSC infusion as other lupus manifestations.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>The duration of response is variable in the reports from Dr Sunâs group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 21 22</xref> He reported a 65%â70%âearly âresponseâ rate with a long-term response rate of 4â5 years in the 25% range. A limited number of patients in his cohort are beyond 5âyears with minimal disease activity. Of the five âresponsiveâ patients in our trial, one remains with minimal disease activity out 3â4 years from their one-time infusion (participant 6). The other four patients had a full or partial flare of their disease from 18 months to 30 months post-single infusion. The response of participant 1 to retreatment was consistent with prior data from Dr Sunâs group reflecting retreatment is often successful.</p>
              <p>There are prior reported trials of MSCs in human lupus; seven used allogeneic derived cells and one used autologous bone marrow-derived cells.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 40â42</xref> All but two trials were done in China. There is only one âplacebo-controlled trialâ of MSCs in lupus nephritis patients that were new onset and untreated comparing MSCs plus cyclophosphamide to cyclophosphamide alone.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 43</xref> The other two reports of MSCs in lupus were case reports from Europe, one using autologous cells that showed no improvement.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> A more recent paper described compassionate use of UC MSCs in three woman with class IV lupus nephritis.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> They reported a complete remission in two patients and a partial remission in a third.</p>
              <p>The only large placebo-controlled trials reported to date of MSCs in allo and autoimmune diseases used MSCs for treating Crohnâs disease and GvHD. The method of derivation and validation of the cells were not described. The MSCs however were late passages and were infused post-thawing, both of which are known to impact MSC functionality. These trials showed trends towards efficacy but did not meet their target endpoint. These failures are likely due to the quality of the cells but led some to postulate MSCs are not effective in immune-mediated diseases.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> There is demonstrated efficacy of MSCs in treating steroid refractory GvHD in paediatric patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow. MSCs are approved to treat GvHD in paediatrics in Canada, Japan and New Zealand. MSCs given by direct injection into the local area is approved to treat refractory fistulas in Crohnâs patients in the European Union.</p>
              <p>Patients in our trial were on hydroxychloroquine, prednisone and different immunosuppressants. Due to lack of response, two patients had their immunosuppressants discontinued prior to entry into the study. In this limited series, nor in the Sun trials, was there any indication of effects of concomitant medications on responses to MSCs. The impact of concomitant medications on response to MSC therapy is unresolved though data to date suggest a minor if any effect.</p>
              <p>There are a number of unanswered questions regarding UC MSCs in lupus. The first is how variable are UC MSCs between donors in their efficacy. In this series, we did not see a differential response between the recipients of the two different cord cell lots. In our preclinical studies in lupus-prone mice, we used four different bone marrow donors from controls and three from lupus patients.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The MSCs from controls were more effective in preventing disease progression in the mice than were lupus-derived MSCs. The lupus-derived MSCs had induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression by gamma interferon and suppressed stimulated T cell proliferation similar to cells from controls. They were, however, not as effective in preventing B cell proliferation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Given the prevalence difference in men versus women, one could speculate MSCs derived from males would be more effective than females. We have insufficient numbers to suggest there are differences in MSCs depending on sex of the donor. Defects in lupus MSCs are increasingly reported in vitro<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45â47</xref>; definitive studies of differences in in vivo efficacy of different MSC preparations are lacking. Studies comparing bone marrow-derived versus adipocyte-derived versus UC-derived suggest subtle differences in function, but no definitive data that one source is superior in in vivo trials in humans. We used UC MSCs due to their ready availability, rapid growth characteristics and the ability to treat multiple patients with one cord (&gt;90).</p>
              <p>It is clear in humans that following intravenous infusion the majority of the cells are trapped in the lung, but how long they remain viable is unknown.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> It is not known whether the MSCs have to migrate to the affected organ for cell-to-cell interactions for effect or if MSC derived endosomes/cytokines are sufficient.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref> In studies in mice infused with human cells, there are reports of a short half-life for the MSCs, while others, including our group, found evidence of MSC survival in target organs for weeks postinfusion.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The only human study of MSC survival looked for HLA mismatched MSCs at autopsy of patients having undergone MSC infusion for GvHD.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> MSCs could be detected in different organs weeks after the MSC infusion. Whether cells that are MHC matched or closely matched are preferable to mismatched cells is also unclear, though the âimmune privilegeâ reported for MSCs is time limited.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Alloreactivity postinfusion is variable and may or may not enhance MSC effects.</p>
              <p>As controversial as is the efficacy of MSCs, the mechanisms by which they impact disease is also unclear. In vitro data indicate that MSCs can suppress the activity of almost every immune cell, while enhancing regulatory B and T cells. A host of mediators are secreted by MSCs including IDO, NO, PGE2, TGFÎ², IL10, Factor H and hepatic growth factor.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53â55</xref> MSC cell surface molecules such as GARP and FLT3L are postulated to interact with host immune cells impacting proliferation, differentiation and activity.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 56</xref> Others showed in mice that MSCs are engulfed by resident macrophages inducing a tolerogenic anti-inflammatory phenotype that prolongs the efficacy of MSCs. MSCs are ineffective in mice lacking macrophages.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56 57</xref> At the cellular level, as noted previously, MSCs are reported to increase Tregs and Bregs while decreasing Th17 cells, TfH cells and inducing a Th1 to Th2 shift possibly via TGFÎ² effects.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Enhancing development of CD1c+ tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) via expression of FLT3L by MSCs was reported, enhancing IFNÎ³ production by CD8+ T cells.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Although all of the previously mentioned may contribute, the actual defining mechanisms remain unknown.</p>
              <p>Although we did not note any significant changes in the T cell compartment other than in two patients, we did find marked changes in the B cell compartment. The significant effect on DN B cells, aN B cells and switched (SW) B cells was not reported in published MSC studies. The importance of these findings is supported by the correlation of SLEDAI scores and changes in B cell subsets. The DN B cells and activated naÃ¯ve cells are increased in active lupus and are believed to be precursors of autoantibody producing cells in lupus.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Epigenetic analysis of these DN B cells in lupus patients revealed they are primed to respond to TLR ligands, especially TLR7.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The changes in ENA autoantibodies is of note, given the reported stability of these antibodies despite therapy. The technique used in this study was the LIP assay which has a broader detection range than standard clinical assays allowing better detection of changes in antibody levels.</p>
              <p>It is unclear if the effect of MSCs on B cells is a direct effect or an indirect effect. The impact on B cells appears less likely to be due to T cell effects since we saw evidence of a T cell change in only two patients, while the B cell effect was present in all five responders. Based on the known expression of GARP on MSCs and a prominent role for GARP in tolerance and autoimmunity in mice,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> we assessed GARP-TGFÎ² levels in participants in this trial. When a GARP bearing cell interacts with another cell that expresses GARP, expression of GARP is increased on both cells.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This affect may explain the rebound of GARP-TGFÎ² levels at 24 weeks or may reflect the improvement in disease activity in patients with resultant increased GARP-TGFÎ² expression.</p>
              <p>If future larger trials prove significant efficacy of MSCs in treating lupus, where would such treatment fit into the treatment algorithm of lupus. Producing the cells can be done given 90â100 patients can be treated with a single cord, and a number of companies and institutions are developing the ability to produce MSCs for human use. Given the safety, the ease of infusion and the length of response, if MSCs are shown to have equal or superior efficacy to current treatments, acceptance and use of MSCs in lupus will likely be broad.</p>
