                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Novel combination therapies to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance are required. Enadenotucirev, a tumor-selective blood stable adenoviral vector, has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and ability to increase tumor immune-cell infiltration in phase I studies in solid tumors.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a phase I multicenter study of intravenous enadenotucirev plus nivolumab in patients with advanced/metastatic epithelial cancer not responding to standard therapy. Co-primary objectives were safety/tolerability and maximum tolerated dose and/or maximum feasible dose (MTD/MFD) of enadenotucirev plus nivolumab. Additional endpoints included response rate, cytokine responses, and anti-tumor immune responses.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Overall, 51 heavily pre-treated patients were treated, 45/51 (88%) of whom had colorectal cancer (35/35 patients with information available were microsatellite instability-low/microsatellite stable) and 6/51 (12%) had squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The MTD/MFD of enadenotucirev plus nivolumab was not reached, with the highest dose level tested (1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp day 1; 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp days 3 and 5) shown to be tolerable. Overall, 31/51 (61%) patients experienced a grade 3â4 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), most frequently anemia (12%), infusion-related reaction (8%), hyponatremia (6%), and large intestinal obstruction (6%). Seven (14%) patients experienced serious TEAEs related to enadenotucirev; the only serious TEAE related to enadenotucirev occurring in &gt;1 patient was infusion-related reaction (n=2). Among the 47 patients included in efficacy analyses, median progression-free survival was 1.6 months, objective response rate was 2% (one partial response for 10 months), and 45% of patients achieved stable disease. Median overall survival was 16.0 months; 69% of patients were alive at 12 months. Persistent increases in Th1 and related cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL-12p70, IL-17A) were seen from ~day 15 in two patients, one of whom had a partial response. Among the 14 patients with matching pre-tumor and post-tumor biopsies, 12 had an increase in intra-tumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration and 7 had increased markers of CD8 T-cell cytolytic activity.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Intravenously dosed enadenotucirev plus nivolumab demonstrated manageable tolerability, an encouraging overall survival and induced immune cell infiltration and activation in patients with advanced/metastatic epithelial cancer. Studies of next-generation variants of enadenotucirev (T-SIGn vectors) designed to further re-program the tumor microenvironment by expressing immune-enhancer transgenes are ongoing.</p>

                    <p>The efficacy of single-agent immunotherapy has been suboptimal in numerous cancer types, particularly those typically characterized as having tumor microenvironments lacking T-cell infiltration. Therefore, a critical need remains to identify new therapeutic combinations that can modify the tumor microenvironment and promote favorable immune responses.</p>

                    <p>The results of this study suggest that enadenotucirev is a promising tumor-selective viral platform that can be used to create vectors that encode immunostimulatory payloads to increase tumor microenvironment re-programming and clinical efficacy.

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors are considered a key facet of treatment algorithms in a range of cancer indications. However, despite driving meaningful improvements in outcomes since their introduction, more than half of patients with solid tumors do not experience an objective response following treatment with PD-1 inhibitors.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1â4</xref> Response rates are particularly low among patients with cancers typically characterized by immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments that lack T-cell infiltration, for example, microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), even when combined with other investigational therapies.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Even for those patients who do respond, secondary resistance and disease progression typically occur eventually.</p>
              <p>Enadenotucirev is a group B Ad11p/Ad3 chimeric adenoviral vector that was generated by directed evolution to have potent tumor-selective replication and cytotoxicity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Enadenotucirev has a high level of stability in human blood<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and selectively replicates in cells derived from epithelial tumors, leading to local amplification and specific killing of malignant cells by a rapid non-apoptotic immunogenic mechanism.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> While enadenotucirev has no inserted transgenes, clinical studies of modified variants known as âTumor-Specific Immuno Gene Therapyâ (T-SIGn) vectors are ongoing. Results from previous phase I studies of enadenotucirev in epithelial malignancies have demonstrated that intravenous dosing of enadenotucirev leads to selective and sustained delivery, with evidence of viral persistence ~7 weeks after dosing,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and a manageable tolerability profile.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â11</xref> In addition, enadenotucirev appears to stimulate tumor immune-cell infiltration.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11</xref></p>
              <p>In murine models, tumor-selective viruses have been shown to reverse tumor insensitivity to checkpoint inhibitors (CTLA-4 blockade)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and have been shown to reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors by eliciting a broader spectrum of cytotoxic T-cell responses to tumor-associated antigens.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Combining a checkpoint inhibitor with a tumor-selective virus such as enadenotucirev may provide a unique ability to increase the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor. Therefore, we conducted a phase I dose-escalation study of enadenotucirev, in combination with nivolumab, in patients with advanced/metastatic epithelial cancer.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study (NCT02636036) included phase Ia and 1b dose escalation and dose expansion stages. However, the study was terminated early prior to opening of the dose expansion stage. Dose escalation in phase Ia was conducted using a standard â3+3â design, with patients receiving increasing dose levels and/or cycles of enadenotucirev in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. A total of seven cohorts of patients were enrolled. Patients in cohort 1 were to receive up to 6 cycles of enadenotucirev in combination with pembrolizumab (1âmg/kg every 3âweeks). A study amendment replaced pembrolizumab with nivolumab, for non-safety related reasons, from cohort 2 onward. Patients in cohorts 2â7A were to receive up to 8 cycles of treatment involving 1â2 cycles of enadenotucirev and up to 8 cycles of nivolumab (360âmg every 3âweeks). Patients could receive additional cycles of nivolumab beyond cycle 8, with the Sponsorâs agreement and provided that the Investigator believed that the potential benefits outweighed the potential risks.

                  <p>The reporting period for all adverse events (AEs) began on the date informed consent was provided and continued until at least 100 days after the last administration of any study treatment. The incidence, type, and severity of AEs were characterized using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. A Safety Review Committee composed of an independent oncologist, all Principal Investigators or their delegates, and medically qualified representatives of the Sponsors reviewed all safety data (including any dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)) and determined whether additional patients were enrolled at the current dose level or whether a higher dose level cohort was opened. During the 42-day DLT period, any of the following toxicities were defined as DLTs if they were considered at least possibly attributed to enadenotucirev, whether given as monotherapy or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor: grade â¥3ânon-hematological toxicity except for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) prolongation, nausea, fatigue, headache, and chills (grade â¥3 nausea, headache, and chills lasting &gt;3âdays and grade â¥3 fatigue lasting &gt;7âdays were considered DLTs); grade â¥3 infusion reaction that did not resolve within 72 hours with appropriate treatment; grade 3 hematological toxicities lasting &gt;3âdays and grade 4 hematological adverse event or laboratory abnormality (with the exception of grade 4 lymphocytopenia, amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations); clotting event (ie, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) occurring concurrently with grade 2 or 3 aPTT prolongation; clinically significant bleeding event (requiring blood transfusion or hospitalization) occurring concurrently with grade 2 or 3 aPTT prolongation (unless there was a clear explanation for the event, such as tumor-related bleeding); any toxicity managed by discontinuation of nivolumab.</p>

                <p>Patient disposition is summarized in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. Overall, 34/51 (67%) of patients received all planned doses of enadenotucirev. Most patients received at least one cycle/dose of pembrolizumab or nivolumab (48/51 [94%]), with nine patients receiving â¥8 cycles. Median number of cycles of pembrolizumab or nivolumab was 3 (range: 0 to 23).</p>

                <p>Three patients were enrolled to receive enadenotucirev 1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp (days 1, 3, and 5; up to 6 cycles) in combination with pembrolizumab (cohort 1). DLTs were reported in 2/3 patients treated in cohort 1. Following review of the cohort 1 data by the Safety Review Committee, the study design was modified to reduce the number of cycles of enadenotucirev from six to a maximum of two. In addition, pembrolizumab was switched for nivolumab from cohort 2 onwards (non-safety-related decision); patients in cohorts 2â7A all received enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab. Cohort 2 (1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on days 1, 3, and 5 (1 cycle); n=3) and cohort 3 (3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on days 1, 3, and 5 (1 cycle); n=3) completed with no DLTs. A total 9 patients were enrolled in cohort 4 (1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on days 1, 3, and 5 (2 cycles)); enrollment into cohort 3 and cohort 4 was in parallel. Following a DLT of hypoxia in cohort 4, a dosing schedule modification was introduced for cohort 6 to administer all six doses of virus in cycle 1. In addition, prophylactic treatment with steroids and diphenhydramine was implemented in the study on enadenotucirev dosing days to help minimize acute reactions to viral particle infusion. Cohorts 5 and 6 enrolled patients at the same 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp dose but with differing schedules (cohort 5: dosing on days 1, 3, and 5 (2 cycles); cohort 6: dosing on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 (1 cycle)). DLTs occurred in 2/10 and 1/9 patients, respectively. A dose of 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp was considered tolerable, but the implementation of additional renal monitoring was recommended, with guidance to hold administration of enadenotucirev should proteinuria be detected, and the use of a âlow-high-highâ dosing regimen (where a lower dose is given on day 1, followed by higher doses on days 3 and 5). Subsequently, a total of 14 patients were enrolled in cohort 7A (1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp (day 1) followed by 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âor 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp ((days 3 and 5); n=7 per dose level). One DLT was reported in cohort 7A. Both dose schedules were deemed tolerable; thus, a MTD of enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab was not determined. A decision was made to halt further enrollment due to limited clinical activity noted on study and the low likelihood of observing additional clinical signals from further escalation.</p>
                <p>Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) classified as DLTs were reported in 7/51 (14%) patients. A total of four DLTs (acute cardiac failure, infusion-related reaction, acute kidney injury, and hypoxia) were also considered serious adverse events (SAEs). Further DLTs that were not considered SAEs included grade 3 fatigue (n=1; event occurred in the same patient with acute cardiac failure), grade 3 hypoxia (n=1), and grade 1 proteinuria (n=2).</p>

                <p>Thirteen patients (25%) experienced a total of 23 serious TEAEs. The serious TEAEs reported in the highest proportion of patients were sepsis, infusion-related reaction, acute kidney injury, and small intestinal obstruction (2 patients (4%) each); all other serious TEAEs were reported for a single patient only. The only serious TEAE related to enadenotucirev reported in more than one patient was infusion-related reaction (n=2).</p>
                <p>Overall, 12/51 patients (24%) had TEAEs leading to discontinuation of enadenotucirev. The only TEAEs leading to discontinuation of enadenotucirev that were reported in more than one patient were hypoxia, proteinuria, and infusion-related reaction (all n=2).</p>
                <p>In response to a DLT of acute kidney injury early in the enrollment to cohort 5, acute kidney injury was considered to be a key safety signal and additional renal monitoring was implemented to help manage and mitigate against the risk. Throughout the course of the study, 34/51 (67%) patients had a urine protein dipstick result of 1+ or greater (CTCAE grade 1); of these 34 patients, 4 had a maximum result of 3+ and 1 had a maximum result of 4+. By end of study, proteinuria had resolved to &lt;1+ in 18/34 (53%) patients. Serious TEAEs related to the risk of acute kidney injury were reported in 3/51 (6%) patients; one case was deemed to be secondary to obstruction from a tumor and therefore unrelated to study treatment.</p>
                <p>Overall, 23/51 patients experienced â¥grade 2 aPTT prolongation at any time point during the study. By day 57, aPTT was normal or grade 1 in 33/38 patients with data available. Of the patients with prolongation, a positive result on antiphospholipid antibody (APLA) tests was seen in all three patients tested. Two of the three patients tested for APLAs were also tested for anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein; both were negative on these tests. No apparent relationship between prolonged aPTT and clinical sequelae was seen.</p>

                  <p>Overall, the pattern of acute (days 1â5) cytokine responses to flat doses (ie, the same dose at all time points) of enadenotucirev in peripheral blood were as previously described (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 4</xref>).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Low-high-high dosing in cohort 7A appeared to allow higher doses of enadenotucirev (3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âand 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp) to be administered on days 3 and 5 without the associated acute cytokine reactions to viral infusions seen with flat dosing at these levels. Cytokine responses with 1-3-3 dosing (1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on day 1; 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on days 3 and 5), including after the first 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp dose on day 3, were negligible. Cytokine responses after the first dose of 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp in the 1-6-6 regimen were similar to those seen with the first dose of the flat 3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp regimen.</p>
                  <p>Persistent increases in Th1 and related cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL-12p70, IL-17A) were seen from ~day 15 in two patients from cohort 7A (one at 1-3-3 and one at 1-6-6), one of whom was classed as having a BoR of PR (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 5</xref>). Increases were sustained out to day 91 and day 544 (patient with PR), respectively. The small sample numbers limit further interpretation of these data but provides evidence of potential sustained enadenotucirev-mediated immune responses.</p>

              <p>This phase I study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and MTD of enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced/metastatic epithelial cancer. In total, 88% of patients enrolled in this study had a primary diagnosis of CRC. Notably, the CRC tumor microenvironment is typically characterized as having a wound healing immune phenotype, defined as infiltrated with anti-inflammatory macrophages and Th2 cells.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> CRC is thus regarded as resistant to immunotherapy, as evidenced by lack of responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitors.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref></p>
              <p>This study demonstrated that intravenous enadenotucirev has a manageable tolerability profile when administered in combination with nivolumab. The frequency and type of AEs seen were largely consistent with previous enadenotucirev monotherapy studies suggesting no additive toxicity with nivolumab.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9â11</xref> In addition, the safety profile with one versus two cycles of enadenotucirev was similar. The maximum dose of enadenotucirev administered in this study (6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp as part of a 1-6-6 regimen) in combination with nivolumab was deemed tolerable. Thus, a MTD of enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab was not determined. Administration of enadenotucirev using a âlow-high-highâ dosing schedule allowed higher doses of enadenotucirev (3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âand 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp) to be administered on days 3 and 5 without the cytokine response associated with flat dosing at these levels. A dosing regimen of 1Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on day 1 followed by 6Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp on days 3 and 5 is greater than the previously determined MTD of enadenotucirevâ3Ã10<sup>12</sup>âvp when administered in a âflatâ dosing regimen.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>In response to a DLT of acute kidney injury early in the enrollment to cohort 5, additional renal monitoring was implemented to help manage and mitigate against the risk of acute kidney injury. Notably, while proteinuria was recorded in a large proportion of patients in this study (67%), this was generally grade 1 or 2, transient, and not associated with clinical sequelae. A platform analysis of cases of acute kidney injury with enadenotucirev and related vectors has since revealed a pattern consistent with a diagnosis of post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Monitoring and risk mitigations have been successfully implemented in ongoing studies of T-SIGn vectors. Mitigation measures include frequent monitoring for proteinuria, blood pressure, and complement C3/C4, with prompt use of systemic corticosteroid therapy and nephrology referral if post-infectious glomerulonephritis is suspected. In addition, patients with prior grade 3â4 acute kidney injury or other clinically significant renal impairment are not considered eligible for T-SIGn studies.</p>
              <p>During this study, a signal for frequently prolonged aPTT without discernible clinical sequelae was identified. Further analysis of this signal identified a pattern consistent with the presence of transient APLAs,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which is a phenomenon known to occur following wild-type virus infection<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> or treatment/vaccination with viral vectors.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22â24</xref> Infection-induced APLAs are generally transient and not associated with thrombotic risk<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and therefore do not meet the criteria established for diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Based on the literature, the general level of risk of bleeding and clotting from infection-related APLAs is low, and therefore the risk to patients in clinical studies of enadenotucirev or other related vectors is believed to be small.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>Median PFS and ORR among patients with CRC in this study were similar to those seen in previous studies with regorafenib and immune checkpoint inhibitors in similar patient populations.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 26</xref> A single patient achieved PR (duration of response: 9.8 months); this patient also demonstrated persistent increases in inflammatory cytokines (IFNÎ³, IL-12p70, IL-17A) from ~day 15, sustained out to day 544 (last measurement). Core needle biopsies were not available for the patient who achieved PR.</p>
              <p>Median OS was longer in the SPICE study (16âmonths) than in the CORRECT study (median OS 6.4âmonths with regorafenib; 12-month OS rate 24%),<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with metastatic CRC (range across studies: median OS 6.2â8.9âmonths).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> However, these data should be interpreted with caution for a number of reasons including differing patient populations and the potential impact of post-progression therapy, which was not available in detail following study treatment progression.</p>
              <p>Enadenotucirev genomic DNA was detected in 19% patients with post-dose biopsies available (cycle 2âdays 8â15); these data, together with those from previous studies,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> demonstrate that enadenotucirev can be effectively delivered intravenously with localization to tumors. The small size of core needle biopsies in this study and heterogenous nature of viral infection likely explain why the presence of virus or evidence of viral replication were not detected in small core needle biopsies from all patients.</p>
              <p>Encouragingly, data from this study have shown that enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab can induce immune cell infiltration and activation in some patients, with a high proportion of evaluable patients showing increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration (12/14âpatients) and markers of T-cell cytolytic activity (7/14âpatients) in post-treatment biopsies. Pro-inflammatory tumor phenotypes have been shown to have a prognostic impact in cancer.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In addition, infiltration of immune cells into the tumor, immune cell activation, and immune cell proliferation have been identified as predictors of response to immunotherapy.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Despite this, no relationship between CD8 T-cell infiltration and response or OS was seen in this small immature data set. These data highlight that in advanced cancer population, immune activation alone may not be sufficient to induce a response and that further targeting of resistance pathways and tumor intrinsic factors may be required.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study demonstrated that intravenous enadenotucirev has a manageable tolerability profile when administered in combination with nivolumab. Enadenotucirev in combination with nivolumab demonstrated encouraging OS and induced immune cell infiltration and activation in this patient population, the majority of whom had MSS/MSI-L CRC. Together, these results suggest that enadenotucirev is a promising tumor-selective platform that can be further adapted to create viral vectors which encode immunostimulatory payloads to increase tumor microenvironment re-programming and clinical efficacy. Studies of next-generation variants of enadenotucirev (T-SIGn vectors) designed to further re-program the tumor microenvironment by expressing immune-enhancer transgenes are ongoing.</p>
