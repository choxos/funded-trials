                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Acute seizures are common in pediatric cerebral malaria (CM), but usual care with phenobarbital risks respiratory suppression. We undertook studies of enteral levetiracetam (eLVT) to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy including an open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing eLVT to phenobarbital.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Children 24–83 months old with CM were enrolled in an eLVT dose-finding study starting with standard dose (40 mg/kg load, then 30 mg/kg Q12 hours) titrated upward until seizure freedom was attained in 75% of subjects.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The RCT that followed randomized children to eLVT vs. phenobarbital for acute seizures and compared the groups on minutes with seizures based upon continuous electroencephalogram. Due to safety concerns, midway through the study children allocated to phenobarbital received the drug only if they continued to have seizures (either clinically or electrographically) after benzodiazepine treatment. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure requiring cross over, coma duration and neurologic sequelae at discharge. PK and safety assessments were also undertaken.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Among 30 comatose CM children, eLVT was rapidly absorbed and well-tolerated. eLVT clearance was lower in patients with higher admission serum creatinine (SCr), but overall PK parameters were similar to prior pediatric PK studies. Within 4 h of the first dose, 90% reached therapeutic levels (&gt; 20 μg/mL) and all were above 6 μg/mL. 7/7 children achieved seizure freedom on the initial eLVT dose.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Comparing 23 eLVT to 21 phenobarbital patients among whom 15/21 received phenobarbital, no differences were seen for minutes with seizure, seizure freedom, coma duration, neurologic sequelae or death, but eLVT was safer (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019). Phenobarbital was discontinued in 3/15 due to respiratory side effects.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par6">Enteral LVT offers an affordable option for seizure control in pediatric CM and is safer than phenobarbital.</p>

              <p id="Par30">Cerebral malaria (CM) primarily affects African children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Between 15 and 25% of CM children die and a third of survivors suffer neurologic sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Seizures, a common complication, are also a risk factor for post-CM brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CM-associated seizures are prolonged, repetitive, focal, and refractory with subclinical seizures occurring in 18–47% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Seizure management is challenging because phenobarbital and benzodiazepines remain the primary treatments, respiratory suppression is a common complication of both medications, and ventilatory support is generally unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Management of CM-associated seizures in most malarial regions entails some degree of tolerance for ongoing seizure activity due to the risk of respiratory compromise and death with aggressive use of phenobarbital. Whether levetiracetam is effective in this environment for acute symptomatic seizures has been identified by the World Health Organization as a top research priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">Even a short course of parenteral LVT is cost prohibitive in low income settings, but a 3-day supply of LVT oral solution for a 10 kg child is &lt;$15. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of enteral LVT (eLVT) in healthy subjects indicate excellent bioavailability with rapid absorption, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] but aspiration risks in comatose children are unknown. Pharmacokinetics are linear in children from 20 to 60 mg/kg/day. LVT is &lt; 10% protein-bound, 66% of the dose is renally excreted unchanged, and 24% undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis. Metabolites are inactive and renally excreted. LVT clearance is reduced with impaired renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">We undertook a series of studies to evaluate the safety, PK properties and efficacy of eLVT for acute CM seizure management in children including (1) PK evaluations in a dose-escalation study to identify a potentially effective dose for CM seizures, (2) safety assessments, and (3) an open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing eLVT to phenobarbital. Given the ubiquitous nature of subclinical seizures in CM, efficacy was based upon ‘minutes with seizure’ using continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring. Duration of coma and neurologic sequelae at discharge were secondary outcomes. Children with seizures, either clinically or electrographically, after the allocated treatment crossed over or received the alternate agent.</p>

                  <p id="Par39">Four dose strata of eLVT with a maximum of 8 subjects per strata were prespecified. The initial dose was 40 mg/kg load, then 30 mg/kg Q12 hours for 72 h. Stopping was indicated if mortality plus grade 3 or 4 suspected adverse drug reactions (SADR) exceeded the ward baseline mortality rate of 16%. LVT serum levels were measured at time (t) = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 h. LVT oral solution (100 mg/ml) was administered via NGT until the child was able to take LVT orally.</p>

                  <title>RCT</title>
                  <p id="Par40">Children allocated to eLVT received the optimal dose identified in the Dose-Escalation Study for 72 h. PK data were assessed at t = 0, 7, 24 h and 4–40 h after the last dose. If clinical or electrographic seizures recurred/continued after the initial eLVT dose, an LVT level at time of failure was captured, escalation to the next dosing strata occurred, and the more frequent PK assessments were conducted (t = 0, 1.5, 4, 12, 24, 36, 40, and 84 h). Benzodiazepines (maximum 2 doses/24 h) were given as needed for breakthrough seizures to allow time for eLVT absorption.</p>
                  <p id="Par41">The dose escalation study was designed to identify the dose which would be effective for most patients but did not delineate what dose of eLVT might benefit a child with refractory seizures/status epilepticus. Escalating therapy for any selected antiepileptic is the commonest approach to treating refractory seizures. Thus, given the established safety profile of eLVT in other populations, data from other populations indicating that higher doses can be beneficial for refractory seizures, our ability to rapidly cross over to PB if higher dose LVT was ineffective and the value of having additional insights into the clinical and pharmacokinetic effects of escalating eLVT in this population, dose escalation of eLVT was undertaken for those children who failed standard dose.</p>
                  <p id="Par42">In RCT year 1, children randomized to ‘usual care’ received phenobarbital 20 mg/kg load, then 5 mg/kg Q12 hours for 72 h. In RCT year 2, the Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) recommended that children randomized to ‘usual care’ receive phenobarbital only if they experienced post enrollment seizures (clinical or electrographic) unresponsive to diazepam or paraldehyde. Children who continued to have seizures after receiving the allocated treatment were given the alternative therapy for rescue.</p>

                  <title>PK studies</title>
                  <p id="Par43">High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method determined LVT levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. PK data were analyzed using a mixed-effects population approach using the computer program NONMEM (ver. 7.2 Icon, Dublin) and the First Order Conditional Estimation (FOCE) method. Size was incorporated into the model using a standard allometric approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Due to the limited study sample size, an exploratory analysis of potential covariates was limited to age, liver function tests and SCr. Reduction in the PK model objective function of at least 7.88 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) was required for inclusion into the final PK model. A 1000 replicate bootstrap analysis of the final model was performed using Wings v 7.4 to determine the parameter confidence interval. Monte Carlo simulations (15,000 virtual subjects) of the final model and dosing were performed to determine the frequency of achieving trough concentrations 6–20 g/mL.</p>
                  <p id="Par44">Since a key concern of eLVT administration in this population was adequate absorption, LVT concentrations collected early in the dose interval (&lt; 4 h after the prior dose) were compared to their (individual) predicted values. The early measured LVT concentrations that were less than 30% of predicted were defined as having slow absorption. Individual subject steady-state trough concentrations, area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F) and half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) were generated using a post hoc empiric Bayesian approach. In this analysis, doses defined as having slow absorption were modelled with an absorption lag time.</p>

EFFICACY ANALYSIS: Beginning with the initial LVT loading dose (40 mg/kg load, then 30 mg/kg Q12 hours), the target response was seizure freedom in 75% of participants in that stratum for 24 h. We estimated the probability <italic>p</italic> of target response by the proportion of study participants meeting the target response. If the estimate of <italic>p</italic> was less than 0.75, the next higher dose would be used in the next group of children and <italic>p</italic> is re-estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

The validity of normalcy was examined by graphical techniques, using histograms and QQ-plots.

Despite the modest number of subjects and samples, CL/F and V/F were estimated with good precision and no bias was evident based on the bootstrap analysis. The estimates for other parameters and between subject variability also were without apparent bias but had lower precision with large standard errors and broad 95% confidence intervals. SCr was found to be a powerful covariate for LVT apparent clearance (objective function reduction of 28.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par73">This is the first open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing eLVT to usual care with phenobarbital for treatment of acute seizures in resource-limited settings. Among 30 comatose CM children with recent clinical seizures, eLVT was rapidly absorbed and well tolerated. Overall eLVT PK parameters were similar to prior pediatric PK studies, but eLVT clearance was lower in patients with higher admission serum creatinine concentrations. Within 4 h of the first dose, 90% reached therapeutic levels, many reaching therapeutic levels quite rapidly. In the initial dose-finding study, 7/7 children receiving the first planned eLVT dose achieved seizure freedom. In the subsequent randomized comparison of eLVT to usual care patients, no differences were seen for minutes with seizure, seizure freedom, coma duration, neurologic sequelae or death. Although treatment assignment was open-label, the primary and secondary EEG/seizure outcome assessments were masked. eLVT was safer (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019) than phenobarbital, which was discontinued in 3/15 subjects due to respiratory side effects. eLVT therefore is a safe, efficacious, and affordable alternative to usual care for acute symptomatic seizures in this critically ill pediatric CM population who have a high risk of acute seizures, status epilepticus and seizure-associated neurologic sequelae.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Several limitations need to be kept in mind. First, this study provides no insights on eLVT safety in children with SCr &gt; 2 mg/dL. None of the 140 children screened for enrollment had a SCr &gt; 2.0 mg/dL. Caution is warranted in extrapolating the eLVT safety data here to eLVT use for acute symptomatic seizures from causes more often associated with comorbid renal insufficiency. Secondly, we had limited PK data in children with continuous electrographic seizures, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but one child who failed standard dose LVT received a higher loading dose while having continuous electrographic seizures and the PK data suggested absorption was delayed until after the seizure halted. Although some of the study subjects developed status epilepticus after enrollment, none of them had experienced status prior to enrollment. The exclusion of children who had received more than two doses of rescue benzodiazepines likely omitted this population from enrollment which may have made the study population less neurologically affected than the typical cerebral malaria population.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Mid-way through the study, the study protocol was amended at the Safety Monitoring Committee’s request based upon interim review of the data which, though not statistically significant at that time, suggested that the risk of respiratory suppression remained elevated in the PB exposed children despite the limitations on pre-enrollment benzodiazepines. This potentially affected the findings in two ways—first, withholding treatment until additional seizures occurred in the PB but not LVT group might have made the LVT treatment appear more efficacious than it would have been compared to PB if everyone in the PB comparison had actually received PB. As such, this study can only confirm that LVT is comparable to PB efficacy when PB is given for ongoing seizures that fail to respond to benzodiazepines. This Safety Monitoring Committee directed protocol change may also have impacted the study findings by making PB appear “safer” than it actually is when given for repetitive but not continuous seizures. This makes the safety findings of this study even more notable.</p>
              <p id="Par76">We also identified some potential issues related to eLVT usage among children with mild renal compromise. Since similar AEs occurred in PB allocated children with elevated admission SCr, modestly elevated admission creatinine is likely an indicator of underlying disease severity rather than high LVT concentrations causing AEs. In terms of efficacy, there was no difference between the LVT and phenobarbital for minutes with seizure, seizure freedom, coma duration, neurologic sequelae or death. The well-established respiratory safety constraints of phenobarbital were evident in this study. The only difference between LVT and usual care with phenobarbital was in the better safety profile of LVT. Given the superior safety profile of eLVT and the option of adding phenobarbital if eLVT proves ineffective, initial management with eLVT is warranted for CM-associated seizures.</p>

            <sec id="Sec30">
              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par77">In the setting of acute CM, eLVT is equally effective and has a more favorable side effect profile than intravenous phenobarbital. The availability of a safer ASD in resource-limited settings may result in fewer cases of untreated seizures, as clinicians may be understandably less concerned about inducing respiratory depression in these deeply comatose and critically ill children. Further studies are needed to determine if LVT can decrease neurologic sequelae in CM survivors. Brain injury occurs in ~ 135,000 child survivors of severe malaria in Africa each year. Affordable, effective neuroprotective interventions are certainly needed and would warrant changes in international malaria care guidelines.</p>

              <p>The authors wish to thank the children and their parents and guardians for participation in the study. The work would not have been possible without the many skilled nurses and clinicians who provided clinical care for the children on the Paediatric Research Ward. Infrastructural support for the Paediatric Research Ward was provided by the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Programme. We are also grateful to Dr. Andre Fenton (Bio-Signal Corporation) for his assistance in successfully incorporating microEEG technology into this work.</p>
