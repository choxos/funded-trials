                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Novel therapies for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are imperative, particularly for those with high-risk features. Selinexor, an exportin 1 (XPO1/CRM1) inhibitor, has demonstrated anti-leukemia activity as a single agent, as well as in combination with anthracyclines and/or DNA-damaging agents.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We report the findings of a phase I dose escalation trial with cohort expansion in 20 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory AML that combined selinexor with age-adjusted high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HiDAC/Mito).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Three (15%) patients received the initial dose of 60 mg of selinexor (~ 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and 17 (85%) received the target level of 80 mg (~ 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Common adverse events included febrile neutropenia (70%), diarrhea (40%), anorexia (30%), electrolyte abnormalities (30%), bacteremia (25%), cardiac toxicities (25%), fatigue (25%), and nausea/vomiting (25%). None were unexpected given the HiDAC/Mito regimen. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 (30%) patients; one was fatal. Ten (50%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 3 (15%) achieved CR with incomplete recovery (CRi), 1 (5%) achieved partial remission (PR), and 6 (30%) had progressive disease for an overall response rate (ORR) of 70%. Eight of 14 (57%) responders proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Correlative studies of WT1 levels showed persistently detectable levels in patients who either did not respond or relapsed quickly after induction.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The selinexor/HiDAC/Mito regimen is feasible and tolerable at selinexor doses of 80 mg/day (~ 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) twice weekly. The recommended phase II dose is 80 mg and warrants further study in this combination.</p>

              <p id="Par6">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults and is characterized by a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Even patients who achieve remission to initial therapy often relapse, and certain subgroups such as those with therapy-related AML, older patients, and those with relapsed or refractory disease have a particularly poor outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Novel agents that are active and able to be widely applied are imperative. Selinexor (KPT-330), an exportin 1 (XPO1) inhibitor, may be such an agent.</p>
              <p id="Par7">XPO1 is the exclusive, nuclear exporter of most major tumor suppressor proteins (TSP) and growth regulatory proteins (GRP), including p53, p21, p73, FOXO1, and NPM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In leukemia and solid tumors, XPO1 is overexpressed leading to enhanced transport of these proteins to the cytoplasm, thereby neutralizing their anti-neoplastic functions and functionally inactivating TSP/GRP. Elevated levels of XPO1 have been independently associated with a worse prognosis in adults with AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These findings presented an attractive target for the development of a novel class of XPO1 inhibitors. However, the earliest compounds of XPO1 inhibitors had faced significant toxicities in phase I clinical trials requiring discontinuation, while others were never studied in a clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Selinexor (KPT-330) is an oral, first-in-class, slowly reversible, and potent agent that was among the next group of selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds to be developed, which also included KPT-335, KPT-185, KPT-276, and KPT-251, many of which have since been studied in clinical trials. The SINE compounds bind to residue Cys528 of XPO1 and blocks the transport of cargo proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In both AML primary samples and murine xenograft models, SINE compounds have been shown to reduce XPO1 levels and enhance the nuclear accumulation of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A phase I clinical trial of selinexor in patients with advanced AML demonstrated it to have a manageable safety profile at 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (60 mg) and to be efficacious in a single-agent setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">In vivo and in vitro evidence suggest synergistic activity against leukemic cells by combining selinexor with anthracyclines or DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The combination of high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) with the anthracycline mitoxantrone (Mito) is an effective induction regimen for patients with AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is frequently utilized at the University of Chicago as frontline therapy for patients with high-risk AML, either de novo or relapsed/refractory. The HiDAC/Mito regimen demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% in the high-risk AML population at this institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and an ORR of 82% in another study of previously untreated patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Based on phase I safety and efficacy data of selinexor in patients with AML, the promising results with HiDAC/Mito induction, and the in vivo and in vitro data suggesting synergistic killing of AML cell lines by combining selinexor and anthracyclines, we hypothesized that selinexor would sensitize AML cells to the cytotoxic effects of HiDAC/Mito. We monitored the impact on minimal residual disease (MRD) by tracking the level of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) expression. WT1 levels in the peripheral blood predict relapse after remission, and their levels after consolidation therapy are closely correlated with survival and early relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this phase I study, we describe the safety, tolerability, correlative molecular studies, and activity of selinexor in combination with HiDAC/Mito for remission induction in patients with previously untreated or relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML.</p>

                <p id="Par11">We performed a phase I dose escalation trial with cohort expansion that combined increasing doses of selinexor with age-adjusted HiDAC/Mito (NCT02573363). The trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Chicago (IRB15-0412). Patients with newly diagnosed or R/R AML, except acute promyelocytic leukemia, were eligible to enroll if they had adequate performance status (ECOG ≤ 2), cardiac function (ejection fraction &gt; 50%), renal function (creatinine clearance &gt; 30cm<sup>3</sup>/min), and hepatic function (transaminases ≤ 3.0 times upper limit of normal). Exclusion criteria included active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, pregnancy, recent treatment with any investigational agent, recent major surgery, concurrent malignancy under active treatment, active infection, or recent seizure or stroke. Dose escalation of selinexor was performed according to a 3 + 3 design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Patient enrollment began in October 2015.</p>

                <p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the study schematic. HiDAC (3 g/m<sup>2</sup>, or 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> if &gt; 70 years, intravenously over 4 h) followed immediately by Mito (30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, or 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> if &gt; 70 years, intravenously over 1 h) were administered on days 1 and 5. This regimen was based on several studies demonstrating efficacy in response and leukemia cell dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Selinexor was given orally on days 2, 4, 9, and 11. Initial selinexor dose was 60 mg (~ 35 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for an average adult) followed by dose escalation to a target level of 80 mg (~ 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Patients who failed to achieve remission after induction were taken off the study. A second cycle of induction was not given. Patients who entered remission proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), if feasible, or consolidation chemotherapy with HiDAC and selinexor for up to four cycles at the same dose, followed by maintenance therapy with weekly selinexor for up to 1 year. Dose adjustments were allowed during consolidation or maintenance if patients experienced grade &gt; 3 toxicities. The selinexor doses and schedule were determined based on results from prior phase I studies in hematologic malignancies (KCP-330-001 [NCT01607892]), solid tumors (KCP-330-002 [NCT01607905]), and sarcomas (KCP-330-003 [NCT01896505]). These studies demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 80–120 mg given twice weekly over a 4-week cycle but recommended a lower dose at 60–80 mg to better enable successful chronic use. Prophylactic antimicrobial and anti-emetic agents were administered according to institutional guidelines.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study schematic. Schematic of phase 1 dose escalation study. Selinexor dosing remained unchanged for all phases, except for 2 patients who received reduced selinexor dosing during consolidation. Twenty patients entered induction, and 14 achieved a response. No patients received a second cycle of induction. No patients withdrew. Six patients entered consolidation, but 1 soon proceeded to allogeneic HCT. Ultimately, 8 underwent allogeneic HCT. One patient quickly relapsed after induction prior to starting the next phase of therapy.

                <title>Toxicity assessment</title>
                <p id="Par13">Patients in the dose escalation cohorts were monitored for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) for up to 56 days. DLT was defined as any grade ≥ 3 treatment-related non-hematologic toxicity, or persistent bone marrow aplasia in the absence of AML, or any grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia at day 56 of induction therapy not explained by disease recurrence or infection. Once a dose level was declared tolerable, more patients could be enrolled at that level to provide additional safety, tolerability, and efficacy data. Patients in the dose expansion cohort were closely monitored for adverse events (AE) but not assessed for DLT per the study design. All AEs were noted, including any serious adverse events (SAE), which were AEs that resulted in death, were life-threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 h, resulted in significant disability/incapacity, or resulted in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</p>

                <title>Response criteria and monitoring</title>
                <p id="Par14">The primary objective was to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of selinexor with HiDAC/Mito. Secondary objectives were to determine the complete remission (CR) rate, toxicities, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates, and allogeneic HCT success rate, defined as the number of patients who proceeded to HCT following remission. CR was defined as being transfusion independent with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, platelet count &gt; 100 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and bone marrow blasts &lt; 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. CR with incomplete recovery (CRi) was defined as meeting all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (&lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Partial remission (PR) was defined as a decrease in pre-treatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50% and to within the range of 5–25%, while otherwise meeting all hematologic criteria of CR. Lastly, a treatment failure (TF) was defined as resistant disease, relapse, or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All patients were followed until disease progression, withdrawal, death, or up to 1 year after completion of all protocol treatment.</p>

                <title>Correlative molecular studies</title>
                <p id="Par15">To assess WT1 levels as a marker of MRD, peripheral blood and marrow aspirate samples were collected before induction, at day 12, at the patient’s blood count recovery or prior to day 56, and again at relapse. Bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA samples and template controls were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis utilizing Taqman gene expression assays (Life Technologies) for <italic>WT1</italic> (Hs01103751) and <italic>ABL</italic> (Hs01104728) in triplicate using LightCycler 48011 (Roche).

The absolute transcript copy number was normalized to the endogenous control gene, <italic>ABL1</italic>.</p>
                <p id="Par16">To demonstrate the effect of selinexor with HiDAC/Mito on the bone marrow, routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for Ki67, p53, SMAD4, Rb, and p21 were performed with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections cut at 5 μm. For IHC staining, slides were baked at 65 °C for 30 min, processed for deparaffinization and rehydration, and then placed in Declare working buffer, steam-cooked for antigen retrieval, cooled, and transferred to 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous hydrogenase activity. Protein block was applied before primary antibodies were incubated with slides. Cell Marque Hi-Def Polymer Amplifier and Secondary Antibody were applied sequentially at room temperature as per manufacturer’s instructions. DAB chromogen was used for color reaction. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, mounted, and cover-slipped. IHC staining was performed on a Biogenex I6000 automated stainer. Digital images of the slides were obtained through an Aperio AT Turbo image scanner at × 20.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par28">The combination of selinexor with HiDAC/Mito for induction chemotherapy in AML is a feasible, tolerable, and effective regimen. This study resulted in an ORR of 70% and a low induction death rate of 5%. This phase I study demonstrates that this first-in-class SINE compound has an acceptable toxicity profile at the tested doses of 60 and 80 mg. The MTD was not determined, and no DLT was observed in the dose escalation phase. However, a frequent hematologic toxicity was prolonged thrombocytopenia and delayed neutrophil recovery. Four patients received filgrastim to promote count recovery, but this did not shorten count recovery time. Moreover, studies on filgrastim have not demonstrated a consistent benefit with respect to lower rates of infections and improved survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. While patients eventually recovered blood counts, one patient with secondary AML had a hypocellular bone marrow prior to induction therapy and hence failed to recover blood counts by day 56. Prior studies of selinexor alone have not reported any adverse effects on hematopoietic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, based on this experience, patients with a hypocellular marrow prior to induction should receive this regimen with particular caution, and dose-reduction of selinexor should be considered based on marrow cellularity and age.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Commonly reported non-infectious toxicities included diarrhea, anorexia, electrolyte abnormalities, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, consistent with prior selinexor studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The Larson et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of HiDAC/Mito alone in high-risk AML patients offered some insight into the independent contribution of selinexor to the toxicity profile. The study reported 64% of patients with neutropenic fever (vs 70% in our study), 12% with diarrhea (vs 40%), 14% with bacteremia (vs 25%), and 10% with cardiac toxicity (vs 25%), an expected toxicity in the setting of Mito exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Additionally, more febrile neutropenia and bacteremia were observed likely due to the longer period of myelosuppression. Despite the higher number of toxicities, the majority were low grade and manageable with supportive therapies. The single case of cerebellar toxicity could be attributed to HiDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], as the patient was 61 years old at the time and had reduced glomerular filtration rate, yet it is worth noting that this was also observed in other phase I studies involving selinexor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One patient’s protracted nausea and vomiting which required TPN was assessed as selinexor-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While GI toxicities were a common reason for patient withdrawal or dose modifications in other selinexor studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], no patients withdrew or needed modification to the dosing during induction due to toxicities. Those who proceeded to consolidation therapy continued to tolerate the regimen, although dose reductions were needed in a couple of cases, suggesting that the 80-mg dose was less tolerable for extended longer-term use. Based on these findings, the recommended phase 2 dose of selinexor is 80 mg (~ 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) twice a week for four doses in combination with HiDAC/Mito for induction therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The major limitations of this study were the small sample size, heterogeneous population, and short duration of follow-up that precluded drawing any definitive conclusions. Moreover, new data on a second-generation XPO1 inhibitor reported better tolerability due to decreased CNS penetration of the drug as compared to selinexor in the pre-clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The development of a second-generation agent offers additional avenues for further study as a single agent or in combination therapy.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par31">The novel class of XPO1 inhibitors have demonstrated effectiveness in disrupting cellular mechanisms that promote tumorigenesis. Selinexor is one such agent within this class that has been well studied as a single agent in AML. We demonstrated that selinexor can be feasibly combined with an existing AML regimen HiDAC/Mito, and this combination is safe with a tolerable toxicity profile. This study reported an ORR of 70% with a low induction death rate of 5%. Given the potential promise of the preliminary data, further study is needed in a large phase II trial to see if these trends would continue. The RP2D of selinexor is 80 mg (~ 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) twice a week for four doses in combination with HiDAC/Mito.</p>
