              <abstract>
                <p>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented public health crisis. Insufficient testing continues to limit the effectiveness of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Molecular testing methods such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) continue to be highly centralized and are a sub-optimal option for population surveillance. Rapid antigen tests (Ag-RDTs) offer multiple benefits including low costs, high flexibility to conduct tests in a wide variety of settings, and faster return of results. Self-test Ag-RDTs (STs) have gained approval in several markets and offer the possibility to expand testing, reaching at-risk populations. While STs have the potential to assist the COVID-19 response, test result integrity, reporting, and appropriate linkage to care continue to hinder the widespread implementation of self-testing programs. This protocol presents a mixed-methods pragmatic trial (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN91602092" ext-link-type="uri">ISRCTN91602092</ext-link>) to better understand the feasibility of self-testing as part of a contact tracing strategy within the Brazilian public health system. Approximately 604 close contacts of 150 index cases testing positive for COVID-19 will be enrolled. Index cases will be randomized for their close contacts to participate in either serial (daily) self-testing over a 10-day follow-up period or a more traditional approach to contact tracing with a professional Ag-RDT at one time point post-exposure. Usability workshops and focus group discussions will also be conducted. This study protocol presents a comprehensive plan to assess the effectiveness, operational feasibility, and stakeholder preferences of a serial self-testing strategy for contact tracing within the Brazilian public health system. Our results will contribute to better understanding of the feasibility of a self-testing strategy within the public sector. Potential risks and limitations are discussed. Our findings will have important implications as governments continue working to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, particularly in the context of where to direct limited resources for testing and healthcare infrastructure.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to an unprecedented public health crisis. Insufficient testing continues to limit the effectiveness of the local and global response to the pandemic. Isolation and quarantine guidelines continue to evolve yet primarily rely on case identification and subsequent behavior modification for infected or exposed individuals. In many settings, the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is plagued by sparse availability of supplies, higher cost, slow turnaround times, and its highly centralized nature [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These challenges make RT-PCR difficult to deploy widely and therefore not an optimal candidate test as a public health tool for population surveillance and effectively interrupting transmission chains [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>Rapid antigen tests (Ag-RDTs) for professional and self-test use offer multiple benefits in comparison to RT-PCR, including low costs and increased portability. Ag-RDTs can expand access to COVID-19 testing in places that do not have molecular testing capacity and results can be returned quickly, facilitating faster reporting and subsequent linkage to care. WHO recommends use of rapid antigen tests and self-tests for kits meeting minimum performance requirements in priority use cases [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further, rapid antigen tests may be more suitable in settings where people have been previously infected and molecular testing methods continue to return positive results due to residual viral fragments.</p>
              <sec id="sec002">
                <title>Self-testing</title>
                <p>Successful strategies to broaden access to testing include the use of self-tests (STs) [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Self-testing regimens for COVID-19 are a promising method to identify infectious individuals, interrupt transmission chains, and reduce demand on health facilities while addressing many of the usual barriers to uptake of services [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to enabling more timely isolation to minimize onward transmission, swift diagnosis can also prompt clinical intervention, which may improve individual patient prognosis, particularly given the availability of new antivirals. Self-testing has shown high levels of acceptability, with many countries implementing large-scale programs to access at-home tests for free, and can increase equity by providing more testing options [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In short, there is evidence that self-testing for COVID-19 is feasible and acceptable, with both national and global recommendations to use self-tests and some specific products receiving emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and WHO [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
                <p>While self-testing has the potential to contribute significantly to the COVID-19 response, it also comes with limitations. Firstly, available antigen tests may have variable performance in asymptomatic individuals [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. False negative results may prompt infected individuals to stop self-isolation and thereby contribute to virus transmission, while false positive results may lead to unnecessary stress, anxiety, and absences from work, school, and social activities. Secondly, self-testing results may not be reported and therefore missed by local and national health authorities. However, WHO guidelines describe the overall benefits of self-testing as outweighing these limitations. Clear communication on actions for positive and negative results, relevant support tools, efficient links to post-test counselling and easy access to results reporting are needed as key components of self-testing programs. The effectiveness of these approaches have already been well-established in HIV self-testing programs [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec003">
                <title>Contact tracing</title>
                <p>Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing was used to limit onward transmission and link at-risk individuals to testing and care [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since then, both observational and modelling studies have shown that contact tracing is associated with better control of COVID-19 and is growing increasingly important for today’s surveillance strategies to guide outbreak response. The impact of contact tracing is mediated by a number of factors, including the time it takes to identify and notify contacts and the number of positive cases that participate in contact tracing [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. During periods of peak transmission, contact tracing efforts may be slowed, stymied, or abandoned all together when the number of cases exceeds the public health system’s capacity to identify and follow-up with exposed cases, as experienced during the omicron wave [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In these cases, a self-testing regimen for exposed individuals may help interrupt transmission and control the outbreak.</p>
                <p>In the context of contact tracing, self-testing facilitates even further decentralization of testing and allows for faster identification of infectious contacts, reaching at-risk populations, and generally mitigating unequal access to testing [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, to ensure equitable access to self-testing, the use of these steps must be integrated into public health system programs and strategies rather than simply making self-tests available as a consumer product. This is particularly true in places where self-tests are difficult to obtain, either logistically or financially. Serial self-testing may also be advantageous to contact-tracing efforts, as it allows exposed individuals to monitor themselves over time and does not rely on a single time point to determine infection status, particularly when individuals may not seek care during the recommended post-exposure period and the recommended on-label testing algorithm for many self-tests calls for testing twice in the event of a negative test. Serial self-testing as part of a public health system contact tracing strategy may be a viable option to avoid multiple follow-up visits and allow both patients and healthcare providers to benefit from the decentralized and flexible nature of self-testing.</p>

                <title>Objectives and hypothesis</title>
                <p>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of contact tracing supported by serial self-testing (testing daily for up to 10 days) among exposed individuals compared to routine contact tracing at one time point. This study also aims to evaluate the operational feasibility of self-testing for contact tracing within the Brazilian public health system, explore the barriers and facilitators at the provider and patient levels that mediate use of COVID-19 self-tests, and assess adherence to quarantine, isolation, and treatment guidelines. This study hypothesizes that serial self-testing of primary close contacts will identify more positive cases than routine contact tracing at a single timepoint post-exposure in a facility-based health care setting.</p>

                <title>Design and setting</title>
                <p>This is a mixed-methods, two-arm randomized pragmatic trial within the public health system of two municipalities in Brazil. The study will be conducted at the Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical de Rondônia (CEPEM) in Porto Velho, Rondônia and several health units in Curitiba, Paraná. The health system within each municipality is structured through localized health units that are responsible for providing care to a specific catchment area. Health units are generally staffed with nurses, technicians, community health workers, doctors, and pharmacists. Professional antigen testing for COVID-19 is widespread within the public health system and pharmacies, though RT-PCR testing remains the laboratory test of choice for patients in the acute phase with moderate to severe symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Patients with no or mild symptoms may not receive a confirmatory PCR test and are typically advised to isolate [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Contact tracing practices conducted by the public health system have varied between study sites based on health system capacity, COVID epidemiology, and caseload, though individuals have generally been instructed to notify their close contacts.</p>

                <title>Population</title>
                <p>Patients aged 7 or older testing positive for COVID-19 at any participating health unit are eligible to be enrolled into the study as index cases. Approximately 604 close contacts of 150 index cases testing positive for COVID-19 per local standard of care testing practices will be enrolled. All index cases will complete a contact elicitation interview to identify close contacts who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 Close contacts will be invited to participate in the study following exposure notification. Close contacts of the index case will be eligible for enrollment as primary close contacts if they are 7 years of age or older and have been exposed to an enrolled index case within 2 days of index case symptom onset or within 7 days of index case positive test result. For the purposes of this study, “exposure” is defined as being within 1 meter of the index case for more than 15 minutes or having physical contact without appropriate personal protective equipment.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Index cases will be randomized such that their close contacts are assigned to either control or intervention. Randomization will be performed 1:1 at the index case level such that all immediate close contacts of an index case are randomized to the same arm. This is the most practical way to randomize, as at least some primary close contacts are expected to share a household with the index case and this approach will minimize contamination between the arms. The data manager will create the allocation sequence through computer-generated random numbers and will store this information in a locked Excel file. Only the data manager will have access to the full sequence. Study staff will reveal participant assignment upon enrollment by accessing a limited version of the file.</p>
                <p>Primary close contacts enrolled in the intervention arm will complete an enrollment visit in person, either at the health unit or at home. Following consent, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire, a supervised self-test and a health worker will independently perform a rapid test. The order in which these tests are conducted will be determined based on study ID and balanced within the arm to avoid test result bias related to sample depletion. Participants will then be provided with 10 self-tests of the same brand and lot to perform daily over the subsequent 10 days and will be contacted daily to complete a brief questionnaire.</p>
                <p>The study will also provide additional tests to household members of primary close contacts enrolled in the intervention arm and invite them to submit anonymous data around their use of the tests. These household members will not be consented or enrolled into the study and will receive no follow-up from the study team.</p>
                <p>Primary close contacts enrolled in the control arm will complete an enrollment visit either at the health unit or at home. Following consent, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire and a health worker will perform a rapid test. Participants will be contacted daily over the following 10 days to complete a brief study questionnaire. <xref rid="pone.0284659.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> details the schedule of enrollment for each participant group and <xref rid="pone.0284659.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> illustrates the overall study design.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary outcome will be the proportion of primary exposure close contacts who test positive for COVID-19 per index case in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. This will be captured through the participant follow-up surveys. Subjects with missing outcome data will be excluded from analysis. For the purposes of analysis, participants in the intervention arm will be considered to have complete primary endpoint data if at least three test results (consecutive or otherwise) are submitted over the 10-day follow-up period. For participants in the control arm, a professional Ag-RDT result available at the enrollment visit will be considered complete.</p>
                <p>Additional endpoints captured in the follow-up survey include proportion of close contacts testing positive who report adhering to recommended isolation guidelines and proportion of exposed contacts who report test results per local guidelines (intervention arm only). During the enrollment visit for participants enrolled in the intervention, study staff will document whether the participant correctly performs the self-test (per the manufacturer’s instructions for use) and the result of both self-test and professional rapid test to assess concordance between the two. Diagnostic accuracy assessment against a gold standard test is out of scope for this study design.</p>
                <p>Acceptability, preferences, and user perspectives on self-testing will be assessed across stakeholders, including study participants and health professionals, through focus group discussions; insights into user needs for instructions and training will be captured through user workshops.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>This study is powered to detect a 7.5% difference in positive cases identified between the intervention and control arm. This threshold was chosen through discussions with stakeholders to balance detection of a clinically meaningful outcome with an understanding of the likely rates of infection in a highly vaccinated population. Prior work at this site with COVID-19 testing of close contacts yielded a 30% PCR positivity rate among close contacts during a period of low to moderate transmission. To account for increases in vaccination coverage, high rates of prior infection, and the likelihood of low transmission following the most recent wave, this population is estimated to have a 20% test positivity rate. Based on the established performance characteristics of Ag-RDTs, serial self-testing is estimated to identify up to 75% of those cases. Using <xref rid="pone.0284659.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 1</xref>, where <italic toggle="yes">z</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">α/2</italic></sub> = 1.96 and <italic toggle="yes">z</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">β</italic></sub> = 0.842, a total of 550 participants are needed (275 per Arm). To account for attrition in longitudinal data and exclusion of unevaluable cases, we will increase the sample size estimate by 10% to enroll a total of 604 close contacts (302 per Arm). To achieve this, approximately 150 index cases are needed, with each index case leading to an estimated average of 4 close contacts (75 per Arm). These estimations are based on prior work at the study site [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>

                  <p>The written consent/assent process for this study is tailored to three different age groups that may be enrolled, per Brazilian regulations. For the youngest age group assenting (7–11 years of age), the caregiver (parent/legal guardian giving written consent) will perform the self-test on the child. The other two age groups (12–14 and 15–17 years of age) will perform the self-test on themselves, though they may receive help from their caregiver as needed. This determination is consistent with what would reasonably be expected of these age groups and Brazilian research ethics regulations. Additionally, the self-tests being used in this study are indicated for children 2 years and older with adult supervision, so all use during this study will be on-label.</p>
                  <p>Enrolling children does not sufficiently alter the risk-benefit ratio to warrant excluding children from this study. The only additional risk this study poses to children is that they may be more likely to use the test incorrectly, which will be mitigated by conducting the test with caregiver supervision. Children may also benefit from the findings of this research given their participation in school and social group activities and that they have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic due to school closures. This study will show how serial self-testing can be used in families and whether it can be operationalized to be effective. Therefore, it would be unethical to exclude children from this study given their potential to benefit from the findings and minimal additional risk posed to them.</p>

                <title>Impact</title>
                <p>This novel approach to contact tracing attempts to increase equitable access to essential diagnostics in the face of the worst pandemic in recent history. This study will generate data around the operational feasibility and effectiveness of a serial self-testing strategy in the context of the Brazilian public health system. While providing patients with 10 self-tests to perform daily is likely impractical, we are hoping further sensitivity analyses may reveal more optimal testing strategies to inform appropriate resource allocation. The study ultimately aims to generate evidence to support health policy makers in Brazil to understand whether this is a feasible tool to incorporate into the unified health system to support public health contact tracing/outbreak response efforts, which would reduce barriers to self-test access and promote use of self-tests. Finally, this study will join a growing body of evidence being generated to find optimal self-testing algorithms as part of non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate onward community transmission of COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284659.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Evidence from these studies will be critical to inform policy and public health practice around the use and merits of self-testing through an epidemiological lens [<xref rid="pone.0284659.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This work will also help codify lessons learned to leverage for future pandemic preparedness.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Study activities will be impacted by changing public health policies and guidelines as well as the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19. Where possible, these will be monitored throughout the study and tracked both administratively and through participant surveys. The methods outlined in this protocol are designed to be flexible enough to adapt to the local COVID-19 situation as needed while maintaining sufficient scientific rigor to fulfill study objectives. Additionally, follow-up data may be biased due to both the nature of being self-reported as well as observed. Data from secondary exposures may also be influenced by the fact their household member is participating in a research study. Finally, performing daily self-tests for 10 days is likely not a cost-effective method of contact tracing for COVID-19. This strategy was selected in the interest of generating a robust data set with the potential to conduct and inform additional analyses regarding cost effective testing strategies. Commodity costs will also be tracked to support these ancillary analyses.</p>

                <title>Dissemination, stakeholder, and participant engagement</title>
                <p>Stakeholders from the local municipalities and the Ministry of Health have been engaged throughout protocol development to better understand the local health system perspective when building the study’s objectives and methodology. These channels of communication will remain open throughout the conduct of the study to ensure continued engagement, and results will be shared back with these stakeholders. Research results will be shared locally, at the participating facilities and health units through debrief meetings and short reports. In addition to local results sharing, study findings will be disseminated through a variety of channels, including engagement with the World Health Organization, donors, and peer-reviewed publications. At the close of their participation, participants will also be sent information about where they can find final study results and be notified of dissemination outputs and events.</p>

              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This article does not say anything about Co-Infections to COVID-19. Inclusion criteria should be elaborated with appropriate controls like, gold standard test controls to rule out possible chances of cross reactivity/ co-infectivity. If there are any cases of co-infections along with COVID-19 then whether this participant will be excluded or any other statistical methodology to analyze these populations? This criterion can increase the sensitivity/ Specificity of screening test.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: 1- Study populations (line 108) Consideration for age range of 7 and above: Although the protocol has received ethical reviews and approvals, it might be necessary to consider limiting the study to adolescents, youths, and adults (aged 14 and above) this will limit the need for supervision of sample collection and self-testing processes by household members at home, to minimize potentials for spread of infections at household level during the process as part of infection prevention. Alternatively, the protocol has to detail how infection prevention will be enhanced through training and provision of PPEs to care givers who will supervise minors enrolled into this study, and what to do in case of exposure</p>
              <p>2- Index cases (Line 109 – 110): indicate what method(s) of test was used or will be used for COVID-19 Positive index cases.</p>
              <p>3- Randomization (line 119 – 121): the sentence indicated that contacts of index cases will be randomized, whereas randomization is only at the level of the index cases. This should be rephrased to show this. The use of randomization for the contacts of index cases throughout the rest of the protocol need to be rephrased accordingly.</p>
              <p>4- Line 131: Will study participants receive the same brand and batch of self-test kits for consistency? This should be included in the narrative</p>
              <p>5- Line 132: Include how the study participants will be contacted in this segment of the protocol – by physical visits, phone calls, WhatsApp (as indicated further down in the protocol), email or a mix</p>
              <p>6- Line 149: Indicate if 3 results will be for 3 consecutive days or otherwise, and what is the rational for using 3 results out of 10-day daily testing?</p>
              <p>7- Line 150: indicate if one-time Ag-RDT test of close contacts of index case within 2 days of symptoms onset, or within 7 days of positive results is the standard practice in Brazil – as proposed for the control group</p>
              <p>8- While training of study participants is implied in the protocol, it would be necessary to include, as part of the methods, that training on standard sample collection, self-testing procedure and interpretation of results, as well as safety precautions and infection prevention and control methods, would be provided and by whom, and at what point of the study</p>
              <p>9- Line 18 – 160: will the study participants be part of the focused group discussions – who are the stakeholders in this case? Will the FGD be conducted prior to enrollment into the study or at the completion of 10-day monitoring?</p>
              <p>10- The protocol did not include any quality check or process for reviewing the Self-testing procedures and validating results. A quality control measure is essential to avoid over reporting of positive test results or under reporting. This could be done by review of captured images of the test strips or other alternative methods.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Jahun,</p>
              <p>Thank you for the review of this manuscript. The authors have carefully reviewed each comment made by yourself and the reviewers and have revised the text accordingly. Please see below for a point-by-point response to each comment.</p>
              <p>1. The protocol is relevant and will certainly simplify COVID-19 surveillance activities especially in low resource settings where access to highly sophisticated PCR tests are rarely available. Please address all comments provided by both reviewers. For reviewer 1, try to adjust your protocol's rational and methodology by making them more explicit to avoid any potential ambiguity. The revision should be minimal. </p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for your comments. We have made minor edits to some of the methodological descriptions and rationale to help clarify them for the reader.</p>
              <p>2. This article does not say anything about Co-Infections to COVID-19. Inclusion criteria should be elaborated with appropriate controls like, gold standard test controls to rule out possible chances of cross reactivity/ co-infectivity. If there are any cases of co-infections along with COVID-19 then whether this participant will be excluded or any other statistical methodology to analyze these populations? This criterion can increase the sensitivity/ Specificity of screening test. </p>
              <p>Response: The authors appreciate this attention to detail with regards to screening test performance. The objective of this study is effectiveness and operational feasibility of a novel service delivery mechanism using an approved product with well-documented and accepted test performance, including cross-reactivity among other respiratory pathogens. Because the focus of this study was not diagnostic performance, but rather effectiveness of the service delivery, the authors sought to keep eligibility criteria as pragmatic and reflective of the real-world use case as possible. The study utilized the GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Ag-RDT by Osang Healthcare, which is approved for commercial use and sale in Brazil. According to the product insert, when tested in triplicate with several other human coronaviruses, adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, influenza A &amp; B, enterovirus, RSV A &amp; B,</p>
              <p>rhinovirus, MERS, streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, candida albicans, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae, no cross-reactivity or interference was found.</p>
              <p>3. Study populations (line 108): Consideration for age range of 7 and above: Although the protocol has received ethical reviews and approvals, it might be necessary to consider limiting the study to adolescents, youths, and adults (aged 14 and above) this will limit the need for supervision of sample collection and self-testing processes by household members at home, to minimize potentials for spread of infections at household level during the process as part of infection prevention. Alternatively, the protocol has to detail how infection prevention will be enhanced through training</p>
              <p>and provision of PPEs to care givers who will supervise minors enrolled into this study, and what to do in case of exposure </p>
              <p>Response: The study team thoroughly considered the acceptable age range for inclusion during the study design phase and throughout the approval process. The ST used in this study is indicated for use by individuals aged 14 or older who self-collect their swabs as well as in children aged 2 or older where an adult collects the swab. The study team felt that excluding school-aged youth under 14 years old would neglect a crucial study population who could benefit from this type of novel service delivery model. Testing procedures in this study were implemented according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use, which describe basic hygienic steps to be taken by anyone performing the test.</p>
              <p>4. Index cases (Line 109 – 110): indicate what method(s) of test was used or will be used for COVID-19 Positive index cases.</p>
              <p>Response: Additional clarification has been added to line 127 to the extent possible. Index cases were tested per local testing practices and referred to the study team for enrollment; the conduct of screening tests to identify index cases was not under research purview.</p>
              <p>5. Randomization (line 119 – 121): the sentence indicated that contacts of index cases will be randomized, whereas randomization is only at the level of the index cases. This should be rephrased to show this. The use of randomization for the contacts of index cases throughout the rest of the protocol need to be rephrased accordingly.</p>
              <p>Response: Thank you for flagging this ambiguity; the wording has been revised throughout.</p>
              <p>6. Line 131: Will study participants receive the same brand and batch of self-test kits for consistency? This should be included in the narrative </p>
              <p>Response: All participants received the same brand and lot of self-test kits. This has been added to line 151.</p>
              <p>7. Line 132: Include how the study participants will be contacted in this segment of the protocol – by physical visits, phone calls, WhatsApp (as indicated further down in the protocol), email or a mix </p>
              <p>Response: Line 146 has been updated to explicitly state that enrollment visits occurred in person, as this was necessary to complete the professional test.</p>
              <p>8. Line 149: Indicate if 3 results will be for 3 consecutive days or otherwise, and what is the rational for using 3 results out of 10-day daily testing?</p>
              <p>Response: Clarification has been added to line 183 indicating the three results may be consecutive or otherwise. Despite best efforts to ensure 100% compliance of follow-up, the study team recognized that the likelihood of achieving 100% follow-up survey completion was highly unlikely. Given the likelihood of a persistent positive test for participants who converted to positive, the study team reasoned it would be likely for a positive result to be captured if at least three results were documented.</p>
              <p>9. Line 150: indicate if one-time Ag-RDT test of close contacts of index case within 2 days of symptoms onset, or within 7 days of positive results is the standard practice in Brazil – as proposed for the control group</p>
              <p>Response: As we have observed throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 practices are highly variable even within a single country or region and evolve over time. At the time of protocol development and study start, practices for contact tracing varied widely across the country depending on health facility bandwidth and local disease epidemiology. As such, the study team based eligibility on a wide range of input, including literature on COVID-19 transmission windows and current-at-the-time Brazilian guidelines for isolation of individuals exposed to someone with COVID-19, recognizing that testing of exposed individuals was being done inconsistently across the country.</p>
              <p>10. While training of study participants is implied in the protocol, it would be necessary to include, as part of the methods, that training on standard sample collection, self-testing procedure and interpretation of results, as well as safety precautions and infection prevention and control methods, would be provided and by whom, and at what point of the study</p>
              <p>Response: As a pragmatic trial, one of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the extent to which formally untrained people are able to correctly perform a ST given standard manufacturer-provided materials. Study participants were not meant to be formally trained on self-test use by a health professional because this is not what would happen in the real world should a person choose to purchase a ST for their own use. Rather, the health professional observed participants perform the self-test during their enrollment visit, after the participant reviewed the manufacturer-provided training materials, and only intervened if the participant made a critical error.</p>
              <p>11. Line 18 – 160: will the study participants be part of the focused group discussions – who are the stakeholders in this case? Will the FGD be conducted prior to enrollment into the study or at the completion of 10-day monitoring?</p>
              <p>Response: Stakeholders are inclusive of study participants and other health professionals; this has been clarified in line 194. As the FGDs are meant to learn about acceptability and preferences for self-testing, they cannot be completed until the participants have completed their study follow-up period.</p>
              <p>12. The protocol did not include any quality check or process for reviewing the Self-testing procedures and validating results. A quality control measure is essential to avoid over reporting of positive test results or under reporting. This could be done by review of captured images of the test strips or other alternative methods.</p>
              <p>Response: The quality check for participant performance of the self-testing procedure was the supervised ST conducted during the enrollment visit. If the participant performed the test correctly with no critical errors, they were considered proficient in ST use for the study. Participants were asked to upload a picture of their ST result each day they performed one, but due to the variable nature of photos and associated challenges with accurately reading RDT results from a photo, the study team felt it would be most appropriate for the participant-reported result to remain the ground truth.</p>
              <p>We hope that the revised manuscript will merit publication and appreciate your reconsideration of this important work.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Rebecca Green, on behalf of the authors</p>

              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>The following minor improvements are further recommended:</p>
              <p>1- It would be necessary to include measures the authors would implement to minimize potentials for viral transmission to household members (infection prevention and control measures) at the household level during self testing for all study participants in the the intervention arm, especially for children requiring supervision by household members. This could be included in the safety or ethical consideration sections</p>
              <p>2- In figure 2 and Ethical Consideration: Authors to clarify what decision would be made if the Professional Ag.RDT conducted at the enrollment stage was positive - will study participants in the control arm who tested positive be linked to care? This should be included in the ethical consideration section.</p>
              <p>3- Authors to clarify what decision would be made for study participants in the Intervention ARM, who had a positive result based on Professional Ag.RDT at enrolment stage, but negative results following 10 days of serial Self-Testing (ST) without any significant testing procedure error, would these category of study participants be linked to care as per Brazil's standard guidelines?</p>
              <p>4- Authors may wish to consider including study participants inclusion and exclusion criteria sections in the protocol to facilitate understanding</p>
