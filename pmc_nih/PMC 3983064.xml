              <abstract>
                <p>Chitin is an essential structural polysaccharide of fungal pathogens and parasites, but its role in human immune responses remains largely unknown. It is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose and its derivatives today are widely used for medical and industrial purposes. We analysed the immunological properties of purified chitin particles derived from the opportunistic human fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which led to the selective secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. We identified NOD2, TLR9 and the mannose receptor as essential fungal chitin-recognition receptors for the induction of this response. Chitin reduced LPS-induced inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> and may therefore contribute to the resolution of the immune response once the pathogen has been defeated. Fungal chitin also induced eosinophilia <italic>in vivo</italic>, underpinning its ability to induce asthma. Polymorphisms in the identified chitin receptors, NOD2 and TLR9, predispose individuals to inflammatory conditions and dysregulated expression of chitinases and chitinase-like binding proteins, whose activity is essential to generate IL-10-inducing fungal chitin particles <italic>in vitro</italic>, have also been linked to inflammatory conditions and asthma. Chitin recognition is therefore critical for immune homeostasis and is likely to have a significant role in infectious and allergic disease.</p>

                  <title>Authors Summary</title>
                  <p>Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose and an essential component of the cell wall of all fungal pathogens. The discovery of human chitinases and chitinase-like binding proteins indicates that fungal chitin is recognised by cells of the human immune system, shaping the immune response towards the invading pathogen. We show that three immune cell receptorsâ the mannose receptor, NOD2 and TLR9 recognise chitin and act together to mediate an anti-inflammatory response via secretion of the cytokine IL-10. This mechanism may prevent inflammation-based damage during fungal infection and restore immune balance after an infection has been cleared. By increasing the chitin content in the cell wall pathogenic fungi may influence the immune system in their favour, by down-regulating protective inflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, gene mutations and dysregulated enzyme activity in the described chitin recognition pathway are implicated in inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's Disease and asthma, highlighting the importance of the discovered mechanism in human health.</p>

              <p>Chitin is a robust Î²-1,4-linked homopolymer of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and is an essential polysaccharide of the cell wall of all fungal pathogens. It is absent in humans but is also found in the skeletal elements in oomycetes, insects, crustaceans and parasitic nematodes <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Araujo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Fuhrman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Neville1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Shahabuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In terms of global biomass, chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellulose.</p>
              <p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a common mucosal pathogen in humans that can cause life-threatening infections in patients suffering trauma or immune dysfunction <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Under normal growth conditions, chitin is a minor component of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> cell wall, comprising only 2 to 3% of its dry weight <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Klis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the chitin content of the fungal cell wall increases in response to Î²-1,3 glucan damage, for example as inflicted by echinocandin antifungal drug treatment <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This leads to chitin exposure at the cell surface as well as reduced efficacy of caspofungin <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The discovery of human chitinases and chitinase-like proteins (CLPs), including some that are constitutively expressed by macrophages and epithelial cells of the lung and digestive tract, suggests the presence of a first line of defence against chitin-containing pathogens, as well as mechanisms for chitin recognition, breakdown and immune-modulation in the human host <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Schlosser1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Vega1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Dysregulated chitinase- and CLP-expression has been linked to inflammatory and allergic conditions such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, recent work has identified additional chitin binding proteins, such as RegIIIg (HIP/PAP), a C-type lectin secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine that also binds peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Cash1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and FIBCD1, a high affinity receptor for chitin and chitin fragments that is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Schlosser1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Studies performed using commercially available sources of chitin from crab/shrimp shell, suggest that the ability of chitin to modulate immune responses depends on the size of the chitin particle. Medium-sized chitin particles (40â70 Âµm) have been shown to activate TNF and IL-17 production in a TLR2- and dectin-1-dependent fashion, whereas small-size chitin particles (&lt;40 Âµm) are strong stimulators of TNF and IL-10 in a manner that involves TLR2, dectin-1 and the mannose receptor (MR) <xref rid="ppat.1004050-DaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. TLR2, dectin-1 and NOD2 have also been implicated in the induction of chitotriosidase expression if stimulated by their specific ligands <xref rid="ppat.1004050-vanEijk1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, these studies were performed using commercially available sources of chitin from crab/shrimp shell- a source that is likely to be found in marine and shell fish processing environments and is often relatively impure. In terrestrial environments, arthropods and fungi represent the major source of chitin. Such organisms are also common indoor environments, resulting in chronic exposure due to the inhalation of chitin-containing particles.</p>
              <p>We set out to identify chitin pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in myeloid cells and to investigate the relationship between chitin particle size and chitin recognition. We report here that ultra-pure fungal chitin dominantly induces the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 through uptake mediated by the mannose receptor and signalling that involves NOD2 and TLR9 activation. Polymorphisms in these receptors predispose individuals to inflammatory conditions such as asthma or Crohn's disease (CD), conditions that have been shown to be significantly influenced by exposure to chitin. These findings therefore open new avenues for the understanding and treatment of these diseases.</p>

                <p>Most immunological studies of chitin have focussed on semi-purified crustacean sources of chitin of relatively large particle size <xref rid="ppat.1004050-DaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Here we established the role of ultra-pure fungal cell wall chitin of a determined size in immune regulation. All fungal chitin preparations used for experiments were pyrogen-free, microbiologically sterile and had a purity of over 98% as analysed by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). In contrast, commercial crab shell chitin contained only 60% glucosamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). All chitin preparations used were between 55% and 100% acetylated, depending on the source of chitin as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004050-t001">Table 1</xref>. If not stated otherwise, work was performed with chitin extracted from yeast cells of the human pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which was &gt;97% acetylated. To investigate the size of fungal chitin particles used for experiments, we performed flow cytometry with 1 and 10 Âµm beads as size standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The majority of fungal derived chitin particles were found to be between 1 to 10 Âµm in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

                <p>To characterise the immunological properties of chitin we first analysed a series of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants of chitin (10 Âµg/ml) stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs, 5Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells) and mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages (mBMMÏs, 1Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells). Chitin stimulation significantly increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 along with the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in hPBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), whereas in mouse macrophages only IL-10 secretion was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). INFÎ³ and IL-17, known to be involved in establishing a protective T-helper (Th) 1/Th17 response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections, were not induced in hPBMCs by chitin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) and chitin did not induce Th1, Th2 or Th17 cytokines in mouse macrophages or any of the pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

                </fig>
                <p>We tested whether the observed IL-10 induction by fungal chitin was concentration-dependent. Low chitin concentrations (1â10 Âµg/ml) induced high IL-10 secretion; high chitin concentrations (250â1000 Âµg/ml) instead strongly induced TNF secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) and intermediate concentrations of chitin (50â100 Âµg/ml) induced equal amounts of both cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Next we investigated the immunostimulatory effects of chitin particles (10 Âµg/ml) derived from different fungal species in comparison to purified commercial crab shell chitin. Nearly all tested chitin preparations significantly induced IL-10 secretion in hPBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and no obvious differences were observed between different sources of chitin. We also investigated the ability of chitin to block or increase cytokine secretion induced by specific PRR ligands. Co-incubation of hPBMCs (5Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS;10 Âµg/ml), zymosan (10 Âµg/ml), curdlan (100 Âµg/ml), Pam<sub>3</sub>CSK<sub>4</sub> (1 Âµg/ml), flagellin (100 ng/ml), CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN; 1 ÂµM) or <italic>C. albicans</italic>-derived cell wall mannoproteins (CWP; 100 Âµg/ml) together with chitin (10 Âµg/ml) for 24 h resulted in increased IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). This increase in IL-10 was significant for all pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) tested except for CpG ODN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), indicating a competitive effect of chitin on CpG-TLR9 interactions. All other cytokines analysed (IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF, IFN-Î³ and TGF-Î²) showed no significant differences in cytokine induction, although a trend for INF-Î³, TGF-Î² and IL-1Î² secretion was observed that was ameliorated when hPBMCs were co-stimulated with chitin (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004050.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

As mentioned above, intermediate-sized chitin particles (40â70 Âµm) have been reported to induce a pro-inflammatory immune response (TNF secretion) through dectin-1/TLR2 signalling, whilst small-sized particles (&lt;40 Âµm) have been reported to induce an anti-inflammatory response (IL-10 secretion) through dectin-1/TLR2 and the mannose receptor <xref rid="ppat.1004050-DaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To examine possible chitin-MR/dectin-1 interactions further, we used soluble mannans purified from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<italic>S. c.</italic> mannan) and laminarin (Î²-1,3 glucan from an alga) to block potential receptor interactions. <italic>S. c.</italic> mannan and laminarin (100 Âµg/ml) alone were immunological inert and no cytokine response was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Pre-incubation with <italic>S. c.</italic> mannan reduced chitin-triggered mBMMÏ IL-10 secretion by 40%, whilst laminarin treatment did not affect IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, blocking MR with <italic>S. c.</italic> mannan significantly increased TNF secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). To confirm these blocking experiments, we exposed mBMMÏs from MR- and dectin-1-deficient mice to fungal chitin. Cytokine analysis reinforced the results of the blocking experiments, with increased TNF induction and reduced IL-10 secretion occurring in chitin-stimulated MR-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Dectin-1 deficiency did not influence chitin-triggered IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Blocking dectin-1 in MR-deficient macrophages with laminarin instead confirmed that the observed chitin triggered TNF secretion in <italic>S. c.</italic> mannan pre-treated wild type macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) and MR-deficient macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) were Dectin-1 dependent (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004050.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

                <title>NOD2 and TLR9 mediate IL-10 induction</title>
                <p>Chitin is a homopolymer of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine. Together with <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-muramic acid, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-glucosamine also forms the backbone of bacterial peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is known to be recognised by TLR2 and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) by NOD2. Therefore we tested whether chitin is recognised by TLR2 or NOD2 using mBMMÏs from TLR2- and NOD2-deficient mice along with mBMMÏs from other PRR- and signalling-deficient mutant mice, including TLR2/4-, TLR9-, MyD88-, RICK- and CARD9-knock-outs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3C and D</xref>). IL-10 secretion was reduced in <italic>Tlr2/4<sup>â/â</sup></italic> -macrophages, but still significantly increased compared to untreated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Similar IL-10 levels were secreted by <italic>Tlr2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> -macrophages and wild type macrophages. Chitin failed to induce IL-10 secretion in <italic>Nod2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-, <italic>Myd88</italic>

Because the IL-10 induction was TLR9-dependent, we also treated the chitin preparations with DNase I prior to stimulation to exclude contaminating DNA as a trigger for IL-10 secretion. DNase I-treated chitin induced similar amounts of IL-10 secretion in wild type macrophages as untreated chitin (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004050.s003">Fig. S3</xref>), indicating a direct role for TLR9 in chitin recognition and induction of IL-10 secretion. This finding is supported by the observed competitive effect of CpG ODN and chitin in hPBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Therefore, the intracellular receptors NOD2 and TLR9 together with their downstream signalling adapter proteins are necessary for chitin-induced IL-10 secretion.</p>

                <title>Uptake via MR directs chitin recognition</title>
                <p>To further investigate the role of the MR and dectin-1 in chitin recognition, intracellular delivery and induction of IL-10 secretion, we forced chitin uptake into the cytoplasm of wild type, <italic>Tlr2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-, <italic>Tlr9<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-, <italic>Nod2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-, <italic>Mr<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- and <italic>dectin-1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-macrophages by liposomal transfection using DOTAP (10 Âµg/ml), or blocked chitin uptake with the endocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytD; 5 ÂµM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Chitin transfection into wild type, <italic>Tlr2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- and <italic>dectin-1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- macrophages significantly increased IL-10 secretion, whereas no IL-10 induction occurred in chitin-transfected <italic>Nod2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>-, <italic>Mr<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- or <italic>Tlr9<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of endocytosis with CytD abrogated the IL-10 secretion in all macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), whereas TNF secretion was significantly increased in wild type and <italic>Mr<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

Co-localisation of chitin with MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) as well as co-localisation of TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>) and NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5A and C</xref>) with chitin could be observed after 20 min of incubation. F-actin staining with phalloidin showed phagocytic uptake of chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).Fluorescence profiles confirmed overlay of fluorescence signals for MR and chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5B and C</xref>), TLR9 and chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>) and NOD2 and chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g005">Fig. 5A and C</xref>). In wild type, <italic>Tlr2<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- and <italic>dectin-1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>- macrophages, chitin (green) co-localised with NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>) and TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) as indicated by fluorescence overlay (yellow). Chitin still co-localised with TLR9 in the absence of NOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). In MR-deficient macrophages, intracellular chitin was detected but no co-localisation with NOD2 and/or TLR9 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g006">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Chitin did not co-localise with TLR2 in wild type macrophages or tested mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that chitin uptake via MR is required for NOD2- and TLR9-dependent chitin recognition and for the induction of an anti-inflammatory immune response through IL-10 secretion. Blocking chitin uptake mediated by the MR or MR-deficiency shifted the anti-inflammatory response to a pro-inflammatory response through TNF secretion that is Dectin-1 and TLR2-dependent and phagocytosis independent.</p>

Nonetheless, it has not been determined whether CHIT-1 secretion increases during fungal infections. We therefore co-incubated human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and analysed CHIT-1 activity in the cell supernatants and lysates. The total CHIT-1 activity increased significantly over time for neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) when stimulated with live <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast cells in comparison to uninfected cells. These results suggest that IL-10-inducing particles are generated during infection due to the digestion of fungal cell wall chitin by CHIT-1. Next we incubated hPBMCs with heat-treated <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast cells over a period of 7 days and measured cytokine levels daily. We included heat-treated yeast cells from the <italic>C. albicans</italic> chitin synthase 3 mutant strain (<italic>chs3</italic>Î) which has a greater than 80% reduction in the total amount of chitin in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8C and D</xref>) <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Munro1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

Wild type and <italic>chs3</italic>Î mutant cells induced equal amounts of TNF from day 1 to 4, but as the response to the wild type yeast cells decreased to control levels from day 5 to 7, the amount of TNF in the <italic>chs3</italic>Î mutant samples remained significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>).

                <p>These observations indicate that the release of cell wall chitin during the end/late-phase of infection when the pathogen has been defeated by the immune system contribute to the resolution of the immune response by the induction of IL-10 thereby preventing collateral inflammatory-mediated damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g009">Fig. 9</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Innate recognition of fungal cells by PRRs like Dectin-1 and TLR2 leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF. The pathogen recognition together with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines induces the secretion of chitinases (e.g. chitotriosidase) from neutrophils and macrophages. Chitin digestion leads to the generation of small sized chitin particles that are taken up by the mannose receptor and induce IL-10 secretion via the TLR9 and NOD2 pathway. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 dampens the inflammatory response by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Chitin is an abundant molecule in nature and is a component of pathogens, parasites and food products of humans <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Araujo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Fuhrman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Neville1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Shahabuddin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Chitin exposure and degradation has been linked to a variety of human diseases, such as allergic asthma and Crohn's disease <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Goldman1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Therefore, chitin recognition and chitin-triggered immune responses are of broad interest to studies of immunity and inflammation. To date, most immunological studies have mostly used semi-purified commercial sources of chitin derived from shrimp or crab shells <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Vega1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, making interpretations of the immunological effects of chitin difficult. Here we investigated the immune regulatory ability of ultrapure fungal chitin as a PAMP and describe several classes of immune receptors that are involved in chitin recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004050-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). We show that fungal chitin acts as a concentration- dependent stimulus of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Chitin particles (1â10 Âµm), resembling a size that is most likely to be found in the natural environment of the host, stimulated mainly IL-10 secretion at lower concentrations. Higher chitin concentrations induced TNF secretion. Lower chitin concentrations were only able to induce TNF secretion when intracellular uptake of chitin was inhibited. In this case, chitin-induced TNF secretion was dependent on TLR2 and dectin-1 recognition as blocking chitin uptake abolished TNF induction in TLR2- and dectin-1-deficient macrophages. Our findings support and explain recent observations reporting that chitin acts as a size-dependent stimulus of IL-10 and TNF, mediated through MR, TLR2 and dectin-1 signalling pathways <xref rid="ppat.1004050-DaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but also help explain observed variations in chitin-induced immune responses related to chitin particle size and chitin concentration <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Muzzarelli1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Whilst the inhibition of chitin uptake led to an increase chitin-induced TNF secretion, IL-10 induction was markedly increased by liposomal transfection, indicating that intracellular recognition was responsible for the anti-inflammatory properties of chitin. By screening mice that were deficient for various PRRs, we showed that NOD2 and TLR9 were required for chitin recognition, IL-10 induction and TNF suppression. Interaction with these two intracellular receptors required chitin to be first recognised by the MR before delivered to the inside of the cell since <italic>Mrâ/â</italic> macrophages failed to induce IL-10, even when chitin was delivered using DOTAP as a liposomal transfecting agent. TLR9 recognises unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA, and has also been shown to recognise fungal DNA <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Miyazato1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, recent studies implicate TLR9 in fungal recognition independent of fungal viability or DNA availability, and TLR9 recruitment to fungus-loaded phagosomes has been shown to depend on the inner fungal cell wall layer rather than the outer wall mannoproteins <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Kasperkovitz1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition, siRNA knock-down of TLR9 expression in hPBMCs demonstrated that TLR9 signalling suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g. TNF and IL-6) and antimicrobial activity <xref rid="ppat.1004050-vandeVeerdonk1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Interestingly, a protective role for TLR9 in acute allergic airway diseases driven by <italic>Aspergillus spp</italic> or house mite containing dust has been implied, since CpG administration inhibits allergic Th2 cytokine production <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Ramaprakash1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Vissers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This effect might be mediated though competitive binding of CpG and chitin to TLR9, as CpG was the only PAMP used in our experiments, which did not show a synergistic effect on IL-10 secretion together with chitin. TLR2, dectin-1 and TLR9 have also been shown to be required for <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> strains to exhibit paradoxical growth upon exposure to caspofungin inside the host <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Moretti1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Paradoxical growth during echinocandin treatment has been linked to the ability of the fungi to upregulate chitin synthesis to restore the cell wall integrity after echinocandin-mediated cell wall damage <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lenardon1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We showed previously that <italic>C. albican</italic>s cells with high chitin levels in their cell wall survive exposure to caspofungin in a mouse infection model <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and that mice inoculated with high-chitin cells do not exhibit the inflammation-based pathology of the kidney that is characteristic of infection with <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells with normal chitin levels. Subsequently, mice with high kidney burdens of chitin-rich yeast cells survived infection <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore, the immunopathology of fungal infections and the immune response of patients treated with echinocandins may be influenced by the recognition of cell wall chitin and the consequential dampening or exacerbation of the antifungal inflammatory response.</p>
              <p>TLR9 SNPs have been linked with a higher susceptibility to CD <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Torok1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> - a disease which is also associated with mutations in the NOD2 gene. Moreover, recent studies suggest that the normal immune interactions between TLR9 and NOD2 are lost in CD patients <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Torok1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Hotte1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. NOD2 is a cytosolic innate immune receptor that mediates pro-inflammatory and antibacterial responses through recognition of bacterial cell wall components. The underlying mechanism governing how NOD2 variants lead to CD development is unknown, but current hypotheses suggest that the impaired function of NOD2 leads to deficiencies in the epithelial-barrier function, leading to increased bacterial invasion and inflammation of the intestine <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Lecat1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> colonises all segments of the digestive tract without any known benefit for the host, but commensal colonisers are also the source of fungal cells that invade the mucosa, leading to life-threatening systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Miranda1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recent investigations described high serum levels of antibodies in 50â60% of CD patients, that recognise major epitopes of the fungal cell wall, including mannan, Î²-glucan and chitin <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Poulain1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. These antibodies are produced during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection and normally subside after antifungal therapy; however serum levels remain high in CD patients <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Poulain1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that healthy relatives of CD patients are more frequently colonised by <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the gut compared to healthy control families <xref rid="ppat.1004050-StandaertVitse1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, analysis of the gut fungal microbiota in healthy and CD patients revealed that the fungal diversity is significantly elevated in inflamed mucosa compared to healthy controls, thereby showing an expansion of pathogenic species like <italic>Candida</italic> spp <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore the fungal gut microflora may be an important immunomodulator of CD.</p>
              <p>The Th1/Th17 response is known to be protective against mucosal <italic>Candida</italic> infections <xref rid="ppat.1004050-McDonald1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, however Th17 responses have also been implicated in the pathology of CD, allergy and asthma <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Maddur1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Elevated IL-17 levels and Th17 cells are found in the intestinal mucosa of CD patients <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Wilke1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and IL-10-treatment of mice with established colitis suppressed Th17 and Th17/Th1 cell development <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Huber1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. IL-10 has an important role in regulating gut immunity and intestinal homeostasis, and CD-associated NOD2 mutations have been shown to inhibit IL-10 expression <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Noguchi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Two recent studies investigated the modulation of intestinal inflammation by yeast cell wall extracts (<italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) and chitin micro particles (1â10 Âµm), both demonstrated increased IL-10 levels and stimulation of IL-10 producing cells in the colon with consequent improvement of inflammation <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Jawhara1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Nagatani1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Low concentrations of small chitin particles are likely to be released by commensal fungi in the gut and on other mucosal surfaces, as well as from the cell walls of fungi that have been killed by the action of the immune system. The release of such chitin particles and chitin oligosaccharides has the potential to induce IL-10 secretion, via NOD2 and TLR9 signalling, promoting the attenuation of inflammatory-mediated diseases and consequent immune homeostasis <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Romani1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. High concentrations of chitin particles generated during pathogen invasion and infection may promote inflammation through dectin-1 and TLR2 signalling. However, chitin is also able to promote Th2-associated inflammation which is central to the pathogenesis of allergy and asthma <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Reese1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004050-VanDyken1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our data therefore suggest that the two signature polysaccharides in the fungal cell wall, Î²-1,3 glucan and chitin, induce markedly different responses in the sentinel cells of the innate immune system and explain why chitin and chitin recognition pathways are implicated in the immunology of asthma, CD and allergies.</p>

                <p>To analyse the quantity and purity of the chitin preparations, samples were hydrolysed with 13 M (99% (w/v)) trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) at 100Â°C for 4 h for purity analysis or 6 M HCl at 100Â°C overnight for chitin yield measurements.

Samples were analysed together with carbohydrate standards by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) in a carbohydrate analyzer system from Dionex (Surrey, UK) as described previously <xref rid="ppat.1004050-Plaine1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.
