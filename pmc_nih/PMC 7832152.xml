                  <p>Biological considerations suggest that renin–angiotensin system inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin–angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40–110] for continuation <italic>vs</italic> 81 [38–117] for discontinuation; β-coefficient 8 [95% CI −13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (χ<sup>2</sup> test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups.</p>

              <p id="para10">The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a public health crisis. COVID-19 is associated with a high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and mortality, and there are few therapeutic options to reduce adverse outcomes.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases are at the highest risk of admission to hospital and mortality due to COVID-19.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para20">Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has an important counter-regulatory role in the renin–angiotensin system, promoting systemic vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> ACE2 also serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, facilitating viral entry into host cells.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Changes in ACE2 activity and expression might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, taking into account the pleiotropic effects of ACE2, the expected direction and magnitude of these effects is unclear. Evidence suggests that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system, might increase ACE2 expression,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> although these findings are not consistent across studies.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>

                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed on Nov 24, 2020, for literature published since Jan 1, 2020, using the search terms “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors”, and “angiotensin receptor blockers”. We searched for primary research (observational studies and clinical trials) with no language restrictions and found 72 observational studies evaluating the association of angiotensin-converting enyzme inhibitor (ACEI) use, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use, or both, with development or severity of COVID-19, one of which was retracted following publication and several of which had important methodological limitations, such as inadequate adjustment for known confounders. Early evidence of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 suggested an association of the use of ACEIs and ARBs, inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system, with increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19. ACEIs and ARBs are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world, and a potential link between these medications and COVID-19 has enormous global health implications. Accordingly, there has been substantial interest in the effect of these commonly used medications on COVID-19 severity. Observational studies suggest no association between outpatient ACEI or ARB use and risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation or mortality, but high-quality randomised trial evidence is lacking.</p>

                  <p id="para70">In this multicentre, international, randomised controlled trial of participants admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, we observed that continuation compared with discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy did not significantly affect the severity or duration of hospitalisation, providing high-quality evidence that adds to the findings of existing observational studies.</p>

                  <p id="para90">Consistent with international society recommendations, current evidence supports continuing renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 unless there is a clear medical contraindication to ongoing therapy.</p>

              <p id="para100">Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors are among the most commonly prescribed medications<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and the possibility of an effect of these medications on COVID-19 is of substantial importance for public health. However, published data to date have been limited to those from observational cohort studies, which suggest no association between outpatient ACEI or ARB use and risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission or mortality.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the absence of a randomised, controlled design, these studies could not address key sources of bias and confounding, and did not evaluate the important question of whether to continue or discontinue these medications in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Continuation of ACEI or ARB therapy could conceivably increase intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes, or reduce the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, improving COVID-19-related outcomes. The REPLACE COVID trial aimed to evaluate whether continuation of ACEIs and ARBs is beneficial or harmful in patients who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19.</p>

A data coordinating centre at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA, USA) oversaw data management and statistical analyses. The trial design was approved by the ethics committee of each participating centre, or in the USA, via reliance agreements with a central institutional review board (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA).

                <p id="para120">Patients aged 18 years or older, who were admitted to hospital with a clinical presentation consistent with COVID-19, and were prescribed ACEI or ARB therapy as an outpatient before the hospital admission, were eligible for enrolment. Participants were recruited upon admission to hospital. Participants were excluded if they had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test or clinical contraindications to continuing or discontinuing ACEI or ARB therapy, including systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg or more than 180 mm Hg (or &gt;160 mm Hg if unable to substitute their ACEI or ARB for another antihypertensive class of drugs); diastolic blood pressure more than 110 mm Hg; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or a clinically significant interim event likely to be associated with a reduction in ejection fraction since the last ejection fraction was assessed; serum potassium concentration of more than 5 mmol/L; known pregnancy or breast feeding; acute kidney injury with a 100% or more increase in creatinine concentration (to a creatinine concentration of &gt;177 μmol/L) compared with the most recent creatinine concentration in the past 6 months, if available; severe proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt;3 g/g or equivalent); or ongoing treatment with aliskiren or sacubitril–valsartan. Additionally, individuals were excluded if they were imprisoned or incarcerated. All participants provided written or electronic informed consent.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para130">Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy or continuation of therapy at the dose previously prescribed during their routine care, for the duration of their hospitalisation. Randomisation lists were generated by a statistician at the data coordinating centre (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) using a standard random number generator in Stata version 16.1 with permuted block randomisation in randomly varying block sizes of two, four, or six by clinical site, sex, and age. Randomisation was controlled centrally by the data coordinating centre. Allocation was concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system.</p>
                <p id="para140">Investigators and treating clinicians were aware of the assigned treatment strategy, but outcome adjudicators were not. A clinician panel was appointed to do masked adjudications of the outcome events. Each site used a standardised approach to redacting patient records so that the adjudicators were fully masked to the treatment assignments but were able to assess other important components of the hospitalisations.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">After participants were randomly assigned, their treating clinicians were asked to maintain the participant on the assigned treatment strategy unless an important clinical indication to change that strategy occurred before discharge (such as hypotension, severe uncontrolled hypertension despite treatment with other agents, hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, new onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). Clinicians were encouraged to temporarily use other antihypertensive classes that do not inhibit the renin–angiotensin system as needed for blood-pressure control among participants who were assigned to discontinuation of therapy.</p>
                <p id="para160">Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline from the participant and supplemented by the electronic health record. Clinical data, including the components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, medication administration, and adverse events, were updated daily by review of the electronic health record throughout the inpatient hospitalisation.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para170">The primary endpoint was a global rank score in which each participant was ranked against all other participants across four hierarchies of clinical outcomes collected over the duration of the hospitalisation: (1) days to death during the hospitalisation (ranked lowest to highest); followed by (2) days on invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ranked highest to lowest); followed by (3) days on renal replacement therapy or inotropic or vasopressor therapy (ranked highest to lowest); followed by (4) area under the curve (AUC) of a modified SOFA score (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 pp 12–13</xref>). The modified SOFA score incorporated the cardiac, respiratory, coagulation, and renal domains of the SOFA score (which were assessed consistently in all participants and were thought to be most relevant to renin–angiotensin system inhibition), and was weighted by duration of hospitalisation via computation of the AUC (which increases with every day of hospitalisation for any given mean modified SOFA score).

The exploratory endpoints reported here were time to intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation; hypotension requiring vasopressors, inotropes, or mechanical haemodynamic support such as a ventricular assist device or intra-aortic balloon pump; and acute kidney injury during hospitalisation. The exploratory endpoints that will be reported elsewhere were the number of 28-day ventilator-free days (invasive or non-invasive); maximal change in NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide concentration from baseline; change in serum creatinine concentration between baseline and discharge or death; and proteinuria or haematuria (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 pp 3–4</xref>).</p>

                <p id="para210">Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis using the total number of randomly assigned participants unless otherwise specified. For the primary analyses, we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare median global rank scores across treatment groups with two-sided testing. Prespecified secondary analyses of the primary endpoint used linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, pre-existing heart failure, pre-existing chronic lung disease, and ACEI versus ARB therapy at baseline. Time-to-event outcomes were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models starting at the time of enrolment and censored at the time of discharge. We assessed for violation of the proportional hazards assumption by statistical evaluation of Schoenfeld residuals and planned to incorporate a time-by-treatment interaction term if the assumption was violated. Kaplan–Meier curves were created for 28-day death and intensive care unit stay or mechanical ventilation, censored at the time of the endpoint or 28 days. Those analyses that did not include death as part of the time-to-event outcome addressed death as a competing risk. Effect modification was assessed in prespecified subgroups (age, sex, race or ethnicity, baseline ACEI <italic>vs</italic> ARB therapy, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and body-mass index) for the primary endpoint and length of hospital stay using likelihood ratio testing. Post-hoc analyses of blood pressure and laboratory values (serum potassium concentration and serum creatinine concentration) monitored for the duration of hospitalisation were done using linear mixed-effects modelling with random slope and intercept to account for within-participant random effects, with an independent covariance structure. Multiple imputation with chained equations was used to address missing covariate data. Analyses were done using Stata version 16.1.

). The median duration of hospitalisation, and thus randomly assigned treatment allocation, was 5 days (IQR 3–11). No participants were excluded or withdrawn following randomisation or lost to follow-up. Mean age of the 152 participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (SD 8), 79 (52%) had diabetes, 24 (16%) had existing cardiac disease, and all participants had a history of hypertension. 90 (59%) participants were enrolled in the USA (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 7</xref>). Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the two treatment groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>

All participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR testing, except one participant in the continuation group who had a clinical presentation consistent with COVID-19 but there was limited availability of testing upon presentation and they died in the interim.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>ACEI=angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

              <p id="para300">Continuation of ACEI or ARB therapy among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 had no overall effect on severity of COVID-19 disease course. We observed no significant difference in the primary hierarchical endpoint between participants who continued their ACEI or ARB therapy compared with those who discontinued therapy. Secondary and subgroup analyses were otherwise consistent with our primary endpoint, showing no difference in length of COVID-19 hospitalisation, need for intensive care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death between treatment groups. Multiorgan dysfunction, as depicted by the AUC of the modified SOFA score, was also similar across treatment groups. Furthermore, we observed no difference in blood pressure control, serum potassium, or serum creatinine over the course of follow-up among patients whose ACEI or ARB therapy was continued versus discontinued.</p>
              <p id="para310">We selected the global hierarchical rank score for our primary endpoint because it incorporates biomarkers and important clinical events into an integrated metric in which participants are ranked by the severity of their disease course.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our hierarchical global rank score incorporates information about each of the highest-priority events in COVID-19, but allows these events to be prioritised. For instance, the principal outcome of interest is death, but even if there is no difference in rate of death across treatment groups, we would still be interested in a shorter duration of invasive respiratory support. Accordingly, individuals in the study were directly contrasted with one another and ranked according to their time to death, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of renal replacement therapy or vasopressors, multiorgan failure, and duration of hospitalisation. Given the urgency of understanding factors that influence COVID-19-related outcomes while infection rates continue to increase in many countries, the global rank score benefits from considerably higher statistical power compared with other commonly used approaches (such as 28-day ventilator-free days, time-to-death, and the WHO COVID-19 ordinal endpoint; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 14</xref>), allowing for greater efficiency in trial implementation.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> It also provides insights into a combination of factors that are important during a global pandemic, including patient-centred hospitalisation outcomes and health-resource use.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

              <p id="para320">In designing the trial, we considered that there was clinical equipoise regarding continuation versus discontinuation of ACEI or ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19. The reason for this assessment was the existence of insufficient information on the effects of renin–angiotensin system inhibition on ACE2 expression, and on the effect of ACE2 expression on COVID-19-related outcomes. Experimental animal models have shown that ACEIs and ARBs increase ACE2 expression in several organs,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> which could theoretically amplify the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells in the lungs and other organs, thus increasing the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction, and death.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, several studies have shown no difference in ACE2 expression and activity caused by ACEI or ARB therapy in either animals<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> or humans.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, experimental animal models of SARS-CoV-1 have shown that increased ACE2 expression might protect against acute lung injury.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> These studies suggest that ACEIs and ARBs enhance host defence and mitigate the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a reduction in short-term target organ injury in addition to the known long-term benefits of these medications in the heart and kidneys.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Accordingly, several ongoing randomised trials (eg, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04335786" id="interrefs50">NCT04335786</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04311177" id="interrefs60">NCT04311177</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04328012" id="interrefs70">NCT04328012</ext-link>) are evaluating the effect of de novo introduction of ACEI or ARB therapy versus placebo for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para330">The results of this trial contribute novel information to our knowledge of the effects of continuing versus discontinuing ACEI and ARB therapy in patients with COVID-19. Our findings, derived from a prospective, multicentre, randomised, controlled design, are consistent with previously published observational studies and unpublished trial evidence, which have generally shown no difference in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among patients who are treated with ACEIs or ARBs compared with those who are not.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For example, in a case-control study of 6272 patients with COVID-19 compared with 30 759 controls, Mancia and colleagues<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> observed no association of ACEI or ARB use with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (ACEI adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·96 [95% CI 0·87–1·07]; ARB adjusted OR 0·95 [0·86–1·05]) or COVID-19 disease severity (ACEI adjusted OR 0·91 [0·69–1·21]; ARB adjusted OR 0·83 [0·63–1·10]). Similarly, in a retrospective, propensity score-matched, cohort study of 12 594 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2, Reynolds and colleagues<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> found no association of ACEI or ARB use with likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity or COVID-19 severity. The authors of many of the existing observational studies took important steps to minimise the effects of bias and confounding; however, these studies were unable to draw causal inferences about the relationship between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19-related outcomes, and could not assess inpatient exposure to ACEI or ARB therapy following the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para340">Similar to the current trial, unpublished results from the BRACE CORONA trial, a pragmatic, registry-based trial of 659 participants admitted to hospital for COVID-19 in Brazil, show no difference in days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days (mean ratio 0·95 [95% CI 0·90–1·01]) or risk of death (nine deaths in each treatment group; HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·38–2·52]) among participants randomly assigned to continue versus discontinue ACEI or ARB therapy.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The BRACE CORONA trial was characterised by a single-country design and a notably younger (mean age 55 years) and less comorbid (33% with diabetes; 5% with cardiovascular diseases) patient population than the current study, with fewer total deaths despite the larger sample size (3% mortality in the BRACE CORONA trial <italic>vs</italic> 14% mortality in our study).<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Thus, the participants in the BRACE CORONA trial might not be fully generalisable to patients typically admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and hypertension globally.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Additionally, 11% of participants enrolled in the BRACE CORONA trial were excluded after randomisation due to protocol deviations, absence of informed consent, or Good Clinical Practice violation.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para350">Strengths of our study include that, to our knowledge, it is the only registered, multicentre, international trial aiming to evaluate continuation versus discontinuation of ACEI or ARB use in patients with COVID-19. Participants were recruited across low-resource and high-resource settings and had clinical characteristics similar to those reported in most studies of hospitalised patients with COVID-19.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, the results are likely to be widely generalisable to patients on ACEIs or ARBs for the management of hypertension. Of note, due to concerns surrounding the safety of discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, these individuals were excluded from the trial. The trial was pragmatic, applying clinician implementation of the treatment strategy during routine inpatient care, further supporting the generalisability of the findings. Our novel hierarchical endpoint provides sufficient statistical power to evaluate the study question with a smaller sample size than is required for typical binary endpoints and offers greater insight into the breadth of COVID-19-related adverse outcomes (ie, time to death; duration of mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressor therapy, and hospitalisation; and severity of multiorgan dysfunction using information available in low-resource settings) than other commonly used endpoints.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para360">Limitations of the study include the small sample size, which limits the ability to draw conclusions from the secondary outcomes. Nonetheless, relative to the sample size, we observed a large number of deaths (n=21) and participants requiring intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (n=30), determined by masked outcome adjudication. These findings are consistent with other trials of COVID-19 interventions among patients admitted to hospital, and facilitate adequate statistical power to evaluate our prespecified primary endpoint despite the small sample size.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Additionally, our randomisation scheme achieved successful balance of baseline covariates across the assigned groups except with respect to previous use of ACEI (as opposed to ARB) therapy, which was higher in the discontinuation group (49% <italic>vs</italic> 33% in the continuation group). Nonetheless, our protocol had prespecified analyses planning to adjust for ACEI versus ARB use, which showed no difference in the overall findings. Furthermore, we observed no effect modification by ACEI versus ARB use. Experimental data in animals suggest that ACEIs and ARBs have differential effects on ACE2 expression and activity,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> although this might not be consistent across organs.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Although it is possible that differences in their effect on ACE2 could cause ACEIs and ARBs to impose distinctive effects on COVID-19-related outcomes, our analyses suggest no meaningful differences in effect across these two classes. Additional limitations to consider are inherent limitations of the pragmatic prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint design. We did not control participant ACEI or ARB dosing or other medication exposures during the trial, although we observed that ACEI and ARB dosing as well as off-label and adjuvant COVID-19 therapies administered during follow-up were similar across the two groups. Also, although outcome adjudicators were masked to the randomly assigned groups when determining clinical endpoints, providers caring for the patients were aware of the group the patient was assigned to. It is possible that the open-label nature of the study might have introduced information bias or influenced provider behaviour. Nonetheless, this pragmatic approach enhances the generalisability of the findings to routine patient care.</p>
              <p id="para370">In conclusion, among patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, continuation and discontinuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors have similar effects on acute hospitalisation outcomes. Consistent with current international society recommendations, providers should continue to prescribe these medications in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 unless there is a distinct medical contraindication to ongoing therapy. Ongoing trials will determine whether de novo use of these medications is effective for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
