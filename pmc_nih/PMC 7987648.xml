                  <p>The Science, PE, &amp; Me! (SPEM) curriculum is a concept-based physical education curriculum that offers students coherent educational experiences for constructing health-related fitness knowledge through movement experiences.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The study used a cluster randomized controlled design in which 30 elementary schools in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the eastern United States were randomly assigned to an experimental or comparison condition. Although all students in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades in the targeted schools were eligible to participate in the study, a random sample of students from the experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 1749; 15 schools) and comparison groups (<italic>n</italic> = 1985; 15 schools) provided data. Students’ motivational response to the SPEM curriculum or comparison curriculum was measured using the previously validated Situational Interest Scale–Elementary. Data were analyzed using structural mean modeling.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The results demonstrated that the experimental group (as reference group) showed significantly higher enjoyment (<italic>z</italic> = –2.01), challenge (<italic>z</italic> = –6.54), exploration (<italic>z</italic> = –12.195), novelty (<italic>z</italic> = –8.80), and attention demand (<italic>z</italic> = –7.90) than the comparison group.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>The findings indicate that the SPEM curriculum created a more situationally interesting context for learning than the comparison physical education curriculum.</p>

                <title>Research on learners’ interest in PE</title>
                <p id="para0010">Initial work on learners’ interest in PE was conducted by Chen in 1996,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> after which the body of literature on situational interest has grown tremendously. In a recent review, Chen and Wang<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> came to 2 conclusions concerning the utility of situational interest in PE. First, the conceptualizations of situational interest and its 5 sources (i.e., novelty, challenge, attention demand, exploration, and instant enjoyment) are well-substantiated by empirical evidence.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> These 5 situational interest sources suggest that a learning task should (a) present new information that was unknown to the learner (i.e., novelty), (b) have optimal difficulty and be achievable through effort (i.e., challenge), (c) demand and draw the learner's attention (i.e., attention demand), (d) offer the learner the opportunity to discover and explore solutions (i.e., exploration), and (e) offer the learner a sense of delight (i.e., enjoyment). Situational interest can exert spontaneous, short-lived, and powerful motivation forces to drive learners for engagement and learning. To entice situational interest, a physical educator may make purposeful pedagogical manipulations on any of the 5 sources of situational interest. One of the motivational impacts of situational interest is its influence on facilitating physical engagement (captured by step count, energy expenditure, vector magnitude, and PA time) both in and outside of PE classes.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These 2 conclusions provide a theoretical foundation and practical strategies for guiding pedagogical manipulations that promote in-class engagement as well as overall PA participation. Physical educators are encouraged to make pedagogical manipulations in their curriculum to trigger and maintain students’ situational interest and therefore facilitate engagement and learning.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Such pedagogical manipulations can target the 5 sources of situational interest: perceptions of novelty, challenge, attention demand, exploration, and instant enjoyment.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The design of the SPEM curriculum, for example, takes into account all 5 sources of situational interest as motivational elements so that students perceive their SPEM experience as attention demanding, challenging, explorative, enjoyable, and novel.</p>

                <p id="para0011">Despite the plethora of research on situational interest as described, to our knowledge no large-scale curriculum intervention studies have examined the motivational response to the curriculum from the perspective of situational interest. SPEM is a multi-year PE curriculum intervention focused on teaching upper-elementary school students the knowledge and behaviors necessary for health-related fitness. Prior research has lent support to the efficacy of SPEM in increasing elementary school students’ health-related fitness knowledge<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> while also keeping students physically active in class.<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Importantly, SPEM lessons were designed to address the learners’ motivational response to the curriculum experience by embedding the 5 situational interest sources in the tasks. It was assumed that this design would stimulate students’ situational interest when they received the SPEM curriculum. However, this assumption has yet to be tested through empirical evidence. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate students’ motivational response to the SPEM curriculum from the perspective of situational interest. It was hypothesized that students who experienced the SPEM curriculum would report higher scores on the measures of the 5 situational interest sources compared to those who did not experience the curriculum. The findings from this study advance our current understanding about the pedagogical significance of situational interest and its sources in curriculum design.</p>

                <title>The SPEM curriculum vs. comparison curriculum</title>
                <p id="para0018">The SPEM curriculum was designed by a team of master PE teachers, science education teachers, and university researchers.<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Its development was guided by the principles of social constructivist learning theory<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> and the domain learning theory.<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The theme of the curriculum is “learning science through physical activity” in addition to the situational interest perspective.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The curriculum affords students with abundant opportunities to conduct PA experiments as lived experiences to construct a deeper understanding of fitness, active living, and nutrition concepts. The curriculum includes three 10-lesson units for each grade. Dr. Love's Healthy Heart unit focuses on learning concepts of building and improving cardiorespiratory fitness and health, Mickey's Mighty Muscle focuses on muscular function and health, and Flex Coolbody's Fitness Club focuses on healthy flexibility and nutrition. In total, the SPEM curriculum consists of 90 lessons, 30 lessons for each of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades.<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> More important, each lesson is structured following a 5E instructional system (i.e., engagement, exploration, explanation, evaluation, and elaboration) in which the 5 sources of situational interest<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> are carefully cultivated. For example, each lesson begins with an engagement activity that is usually an exciting game used to induce instant enjoyment. An experiment activity follows, in which learning tasks enticing students’ curiosity are given for them to explore their body's secret responses to exercise. In the elaboration activity, students conduct Think, Pair, Share tasks to continuously challenge themselves by learning from each other. A unique learning tool in SPEM is its companion student workbook. Upon completion of each task or experiment, students record the data/information related to their body responses to exercise, such as heart rate, estimated physical exertion, and repetition of weight lifting, in their personal workbook and then use the data to answer a variety of questions. The workbook tasks are structured in 3 levels of cognition: descriptive tasks, relational tasks, and reasoning tasks. The tasks in this structure gradually guide students to high cognitive attention, another source of situational interest,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and eventually contribute to student knowledge gain.<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para0019"><xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates some examples of curricular manipulation on these constructs. To increase students’ sense of novelty, the SPEM curriculum offers new PE games, activities, or tasks that may be perceived as novel. For example, a 5th-grade lesson within the Flex Coolbody unit provides students with the opportunity to Explore (i.e., the 2nd E of the 5E system) and compare different methods of throwing to understand the concept of range of motion and flexibility. Through bodily experiment, students realize the importance of using a full range of motion (which requires good flexibility) to throw effectively and then develop the skill of throwing. Challenge is represented by the difficulty level of a lesson or task appropriate to the students’ abilities. A moderately challenging task provides most students with the opportunity to achieve success through effort. However, a task that is too difficult or too easy would not likely be perceived by most students as interesting.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The deliberations of the expert panel ensured that the lessons, activities, and tasks had the appropriate level of difficulty to sustain interest. Other than novelty and challenge, a situationally interesting task demands student attention and should be explorative and enjoyable. In each SPEM lesson, students act as curious junior scientists who must stay attentive to engage, explore, explain, and evaluate their ability to learn to solve the problems (i.e., explorative) documented in their student workbooks. They work in small groups or in pairs to construct knowledge of health-related fitness through peer socialization. As the junior scientists conduct their experiments, the teacher scaffolds the students’ explorations through Elaboration of the concepts. Through socialization with peers and the teacher, students construct meaningful learning and close the zone of proximal development.<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Last, another parameter of curriculum design for the SPEM curriculum is enjoyment. Fitness concepts are integrated in fun and active games or activities for enhanced kinesthetic experiences and learning achievement.

The PE teachers mainly followed the direct teaching style, where the teacher directs and students follow. The teachers in the comparison schools also received a 3-day placebo training from the research team.

                <p id="para0026">In Step 2, we used a multi-group CFA approach. Before we were able to evaluate differences in factor means, we assumed that the model structure of situational interest was equivalent across groups; that is, the model specified in <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> should fit for both SPEM and the comparison curriculum conditions. In Step 2, we also assumed that the values of model parameters were equivalent between groups.<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Specifically, we conducted a sequential CFA multi-group analysis (a separate single-group CFA, 2-group model CFA, and multi-sample significance) to determine whether the situational interest model was invariant between the 2 groups. The single-group CFA results suggested that the model is tenable for each condition separately. The results from the 2-group CFA indicated that the 2-group model that tested data from both conditions simultaneously is tenable (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 583.85, <italic>df</italic> = 160, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, CFI = 0.97, SRMR = 0.03, and RMSEA = 0.040 with 95%CI of 0.040–0.046).

                <title>Step 3: SMM analysis</title>
                <p id="para0027">Given the fact that the aforementioned CFA multi-group analysis showed a good measurement model between the 2 groups, we proceeded to the SMM analysis to address the purpose of the study: to evaluate elementary school students’ response to situational interest in the SPEM curriculum. In this step, the factor intercepts were allowed to be variant between conditions so that the factor/latent means could differ if there was any difference. The SMM results showed that all latent means (<xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) of the situational interest factors from the SPEM condition were significantly higher than means from the comparison condition (<italic>z</italic> = –7.90, –6.54, –12.195, –2.01, and –8.80 for attention, challenge, exploration, enjoyment, and novelty, respectively). Using attention for an example (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we assessed latent mean differences by using the experimental group as a reference group. The results suggest that the mean latent attention demand is significantly higher for the experimental group than for the comparison group (comparison mean = –0.225, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), given the fact that intercepts are invariant across groups. The standardized effect size values suggested low to moderate practical significance (<italic>d</italic> = 0.37, 0.36, 0.63, 0.09, and 0.41 for attention, challenge, exploration, enjoyment, and novelty, respectively), all favoring the responses from the SPEM condition. These SMM results confirmed the intent of the SPEM curriculum development, which was designed to be situationally attractive and interesting. It is worth noting, however, that the standardized effect size should be higher than those found with measured variables because latent variables are error-free while the measured variable allows for measurement error.<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> The standardized effect sizes in this study, therefore, are considered to be small, except for exploration, according to the cut-off points (0.23, 0.56, and 0.89 for small, medium, and large standardized latent effects, respectively).<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The difference on mean latent attention demand (AT) between 2 groups.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0028">The purpose of this study was to evaluate learners’ motivational response to the SPEM curriculum from the perspective of situational interest. Following a cluster randomized controlled research design, our analysis attempted to identify the effect of the SPEM curriculum on students’ situational interest. The results confirmed that the SPEM curriculum generated significantly higher situational interest than the comparison curriculum did. The findings add to the extant research literature by confirming the feasibility of manipulating curriculum factors to stimulate learners’ situational interest in elementary school PE.</p>
              <p id="para0029">A key finding is that the students in the SPEM curriculum condition reported significantly higher situational interest than those in the comparison curriculum group. It has been observed occasionally in prior research that attention demand (e.g., increased demand of cognition) in PE can be a source of situational interest.<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Physical educators are encouraged to exploit the opportunity to design tasks that trigger and maintain situational interest for the learner. Our finding provides evidence that the concept-based, knowledge-rich SPEM curriculum was perceived by the elementary school students to be more interesting than the comparison curriculum. One unique aspect of the SPEM curriculum is its 5E structure (i.e., engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation) through which students cognitively engage as they perform movement tasks and activities in each lesson. The 5E structure enables the concept-based curriculum to be cognitively demanding, which is likely to be a main stimulating factor that entices student situational interest. This observation is in support of previous findings that reported an increase in situational interest when the PA tasks increased students’ attention demand.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para0030">It is noticeable that the students in the SPEM condition rated task novelty higher than students in the comparison condition did. This finding confirms that the SPEM curriculum offered students novel knowledge and experiences. The intentional focus of the curriculum on learning health-related fitness concepts through modified games and activities appears to make the learning experience novel in comparison with the traditional PE curriculum that the students in the comparison condition experienced. For instance, in the Dr. Love's Health Heart unit, students were guided by scaffolding tasks specified in the workbook to construct knowledge about cardiorespiratory endurance fitness through PAs such as running and jumping ropes. After each activity, students returned to the workbook to record their observations, analyze their physiological responses, and reach a conclusion about benefits from the activity. This seems to be more a novel task than merely participating in these activities without tangible purposes. This and other similar tasks about the scientific mechanisms underlying PA and movement participation seem to be sources of motivation that resulted in the informed association between PA and cognitive understanding among the young children.</p>
              <p id="para0031">Speculatively, it may not be an overreach to argue that a link between the physical and cognitive components of a learning task presents an opportunity for young learners to effectively bridge new cognitive information with their experiential repertoire developed mostly through physical activities. These tasks would possibly elevate and satisfy students’ curiosity through novel experiences better than those tasks with a single focus on cognition or physical movement in the conventional curriculum. Engaging in these PA experiments and games associated with health-related knowledge does not demand a high level of sport skill proficiency and yet results in more instant enjoyment. This curriculum environment could be particularly friendly to students with an average or lower level of sport skills and could provide them with meaningful and enjoyable PA experiences and opportunities to learn knowledge beneficial for lifelong health.</p>
              <p id="para0032">While situational interest has been characterized as a short-lived, immediate engagement prompter,<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> a consistent lesson structure (such as the 5E in this study) coupled with comparable PA tasks tends to generate repeatable levels of situational interest.<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Hidi and Renninger<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> proposed a theoretical hypothesis on interest development. One important component is the possibility of situational interest transition from a “trigger” phase to a “sustained” (or maintained) phase where individual interest, which is more stable and long-lasting, would start to emerge.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In a preliminary study, for instance, Zhu and Dragon<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> tracked students’ situational interest through 5 consecutive lessons using the same lesson structure and comparable PA tasks, and their results showed that students reported a similar level of situational interest across those 5 PE lessons.<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> In other words, situational interest remained stable over multiple class periods. Because the SPEM curriculum used a consistent 5E structure for all lessons and students were expected to conduct experiments based on PA in every lesson, it is highly likely that the higher situational interest in the SPEM condition will be sustained throughout and across the units. Development of Individual interest relies on the development of knowledge and values.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Coupled with in-depth knowledge and values of PA as major content, the repeated exposure to situationally interesting tasks with knowledge and values assisted in the students’ development of initial individual interest, which in turn led them to a stronger perception of situational interest in SPEM. This informed speculation, however, needs to be confirmed by future research.</p>
              <p id="para0033">In addition to the curricular level, at the instructional task level the integration of cognitive demand into teaching strategies is crucial in that higher cognitive demand also increases the level of the students’ perceived situational interest.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Specifically, in the SPEM curriculum the Think, Pair, Share strategy and the workbook tasks add cognitive demands to the PAs and thus could be a contributing factor for the elevated situational interest reported in this study. As cautioned by Zhu and Chen,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> adding cognitive demand, however, should depend on the cognitive demand level of the current task and the specific characteristics of the students. An overwhelming level of cognitive demand could potentially reduce participation and situational interest.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The findings of this study show a low to moderate level of situational interest in SPEM, which could have contributed to the significant knowledge gain that resulted from the SPEM curriculum intervention.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para0034">Facilitating situational interest in PE has important implications.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In particular, situational interest has been shown to positively correlate with PA participation.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Thus, a curriculum with situationally interesting tasks is likely to contribute to a higher level of PA participation. In the case of the SPEM curriculum, a previous study demonstrated that students’ PA levels during the lessons was not compromised in spite of their higher cognitive engagement and achievement compared to students in a regular PE curriculum.<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The higher situational interest generated by the SPEM curriculum is likely to facilitate students’ physical engagement, cognitive engagement, and knowledge achievement compared to a regular PE curriculum.</p>
              <p id="para0035">Due to the present study's cluster randomized controlled design and large random student sample, the findings reported here have added external validity, which increases generalizability of the findings. A motivated learner is the most effective learner, and interest in learning is the best guide for a learner. We encourage physical educators and teacher educators to incorporate the findings from this study into their daily teaching to increase situational interest. This includes deliberately changing the task structure, lesson organization, and even the entire curriculum.</p>
              <p id="para0036">Despite the strength added to our study by a randomized controlled design, we note the following limitations. First, we did not conduct a thorough manipulation check to investigate the extent to which the teachers followed the lesson plans during implementation. To address this concern prospectively, we sent trained data collectors to observe the implementation of the curriculum but we decided not to report these data because of significant missing data. Second, in our data analysis, we did not take into account potential moderating variables such as grade, gender, individual interest, or prior achievement in PE, because it was not our research purpose to test the curriculum effect caused by these variables. Future research should look into the potential group differences as they relate to these variables.</p>

              <p id="para0037">In addition to the findings from previous studies,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> the findings in this study further support the value of the SPEM curriculum by verifying that the motivational component built into the curriculum generated positive results, as it was designed to do. Students in the experimental condition perceived the curriculum and learning to be more situationally interesting than their counterparts in the regular PE curriculum. The findings from this research, with its robust design, provide strong evidence suggesting that there are benefits to be gained from the dissemination of this evidence-based curriculum to other school districts within or beyond the original research site. To improve program scalability and implementation sustainability, such dissemination efforts should consider local adaptations to the curriculum based on feedback gathered before and during implementation through process evaluation.<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> More important, the findings clearly encourage physical educators to take advantages of situational interest to enhance students’ physical engagement during PE classes. Our study has generated new information that is useful in guiding future curriculum design that facilitates positive student motivation, in-class engagement, and learning achievement. The implementation of the SPEM curriculum can be challenging, but through tailored staff training, PE teachers can successfully implement the curriculum into their schools.<xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Physical educators who are interested in teaching health-related fitness knowledge while maintaining students’ interest and PA levels are encouraged to consider adopting the SPEM curriculum.</p>
