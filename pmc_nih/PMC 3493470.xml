              <abstract>
                <p>Antigenic variation to evade host immunity has long been assumed to be a driving force of diversifying selection in pathogens. Colonization by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, which is central to the organism's transmission and therefore evolution, is limited by two arms of the immune system: antibody- and T cell- mediated immunity. In particular, the effector activity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell mediated immunity has been shown to act <italic>in trans</italic>, clearing co-colonizing pneumococci that do not bear the relevant antigen. It is thus unclear whether T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity allows benefit of antigenic variation and contributes to diversifying selection. Here we show that antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity almost equally reduces colonization by both an antigen-positive strain and a co-colonized, antigen-negative strain in a mouse model of pneumococcal carriage, thus potentially minimizing the advantage of escape from this type of immunity. Using a proteomic screening approach, we identified a list of candidate human CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell antigens. Using this list and a previously published list of pneumococcal Antibody antigens, we bioinformatically assessed the signals of diversifying selection among the identified antigens compared to non-antigens. We found that Antibody antigen genes were significantly more likely to be under diversifying selection than the T<sub>H</sub>17 cell antigen genes, which were indistinguishable from non-antigens. Within the Antibody antigens, epitopes recognized by human antibodies showed stronger evidence of diversifying selection. Taken together, the data suggest that T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-mediated immunity, one form of T cell immunity that is important to limit carriage of antigen-positive pneumococcus, favors little diversifying selection in the targeted antigen. The results could provide new insight into pneumococcal vaccine design.</p>

                <p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, or pneumococcus, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children and elderly persons worldwide. Current pneumococcus vaccines target a limited number of clinically important serotypes, while strains with serotypes not targeted by current vaccines are increasing in importance in both carriage and invasive disease. As a result, there has been a substantial interest to develop novel, cost-effective vaccines based on protein antigens from pneumococcus. To this end, it is critical to understand how the human immune system exerts selection pressures on the targeted antigens. Two immune mechanisms targeting pneumococcal protein antigens have been documented, mediated by antibody and T cells, respectively. In this study, we screened for pneumococcal antigens that are commonly recognized by human CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Using a mouse model of pneumococcal colonization, we demonstrate that T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-based immunity almost equally reduces colonization by both an antigen-positive strain and a co-colonizing, antigen-negative strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DNA sequences of T<sub>H</sub>17 cell antigens demonstrate no detectable signs of being under selective pressure, unlike pneumococcal antigens known to be strong antibody targets. Thus, one form of the T cell-mediated immunity that is important to limit carriage of antigen-positive pneumococcus favors little diversifying selection in the targeted antigen. These results suggest evolution of escape from T<sub>H</sub>17 -based vaccines may be slower than from antibody-based vaccines.</p>

                <p>To better quantify the potential competitive advantage for the antigen-negative strain, we constructed nonparametric confidence intervals for the median of the difference in log<sub>10</sub> (AVO/OVA) between the immunized group and the control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002989-t001">Table 1</xref>). A median greater than 0 would indicate a competitive advantage for the AVO strain in the immunized group. The 95% confidence intervals for median difference in log<sub>10</sub> (AVO/OVA) were (‚àí0.006, 0.563), (‚àí1.437, 0.456), and (‚àí0.2319, 1.015) on days 1, 4, and 8, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002989-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the loss of an antigen was unlikely to provide a more than 10.4-fold (1.015 log<sub>10</sub>) median increase in competitive advantage for the AVO strain by day 8. We also note that the increased frequency of AVO strains was almost entirely found in mice who have nearly cleared colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In absolute CFU numbers, therefore, the relative advantage is unlikely to be associated with much overall superiority.</p>
                <p>In mice that remain colonized on days 4 and 8, a negative correlation between the AVO/OVA ratio and total CFU recovered was observed in the immunized group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) but not in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggested that the antigen-negative strain gains a relative advantage only for the period where bacterial numbers are rather low.</p>

An N-terminal fragment of PtrA (SP0641.1) was the most strongly recognized antigen in the screen with an antigenicity score of 1.58√ó10<sup>‚àí17</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Clones with a score less than 0.05 were defined as the common antigens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1002989-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                    <p>(A) The average of duplicate ELISA measurements of the IL-17A concentration in the supernatant for each protein pool is displayed. The dashed line separates data points from the two dimensions of the pooled library (see SI for details). Each pair of colored geometric data points marks the data from pools that contain the same clone. (B) The MAD score for each pool measured in screens of enriched T<sub>H</sub>17 cells from 36 subjects was compared to the MAD score for wells containing MoDCs pulsed with <italic>E. coli</italic>-expressing GFP using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The antigenicity score for PtrA (SP0641.1), calculated by multiplying the p-values resulting from the Mann-Whitney test of the two pools containing the clone, is also displayed.</p>

                <title>Detection of diversifying selection in pneumococcus</title>
                <p>To evaluate genetic diversity and the underlying selection pressure on pneumococcal proteins, we systematically examined protein-encoding regions from the genome sequence data of 39 publicly-available pneumococcus strains for evidence of diversifying selection. Based on information accompanying the genome sequence data, the collection of strains covered 14 common serotypes (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002989.s004">Text S1</xref>). Although the strains used in our study are not a random sample of any population and may overrepresent clinical (invasive) isolates, the distribution of serotype frequency in this study was reasonably consistent with distribution reported in human carriage <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Bogaert1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002989.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
                <p>A flowchart of the analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. Open reading frames (ORFs) that were inferred to represent the same gene in different strains were grouped together to form an orthologous group. A total of 2773 unique unambiguous groups were generated by the Proteinortho4 software <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Lechner1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Sequence alignment of genes within an orthologous group was performed using the PRANK software <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Loytynoja1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Extensive sequence variation was observed for many pneumococcal protein-encoding genes. The nucleotide diversity for a gene ranged from 0 to 0.23 with a median of 0.0091 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

                <p>To identify pneumococcal genes that show signs of being under diversifying selection, we analyzed the non-synonymous to synonymous substitution (dN/dS) ratio for codon sites in each gene using the PAML package as described by Yang <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Signs of being under diversifying selection were detected by a likelihood ratio test in which a null model (dN/dS &lt;‚Ää=‚Ää1 for all codons) was compared with an alternative model (dN/dS&gt;1for at least one codon), as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. We concluded signs of diversifying selection for a gene if the null model was rejected at the significance level of 0.05. By this criterion, 658 genes (23.7%) showed signs of being under diversifying selection. The subsequent Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> identified 1410 codon sites, or 0.178% of total codon sites, to be under diversifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Codon sites under diversifying selection were enriched in cell envelope genes (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002989.s004">Text S1</xref>), consistent with that interaction with antibodies might be a source of selection pressure on the pneumococcal protein antigens.</p>

                <title>A link between immune recognition and diversifying selection</title>
                <p>We hypothesized that if human immunity had promoted diversifying selection in pneumococcal antigens, the antigen genes would exhibit higher sequence diversity than non-antigen genes. Genes encoding CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> 17 antigens were identified as described above. Genes encoding Antibody antigens were obtained from the list published by Giefing <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002989-Giefing1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. TIGR4 genes belonging to an orthologous group of two or more genes were analyzed, including 1648 non-antigens, 48 T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens and 80 Antibody antigens. In addition, the regions of Antibody antigens genes that included epitopes were also noted by Giefing <italic>et al</italic>., facilitating our comparisons of non-antigens, Antibody antigen-encoding genes, and the epitope-containing and non-epitope-containing regions of these antigen-encoding genes.</p>
                <p>The average non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) of Antibody antigens was significantly higher than that of non-antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; median 0.0032 vs. 0.0025; p‚Ää=‚Ää0.022, Mann-Whitney test).

                <p>Not all codon sites within a gene need be under the same selective force. To understand the contribution of host immunity to diversifying selection, we were particularly interested in whether the codon sites that did show an estimated dN/dS ratio greater than 1 were equally distributed among antigen categories. We found that 0.183% of the codon sites located in the non-antigen genes showed dN/dS ratio greater than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). For codon sites in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> 17 antigen genes, a higher fraction (0.33%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) showed a dN/dS ratio greater than 1. An even higher fraction (0.46%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) of the Antibody antigen codon sites showed a dN/dS ratio greater than 1. Furthermore, within the Antibody antigens, the regions in antibody epitopes showed a higher density of codon sites with dN/dS greater than 1 than the non-epitope regions (0.62% vs. 0.42%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the genomic regions that interact with antibody-mediated immunity appeared to be more enriched for codon sites with signs of being under diversifying selection, with a weaker signal of diversifying selection in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens.</p>
                <p>To account for correlations between different codon sites within a gene and for differences in gene length that would make longer genes more likely, by chance alone, to have sites with elevated dN/dS ratios, we employed a generalized-estimating-equation (GEE) model to examine the ‚Äúpopulation-averaged‚Äù effect of being recognized by human immunity on the probability that a gene is under diversifying selection <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Zeger1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Essentially, we treated the status of each individual codon in a gene (whether or not the codon showed sign of being under diversifying selection) as the outcome of a repeated measurement for the status of the gene (whether or not the gene showed sign of being under diversifying selection). During model fitting, the covariance structure across codon sites within a gene was treated as a nuisance parameter. The output of the model fitting showed that being an Antibody antigen is a highly significant predictor for being under diversifying selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; OR‚Ää=‚Ää2.23, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.0016) and being a T<sub>H</sub>17 antigen is a weaker, and not statistically significant predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002989-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, OR‚Ää=‚Ää1.57, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.17). Taken together, these results indicated that antibody immunity made a greater contribution than CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> 17 cell immunity to diversifying selection on antigen genes in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p>
                <p>To examine the robustness of our results, we carried out the analysis of diversifying selection using a different alignment algorithm <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, as well as another evolution model proposed by Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., which allows estimation of the dN/dS ratio in the presence of recombination <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. All analyses yielded qualitatively similar results (Table S3 and Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002989.s004">Text S1</xref>).</p>

              <p>In this study, we investigated the contribution of host immunity to the diversifying selection in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-mediated immunity, elicited by exposure to pneumococci bearing a targeted antigen, cleared pneumococci that do not bear this antigen <italic>in trans</italic> almost as efficiently as it cleared the antigen-bearing cells. Thus, T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity limited the competitive benefit of antigenic variation within a colonized host, potentially reducing a driving force of diversifying selection. Consistent with this notion, we found a weak, and not statistically significant association between diversifying selection and recognition by human T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity. We hypothesize that this lack of selection is due to <italic>in trans</italic> killing of antigen-negative bacteria by innate cells recruited through T<sub>H</sub>17 cells recognition of antigen-expressing bacteria. However, the promiscuity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitope recognition <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Wucherpfennig1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> could also play a role as it may be more difficult for bacteria to mutate the recognized antigens to avoid T cell recognition. In contrast to T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens, there was a significant association between recognition by human antibody and diversifying selection on the antigen. These data suggest that these two mechanisms of acquired immunity exert distinct selection forces on their respective antigens in <italic>S. pneumoniae.</italic>
</p>
              <p>We observed that an antigen-negative (AVO)/antigen-positive (OVA) ratio higher than 1 was associated with lower CFU in the ovalbumin-immunized mice but not in the control mice. This supported the antigen-specificity of the immunity recalled by the OVA strain. In principle, there are three stages of the pneumococcal life cycle in which escape from immunity might be beneficial: (1) an advantage for an escape variant by mutation or deletion of an antigen that is the target of an immune response during infection; (2) an advantage for a variant in colonizing a host already responding to a ‚Äúwild-type‚Äù strain that is resident and targeted by the host's response; (3) an advantage for a variant in colonizing a host that is currently uncolonized with any pneumococcal strain, but has immunity to wild-type alleles of the antigen from previous exposure. <italic>Cis</italic>-acting immune effectors, such as antibodies, would be expected to provide an advantage for a variant at all three of these stages. Our animal experiments suggest that for CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, the advantage of an immune-escape variant would be small at stages 1 and 2, because of <italic>in-trans</italic> killing; the first stage is particularly important because this is where a variant would likely first arise. Still, one would expect some advantage for CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell escape variants at the third stage ‚Äì colonization of an uncolonized but partially immune host; this possibly may account for the weaker, less statistically convincing evidence of enrichment for diversifying selection in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens.</p>
              <p>Escape from CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub> 17 cell immunity in our in vivo model should be more favored than in natural settings, for two reasons. First, we constructed a model in which the T<sub>H</sub>17 epitope was completely deleted (and replaced with the reverse amino acid sequence), rather than creating a point mutation; given the promiscuity of T cell responses, many point mutations might make little or no difference to T cell recognition. Second, natural exposure to pneumococci would induce immunity to multiple T cell (and antibody) antigens, so that escape from a single response would not necessarily create a major advantage. The fact that we saw a modest benefit of losing the sole CD4+ T cell epitope against which the mice had been immunized argues that the benefit would be even weaker under natural conditions.</p>
              <p>The high throughput screen was designed to pick up the antigens with the strongest T<sub>H</sub>17 responses in the studied sample. This strength includes both frequency of response in the studied population and the strength of the response within individuals. The Mann-Whitney analysis does not allow us to define whether an antigen was positive in any given subject. However, if we use a different analysis method of taking antigens that induce a response greater than 1.2 MAD above the median, we find that the most common antigen was recognized by 47% of the subjects, with most antigens present in 10‚Äì20% of subjects (data not shown), indicating a reasonably broad T<sub>H</sub>17 response. We acknowledge that there are weaker responses in these individuals that may have not been detected, but we posit that any selective pressure on T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens should be more robust in the strongly recognized antigens. Since no association between signs of diversifying selection and the human T<sub>H</sub>17 antigens we identified was found, the observation supports our hypothesis that CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity in humans allows minimal competitive benefit for antigenic variation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. It is also important to note that only antigens recognized by IL-17A secreting T cells were identified. If the antigens recognized by different T cell lineages are distinct <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, other T cells lineages may exert stronger selective pressure depending on their mechanism of action.</p>
              <p>We found that genomic regions that showed signs of being under diversifying selection were enriched in the antibody antigen genes and further enriched in the epitopes targeted by antibodies. This finding was consistent with the conventional understanding that avoidance of antibody-recognition can provide a substantial competitive benefit. The magnitude of the enrichment was consistently modest among all analyses. It is possible that multiple ways to avoid antibody-recognition exist, reducing the dependence on non-synonymous substitutions in the antigens. For example, antigens can be temporarily down regulated at the expression level to escape from host immunity, as was seen in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1002989-Scherf1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> and suggested for meningococci under vaccine pressure <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Maiden1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Antigens are also proteins carrying out physiological functions for the pathogen at the same time. They might be subjected to diversifying, purifying or other selective forces in addition to those imposed by acquired immunity. However, the significant association between antibody-recognition and diversifying selection despite these putative competing mechanisms suggested that antibodies impose a strong fitness cost on the antigen-bearing pneumococcus. In addition, it would be interesting to understand whether the diversifying selection differs in selected genes according to the invasive potential and transformability of the strain. Appropriate comparison would require much larger samples, which we hope to investigate in future studies.</p>
              <p>CD4+ T subsets other than the T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, such as the IFN-Œ≥ producing T<sub>H</sub>1 cells, have been proposed to play important roles in the control of pneumococcal invasive disease <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Weber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> but not, to our knowledge, colonization. In fact, in our colonization model, the IFN-Œ≥ mediated mechanism appeared to be dispensable <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Lu3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our screen would not have picked up antigens that elicited CD4+ T responses unless they also stimulated IL-17A production. Further work might address the contribution of other forms of T cell mediated immunity to diversifying selection.</p>
              <p>This study suggests that CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity creates little selective pressure for antigenic variation while efficiently protecting against pneumococcal colonization, and suggest that the reason for this lack of selection may be due to efficient <italic>in trans</italic> killing of antigenic variants arising within a host. It is conceivable that a vaccine designed to induce T<sub>H</sub>17 cell immunity might limit the immune escape of antigenic variants and result in broader and longer protection. To this end, further research is ongoing to characterize the major T<sub>H</sub>17 cell antigens in pneumococcus and identify methods for eliciting this type of immunity through vaccination <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Lu4" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.</p>

                <p>The gene sequences of each orthologous group were aligned based on the amino acid sequences they encode (codon alignment) and a gene tree was constructed using either the ClustalW software or the PRANK software <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Loytynoja1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A likelihood ratio test was applied to compare a null model with an alternative model of the distribution of the dN/dS ratio parameter, œâ, among codon sites, as described in <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Yang2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In the null model (nearly-neutral model), each codon site within a gene is assumed to be either under purifying selection (œâ0&lt;1) or under neutral evolution (œâ1‚Ää=‚Ää1). In the alternative model (positive selection model), a codon site can be under purifying selection (œâ0&lt;1), under neutral evolution (œâ1‚Ää=‚Ää1) or under diversifying selection (œâ2&gt;1). For each model, the log likelihood value was calculated by the CodeML program from the package PAML <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. If the null model was rejected by the likelihood ratio test at a significance level of 0.05, the gene represented by the orthologous group would be considered as being under diversifying selection. For such genes, a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis implemented in the CodeML program <xref rid="ppat.1002989-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> was used to determine the particular codon sites that were under diversifying selection.</p>
                <p>The output file of the CodeML program included non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) derived from pair wise sequence comparison. The average dN for each orthologous group was estimated by averaging over all pair wise dNs.</p>

The codon alignment of each orthologous group was analyzed by Omegamap software with a prior exponential distribution of œâ and a prior œâ mean of 1. Each codon site was assumed to have independent œâ and the posterior distributions of œâ were obtains by 500,000 iterations. A codon site was defined to show evidence of being under diversifying selection if 95% of its posterior distribution of œâ was above 1. A gene was considered to show evidence of being under diversifying selection if any codon site within the gene showed sign of being under diversifying selection.
