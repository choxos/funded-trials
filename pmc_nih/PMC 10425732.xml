                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Patients with unresectable/metastatic chondrosarcoma have poor prognoses; conventional chondrosarcoma is associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of &lt;4 months after first-line chemotherapy. No standard targeted therapies are available. We present the preclinical characterization of INBRX-109, a third-generation death receptor 5 (DR5) agonist, and clinical findings from a phase I trial of INBRX-109 in unresectable/metastatic chondrosarcoma (NCT03715933).</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>INBRX-109 was first characterized preclinically as a DR5 agonist, with binding specificity and hepatotoxicity evaluated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and antitumor activity evaluated both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. INBRX-109 (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) was then evaluated in a phase I study of solid tumors, which included a cohort with any subtype of chondrosarcoma and a cohort with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>-mutant conventional chondrosarcoma. The primary endpoint was safety. Efficacy was an exploratory endpoint, with measures including objective response, disease control rate, and PFS.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In preclinical studies, INBRX-109 led to antitumor activity in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models, with minimal hepatotoxicity. In the phase I study, INBRX-109 was well tolerated and demonstrated antitumor activity in unresectable/metastatic chondrosarcoma. INBRX-109 led to a disease control rate of 87.1% [27/31; durable clinical benefit, 40.7% (11/27)], including two partial responses, and median PFS of 7.6 months. Most treatment-related adverse events, including liver-related events, were low grade (grade ≥3 events in chondrosarcoma cohorts, 5.7%).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>INBRX-109 demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with a favorable safety profile in patients with unresectable/metastatic chondrosarcoma. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial (ChonDRAgon, NCT04950075) will further evaluate INBRX-109 in conventional chondrosarcoma.</p>

              <p>Chondrosarcoma is a rare, indolent, heterogeneous, malignant bone tumor. Conventional chondrosarcoma, which accounts for approximately 80% of chondrosarcomas, is largely resistant to chemotherapy and radiation; nonconventional chondrosarcoma (e.g., dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma) is generally associated with more aggressive growth. Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment, and options for patients with unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma are limited, with no improvement in outcomes observed in 30 years. In our study, INBRX-109, a novel, tetravalent DR5 agonist, demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity, including objective response and durable clinical benefit, and a favorable safety profile in patients with unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma. Our data suggest that DR5 is a valid target and that INBRX-109, with its favorable safety and efficacy profile, warrants further evaluation as a novel targeted therapy for chondrosarcoma. Additional ongoing studies, including a randomized phase II study, will confirm the activity of INBRX-109 in unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chondrosarcoma, one of the over 100 different types of sarcoma (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), is a heterogeneous malignant tumor that forms cartilaginous matrix and accounts for approximately 20% of primary bone tumors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). On the basis of histology, chondrosarcoma is classified as conventional or nonconventional, with clinical characteristics varying by subtype (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>). Primary conventional chondrosarcoma represents 85% to 95% of all chondrosarcoma cases and typically develops in the pelvis, femur, humerus, or ribs; less common sites include the mobile spine and craniofacial bones (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>). Nonconventional chondrosarcoma is rare and includes clear cell, mesenchymal, and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>). Mesenchymal and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma are considered high grade and have a poor prognosis due to more aggressive growth and a higher risk of metastases than conventional chondrosarcoma; in contrast, clear cell chondrosarcoma is considered low grade (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref>).</p>
              <p>In patients with conventional chondrosarcoma, complete surgical resection is the recommended management approach, although radiation therapy is used for select situations. However, treatment options for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease are greatly limited given that these tumors tend to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation and that no standard targeted systemic therapies are available (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5, 6</xref>). Prognosis in these patients is poor, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 2.0 months with no systemic treatment (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Chemotherapy has not greatly improved PFS rates, with studies reporting a median PFS of 2.5 months with doxorubicin and 3.6 months with doxorubicin in combination with cisplatin or ifosfamide (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although several agents have been evaluated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma, outcomes have not changed substantially in 30 years, highlighting the need for novel and effective therapies.</p>
              <p>Death receptor 5 (DR5), a proapoptotic receptor that forms multimers on the cell surface and is activated after binding TRAIL, has long been a target of interest in oncology due to the differential sensitivity of cancerous over healthy cells to TRAIL-mediated killing (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>). The binding of trimeric TRAIL to three death receptors leads to clustering of DR5 and recruitment of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC; refs. <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 11</xref>). Within the DISC, procaspases-8 and procaspases-10 are autocatalytically cleaved, leading to activation of downstream effector caspase-3 and caspase-7, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref>). Although the trimer is the minimal functional unit for TRAIL activity, clustering of multiple receptor trimers at the cell–cell interface results in maximal apoptotic activity (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref>).</p>
              <p>INBRX-109 is a third-generation, recombinant, humanized, agonistic antibody against DR5 that has been precisely engineered for optimal DR5 agonism and safety. INBRX-109 is based on a single-domain antibody (sdAb) platform and was designed to simultaneously engage four DR5 molecules and induce robust apoptotic signaling. Importantly, the tetravalent format of INBRX-109 was selected as an optimal balance of DR5 agonism on tumor versus normal cells, enabling cancer-biased cell death while avoiding hyperclustering and concomitant hepatotoxicity observed with previous multivalent DR5 candidates (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; Genmab; cited October 14, 2022).

              <p>Early studies reported encouraging responses to DR5 agonists in patients with chondrosarcoma. In one case study, a patient achieved a sustained partial response and, eventually, a complete response (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); in a phase I study, a patient achieved a 20% reduction in measurable disease (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). On the basis of these early reports, we evaluated INBRX-109 in patients with chondrosarcoma as part of a phase I, first-in-human study in advanced solid tumors (NCT03715933; Supplementary Fig. S1). Here, we present the preclinical characterization of INBRX-109 as a DR5 agonist, followed by safety and efficacy findings in patients with unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma in the phase I study.</p>

                  <p>Blood samples were collected from all study patients to characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of and the potential for immunogenicity against INBRX-109. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated via noncompartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin version 8.3 (Certara, RRID:SCR_021370). Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software (NONMEM, Version 7.3; ICON, RRID:SCR_016986), a software package for nonlinear mixed-effects analysis, was used for population pharmacokinetic modeling.</p>
                  <p>The method to quantify INBRX-109 in human serum was validated for clinical sample analysis and used the format described here. Wells were first coated with recombinant DR5 as the antigen capture (Inhibrx). INBRX-109 in standards, quality controls, and samples are bound to the capture antigen and subsequently detected with a ruthenium-labeled, drug-specific anti-idiotype antibody (Inhibrx). The method used the Meso Scale Discovery Electrochemiluminescence platform (Meso Scale Diagnostics); assay signal from calibrators were plotted, and a curve fit was generated using a 4PL fit model with 1/Y2 weighting for quantification of INBRX-109 in samples.</p>
                  <p>ADAs were detected and characterized using validated methods that follow the traditional three-tiered testing scheme. The first method used a direct bind format in which INBRX-109 coated to wells of a 96-well microtiter assay plate was used to capture ADAs in serum samples; ADAs were subsequently revealed with a ruthenium-labeled anti-human immunoglobulin light chain antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1–34883; RRID:AB_10980148). Later in the study, a second method was validated. A bead-based sample pretreatment was used to purify ADAs from serum, which were then coated to wells of a multiarray high-bind plate (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Catalog no. L15XB) and directly detected using ruthenium-labeled INBRX-109. The sensitivity of anti-INBRX-109 antibody detection was increased approximately two-fold over the original method and was less than 10 ng/mL of ADA in serum.</p>

                  <title>Characterization of INBRX-109</title>
                  <p>INBRX-109 is a 105.7-kDa recombinant, humanized, third-generation DR5 agonist that is built on a camelid-derived sdAb platform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). INBRX-109 is composed of two identical sdAbs (heavy chain–only binding domains) joined end to end with an Fc domain based on human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) to create a molecule that homodimerizes into a tetravalent antibody targeting four DR5 receptors. To prevent the safety liability of excessive secondary clustering, the binding domains of INBRX-109 were humanized and specific modifications incorporated to eliminate recognition by preexisting ADAs. The Fc domain was engineered with a proprietary three amino acid deletion (Glu233, Leu234, and Leu235) near the hinge to prevent cross-linking and effector function through interaction with Fcγ receptors and complement, thereby constraining the activity of this molecule to that of a tetravalent agonist.</p>

                  <p>INBRX-109 bound its target, DR5, in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent affinity of approximately 0.11 nmol/L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and blocked binding of TRAIL to DR5 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.17 nmol/L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>); no signal—and no cross-reactivity with hamster DR5—was detected in untransfected ExpiCHO-S cells (negative control). Binding of INBRX-109 was specific to DR5, with no binding to DR4 or either of the decoy receptors observed (Supplementary Fig. S2). No significant difference in INBRX-109 binding to DR5 was observed when TRAIL was present in solution (Supplementary Fig. S3). The potential for Fc receptor–mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with INBRX-109 was assessed using the ADCC Reporter Bioassay (Promega), a surrogate for primary cell ADCC activity, where a Jurkat reporter cell line was cocultured with target cells expressing high levels of DR5. Reporter activation was not observed with INBRX-109, consistent with a disabled effector function and the inability to mediate ADCC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, and as expected, reporter activation was observed with daratumumab, an antibody targeting CD38, a marker expressed on the Jurkat reporter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>; Supplementary Fig. S4). Binding of the complement C1q protein, a surrogate for complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, was also absent for immobilized INBRX-109 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), confirming effector silencing.</p>

Activity of INBRX-109 was assessed in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. E, Tumor volume over time in animals harboring patient-derived chondrosarcoma tumors and treated with vehicle or INBRX-109 (1 mg/kg, i.v. once every week × 3 weeks starting on study day 0, as indicated by arrows).

                  <p>Multimerization of DR5 leads to the formation of the DISC, in which caspase-8 is activated, leading to the subsequent activation of the downstream executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10, 12, 19</xref>) and the coordinated destruction of the cell. Treatment of H-EMC-SS cells with INBRX-109 resulted in rapid activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). INBRX-109 induced substantially higher caspase activity than agents with lower valencies (i.e., TRAIL and a bivalent agonist), highlighting the impact of valency on executioner caspase activation. Consistent with our previous observations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>), the hexavalent comparator resulted in only a modest increase in caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation relative to that induced by INBRX-109 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The induction of caspase-3 and -7 and subsequent loss of cell viability could be inhibited by addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor, further indicating that the cytotoxicity induced by INBRX-109 was dependent on the activation of these executioner caspases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Antitumor activity was also demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in chondrosarcoma PDX models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In evaluating a wide range of doses (0.1–10 mg/kg weekly) in mouse tumor models, INBRX-109 at a dose of 1 mg/kg weekly was generally the most efficacious and led to sustained tumor inhibition in two chondrosarcoma PDX models, with near-complete tumor regressions observed in one model.</p>

                  <title>Hepatotoxicity analyses</title>
                  <p>In Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, INBRX-109 was well tolerated and the no-observed-adverse-effect levels were the highest doses tested (100 mg/kg weekly and 50 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Previous generations of DR5-targeted therapeutic antibodies, such as TAS266, have exhibited dose-limiting hepatotoxicity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the case of TAS266, an sdAb-based tetravalent DR5 agonist, retrospective experiments revealed that hepatotoxicity correlated with the presence of preexisting ADAs to TAS266. A bivalent IgG ADA capable of recognizing TAS266 could bind two molecules, which would increase the functional valency of TAS266 from 4 to 8, leading to hyperclustering of DR5 and a greater potential for hepatotoxicity (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). INBRX-109 was engineered with proprietary modifications to remove preexisting ADA recognition sites and incorporates an Fc domain so that the C-terminal sdAb is not exposed. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these modifications, we evaluated the impact of clinical grade immunoglobulin (IVIG)—which is known to contain anti-sdAb ADAs—on the hepatotoxicity profile of INBRX-109 in HepaRG cells, an immortalized hepatic progenitor cell line that recapitulates hepatic cell biology and toxicity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>. By both CellTiter-Glo endpoint analysis of cell viability (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and Incucyte real-time imaging of caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation (Supplementary Fig. S5A), the TAS266 analogue and INBRX-109 induced similarly low rates of HepaRG cell apoptosis in the absence of IVIG. The activity of INBRX-109 remained unchanged with the addition of IVIG. In contrast, the TAS266 analogue cross-linked by ADAs reduced the viability of HepaRG cells to approximately 30% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The ADA-mediated hepatotoxicity of the TAS266 analogue could be attenuated by engineering the molecule to include modifications from INBRX-109 that eliminate those ADA recognition sites (TAS266 mut), formally demonstrating that higher-order clustering, and not tetravalent valency, is responsible for TAS266 hepatotoxicity.</p>

                  <p>INBRX-109 was also evaluated in a more physiologically relevant 3D liver spheroid model (3D InSight Human Liver Microtissues, InSphero) composed of primary human hepatocytes pooled from 10 donors cocultured with nonparenchymal liver cells (i.e., mostly Kupffer cells and liver endothelial cells). A hexavalent variant of INBRX-109 was included to determine the impact of higher-order valency on hepatotoxicity. Treatment with up to 10 nmol/L of INBRX-109 resulted in no cell death as determined by total cellular ATP (7-day treatment; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, treatment with the hexavalent molecule [up to 1 nmol/L (IC<sub>50</sub>, 41.3 pmol/L)] led to dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. At 10 nmol/L, the highest concentration tested, the hexavalent molecule had substantial but reduced hepatotoxicity, suggesting that at high concentrations, not all DR5 binding domains in the hexavalent molecule engage receptors, which results in a lower functional valency. Similar findings were observed when cell death was determined by lactate dehydrogenase release (Supplementary Fig. S5B).</p>
                  <p>The immunogenicity of INBRX-109 was also assessed in an ELISA-based ADA assay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).

                  <title>Patients</title>
                  <p>A total of 149 patients with advanced solid tumors were included. In part 1 (Supplementary Fig. S1), patients received INBRX-109 at five escalating dose levels ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg. Common tumor types were mesothelioma, chondrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and adenocarcinomas. Patients had received a median of 5.5 lines (range, 1–15 lines) of previous systemic therapies. INBRX-109 was well tolerated, and a maximum tolerated dose was not reached; 3 mg/kg was selected as the recommended phase II dose. Based on preclinical activity and clinical efficacy observed in part 1, eight cohorts were opened in part 2 of the study (single-agent expansion), including two cohorts of patients with chondrosarcoma; cohort B4 consisted of patients with any subtype of chondrosarcoma (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 23), and cohort B6 included patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>-mutant conventional chondrosarcoma (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12). Part 3 (combination therapy expansion) is ongoing.</p>
                  <p>Overall, 33 patients with chondrosarcoma (84.8% conventional) were included in this analysis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); patients were largely representative of the overall chondrosarcoma patient population (Supplementary Table S2). Most patients were male (78.8%). Among the 11 patients with a known <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic> mutation status, 10 (90.9%) carried <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic> mutations. Median age was 59 years (range, 21–86 years); patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>-mutant chondrosarcoma were younger (median age, 54 years) than those in the general chondrosarcoma cohort (median age, 63 years). Most patients had grade 2 chondrosarcoma (64.3%) and metastatic disease (87.9%). Almost all patients (97.0%) had undergone surgical treatment; 36.4% had received radiotherapy. Patients had received a median of one prior line of systemic therapy (range, 0–12 lines), with the most common prior systemic therapies being chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and molecularly targeted therapies. As expected, patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>-mutant chondrosarcoma were more likely to have received immunotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy. Approximately one-quarter of patients (24.2%) had received no prior systemic therapy. As of the data cutoff (May 26, 2022), 9 of 33 patients with chondrosarcoma continued to receive study treatment.</p>

                  <p>Following intravenous infusion, peak INBRX-109 concentrations (<italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>max</sub>), which increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner across the single-agent dose-escalation dose range of 0.3 to 30 mg/kg, were observed at or near the end of the infusion (Supplementary Fig. S6). The mean terminal elimination half-life after the first dose ranged from ≈2 to 8 days (Supplementary Table S3). Early unaudited pharmacokinetic data from single-agent dose-expansion and combination cohorts showed no significant difference in INBRX-109 pharmacokinetics in patients with different tumor types or in combination with various anticancer agents. The expansion dose of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks was selected based on clinical efficacy and safety data as well as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of nonclinical and clinical data.</p>
                  <p>Preliminary immunogenicity assessments indicated that treatment-emergent ADAs against INBRX-109 were present in at least half of study patients; however, most samples were of low titer, and no significant impact on INBRX-109 pharmacokinetics was observed in any ADA-positive patient.</p>

                  <p>Treatment-related AEs occurred in 46.3% of all enrolled patients and were predominantly grade 1 or 2; 12.1% of patients had an AE of grade ≥3 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The most common (in &gt;5% of patients) treatment-related AEs were fatigue (18.8%; grade ≥3, 1.3%), increased alanine aminotransferase (10.7%; 4.0%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (8.7%; 2.7%), nausea (8.7%; 0.7%), and diarrhea (6.0%; 2.0%).</p>

                  <p>Among patients with chondrosarcoma, 20.0% had ≥1 treatment-related AE; 5.7% of AEs were grade ≥3 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The most common (in &gt;5% of patients) treatment-related AEs in patients with chondrosarcoma were increased alanine aminotransferase (11.4%; grade ≥3, 0%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (8.6%; 0%), increased blood bilirubin (5.7%; 2.9%), and fatigue (5.7%; 0%). Among patients with frequent treatment-related AEs, no grade 4 or 5 events were reported.</p>
                  <p>Given the potential for hepatotoxicity, liver-related AEs associated with INBRX-109 treatment were also assessed. Most patients (93.3%) had no or low-grade liver-related AEs associated with INBRX-109 treatment; grade ≥3 events were reported in 10 patients (6.7%). Similarly, liver-related AEs in patients with chondrosarcoma were mostly low grade; grade ≥3 events were reported in 2 patients. Two deaths occurred due to hepatic failure and were temporally associated with INBRX-109 treatment; 1 patient had mesothelioma, and 1 had <italic toggle="yes">IDH2</italic>-mutant chondrosarcoma. At the time of INBRX-109 initiation, the patient with mesothelioma was taking high doses of acetaminophen and antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections, urosepsis, and pneumonia. The patient died 2 weeks after study start. The patient with chondrosarcoma experienced a significant increase in liver function tests 7 days after the first dose of INBRX-109. The patient was treated with steroids and plasmapheresis but experienced liver failure and died. It was later discovered that this patient had been self-medicating with high doses of fenbendazole, a veterinary antihelminthic that has been linked to hepatic dysfunction (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>); the patient had received no prior systemic therapies.</p>

Although it is rare for chondrosarcoma tumors to shrink with currently available therapy, 2 patients (both with conventional chondrosarcoma) achieved PR (objective response rate, 6.5%). The observed clinical benefit was durable: 11 of 27 patients who achieved disease control had a clinical benefit lasting ≥180 days; the longest duration of SD was 17.8 months. Of the 25 patients who experienced SD, 14 (56.0%; 13/14 with conventional chondrosarcoma) had decreases from baseline in tumor size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

The first patient, a 29-year-old man, experienced a 61% decrease in target lesions after starting treatment with INBRX-109; the response was durable, and he continued to receive study treatment for 45 weeks. The second patient, a 57-year-old woman, experienced a 32% decrease in target lesions after seven treatment cycles.</p>
                  <p>Representative CT scans of a patient who achieved SD are presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>. This patient was a 55-year-old man with grade 3, metastatic, conventional chondrosarcoma who had received four prior lines of therapy, including pazopanib, nivolumab, and pazopanib plus nivolumab. The patient had a 20% decrease in target lesions after initiating INBRX-109; disease control was maintained for 17.8 months (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Median PFS among patients with chondrosarcoma (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 33) was 7.6 months (range, 0.03–17.8 months; median follow-up, 11.6 months; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). The 3- and 6-month PFS rates were 82% and 58%, respectively. Median PFS was not reached in the cohort of patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic>-mutant conventional chondrosarcoma.</p>
                  <p>To further examine its antitumor activity, we determined the growth-modulating effect of INBRX-109 in chondrosarcoma. Growth modulation can be measured by calculating the GMI, or von Hoff ratio (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), which is defined as the ratio of the time to progression (TTP) with a new treatment versus TTP with the prior line; the patient serves as their own control (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In our study, TTP with the last therapy was not available. To circumvent this, we used a modified analysis that determined the ratio of TTP with INBRX-109 versus prior treatment duration (modified GMI). Among 23 evaluable patients, the median modified GMI was 1.07 (range, 0.03–9.87; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Overall, 54.5% of patients had a modified GMI of &gt;1, 36.3% had a modified GMI of &gt;1.33 (i.e., 33% improvement), and 31.8% had a modified GMI of &gt;1.5 (i.e., 50% improvement), further indicating that INBRX-109 has antitumor activity in chondrosarcoma.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Drug development for rare diseases is challenging. INBRX-109, a precisely engineered, tetravalent, DR5 agonist, has been designed to overcome the limitations of earlier-generation agonists that lacked efficacy or ceased development due to hepatoxicity. This study demonstrated that INBRX-109 had encouraging antitumor activity in chondrosarcoma and a manageable safety profile, suggesting that DR5 is a valid target in the treatment of this tumor.</p>
              <p>DR5 has long been of interest in oncology due to its ability to induce programmed cell death through the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in a cancer-biased manner (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 9</xref>). The first DR5 agonist to enter the clinic, dulanermin (recombinant TRAIL), showed some promising clinical activity in chondrosarcoma; however, rapid clearance and decoy receptor binding limited its activity (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9, 17, 22–24</xref>). Several bivalent antibodies targeting DR5 were also developed on the basis of promising <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> preclinical data (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25–28</xref>). Unfortunately, the clinical activity for bivalent antibodies was underwhelming, likely due to requiring Fc receptor engagement for DR5 clustering and activity (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29, 30</xref>). To circumvent this requirement, a second-generation DR5 agonist, TAS266, was developed using camelid-derived sdAbs to create a tetravalent molecule designed to more efficiently cluster DR5 in the absence of Fc receptor engagement (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, preexisting ADAs toward this molecule led to additional higher-order DR5 clustering that was presumably responsible for the observed hepatotoxicity that led to the cessation of a phase I trial (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p>
              <p>INBRX-109 also has a tetravalent configuration and induces DR5-mediated apoptosis without the need for additional cross-linking. In preclinical studies, DR5 receptor clustering by INBRX-109 induced death in H-EMC-SS cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). This chondrosarcoma-like line has high DR5 expression, making it well suited for characterizing the activity of INBRX-109, and was previously used to evaluate an anti-DR5 pentameric IgM antibody that is currently in clinical development (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>With the activity of INBRX-109 as a DR5 agonist established <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, we examined its activity in PDX mouse models of various cancers, including chondrosarcoma. The encouraging results that we observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), along with prior studies that suggested that targeting DR5 in this tumor type could be beneficial (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>), motivated our clinical evaluation of INBRX-109. In patients with metastatic or locally advanced chondrosarcoma, INBRX-109 demonstrated antitumor activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and, unlike TAS266, minimal hepatotoxicity both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and in the clinical setting (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Although both tetravalent and hexavalent anti-DR5 antibodies show superior cytotoxic activity to bivalent antibodies and trimeric TRAIL in the absence of Fc receptor binding, increasing valency carries with it an increased risk of activity on normal healthy tissue, as was seen with HexaBody-DR5/DR5 (GEN1029), a mixture of two DR5-specific antibodies with a hexamerization-enhancing Fc mutation [ref. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>; Genmab. (cited August 8, 2022). Available from: <ext-link xlink:href="https://ir.genmab.com/static-files/60467b61-f6ed-4196-ae15-455d57d9f919" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ir.genmab.com/static-files/60467b61-f6ed-4196-ae15–455d57d9f919</ext-link>.]. In August 2019, the FDA issued a partial clinical hold on a phase I/II study of HexaBody DR5/DR5 (NCT03576131) due to liver toxicity. The clinical hold was lifted in October 2019; however, development of the drug was later stopped due to what the sponsor considered to be a narrow therapeutic index [Genmab. (cited August 8, 2022). Available from: <ext-link xlink:href="https://ir.genmab.com/static-files/be692ea1-1ee7-44d3-ab20-f0dda61ea843" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new">https://ir.genmab.com/static-files/be692ea1–1ee7–44d3-ab20-f0dda61ea843</ext-link>]. In our study, the hexavalent comparator showed robust cross-linking–independent hepatocyte cytotoxicity <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, INBRX-109 demonstrated little induction of the DR5-mediated apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes, suggesting that a tetravalent molecule may have achieved an optimal combination of activity and safety.</p>
              <p>In this phase I study, INBRX-109 was well tolerated and demonstrated a manageable safety profile in patients with chondrosarcoma. Most treatment-related AEs in patients with chondrosarcoma or in those with other tumors were low grade. Among those with chondrosarcoma who experienced frequently reported AEs, only 1 patient had a grade 3 event (increased blood bilirubin). Similarly, liver-related AEs were mainly grade 1 or 2, indicating that the INBRX-109 design minimizes hepatotoxicity, unlike earlier DR5 agonists. Two deaths occurred, both due to hepatic failure. Both patients had several comorbidities and/or were taking concomitant medications, including fenbendazole, a prohibited treatment linked to hepatotoxicity (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, the deaths were considered as possibly related to INBRX-109 treatment by the investigators. To better understand any treatment-related effects on liver function, hepatotoxicity will continue to be closely monitored in future studies of INBRX-109.</p>
              <p>INBRX-109 demonstrated single-agent activity in chondrosarcoma—including in the traditionally chemotherapy-resistant conventional chondrosarcoma subtype—with a DCR of 87.1%; 2 patients achieved a PR (6.5%; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Although a direct comparison is not possible, this rate was much higher than the DCR of 31.3% observed in patients treated with placebo (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 16) in a randomized phase II study in advanced chondrosarcoma (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These suggest that the observed DCR in our study was due to the activity of INBRX-109 and not the indolent nature of the disease. Similar to our study, in the phase II study most patients had conventional chondrosarcoma; only 2 patients in the placebo arm had nonconventional subtypes (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>As expected in sarcomas (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34, 35</xref>), few objective responses by RECIST criteria were observed. However, 25 of 31 patients (80.6%) achieved SD, regardless of <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic> mutation status, with many of these patients having decreases in tumor size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Disease control was durable for &gt;6 months in 11 of 27 patients (40.7%). We acknowledge that, due to the indolent nature of chondrosarcoma, the use of RECIST criteria may lead to an overinterpretation of the DCR for this tumor indication. In the study by Duffaud and colleagues (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), 5 of 16 patients (31.3%) in the placebo arm had tumor shrinkage. However, in our study, tumor shrinkage was observed in 16 of 30 evaluable patients (53.3%; 56% of patients with SD; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These data suggest activity of INBRX-109 in chondrosarcoma.</p>
              <p>These findings with INBRX-109 are notable given the lack of effective therapies in this setting and the lower DCR seen with targeted single-agent therapies in recent studies. A phase I study of ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) in patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>-mutant advanced solid tumors reported a DCR of 40% (no complete response or PR) in 21 patients with advanced chondrosarcoma (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Ivosidenib is considered a systemic treatment option for patients with <italic toggle="yes">IDH1</italic>-mutant chondrosarcoma despite no objective response observed in the phase I study (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), highlighting the importance of SD in this setting and the need for more effective treatment options. Similarly, a phase II study of pazopanib in patients with unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 47) reported a DCR of 42% at week 16, with 1 patient achieving a PR (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>); olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, led to a DCR of 40% in 5 patients with chondrosarcoma in a phase II, open-label study in patients with metastatic solid tumors (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>Given the limitations with RECIST criteria, other measures of activity, such as nonprogression and tumor growth delay, have been explored and are widely considered to be appropriate indicators of activity in sarcomas (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39, 40</xref>). In our study, nonprogression was determined by PFS, which has been suggested as a measure of success for targeted therapies in sarcomas (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21, 34, 35, 41</xref>). Patients treated with INBRX-109 had a median PFS of 7.6 months, which was substantially longer than what has been observed with chemotherapy (usually &lt;4 months; ref. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and other recently evaluated targeted therapies, including ivosidenib (5.6 months) (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib (≈5 months; ref. <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Median PFS in patients treated with pazopanib was similar (7.9 months; ref. <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
              <p>The GMI, which measures tumor growth delay, has also been considered by some to be a way of determining success in studies of sarcomas (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In a study evaluating concordance between the GMI and efficacy outcomes in advanced sarcomas, a higher GMI correlated with better outcomes, including survival (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). A GMI of &gt;1 was considered a sign of activity, and a GMI of &gt;1.33 (i.e., 33% improvement) was considered a more conservative threshold (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In our study, 36.3% and 31.8% of patients had modified GMIs of &gt;1.33 and &gt;1.5, respectively, suggesting that INBRX-109 has an antitumor effect and can delay tumor growth in patients with chondrosarcoma. However, our modified analysis used the time receiving prior line of treatment rather than TTP, which could make interpretation of the results difficult given the potential confounders. For example, physicians may change a patient's treatment before progression if they believe a new treatment regimen will lead to greater clinical benefits or tolerability. Overall, INBRX-109 not only demonstrated clinical activity by RECIST criteria (objective response and tumor shrinkage) but also by nonprogression and tumor growth delay, which are two additional measures considered to be appropriate indicators of activity in sarcomas (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39, 40</xref>).</p>
              <p>Together with previous findings, our data suggest that DR5 is a valid target in the treatment of chondrosarcoma. Although the mechanisms driving tumor response to INBRX-109 are not known, enhanced sensitivity of chondrosarcoma to DR5 agonism could play a role. It is not uncommon for tumors to develop resistance to DR5 agonism due to prior exposure to TRAIL expressed on infiltrating immune cells (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, immune cell infiltration into conventional chondrosarcoma is poor (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43–45</xref>), making chondrosarcoma less likely to develop resistance to DR5 agonism; this provides support for the use of DR5 agonists in this tumor type. Another possible mechanism involves the activity of DR5 agonism on tumor-associated, suppressive immune cell populations. Immune infiltrates in chondrosarcoma are largely composed of immunosuppressive macrophages (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44, 45</xref>), which have been shown to express functional DR5 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In a study of patients with advanced cancers (NCT02076451), the DR5 agonist DS8273a reduced the tumor-associated, myeloid-derived suppressor cell population (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), suggesting that INBRX-109 could be acting on this suppressive immune cell population in chondrosarcoma. Given that tumor DR5 expression could not be assessed in patients at baseline, additional studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of action of INBRX-109 in chondrosarcoma and the link between DR5 levels on tumor and/or tumor-infiltrating immune cells and response to INBRX-109. To further evaluate INBRX-109 and address these open questions, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of INBRX-109 in unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma (ChonDRAgon; NCT04950075) is currently enrolling in the United States and Europe. In addition, the phase I study (NCT03715933) is now exploring clinical activity of INBRX-109 in patients with nonconventional chondrosarcoma. This cohort is still enrolling, and findings will be reported in a separate manuscript.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, INBRX-109 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and led to a high DCR of 87.1% in patients with metastatic or advanced chondrosarcoma; 2 patients achieved PR, and approximately half of the patients achieved tumor shrinkage. Importantly, median PFS with INBRX-109 was 7.6 months, which is a substantial improvement over results with currently available therapies. However, given the indolent nature of the disease, randomized controlled studies, like the ongoing ChonDRAgon study, are needed to validate these early findings. Overall, our study suggests that DR5 is a valid target in chondrosarcoma and indicates that INBRX-109 has antitumor activity in unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma, regardless of <italic toggle="yes">IDH1/IDH2</italic> mutation status. Importantly, findings from this study fill a highly unmet need in a rare disease and provide support for continued evaluation of INBRX-109 in unresectable or metastatic chondrosarcoma.</p>
