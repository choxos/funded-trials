                <p id="P2">The Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention targeted multiple factors critical to the health and well-being of toddlers living in poverty. This randomized controlled trial, which was embedded within Early Head Start home visits for 12 weeks, included 242 racially and ethnically diverse families (51% girls; toddler mean age = 2.58 years; data collected 2016–2019). Compared to parents in usual practice home visits, parents in Recipe 4 Success displayed greater sensitive scaffolding of toddlers’ learning and more responsive food parenting practices (Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .21–.30). Toddlers in Recipe 4 Success exhibited greater self-regulation and had healthier eating habits (Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = |.16–.35|).

          <body>
            <p id="P3">One of the most insidious aspects of growing up in poverty is that it tends to undermine those factors most predictive of health and well-being across the lifespan (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Chaudry &amp; Wimer, 2016</xref>). For example, growing up in poverty affects early brain development, which is related to academic achievement and, eventually, socioeconomic status (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hair et al., 2015</xref>). Because children living in poverty are more likely to be from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, the effects of poverty and the effects of structural racism on health and well-being are often compounded (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Iruka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Shonkoff et al., 2021</xref>). While we work toward redressing systemic inequities, it is critical to simultaneously do everything possible to help support children growing up in poverty, so they receive the care they need and develop the skills required to navigate the challenges they face.</p>
            <p id="P4">This study tested the efficacy of the Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention, which was designed to enhance the benefits of Early Head Start, an evidence-based home visits program which is implemented across the United States and intended to help families living in poverty nurture the social-emotional and physical health of their infants and toddlers (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Love et al., 2005</xref>). Recipe 4 Success sought to capitalize on the inter-related and mutually reinforcing ways in which parents could engage in greater sensitive scaffolding and more responsive food parenting practices as a means of promoting toddlers’ self-regulation and healthy eating habits.</p>

              <title>Parents’ sensitive scaffolding</title>
              <p id="P5">Parents’ sensitive scaffolding involves understanding the developmental tasks individual children are attempting to master and structuring interactions to facilitate success with maximum autonomy (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Pendergrast &amp; MacPhee, 2018</xref>). Sensitive scaffolding depends on parents’ knowledge of children’s skills and a moment-by-moment assessment of their progress, level of engagement, and the likelihood of imminent frustration. As parents attend to those factors, they often use language to direct attention and orchestrate problem solving, so children are able to remain in an ever-shifting zone of proximal development. Parents’ sensitive scaffolding appears critically important to the development of multiple aspects of children’s self-regulation, including executive functions, emotion regulation skills, and behavioral control (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Hughes &amp; Ensor, 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P6">Living in poverty and experiencing other sources of stress can make it more challenging for parents to provide sensitive scaffolding and exhibit high levels of responsiveness (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Magnuson &amp; Duncan, 2019</xref>). Compared to parents from middle- and upper income families, parents in living in poverty often speak to their children less and ask fewer questions to guide their learning (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Schwab &amp; Lew-Williams, 2016</xref>). This can affect the development of children’s language skills, a robust predictor of growth in self-regulation (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Vallotton &amp; Ayoub, 2011</xref>). Relatedly, parents living in poverty tend to use more prohibitions with their children and provide fewer affirmations (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hart &amp; Risley, 1995</xref>), which can be detrimental to children’s sense of autonomy and self-regulation.</p>

              <title>Responsive food parenting practices</title>
              <p id="P7">Responsive food parenting practices are a domain-specific form of sensitive scaffolding. Food parenting practices represent the strategies parents use to introduce new foods and to encourage their toddlers and young children to eat what is good for them. Ideally, parents create a food environment in which toddlers can be granted maximum autonomy in choosing what to eat among healthy options (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sano et al., 2019</xref>). The ways parents interact with toddlers and young children can either support or negatively impact self-regulation around food (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Balantekin et al., 2020</xref>). When parents establish consistent routines and involve children in the preparation of meals and snacks, children are more likely to develop healthy eating habits (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Knai et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, when parents are coercive and controlling around food, children may become less reliant on their own feelings of hunger and satiety, leading to dysregulated eating and excessive weight gain (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Vollmer &amp; Mobley, 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P8">As with sensitive scaffolding, living in poverty makes it more challenging for parents to enact responsive food parenting practices as a means of promoting toddlers’ healthy eating habits (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Sano et al., 2019</xref>). When faced with food insecurity, parents may be most focused on simply ensuring their children eat and are not hungry (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Arlinghaus &amp; Laska, 2021</xref>).</p>

              <title>Toddlers’ self-regulation</title>
              <p id="P9">Self-regulation allows us to control responses and actions in ways that are adaptive and help achieve long-term goals (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Blair &amp; Ku, 2022</xref>). Self-regulation occurs at both psychological and physiological levels and includes the distinct but related abilities to direct and sustain attention, inhibit impulses, plan and sequence actions, and adhere to healthy eating routines. Self-regulation grows rapidly around age 2 (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Calkins, 2007</xref>), enabled in part by the development of the prefrontal cortex (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Hodel, 2018</xref>). Greater self-regulation in early childhood predicts competence in multiple domains of functioning in adolescence, including executive functions, academic achievement, stress management, and social-emotional skills (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Robson et al., 2020</xref>). Greater self-regulation in early childhood is also associated with multiple dimensions of success in adulthood, including better physical health, less substance abuse, higher levels of education, greater income, and fewer arrests (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to being related to cognitive and social-emotional functioning, there is some—albeit, not always consistent—evidence that self-regulation is related to body mass index (BMI) and obesity (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Robson et al., 2020</xref>). For example, children who had difficulties with one aspect of self-regulation, effortful control, at age 3 had a higher BMI through age 12 (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Francis &amp; Susman, 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P10">Unfortunately, living in poverty puts children at risk for lower levels of psychological and physiological self-regulation. The chronic stress associated with living in poverty appears to affect development in regions of the brain most critical to self-regulation (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Palacios-Barrios &amp; Hanson, 2019</xref>). For young children, much of the relation between chronic stress and lower levels of self-regulation appears to be mediated by less positive parent–child interactions (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). However, that relation also can be moderated by high levels of parents’ sensitivity and warmth (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Blair &amp; Ku, 2022</xref>).</p>

              <p id="P11">Just as responsive food parenting practices are a domain-specific form of parents’ sensitive scaffolding, healthy eating habits, which involve modulating prepotent preferences for energy-dense foods in favor of nutrient-dense foods, represent one aspect of self-regulation. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, toddlers’ diets should consist of small portions of a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and sources of protein (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/HALF-Implementation-Guide/Age-Specific-Content/Pages/Toddler-Food-and-Feeding.aspx" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.aap.org/en-us/advocacy-and-policy/aap-health-initiatives/HALF-Implementation-Guide/Age-Specific-Content/Pages/Toddler-Food-and-Feeding.aspx</ext-link>). Parents are advised to limit the availability of foods and drinks that are overly processed or high in salt or sugar, such as hot dogs, chips, desserts, and soda. Like other aspects of self-regulation, deliberate self-regulation around eating appears to emerge around age 2, when taste preferences are being formed (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Birch &amp; Ventura, 2009</xref>). Children who develop healthy eating habits during this period are likely to grow into adults with healthy eating habits (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Craigie et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P12">However, due to multiple structural and environmental impediments, toddlers living in poverty are often less likely to develop healthy eating habits. For example, food deserts are more prevalent in communities with lower average incomes, especially when those communities also have a high proportion of residents of color (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Karpyn et al., 2019</xref>). In food deserts, the most accessible and least expensive foods, such as those available at fast food restaurants or convenience stores, tend to be high in calories but low in essential nutrients (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fleishhacker et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

              <title>An integrated approach to intervention: Recipe 4 Success</title>
              <p id="P13">The toddler period represents an ideal time in which to intentionally support and promote the development of both self-regulation and healthy eating habits. Although systematic reviews have identified relatively few preventive interventions that reliably change toddlers’ self-regulation or healthy eating habits (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Morawska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2015</xref>), those interventions that are effective often focus on parents’ behaviors related to sensitive scaffolding and/or responsive food parenting practices. For example, in the Playing and Learning Strategies intervention, parents learn to read children’s signals, respond contingently, provide choices, build and maintain children’s attention, and use rich language (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Landry et al., 2008</xref>). In an adapted version of Active Parenting, implemented as home visits with Native American families, parents who established mealtime and active play routines, guided positive choices, and modeled desired eating behaviors were successful in reversing children’s unhealthy weight gain (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Harvey-Berino &amp; Rourke, 2003</xref>). In Family Check-Up, parents who were given extensive feedback about their families and had the opportunity to receive additional parenting and family management support from family consultants demonstrated more positive interactions with their toddlers, who, in turn, had decreased behavior problems over time (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Dishion et al., 2008</xref>). In Parent-Corps, parents who participated in a school readiness program designed to support family engagement and child social-emotional learning were better able to use evidence-based strategies to create safe, nurturing, and predictable home environments, leading their children to have greater academic achievement and better mental health over time (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Brotman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Dawson-McClure et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, although neither Family Check-Up nor ParentCorps focused on healthy eating habits, both preventive interventions had a delayed impact on children’s overweight and obesity (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Brotman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P14">The Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention was the result of a community-based participatory research collaboration involving university researchers and Early Head Start directors, clinical supervisors, nutrition educators, and home visitors (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Nix, 2020</xref>). It sought to address the pressing need to develop and refine strategies to promote toddlers’ self-regulation and healthy eating habits by helping parents become proficient in sensitive scaffolding and responsive food parenting practices. Recipe 4 Success aimed to accomplish its goals by implementing within Early Head Start home visits an integrated curriculum that relied on active coaching strategies during parent and toddler cooking and food preparation activities. In a small randomized controlled trial (<italic toggle="yes">N</italic> = 73), Recipe 4 Success produced statistically significant improvements in four target outcomes most likely to be affected by living in poverty and most likely to shift developmental trajectories toward more optimal adjustment: parents’ sensitive scaffolding, Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .58; responsive food parenting practices, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .87; toddlers’ self-regulation, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .95; and healthy eating habits, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .57 (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nix et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

              <title>The present study</title>
              <p id="P15">The present study reports the results of the second randomized controlled trial of Recipe 4 Success. Compared to the first trial, this trial included more families from more Early Head Start centers in both more rural and more urban communities, and it featured a more refined version of the curriculum. Because this trial attempts to replicate the positive findings from our first trial and was preregistered, this study should be viewed as more confirmatory on the continuum from exploratory investigations to confirmatory hypothesis testing. We hypothesized that, compared to parents in usual practice Early Head Start home visits, parents randomized to participate in Recipe 4 Success would exhibit more sensitive scaffolding and responsive food parenting practices. Likewise, we hypothesized that, compared to toddlers in usual practice Early Head Start home visits, toddlers in Recipe 4 Success would display greater self-regulation and have healthier eating habits.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="P17">This study included 242 parents and their toddlers. Thirty-seven percent of families were White, 25% were Black, 19% were Latinx, 17% were multiracial, 2% were Asian American, and less than 1% were Native American. Ninety-one percent of caregivers were mothers, 5% were fathers, and 4% were other relatives, all of whom are referred to as “parents” hereafter. Forty-seven percent of parents were single and did not live with a partner. Sixty-five percent had a high school degree or less; 60% did not work outside the home; 20% had a part-time job; and 20% had a full-time job. Sixty-nine percent of families lived below the federal poverty threshold, and an additional 25% of families lived below 200% of that threshold; the median family income was $1555 per month, and the median income-to-needs ratio was 0.75.</p>
                <p id="P18">Among the toddlers in this study, 51% were girls, and 49% were boys. At the beginning of this study, they were age 2.58 years on average (SD = 0.31; range = 1.72–3.29).</p>

                <title>Recruitment and random assignment</title>
                <p id="P19">Families were recruited through organizations providing Early Head Start home visit services in seven cities, towns, and rural areas across Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. To be eligible for the study, families had to be able to complete assessments in English and have a toddler, age 2. (Note: There were some misunderstandings about trial guidelines regarding toddler age, causing some toddlers to fall outside the intended range.) Families’ Early Head Start home visitors told them about the study. If parents wanted to learn more, project staff members provided details and obtained consent. About 65% of eligible families chose to participate in the study.</p>
                <p id="P20">Once families completed the baseline assessment, they were randomly assigned to receive the Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention, delivered by their regular Early Head Start home visitors during their regularly scheduled home visits, or continue to receive their usual practice Early Head Start home visits, which were structured around evidence-based curricula, such as Parents as Teachers (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2002</xref>), and focused on cognitive and social-emotional skills, motor development, physical health, and positive parent–child relationships. Families who participated in Recipe 4 Success did not receive extra home visits or extra-long home visits. Rather, the content of Recipe 4 Success comprised an alternative means of meeting all the performance standards of usual practice Early Head Start home visits during the toddler years.</p>
                <p id="P21">Families were assigned to condition on a 1:1 allocation, within the caseload of each home visitor, based on a coin toss conducted by the project manager. Across the recruitment period, 123 and 119 families were assigned to the intervention and control conditions, respectively.</p>

                <title>Intervention procedures</title>
                <p id="P22">Intended to be implemented in 12 consecutive weeks, the Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention consisted of carefully sequenced and highly structured food preparation lessons, which provided countless opportunities for parents to practice sensitive scaffolding and learn responsive food parenting practices and for toddlers to practice self-regulation—such as mixing carefully without spilling and waiting patiently for something to cook—and be exposed to new healthy foods. Each lesson required about 45 min of a regular 90-min home visit.</p>
                <p id="P23">To introduce the curriculum, the first two Recipe 4 Success lessons used wooden food toys to help parents learn and practice four core parenting skills, adapted from parent–child interaction therapy (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">McNeil &amp; Hembree-Kigin, 2010</xref>): describing toddlers’ behavior to maintain focus and concentration; reflecting and expanding on what toddlers said to demonstrate interest and promote language development; providing specific praise for persistence and effort; and giving meaningful concrete choices to foster investment and autonomy. Parents were told that cooking with toddlers was difficult, but these four core parenting skills would help their toddlers pay attention and enjoy the activity so they could be successful. Our goal was to help parents see how routine daily activities, like cooking, could become a way to spend high-quality special time with their toddlers.</p>
                <p id="P24">In the subsequent 10 Recipe 4 Success lessons, home visitors coached families through actual food preparation activities, following a standard lesson protocol:</p>

The recipes always included at least one fruit and/or vegetable and a source of protein. Recipes never required anything more than a microwave or freezer to prepare. At the beginning of the intervention, families received toddler chef hats and aprons, a microwave-safe bowl, and a set of measuring cups and spoons. Lessons were tailored as necessary to accommodate food allergies or limited cooking facilities.</p>
                <p id="P37">Before the start of the intervention, all home visitors completed a 2-day training conducted by study investigators. While implementing Recipe 4 Success, home visitors participated in a weekly 30-min group conference call with a study investigator to discuss the progress of lessons and address unexpected challenges. Home visitors also continued to receive ongoing supervision with their individual clinical supervisors.</p>
                <p id="P38">Intervention fidelity was assessed via digital audio recordings of entire home visits that included Recipe 4 Success Lessons 4, 7, and 10. These recordings were collected by the home visitors, but rated by a team of laboratory-based research assistants who completed extensive training, reviewed multiple practice recordings, used a written manual, and participated in weekly group supervision discussions. On average, home visitors implemented 9 of the 12 essential components of Recipe 4 Success, such as reviewed educational information on self-regulation, prompted parent to use each of the core parenting behaviors, and set up plan with parent to practice new skills. Extensive ratings of the quality of delivery demonstrated that almost all lessons were high in educational content, home visitor therapeutic skills, home visitor–parent working alliance, and parent and toddler engagement.</p>

                  <p id="P42">This study included three measures of parents’ sensitive scaffolding, all assessed during three 3-min structured interactions in which parents and toddlers worked together on unfamiliar tasks, including bowling with a stuffed ball and pins, building a 4-foot-high tower with different-sized blocks, and completing a shape sorter ball puzzle in which parents could not touch individual pieces. All interactions were video recorded and independently coded by at least two members of a team of lab-based research assistants, who were unaware of study condition. The research assistants completed extensive training, reviewed multiple practice videos, used a written manual, and participated in weekly group supervision discussions of ratings. After computing reliability, all ratings for each task were averaged across the research assistants, except in the cases of large 2- or 3-point discrepancies (depending on the number of response options within a scale), when the research assistants rewatched videos to achieve consensus. The ratings from each of the three tasks were then averaged for final scores.</p>
                  <p id="P43">The first measure of parents’ sensitive scaffolding assessed how often parents used the four core parenting skills hypothesized to promote toddlers’ self-regulation and sustained attention/persistence, namely describing their toddlers’ behavior, reflecting and expanding on what their toddlers said, providing specific praise, and giving concrete choices (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">McNeil &amp; Hembree-Kigin, 2010</xref>), with 0 = <italic toggle="yes">none</italic>, 1 = <italic toggle="yes">once</italic>, and 2 = <italic toggle="yes">twice or more</italic>, as parents rarely demonstrated each behavior more than twice in each task (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] for the four ratings on each of the three tasks = .72–.87; <italic toggle="yes">α</italic> [of those 12 total ratings] = .76).</p>

The first measure was the well-validated snack delay task (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Kochanska et al., 2000</xref>). The project interviewer placed a single M&amp;M on a plate and told the toddlers they could eat it, once time was up.

                  <title>Healthy eating habits</title>
                  <p id="P53">Finally, this study included three measures related to toddlers’ healthy eating habits. Two of these measures were derived from three 24-h recalls about what toddlers had done throughout the day, with one recall collected in person and two over the telephone (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nix et al., 2021</xref>). During the recalls, project interviewers guided parents through specific questions about what toddlers had eaten and drank for breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, and evening snack, with an additional opportunity for parents to identify foods not remembered initially. Project interviewers wrote down parents’ responses verbatim, and foods were later sorted into categories.</p>
                  <p id="P54">The first measure of healthy eating habits represented the percentage of days in which toddlers were involved in preparing one of their meals or snacks (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Knai et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="P55">The second measure was composed of three items: (1) the percentage of all meals and snacks across the 3 days that included a fruit, not counting juice; (2) the percentage of meals and snacks that included a vegetable, not counting French fries; and (3) the percentage of meals and snacks that included a substantial source of protein, such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy, or peanut butter (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nix et al., 2021</xref>). All percentages were standardized and averaged for a total score.</p>
                  <p id="P56">The final measure related to healthy eating habits was BMI. Project interviewers measured toddlers’ weight on a high-quality portable scale, and height as they stood against a wall. These measurements were then used to calculate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sex-specific BMI-for-age percentile scores. Unlike the other outcomes in this study in which, at least conceptually, all parents and toddlers could improve in the same way, the effects of healthy eating habits should be quite different for toddlers with underweight, normal weight, and overweight/obesity. But, because Recipe 4 Success was a primary preventive intervention, not a clinical trial in which toddlers were screened for overweight/obesity, it included many toddlers who would not benefit from a lower BMI. Thus, postintervention BMI-for-age percentile scores were only examined among the toddlers who were at risk and had overweight/obesity at baseline (i.e., at or above the 85th percentile; <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 103).</p>

                <title>Plan of analysis</title>
                <p id="P57">The plan of analysis for this trial followed what was described in the original grant application to the National Institutes of Health. For each outcome, a hierarchical linear model was estimated with a random intercept to account for the nesting of families within home visitors’ caseloads. For those outcomes in which clustered variance at the home visitor level was so negligible it could not be estimated, results are comparable to those from a regression equation. In each hierarchical linear model, the independent variables were the indicator of intervention condition, the baseline measure of the outcome, Early Head Start site, race and ethnicity, toddler age, toddler gender, parent marital status, parent education, and whether the parent was employed. To assess robustness, all hierarchical linear models were re-estimated with the independent variables comprising only intervention condition and the baseline measure of the outcome, which was the lone covariate consistently related to parent and toddler outcomes. All parent and toddler outcomes were standardized with <italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0 and SD = 1.00, so the <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> of the intervention effect was comparable to Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>, representing the difference in standard deviation units between families in Recipe 4 Success and usual practice Early Head Start home visits, controlling for model covariates (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Lorah, 2018</xref>).</p>

              <p id="P58">Among the 242 families in this study, 229 families (95% of the original sample) were retained at postintervention. Attrition did not vary by any known and measured factors, including intervention condition, Early Head Start site, race/ethnicity, toddler age, toddler gender, parent marital status, parent education, and whether the parent was employed.</p>
              <p id="P59">Baseline and postintervention means of all study outcomes for families in Recipe 4 Success and usual practice Early Head Start home visits are presented in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. At baseline, there were three statistically significant differences between intervention groups: Compared to parents randomized to usual practice Early Head Start home visits, parents randomized to Recipe 4 Success initially displayed more of the core parenting behaviors, higher levels of learning support, and greater technical scaffolding. There were no statistically significant differences between intervention groups on the two outcome measures related to responsive food parenting practices, the four outcome measures related to toddlers’ self-regulation, or the three outcome measures related to healthy eating habits.</p>

The pattern of results was quite similar when the hierarchical linear models included all covariates, as summarized below, or only the baseline measure of the outcome, as can be seen in those tables.</p>
                <p id="P62">Compared to parents who continued to receive usual practice Early Head Start home visits and controlling for baseline scores and family demographic characteristics, parents who participated in the Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention generalized the four core parenting behaviors hypothesized to support toddlers’ self-regulation and were more likely to apply them in the context of novel parent–child interaction tasks, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .30 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .021). As with Cohen’s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic>, this intervention effect indicates that parents in the two experimental conditions differed by three-tenths of a standard deviation, which would be considered a small-to-medium intervention effect size. Compared to control group parents, intervention parents also were more likely to provide their toddlers with higher levels of learning support as they mastered the new skills involved in those interaction tasks, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .26 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .031). Compared to control group parents, intervention parents displayed greater technical scaffolding of their children’s development in general, but this difference did not reach the conventional level of statistical significance for a two-tailed test, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β=</italic>.21, (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>=.098).</p>
                <p id="P63">In addition, Recipe 4 Success had a positive impact on responsive food parenting practices. Compared to control group parents, intervention parents were observed to engage in more responsive food parenting strategies that are associated with healthy eating habits and fewer coercive food parenting strategies associated with overweight/obesity, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .29 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .024). Overall, compared to control group parents, intervention parents were more sensitive in the way they interacted with their toddlers during the shared snack and more respectful of their toddlers’ autonomy, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .27 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .038).</p>
                <p id="P64">As hypothesized, participating in Recipe 4 Success had a positive impact on toddlers’ self-regulation. Compared to toddlers who continued to receive usual practice Early Head Start home visits, toddlers who participated in Recipe 4 Success with their families were better able to resist temptation in the presence of highly desirable food rewards, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .31 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .012); they displayed greater task orientation and attention, as observed by project interviewers, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .25 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .046); they exhibited greater behavioral control and were more compliant, as perceived by their parents, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = .20 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .040); and they had lower levels of dysregulation, in terms of negative emotionality and eating and sleeping problems, as perceived by their parents, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = −.16 (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .045).</p>
                <p id="P65">Participating in Recipe 4 Success also had a positive impact on healthy eating habits.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P66">The Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention targeted inter-related factors that are likely to be compromised by living in poverty and predict long-term health and well-being. This study found statistically significant postintervention between-group differences in aspects of parents’ sensitive scaffolding, responsive food parenting practices, toddlers’ self-regulation, and healthy eating habits. As such, this study informs our understanding of how to design and implement more effective two-generation preventive interventions to support families with toddlers and young children living in poverty.</p>
              <sec id="S21">
                <title>Recipe 4 Success intervention effects</title>
                <p id="P67">This randomized controlled trial of Recipe 4 Success found that parents were able to apply what they had learned in the context of cooking with toddlers to other tasks in which they helped their toddlers master a new skill. In particular, compared to control group parents, intervention parents exhibited higher levels of our core parenting behaviors (e.g., describing their toddlers’ behavior to maintain focus and concentration; reflecting and expanding on what their toddlers said or did to demonstrate interest and promote language development; providing specific praise for persistence and effort; and giving meaningful concrete choices to foster investment and autonomy). Compared to control group parents, intervention parents also exhibited higher levels of learning support, in general. Prior research demonstrates that sensitive parenting reduces the stress children experience, dampening activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and reducing allostatic load, including weight gain (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2003</xref>). Indeed, in families in which there are high levels of sensitive parenting, relations between cumulative environmental risk and children’s allostatic load are reduced substantially (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 2007</xref>). Such parenting in the early years of life is integral to a nurturing care framework intended to subvert the effects of racism on the development of child obesity (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Skouteris et al., 2020</xref>). The results of this trial suggest that providing parents with the right support at the right time may be one of the most effective means of promoting resilience among families living in poverty.</p>
                <p id="P68">Recipe 4 Success also altered food parenting practices: It not only increased the proportion of responsive and noncoercive strategies parents tried as they introduced their toddlers to novel healthy foods but also the sensitivity with which parents used those strategies. When parents provide nutritious options but respect children’s autonomy by letting them decide what to eat, children are more likely to maintain healthy relationships with food and are less likely to gain excessive weight (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Vollmer &amp; Mobley, 2013</xref>). Like other preventive interventions that have focused on responsive food parenting practices (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Harvey-Berino &amp; Rourke, 2003</xref>), Recipe 4 Success may help shift parent–child interactions around food in a way that supports toddlers’ self-regulation and healthy eating habits.</p>
                <p id="P69">This trial found that Recipe 4 Success promoted multiple dimensions of toddlers’ self-regulation, including the abilities to delay gratification and resist temptation, to concentrate and pay attention, and to refrain from pursuing their own goals and comply with parental requests. Compared to families in the control group, intervention parents also perceived their toddlers to exhibit less negative emotionality and to have fewer eating and sleep problems. In most biological systems, change is most likely to happen before canalization occurs (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Blair &amp; Raver, 2012</xref>), suggesting that self-regulation will be most malleable during early childhood. The fact that self-regulation by ages 5–6 predicts diverse and important outcomes going forward suggests considerable rank-order stability across middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Moffitt et al., 2011</xref>). Because of positive and negative developmental cascades, small differences in early childhood can become magnified over time. Recipe 4 Success represents an addition to the relatively small cadre of preventive interventions that improve self-regulation at such an important period in development as the toddler years (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P70">Finally, the results of this trial showed that Recipe 4 Success produced changes in toddlers’ healthy eating habits. It is encouraging that, compared to families in the control group, parents in Recipe 4 Success were more likely to involve their toddlers in preparing meals and snacks after the intervention had ended. When children help prepare healthy foods, they are more likely to eat those foods, and when families cook and eat at home, children are more likely to have a normal weight (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Knai et al., 2006</xref>). We found that, at the end of the 12-week intervention, toddlers who participated in Recipe 4 Success, compared to usual practice Early Head Start home visits, were eating more healthy foods each day. Moreover, when toddlers with overweight/obesity participated in Recipe 4 Success, rather than usual practice Early Head Start home visits, they may be more likely to have a lower BMI. Although that difference was not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .096) due to the smaller subsample of toddlers with overweight/obesity at baseline, the intervention effect size, standardized <italic toggle="yes">β</italic> = −.35, was considerably larger than the intervention effect sizes, <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = .10–.20, typically found in other interventions targeting childhood obesity (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kerr et al., 2019</xref>). Because healthy eating habits in early childhood are some of the strongest predictors of adult diet (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Craigie et al., 2011</xref>), changes in this domain, if sustained and built upon, could have life-long implications for physical health.</p>

                <title>Cumulative evidence of effectiveness</title>
                <p id="P71">In the first trial (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nix et al., 2021</xref>) and in this second trial, Recipe 4 Success produced statistically significant intervention effects in parents’ sensitive scaffolding, responsive food parenting practices, toddlers’ self-regulation, and healthy eating habits. Together, these two trials substantiate the value of our community-based participatory research approach to working with racially and ethnically diverse families living in poverty (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Nix, 2020</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P72">The major difference between the results of these two trials was the magnitude of the intervention effects: The first trial produced medium-to-large intervention effect sizes, whereas this second trial produced small-to-medium intervention effect sizes. Aside from random variation across samples, this difference could be a result of the fact that, in the first trial, all of our Early Head Start partners helped create the preventive intervention (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Nix, 2020</xref>). As a result, Early Head Start administrators and home visitors were more familiar with the rationale behind the different components of the curriculum and may have felt greater investment in implementing them well. This difference in intervention effect sizes could have been due to a greater emphasis in this second trial on the four core parenting behaviors, including adding two lessons devoted solely to teaching those behaviors. Perhaps, by focusing on these core parenting behaviors more, we overtaxed both home visitors and parents and diluted the impact of other critical messages and skills. This difference in intervention effect sizes also could be a result of changes in some of the featured recipes. In the first trial, we included several recipes that were child friendly and reasonably healthy, such as English muffin pizzas and peanut butter-chocolate chip granola bars. In contrast, in this second trial, all of our recipes were child friendly but only included WIC-approved ingredients, such as a vegetable omelet and pumpkin soup. It could be that our recipes in the first trial were better aligned with the kind of change families were ready or willing to make, and our recipes in the second trial were too different from current and preferred diets to be readily embraced, thus dampening enthusiasm for the lessons overall.</p>
                <p id="P73">Although the current Recipe 4 Success intervention effects are smaller than those of the previous trial, they are as large as those found in most other two-generation preventive interventions for families with young children (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Filene et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 2015</xref>). In general, effect sizes for preventive interventions are smaller than effect sizes in clinical treatments because preventive interventions inevitably include families who may not require the support provided, thereby reducing group differences. Importantly, however, even small-to-medium intervention effects can lead to substantial and meaningful long-term change, especially when intervention effects set in motion self-perpetuating virtuous cycles that give children the support and skills they will need to navigate the challenges they may encounter.</p>

                <title>Enhancing the effectiveness of home visit programs</title>
                <p id="P74">Recipe 4 Success was designed to be embedded within Early Head Start home visits to take advantage of the therapeutic relationships that already had been formed and to enhance the ability of the national program to effectuate change. By relying on evidence-based usual-practice Early Head Start home visits as the comparison condition, this trial of Recipe 4 Success suggests a refined model for how home visit programs can be organized and optimized. Although following one longer evidence-based curriculum, such as Parents as Teachers (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al., 2002</xref>), has been effective overall, adding a series of shorter term evidence-based curricula that are timed with developmental transitions and focused on specific milestones might boost program benefits and yield even better outcomes for children.</p>
                <p id="P75">There are several advantages to such an approach. First, many of the preventive interventions with the strongest evidence of efficacy, such as Playing and Learning Strategies, are implemented over a relatively circumscribed period of about 12 weeks (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Landry et al., 2008</xref>). This kind of focused attention on a limited set of learning objectives may have advantages for both home visitors and families. Second, these preventive interventions with the strongest evidence are the result of countless hours of planning, piloting, and testing. They most likely represent superior lessons to what overtaxed home visitors can create on their own, between appointments with the families in their caseloads, based on looser guidance from broader curricula. Third, learning to implement multiple brief evidence-based preventive interventions with fidelity could build professional capacity and expertise among home visitors, which could generalize to all of their work. In addition, there may be less burnout among home visitors as they feel more effective in actually helping the families they work with (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Maslach et al., 2001</xref>). Fourth, families may appreciate more variety in lesson content, and different families may respond to some approaches more than others.</p>
                <p id="P76">Current home visiting programs, such as Early Head Start, with their established infrastructure in most communities, may serve as an unrivaled platform with which to widely disseminate the best preventive interventions. Although including multiple new evidence-based preventive interventions within home visiting programs would require either more resources or a re-allocation of current resources, such costs may represent a small percentage of overall expenditures. In our case, it costs about $4800 to provide Early Head Start home visits to one family for eightmonths, which is the average length of participation, and considerably more when families remain enrolled for a longer proportion of the three-plus years they are eligible (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Corso et al., 2022</xref>). The one-time cost of providing Recipe 4 Success for 12 weeks was about $300 per family: $100 for food; less than $100 dollars for materials, such as curriculum manuals and recipe books; and about $100 for the home visitor trainings and supervision. All other costs, such as home visitor salary and benefits, were the same regardless of which curricula Early Head Start programs were implementing.</p>
                <p id="P77">Compared to no home visits at all, Early Head Start improves parent and child functioning, with statistically significant intervention effects of .09–.20 (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Love et al., 2005</xref>). The results of this trial suggest that, compared to usual practice Early Head Start, a preventive intervention like Recipe 4 Success could enhance critical dimensions of family functioning and child development even more, with additional statistically significant intervention effects of .16–.33.</p>

                <title>Study strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="P78">In testing the efficacy of Recipe 4 Success, this study had several strengths. It included a racially and ethnically diverse sample of families, most of whom were living in poverty in a broad cross-section of communities. This study has high external validity because Recipe 4 Success was implemented by Early Head Start home visitors in the context of their regular work with families. This study has high internal validity because families were randomly assigned to condition within home visitor caseloads. Intervention and control group differences depended on the curriculum only, and any contamination across conditions would work against finding intervention effects. In our design, the efficacy of Recipe 4 Success was compared to the evidence-based curricula Early Head Start centers were currently using: Our intervention effects were in addition to those already brought about by Early Head Start on its own. To gauge those intervention effects, this study included multiple observational measures, assessed in a variety of contexts that required generalization of intervention lessons (i.e., parents used what they learned while making an omelette to teach their toddlers how to bowl). In addition, ratings of parents and children were made by different teams of project interviewers and research assistants who were unaware of the study condition. Finally, this study produced a similar pattern of findings to a previous trial (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Nix et al., 2021</xref>), providing evidence of high replicability. Although original discovery is important, replication may have greater scientific merit and public policy value (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Ioannidis, 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P79">This study also had notable limitations. First, although this trial included 47 Latinx families (19% of the sample), it excluded an additional 36 families who spoke only Spanish. We initially tried to accommodate these families, but soon realized that virtually no aspect of participating in the trial was comparable for English- and Spanish-speaking families. Important differences for Spanish-speaking families included the cultural compatibility of the suggested changes to parent–child interactions, the appeal of featured recipes, instability in housing that comes with being even more marginalized in the United States, the perceived safety of sharing family information with unfamiliar adults in an unpredictable political climate, and the experience and availability of project interviewers and research assistants who were fluent in Spanish and could conduct assessments and code video recordings of parent–child interactions. Second, this study tested postintervention between-group differences, not baseline-to-postintervention change. For some parent and toddler outcomes, mean change across time and across conditions was quite small. This could reflect developmental processes or experience. For example, parents may be less likely to engage in high levels of learning support behaviors as their toddlers mature and become more familiar with tasks. What parents learn in Recipe 4 Success might help slow a normative decline and/or shift rank-order stability, lessening the impact of baseline functioning on postintervention functioning. Third, this study tested postintervention between-group differences without investigating the therapeutic mechanisms that might explain how those differences came to be.</p>

It is critical we change public policy to reduce class- and race-based structural inequities too many children face, and it is critical we refine our two-generation preventive interventions for families so they are as effective as can be.</p>
              <p id="P81">This study demonstrated how the Recipe 4 Success preventive intervention can help promote parents’ sensitive scaffolding and responsive food parenting practices, as well as toddlers’ self-regulation and healthy eating habits.
