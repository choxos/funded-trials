                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Nearly half of neonatal intubations are complicated by severe desaturation (â¥20% decline in pulse oximetry saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>)). Apnoeic oxygenation prevents or delays desaturation during intubation in adults and older children. Emerging data show mixed results for apnoeic oxygenation using high-flow nasal cannula (NC) during neonatal intubation. The study objective is to determine among infants â¥28 weeksâ corrected gestational age (cGA) who undergo intubation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) whether apnoeic oxygenation with a regular low-flow NC, compared with standard of care (no additional respiratory support), reduces the magnitude of SpO<sub>2</sub> decline during intubation.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre, prospective, unblinded, pilot randomised controlled trial in infants â¥28 weeksâ cGA who undergo premedicated (including paralytic) intubation in the NICU. The trial will recruit 120 infants, 10 in the run-in phase and 110 in the randomisation phase, at two tertiary care hospitals. Parental consent will be obtained for eligible patients prior to intubation. Patients will be randomised to 6âL NC 100% oxygen versus standard of care (no respiratory support) at time of intubation. The primary outcome is magnitude of oxygen desaturation during intubation. Secondary outcomes include additional efficacy, safety and feasibility outcomes. Ascertainment of the primary outcome is performed blinded to intervention arm. Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted to compare outcomes between treatment arms. Two planned subgroup analyses will explore the influence of first provider intubation competence and patientsâ baseline lung disease using pre-intubation respiratory support as a proxy.</p>

Upon completion of the trial, we intend to submit our primary results to a peer review forum after which we plan to publish our results in a peer-reviewed paediatric journal.</p>

              <p>Tracheal intubation is a common, life-saving, high-risk procedure for critically ill infants. Adverse events occur in 18% of tracheal intubations performed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting, and almost half (48%) of NICU intubations are complicated by severe oxygen desaturation (â¥20% decline in pulse oximetry saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>)).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among extremely preterm infants, severe desaturation events are now recognised as an important contributor to neonatal morbidity and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-month follow-up.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2â4</xref> Modifiable factors such as video laryngoscope and paralytic premedication are associated with lower rates of adverse events during neonatal intubation, but these practices do not prevent severe oxygen desaturation during intubation in NICU patients.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>Typical practice during intubation in the NICU setting is to remove respiratory support during laryngoscopy and intubation attempts. Patients are often apnoeic during this period due to premedication administration, a practice that is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Apnoeic oxygenation is a strategy in which free-flowing oxygen is provided via nasal cannula (NC) during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Apnoeic oxygenation has been demonstrated to prevent or delay oxygen desaturation during intubation in adults and older children.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6â9</xref> Apnoeic oxygenation is now a clinical standard or quality improvement intervention in many paediatric acute care settings.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â13</xref></p>
              <p>Emerging data demonstrate mixed results for the use of apnoeic oxygenation among neonates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> One trial demonstrated a significant improvement in the composite outcome of intubation success without physiological deterioration. However, 26% of intubations in the trial were performed without premedication, and thus the neonates were not apnoeic during the intubation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The second trial demonstrated no difference in the primary outcome of duration of oxygen desaturation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Additionally, both studies used high-flow NC to provide apnoeic oxygenation which costs more and requires additional time and resources to set up compared with regular low-flow NC.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> We designed this study to test the efficacy, feasibility and safety of apnoeic oxygenation delivered via NC among neonates with apnoea during tracheal intubation in the NICU.</p>

                <title>Aim</title>
                <p>The study objective is to determine among infants â¥28 weeksâ corrected gestational age (cGA) who undergo intubation in the NICU, whether apnoeic oxygenation with NC, compared with standard of care (no additional respiratory support), reduces the magnitude of SpO<sub>2</sub> decline during intubation. Secondary objectives include determining whether apnoeic oxygenation is safe and feasible to perform among NICU patients.</p>

                <p>The first five patients at each study site will receive apnoeic oxygenation during a run-in phase. This will enable optimisation of site-specific operational procedures and identification of any site-specific barriers to study procedures prior to randomisation phase. Run-in patients will not be included in final analyses.</p>
                <p>All subsequent patients at each site will undergo randomisation during the randomisation phase (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The study will employ computer-generated permuted block randomisation with unequal blocks of varying size with an allocation ratio of 1:1 within each block. Pre-randomisation stratification is by site. Given the time-critical nature of the intervention, randomisation cards will be kept in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes stored in each NICU adjacent to the respiratory therapy equipment. If a consented infant meets all eligibility criteria, the randomisation envelope will be opened immediately prior to intubation.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The decision to intubate is left to the clinical teamâs discretion. If the clinical team determines a consented patient requires intubation, the study equipment pole will be brought to the patientâs bedside (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The study pole includes all study materials: study-specific NC (Hudson RCI, Teleflex, Morrisville, North Carolina, USA), study-specific pulse oximeter (Masimo Rad-G, Masimo Corp, Irvine, California, USA), randomisation envelopes, study video-recording device (GoPro HERO Session, GoPro, San Mateo, California, USA) and trial workflow education. The clinical team will confirm eligibility criteria reviewing both inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient does not meet eligibility criteria, the intubation will proceed per standard of care and the patient will not be randomised. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the clinical team will place the study pole next to the bedside and start the video-recording device, positioning it with a birdâs-eye view of the infantâs bed. The clinical team will then apply the study-specific pulse oximeter probe to any of the patientâs extremities and place the pulse oximeter on the bed in view of the video-recording device. The team will open the randomisation envelope and treatment allocation will be announced at which point the patient is officially enrolled in the trial.</p>

NEAR4NEOS is an international multicentre airway registry which captures tracheal intubation process and outcome measures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> After a patient is randomised, a team member will download the pulse oximeter data and the video of the intubation.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>All statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata V.17 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). An intention-to-treat analysis will estimate whether apnoeic oxygenation is superior to standard of care in reducing the magnitude of oxygen desaturation. The analyses will be performed according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The primary and secondary outcomes (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) recorded for eligible infants enrolled in the randomisation phase will be evaluated via intention-to-treat statistical analysis. The effect sizes for primary and secondary outcomes will be estimated, with 95% CIs as a measure of precision of estimation. The analysis of the primary outcome will be conducted using linear regression to control for residual confounding by clinical site, as the randomisation will be stratified on this variable, consistent with the CONSORT statement.</p>
                <p>We will also conduct exploratory and hypothesis-generating secondary analyses of the primary outcome for this trial. In these analyses, we will adjust for potentially important prognostic covariates, including patient weight at intubation, patient biological sex, respiratory support prior to intubation (as a proxy for baseline lung disease), use of video laryngoscope and first provider intubation competence. We will employ a manual stepwise approach that first fits a model that includes all variables and will then remove the variable with the largest p value, until all p values are &lt;0.05. We will report results from these secondary analyses but will consider the results from the analysis adjusted for site only to be primary.</p>
                <p>We will perform two subgroup analyses to explore the influence of first provider intubation competence and patientsâ baseline lung disease. We will use cumulative summation methodology to define providers as procedurally competent, deficient or undifferentiated at time of each intubation, based on their past intubation performance.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We will use patientsâ level of respiratory support prior to intubation as a proxy for baseline lung disease dichotomising this variable into low support (â¤5âL high-flow NC) and high support (&gt;5âL high-flow NC).</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes will be analysed using similar procedures to the primary outcome. Comparisons between treatment arms will use logistic regression, linear regression or time-to-event analyses, as appropriate.</p>
                <p>We do not anticipate significant loss to follow-up for the primary endpoint given the proximity to randomisation. However, missing data from the pulse oximeter are possible. We will therefore perform two sensitivity analyses using physiological data reported for the encounter in NEAR4NEOS to assess oxygen desaturation defined in two ways: severe oxygen desaturation (â¥20% decline in SpO<sub>2</sub>) and desaturation &lt;80% during intubation encounter.

                <p>The study team conducted extensive education and training with all disciplines involved in intubation at each site to ensure protocol understanding and compliance prior to study initiation. The team developed a training video demonstrating both arms of the intervention to augment the educational curriculum. Additionally, the protocol includes a run-in phase where the first five patients at each site receive apnoeic oxygenation to establish site-specific operational procedures and to identify any site-specific barriers to study procedures. During the study period, weekly email reminders with refresher education will be sent to clinical teams with consented patients. Lastly, all trial intubations will be video recorded to assess protocol adherence and address quality control issues.</p>
