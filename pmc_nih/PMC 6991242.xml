                  <p>Among patients hospitalized with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a patient-driven virtual educational intervention as effective as the criterion standard in-person teach-to-goal intervention for improving medication use skills?</p>

                  <p>In this equivalence and noninferiority trial of 118 adult inpatients with asthma or COPD, the increase in the percentage of persons with improved medication skills was similar in the virtual teach-to-goal group (67%) and the in-person teach-to-goal group (66%), although the postintervention group comparison did not meet the a priori noninferiority significance level.</p>

                  <p>Many patients who are hospitalized cannot use inhalers correctly, yet education for their use is often not provided. To address the need for an effective intervention feasible for wide-scale implementation, a virtual teach-to-goal intervention was developed to provide tailored patient-directed education using adaptive learning technology.</p>

                  <p>An equivalence and noninferiority randomized clinical trial took place from January 13, 2016, through September 20, 2017, with analyses conducted between October 25, 2017, and September 23, 2019. Adult inpatients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) admitted to general inpatient wards were eligible. Enrolled participants were randomized to virtual (n = 61) or in-person (n = 60) educational interventions. Investigators and research assistants were masked to interventions. Initial enrollment, study assessments, and delivery of the educational intervention occurred in the hospital; participants returned at 30 days for a follow-up research visit.</p>

                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Virtual education was a module delivered via handheld tablet with self-assessment questions before demonstration, narrated video demonstration of the correct technique, and self-assessment questions after demonstration; up to 3 rounds were repeated as needed. In-person education participants received iterative rounds of inhaler technique assessment and education by trained staff.</p>

                  <p>Noninferiority testing of whether virtual vs in-person education achieved an equal percentage with correct inhaler technique after education (&gt;9 of 12 steps correct) against an a priori noninferiority limit of –10%; logistic regression models were used to adjust for differences in baseline technique and health literacy.</p>

Correct technique increased similarly before vs after education in virtual (67%; range, 2%-69%) and in-person (66%; range, 17% to 83%) groups, although the difference after intervention exceeded the noninferiority limit (–14%; 95% CI lower bound, –26%). When adjusting for baseline inhaler technique, the difference was equivalent to the noninferiority limit (–10%; 95% CI lower bound, –22%).</p>

Future work should confirm whether virtual teach-to-goal education is noninferior to in-person education and whether it is associated with long-term skills retention, medication adherence, and improved health outcomes.</p>

              <p>In-person education, especially using teach-to-goal (TTG) methods with rounds of demonstration and the teach-back method, has been shown to be superior to brief verbal instructions for improving inhaler technique and decreasing acute care utilization.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> However, in-person education is expensive, difficult to implement, and of varying quality.

              <p>A direct-to-patient, technology-based intervention designed to be a low-cost, feasible solution was developed by members of our team at the University of Chicago, some of whom are authors on this report; this intervention is housed and licensed on the Smart Sparrow platform.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> However, it is unknown whether this virtual educational intervention is as effective as in-person education.

                <p>A conservative a priori noninferiority margin of –10% for the difference (V-TTG minus in-person TTG) in the percentage of participants with correct inhaler use at discharge was chosen<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> because of concerns that clinicians would be skeptical of non–in-person approaches. On the basis of previous studies, we anticipated the percentage with correct use immediately after education to be approximately 88%; given this, a sample size of 59 participants per group would yield an approximate 95% CI 1-sided lower bound 10 percentage points less than the observed difference between the 2 groups.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Although a standard sample size calculation for establishing noninferiority in this setting would result in a larger sample size, the available resources precluded performing a larger trial.</p>
                <p>The a priori planned primary analysis was an unadjusted comparison of the percent of participants using the inhaler correctly (≥10 of 12 steps correct) at discharge between those assigned to V-TTG and those assigned to in-person TTG. All consenting participants who completed the primary outcome assessment before discharge were included in the analyses. Adjusted comparisons were performed using logistic regression (percentage with correct technique) and ordinal logistic regression (total number of steps performed correctly).<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> A 95% CI 1-sided lower bound was computed using the standard normal approximation and was compared with the noninferiority margin of –10%.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> To facilitate comparison with the unadjusted results, we computed the marginal probabilities (presented as percentages for consistency) of obtaining a score at least 10 correct steps separately for each group, the difference between them, and a 95% CI lower bound (again using the normal approximation with SEs obtained with the method). The marginal probability for a given group was computed by calculating the predicted probability for each individual based on the model assuming that all individuals are in the given group (but leaving the value of the other covariates unchanged) and averaging the entire sample.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Covariates included baseline correct use score and baseline health literacy (binary). Comparisons at 30 days after discharge were also performed.</p>
                <p>To examine treatment effects over time, we fit a mixed-effects ordinal logit model to the observed scores at baseline, discharge, and 30 days after discharge (ie, 3 observations per participant)<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>:<disp-formula id="zoi190686ea">logit[P(Y<sub>ij</sub> &gt; k)] = β<sub>1</sub> × V<sub>i</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>A<sub>ij</sub> + β<sub>3</sub>D30<sub>ij</sub> + β<sub>4</sub>V<sub>i</sub> × A<sub>ij</sub> + β<sub>5</sub>V<sub>i</sub> × D30<sub>ij</sub> + Z<sub>i</sub>γ + <italic>θ<sub>i</sub></italic> – κ<sub>k</sub></disp-formula>where Y<sub>ij</sub> is the number of steps performed correctly by the <italic>i</italic>th participant at the <italic>j</italic>th time point (<italic>j</italic> = 1, 2, 3 and <italic>k</italic> = 1, 2, …, 11). The variable V<sub>i</sub> = 1 for those assigned to V-TTG, 0 otherwise; A<sub>ij</sub> = 1 for those time points after the educational intervention, 0 otherwise; D30<sub>ij</sub> = 1 for the time point 30 days after discharge, 0 otherwise; and Z<sub>i</sub> defined a vector of covariates (eg, an indicator of low health literacy). Thus, the coefficient β<sub>4</sub> captured the differential effect of V-TTG vs in-person TTG on performance at discharge, whereas β<sub>5</sub> captured the difference between V-TTG and in-person TTG in the change during the first month after discharge. Finally, <italic>θ<sub>i</sub></italic> is a random intercept capturing stable differences between participants.

                <p>For the secondary outcome, we dichotomized 30-day acute care events (both emergency department and hospitalization visits) and then conducted a noninferiority analysis using logistic regression to model the likelihood of having an acute care event (both emergency department and hospitalization visits) within 30 days after education. Consistent with the analysis of the primary outcome, we presented a 95% CI upper bound for the risk difference between V-TTG and in-person TTG using the same noninferiority margin of 10%. The number of acute care events at baseline (previous 12 months) and health literacy were included as covariates.

                <p>Most participants (91 of 118 [77%]) completed the interventions on days 2 or 3 of hospitalization. Forty-one of the 59 participants (69%) randomized to V-TTG scored at least 10 when assessed at discharge compared with 49 of 59 participants (83%) in in-person TTG group, although the percentage of participants with correct technique increased similarly in both the V-TTG (from 2% to 69%; difference, 67%) and in-person TTG (from 17% to 83%; difference, 66%) groups (eTable in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190686-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>). The difference in the observed rate (V-TTG minus in-person TTG) was –14% (95% CI lower bound, –26%) (<xref rid="zoi190686t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A logistic regression model (model 1) adjusting for number of baseline correct steps yielded marginal probabilities of scoring at least 10 of 71% (V-TTG) and 82% (in-person TTG), for a difference of –10% (95% CI lower bound, –22%); adjusting for low health literacy (model 2) yielded the same estimated difference and confidence bound. Fitting an ordinal logit model with both covariates yielded a similar difference and greater precision (–11%; 95% CI lower bound, –19%). Similar improvements in the individual steps missed were seen across both groups for all inhaler technique steps except for step 11 (53% correct in the V-TTG group vs 76% correct in the in-person TTG group; <italic>P</italic> = .01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190686f2">Figure 2</xref>B); however, this difference was smaller when adjusting for baseline misuse (V-TTG: 49% vs 64%; <italic>P</italic> = .10).</p>

As noted earlier, performance declined in the in-person TTG group during the first month after discharge by an amount that was approximately one-third that of the initial increase (–2.19; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

The overall increase from baseline to 30 days after discharge in the V-TTG group (3.16) was 89% as large (95% CI lower bound, 67%) as that for the in-person TTG group (3.54). Those with low health literacy scored lower on average (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.59; <italic>P</italic> = .001); despite adjusting for this, there remained substantial between-individual differences assuming that the <italic>θ<sub>i</sub></italic> is normally distributed with mean of 0 (SD of random intercept, 1.7). An interaction between the postintervention indicator and low health literacy yielded an estimated difference in differences value of –0.80 (95% CI, –1.80 to 0.19; <italic>P</italic> = .10), consistent with the possibility that the effect of an educational intervention may be lower among those with low health literacy.</p>

                <p>At baseline, both V-TTG and in-person TTG groups reported similar rates of all-cause acute care utilization 1 year before study enrollment (<xref rid="zoi190686t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The V-TTG participants reported a mean (SD) of 2.1 (1.7) emergency department visits and 1.8 (1.6) hospitalizations compared with the in-person TTG participants, who reported a mean (SD) of 1.9 (1.6) emergency department visits and 1.4 (1.5) hospitalizations. After 30 days, the percentage of participants who had experienced acute care emergency department or hospital utilization was lower for V-TTG (24%) than for in-person TTG (29%) participants, yielding an unadjusted difference of –5% (95% CI upper bound, 9.6%). Adjusting for the baseline number of acute events and health literacy changed this difference to –8% (95% CI upper bound, 7%). Using the noninferior margin of 10%, V-TTG was noninferior to in-person TTG in probability of 30-day acute events.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found that a virtual-delivered, patient-directed intervention for inhaler instruction increased inhaler technique proficiency by a similar amount as a well-validated in-person approach. Moreover, performance in the V-TTG group declined by the same amount as in the in-person TTG group in the month after discharge, implying that skills learned with V-TTG may be as durable as those learned with in-person TTG. Thus, it appears that learners are well served by V-TTG, especially because it may be repeated at home. This virtual approach has potentially important implications for increasing access to high-quality education because the virtual intervention likely has significantly lower costs and time constraints in real-world settings compared with the costs of training and delivering in-person education in hospital and at home.</p>
              <p>The V-TTG nearly met our a priori noninferiority criteria compared with in-person TTG, especially when specifically evaluating the study population with baseline inhaler misuse. The estimated differences in the rates of inhaler proficiency at discharge and at 30 days were similar to our a priori noninferiority margin of 10%. This margin was conservative; with hindsight, a more liberal noninferiority margin could have been justified clinically given the higher feasibility of disseminating the virtual educational intervention with potentially broader reach in real-world practice and given our findings that decline of inhaler technique skills was similar with both virtual and in-person approaches. Future studies designed to demonstrate statistical noninferiority might consider a more liberal noninferiority margin because even if in-person TTG is somewhat more efficacious, V-TTG’s greater feasibility would make it an attractive option in real-world settings. More importantly, future studies should be designed to observe patients for a long time such that V-TTG can be repeated at any time, potentially increasing its value compared with in-person TTG. Because this was a single-site study in an urban setting with predominantly black individuals, future studies should also compare the efficacy of V-TTG vs in-person TTG in diverse settings and populations.</p>
              <p>Innovation appears to be necessary to solve the fundamental problem of how to deliver guideline-recommended care in real-world settings because the practice of relying on health care clinicians has not proved to be effective.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The novel approach of V-TTG is that it may not only be effective but also offer a solution to system barriers that prevent education from occurring in the first place. Of importance, in our study, similar improvements occurred in individual inhaler steps and overall technique among participants with baseline misuse in the V-TTG and in-person TTG groups.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Because inhaler education is often substandard or lacking, patients commonly misuse their inhalers and thus do not receive the clinical benefits. Virtual TTG also allows for ongoing refresher or practice education because this teaching method could be done in homes or other non–health care settings. This aspect of V-TTG provides a system-based solution to the need for repeated education<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> because our work and other studies have found that inhaler skills wane quickly after education.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Effective patient-driven interventions that can work in any setting could be beneficial and improve long-term outcomes. Real-world studies are needed to test the feasibility of large-scale implementation of V-TTG across clinical and home settings and whether repeated administration of virtual education improves long-term outcomes.</p>
              <p>To date, the relationship between inhaler technique and health outcomes has been difficult to study in real-world settings because of limited availability of discrete administrative data. In previous studies, improved technique was associated with short-term improved health outcomes, including fewer 30-day acute care events among participants receiving in-person TTG vs brief verbal instructions.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In this study, the percentages of participants in both groups with acute care visits (emergency department visits or hospitalization) at 30 days were similar. More data are needed to understand whether V-TTG can further improve health outcomes if used for refresher education. In addition, outside controlled research studies, documentation of education, especially inhaler technique, is frequently lacking. Therefore, little is known about the real-world impact of inhaler education. Technology that captures patients’ responses may permit measurement of the inhaler educational intervention’s effect on health outcomes in real-world settings.</p>
              <p>Another potential advantage of V-TTG is identification of patients who may benefit from additional in-person training. Because interventions that rely on technology may not be suitable for all patients, if V-TTG proves to be inaccessible to some patients, in-person education could be provided. Using in-person education for a smaller and preidentified high-risk patient population could be less costly than providing it for all inpatients. Investigations are needed into practical methods to deploy V-TTG for screening of high-risk patients who need hands-on training.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. First, our study population primarily comprised urban, underserved, black patients, with a slightly higher proportion of these patients than our clinical population, and our intervention was developed using direct feedback from this population. Also, trained nonclinical research personnel provided in-person TTG education. However, our validated checklists have high interrater reliability<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>; thus, this approach could be adapted by clinical staff. Therefore, future work is needed to test generalizability among diverse patient populations in clinical settings.</p>
                <p>An important methodologic limitation is the significant difference in baseline inhaler misuse between V-TTG and in-person TTG groups. This imbalance adds complexity to deciphering the findings, although overall results were not different (noninferiority not met). Future studies across diverse settings and populations with similar baseline rates of misuse are needed to validate our findings. Another important limitation is that participants were provided with devices to complete V-TTG education; thus, data are needed on technology access for such education in hospitals and homes. Although most US adults report mobile device ownership, device size, and/or willingness to use, data plans and service may vary across patient subgroups and setting which could affect real-world use of V-TTG.<sup><xref rid="zoi190686r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190686r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Therefore, generalizability to clinical and home settings across diverse populations and geographies needs testing in future head-to-head comparisons. Although V-TTG may be a cost-effective system-based solution to providing effective guideline-recommended inhaler education, real-world testing is needed. For instance, if clinician or staff time is needed for V-TTG, the hypothesized cost-savings could be mitigated because completion of V-TTG takes significantly longer than in-person TTG.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This study found that virtual TTG may be nearly as effective as in-person education for correcting baseline inhaler misuse among hospitalized patients. Larger-scale pragmatic studies are needed to determine whether V-TTG will improve long-term inhaler technique skills and/or patient outcomes when used across health care and home settings and to evaluate feasibility and potential cost-savings of wide-scale implementation. If V-TTG is shown to be feasible and effective across diverse populations and settings, this innovation could transform the ability of health care systems and individual clinicians to deliver guideline-recommended education for inhalers effectively with the goal of improving health outcomes and avoiding exacerbations.</p>
