                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling drives development of T cell populations important to type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. We evaluated whether blockade of IL-6R with monoclonal antibody tocilizumab would slow loss of residual Î² cell function in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with tocilizumab in new-onset type 1 diabetes. Participants were screened within 100 days of diagnosis. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to receive 7 monthly doses of tocilizumab or placebo. The primary outcome was the change from screening in the mean AUC of C-peptide collected during the first 2 hours of a mixed meal tolerance test at week 52 in pediatric participants (ages 6â17 years).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There was no statistical difference in the primary outcome between tocilizumab and placebo. Immunophenotyping showed reductions in downstream signaling of the IL-6R in T cells but no changes in CD4 memory subsets, Th17 cells, Tregs, or CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector cell resistance to Treg suppression. A DC subset decreased during therapy but regressed to baseline once therapy stopped. Tocilizumab was well tolerated.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Tocilizumab reduced T cell IL-6R signaling but did not modulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell phenotypes or slow loss of residual Î² cell function in newly diagnosed individuals with type 1 diabetes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is a significant unmet need for disease-modifying therapy in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Despite the advent of modified insulins and new insulin delivery technologies, disease management remains suboptimal, and patients continue to experience disease-associated morbidity, day-to-day emotional and financial burdens, and reduced life expectancy (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The goal of disease-modifying therapy in T1D, similar to other autoimmune diseases, is to modulate the autoimmune process instead of treating symptoms (i.e., hyperglycemia).</p>
              <p>Over the past 2 decades, 7 trials of immune-modulating therapies have shown efficacy in preserving insulin secretion after clinical diagnosis. These studies targeted adaptive immune cells (such as antiâB cell therapy with rituximab and antiâT cell therapy with teplizumab, antithymocyte globulin, and alefacept), blocked costimulation pathways (abatacept), and inhibited cytokines (antiâIL-21 and anti-TNF; refs. <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-6 belongs to a family of cytokines sharing a common receptor subunit, gp130 (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Classical IL-6 signaling occurs after IL-6 binds to membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and associates with gp130, forming an active ligand-receptor complex and activating, via phosphorylation, the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (JAK/STAT3) cascade (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Targeting IL-6 in T1D would be rational based on the immunology of the disease. Both T helper 17 (Th17) cells and T regulatory cells (Tregs) contribute to the development of T1D, with IL-6 augmenting development of pathogenic Th17 effector cells and blocking the development and function of suppressive Tregs (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, T effector cells from T1D individuals are hyperresponsive to IL-6 and resistant to suppression by Tregs in vitro (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Also, signaling through the IL-6R appears to play a role in risk of developing T1D based on the observation that a functional <italic toggle="yes">IL-6R</italic> variant impairs classical IL-6 signaling and may protect against the development of T1D (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the IL-6R. It has been shown to be effective in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and is currently approved for use in children as young as 2 years of age for the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Given the mechanistic rationale for the role of IL-6 signaling in T1D and that other effective rheumatoid arthritis drugs (abatacept and TNF-Î± blockers) have shown benefit in T1D, we hypothesized that blockade of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab would lead to clinical improvements in T1D (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in individuals with newly diagnosed T1D. Our primary outcome was a change in residual insulin secretion at 1 year as measured by 2-hour C-peptide mean area under the curve (mAUC) in pediatric participants following 6 months of therapy. While children ages 6 to 17 years were the primary efficacy population in this study, a cohort of adults was enrolled initially for a safety evaluation before opening the study to the pediatric group. Additional aims of the study were to evaluate the safety of tocilizumab treatment in T1D and to examine changes in immune cell subsets after tocilizumab therapy.</p>

                <p>Adults and pediatric patients screened and randomized are shown (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 6 tocilizumab-treated participants (3 adult and 3 pediatric) discontinued therapy early, and a total of 2 placebo-treated patients discontinued prior to completing the course of study medication (1 adult and 1 pediatric). The pediatric and adult cohorts had, respectively, 54 and 34 modified intention to treat (mITT) participants in the tocilizumab arm and 27 and 20 mITT participants in the placebo arm.</p>
                <p>In both the adult and pediatric cohorts, most participants were White (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There were more men than women in the adult cohort. On average, participants in both cohorts had excellent glucose control at study entry as evidenced by the mean HbA1c values of less than 7%.</p>

                <p>There was no difference in the 2-hour C-peptide mAUC at week 52 between the tocilizumab- and placebo-treated groups in either the pediatric or adult cohort (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The least squares means from the primary endpoint model (pediatric participants) for the change from screening to week 52 in 2-hour C-peptide mAUC were â0.337 (95% CI: â0.39, â0.28) for the tocilizumab arm and â0.391 (95% CI: â0.47, â0.31) for the placebo arm (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.277). Mixed model analysis of 2-hour C-peptide mAUC did not find any difference between the treatment groups at screening or over time for each age cohort. Participants over 12 years of age completed a 4-hour MMTT. No difference in 4-hour MMTT mAUC between baseline and week 52 was observed between treatment arms in both the pediatric and adult participants (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>).

                <p>Insulin sensitivity was also assessed in a subset of participants who completed the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing (FSIVGTT). Since IL-6 may regulate peripheral insulin resistance, it was hypothesized that blockade of the IL-6 pathway with tocilizumab would result in improved insulin sensitivity. A total of 19 participants elected to participate, and 11 participants had adequate data for modeling at the 3 visits. No change in insulin sensitivity was noted in any active drug participant (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>).</p>

                <title>AntiâIL-6R transiently reduces signaling in T cell subsets but does not alter T cell phenotypes.</title>
                <p>We analyzed longitudinal blood samples from trial participants to understand the immunological effects of tocilizumab given its lack of clinical efficacy in this study. We first determined whether tocilizumab suppressed signaling in T cells downstream of the IL-6R. Activation of the IL-6R on T cells results in phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In our trial, monthly tocilizumab dosing over the 24-week treatment period led to significant and rapid reductions of phosphorylated STAT3 in memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T effector (Teff) cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CD45RA<sup>â</sup>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4, AâC</xref>) compared with placebo. However, 6 months after stopping the drug, at week 52, STAT3 phosphorylation in the tocilizumab group returned to levels comparable to those of the placebo group. Tocilizumab therapy also reduced STAT3 phosphorylation in CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, we observed that surface IL-6R expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells decreased during therapy with tocilizumab, consistent with the known mechanism of the drug (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). These experiments confirmed that tocilizumab blocked IL-6R signaling in T cells.</p>
                <p>Despite impaired IL-6 signaling, no changes were observed in the phenotype and function of circulating T cells. There was no effect of tocilizumab on the percentages of the CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg (CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>), total CD4 memory, or CD4 memory subsets (CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> for central memory and CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>â</sup> for Tem cells; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, AâD</xref>). We also found no reductions in Th17 (CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>IL-17a<sup>+</sup>) or T follicular helper (Tfh) (CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>â</sup>CD45RO<sup>+</sup>IL-21<sup>+</sup>) subsets (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5, E and F</xref>). Although prior in vitro studies suggested that IL-6 impairs CD4<sup>+</sup> Teff susceptibility to suppression by Tregs (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), no differences in suppression were seen between the tocilizumab and placebo groups (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

                <p>Given the importance of IL-6 in myeloid cell function, we studied whether tocilizumab affected monocytes and DCs. Classical monocytes (CD3<sup>â</sup>CD19<sup>â</sup>CD56<sup>â</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>hi</sup>CD16<sup>â</sup>) increased during the early phase of treatment with tocilizumab, but the increase did not persist over time (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, A and B</xref>). Tocilizumab recipients had transient but not statistically significant increases in the frequency of pDCs (CD3<sup>â</sup>CD19<sup>â</sup>CD56<sup>â</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>â</sup>CD16<sup>â</sup>CD141<sup>lo</sup>CD1c<sup>â</sup>CD123<sup>+</sup>) and cDC1s (CD3<sup>â</sup>CD19<sup>â</sup>CD56<sup>â</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>â</sup>CD16<sup>â</sup>CD141<sup>hi</sup>CD1c<sup>â</sup>; <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7, C and D</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Results from this randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that IL-6R blockade with tocilizumab did not slow the loss of residual Î² cell function in children or adults with T1D in the first year after randomization. The high retention of participants in a well-powered clinical trial led to an unambiguous, but disappointing, clinical result.</p>
              <p>Given the role of IL-6 in regulating T cell function and its importance in T1D, the results of this trial were surprising. Prior to this study, data from both animal models and humans supported the approach of IL-6 blockade in T1D. In murine models, IL-6 signaling reduces the frequency of FoxP3 Tregs in favor of expansion of Th17 cells, changes that reflect models of T1D pathogenesis (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In addition, NOD mice treated with tocilizumab maintain euglycemia and have less demonstrable insulitis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Patients with T1D also seem to have evidence of increased IL-6 signaling. Myeloid cells from patients with T1D show increased secretion of IL-6 compared with control and type 2 diabetes patients (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Phosphorylation of STAT3 is also increased in patients with T1D compared with control patients and results in resistance of Teff cells to Treg suppression (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, a coding <italic toggle="yes">IL-6R</italic> variant, rs2228145, confers protection against the development of T1D in humans by promoting membrane shedding of IL-6R by the protease ADAM17 (<underline>a</underline>
<underline>d</underline>isintegrin and <underline>a</underline>
<underline>m</underline>etalloproteinase domain 17), suggesting that reduced IL-6R signaling may be protective (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Together these data strongly implicate the IL-6 pathway in T1D pathogenesis and predict that blockade of the IL-6R with tocilizumab would have some clinical benefit.</p>
              <p>However, despite impairment of IL-6R signaling in this trial, expected changes in T cell phenotypes did not occur. In rheumatoid arthritis, tocilizumab therapy decreases Tfh frequency, and increases Treg frequency, but does not change the frequency of Th17 cells (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The lack of effect on Th17 cells in the present study may have been predicted based on earlier in vitro work in human cells that showed that IL-1 receptor blockade, in combination with antiâIL-6 therapy, is needed to decrease Th17 cells (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the EXTEND trial did not show changes in other T cell subsets that would have been predicted from trials in other autoimmune diseases. For diseases where tocilizumab has been effective (rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome), systemic inflammation is a feature of the disease and IL-6 levels are elevated. This is not the case in T1D and suggests that tocilizumabâs ability to modulate the T cells depends on an inflammatory milieu. In the context of other T1D trials using cytokine receptor antagonists that failed to show efficacy, such as the IL-1R antagonist anakinra, the broader approach of inhibiting inflammatory pathways with receptor blockers should be reevaluated (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p>
              <p>Alternative signaling pathways may also help explain the lack of clinical efficacy. Classical IL-6 signaling involves IL-6 binding to membrane-bound IL-6R. However, cells may release sIL-6R either by the activity of the ADAM17 protease or secretion of an alternative splice product lacking a transmembrane domain (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In a similar fashion, soluble gp130 (sgp130) is also present in the circulation and, together with sIL-6R, functions as a âcytokine sink,â limiting IL-6 activity. Excess amounts of IL-6 and sIL-6R may exceed levels of sgp130, resulting in activation of gp130-expressing cells via transactivation (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p>
              <p>Despite the pharmacodynamic changes indicating marked IL-6R blockade (i.e., a nearly 10-fold reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 in T cells), the inherent redundancy of IL-6 signaling mechanisms may have prevented a complete blockade of the pathway with tocilizumab monotherapy. The parallel increases we observed in serum IL-6 and sIL-6R suggest that transactivation theoretically could have occurred in our trial. Tocilizumab treatment is known to saturate sIL-6R, prolonging the circulating half-life of sIL-6R and reducing consumption of IL-6, resulting in elevated serum IL-6 levels (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). In our study, there was close to a 10-fold increase in serum IL-6 at the end of tocilizumab therapy, but it is not clear if that degree of increased ligand availability would result in transactivation of the IL-6 pathway. It is also possible that global blockade of IL-6R may have directly affected the Treg pool, including a recently described Treg subset seen in patients with T1D that expresses high levels of IL-6R and exhibits suppressive function (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). While alternative signaling was possible in our trial, it does not reconcile the efficacy of tocilizumab in other autoimmune diseases, where similar changes in serum IL-6 and sIL-6R have been reported (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). It may be that complete systemic blockade with a receptor antagonist is not possible, and downstream blockade of the IL-6R/gp130 complex may be needed in T1D. Additionally, while combining tocilizumab with another anticytokine agent is appealing, such a strategy would require additional mechanistic rationale that incorporates the cause for tocilizumabâs lack of efficacy in T1D.</p>
              <p>Besides the lack of modulation of the T cell pool, our trial also found reductions in cDC2s with tocilizumab treatment. Although reductions in DCs have been reported previously in tocilizumab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), no previous tocilizumab trial to our knowledge has analyzed cDC subsets in detail or reported reductions in cDC2s. Two subsets of cDCs in humans exist, cDC1s and cDC2s, and their function seems context dependent. In the cancer microenvironment, cDC2s can recruit naive T cells to mount a Th1 response against malignant cells (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). In autoimmunity, cDC1s are involved in cross-presentation of antigen to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells while cDC2s present antigen to CD4 and may be more tolerogenic by promoting expansion of Tregs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). It is possible that the failure in our study to increase Tregs, as seen in other tocilizumab trials, may have resulted from unexpected reductions in cDC2s. What role IL-6 plays in the homeostasis of cDC2s and whether this role is unique to patients with T1D remains to be clarified.</p>
              <p>Finally, it is important to consider the nonimmunological functions of IL-6 in the context of understanding the trial outcomes. Paradoxical data exist about the role of IL-6 in metabolism. Animal data suggest that IL-6 mediates hepatic insulin resistance via SOCS3, which blocks autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In muscle, however, IL-6 enhances glucose uptake via glucose transporter 4 and increases fatty acid oxidation by upregulating AMPK (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Additionally, it should be noted that IL-6 itself may have a direct role in impairing reactive oxygen species generated in Î² cells (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In our study, no changes in insulin sensitivity were noted during the FSIVGTT, suggesting that the metabolic effects of IL-6 do not play a significant role in Î² cell function in T1D.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the use of tocilizumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with T1D. Tocilizumabâs use was associated with increases in sIL-6R and serum IL-6 and a reduction in cDC2s but did not alter Teff resistance or the frequencies of Th17, Tfh, and Treg subsets. The lack of response to tocilizumab in this study suggests that the role of IL-6 in T1D is complex. Therapeutic interventions targeting IL-6 in the future may be most beneficial in combination with therapies that synergize with the IL-6âdriven pathways most important in T1D pathogenesis.</p>

                <p>This was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of individuals within 100 days of T1D diagnosis. Randomization was done through a central automated system. Both participants and study personnel were blinded to study treatment. Entry criteria included the presence of at least 1 diabetes-related autoantibody, peak stimulated C-peptide â¥ 0.2 pmol/mL during an MMTT, and absence of infections, malignancies, or hematologic abnormalities that could increase risk with tocilizumab administration. The study was powered to determine the effect of tocilizumab in pediatric participants. Adults (ages 18â45 years) were enrolled beginning in March 2015 to provide safety data prior to enrollment of children and to evaluate the impact of tocilizumab in this age group. Data on 35 adults who completed the 12-week postrandomization visit were reviewed by the DSMB and FDA in November 2016 and January 2017, respectively, prior to enrolling pediatric participants. The study was then opened to pediatric enrollment (ages 6â17 years), with the first pediatric participant enrolled on May 12, 2017. All participants were randomized within each age cohort to tocilizumab and placebo 2:1. The primary endpoint was the 2-hour C-peptide mAUC at week 52, adjusted for baseline. Participants were followed for a total of 2 years to evaluate safety and changes in immune response, but this manuscript summarizes the first 52 weeks of the trial for all participants.

FcX Block (BioLegend 4223301) treatment was performed prior to addition of all staining cocktails. Surface markers were stained using cocktails prior to eBioscience FOXP3 fix/perm (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for intracellular staining. Live/Dead Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific L23105) was performed prior to BD Phosflow Fix Buffer I (BD Biosciences 557870) and BD Phosflow Perm buffer III (BD Biosciences 588050) for phosphoflow. Two-hour stimulation with PMA and ionomycin for the ICS panel was performed in the presence of brefeldin A and monensin (BioLegend).

All samples from the same participant were run on the same day, and an internal control sample from 1 individual was run each week to identify any machine or staining issues. Gated populations with fewer than 100 events in immunophenotyping and fewer than 150 events in phosphoflow were excluded from analysis.</p>

                  <title>Treg suppression assay.</title>
                  <p>Samples from 10 randomly selected placebo-treated and 10 tocilizumab-treated pediatric participants with the greatest reduction in phosphorylated STAT3 with tocilizumab therapy were used in a Treg suppression assay. Teff cell resistance was determined by an in vitro Treg-mediated suppression assay using Teff cell surface expression of both CD25 and CD134 as a surrogate marker of Treg-mediated suppression (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). In brief, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells depleted of CD25<sup>hi</sup> cells were isolated from PBMCs of 10 treated and 8 placebo pediatric patients, at baseline and weeks 12, 24, and 52, using a no-touch Miltenyi Biotec CD4 T Cell Isolation Kit II and positive Miltenyi Biotec CD25 Microbeads II prior to staining with CFSE (MilliporeSigma). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>lo</sup> Tregs from a single healthy donor were sorted, expanded, and frozen as described (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) and used as a constant source of Tregs for all suppression assays. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>dim</sup> T (Teff) cells were cultured at 100,000 cells per well. Tregs were added at ratios of 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, and 1:32 (Treg/Teff) and Dynabeads CD3/CD28 T Cell Expander bead (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) added at a ratio of 1:28 (beads/Teff cells). On day 2, Teff cells were stained (<xref rid="sd" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Table 5</xref>). For analysis, Teff cells cultured in media alone were used to set gates for the various activation markers or proliferation. EF670 was used to identify Tregs. Percentage suppression (<italic toggle="yes">s</italic>) was calculated as follows: <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = ([<italic toggle="yes">a</italic> â <italic toggle="yes">b</italic>]/<italic toggle="yes">a)</italic> Ã 100, where <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> is the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD134<sup>+</sup> Teff cells in the absence of Tregs and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> is the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>CD134<sup>+</sup> Teff cells in the presence of Tregs. Samples were collected on a BD Biosciences FACSCanto II; data were analyzed using FlowJo V10.6.2 and GraphPad Prism.</p>

                  <p>Genomic DNA from study participants was genotyped using the Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific), consisting of 903,000 genome-wide and clinically relevant markers and more than 9000 markers across the HLA region for HLA imputation purposes. SNP genotypes were subjected to quality control using the Axiom Analysis Suite 3.0, and 856,419 markers passing quality metrics and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were selected for downstream analysis. All EXTEND samples were concordant for sex and yielded quality genome-wide SNP genotypes. The <italic toggle="yes">IL6R</italic> SNP rs2228145 was not included on the Axiom Precision Medicine array, and genotype was imputed from 2 SNPs, rs4129267 and rs61812598, that were in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2228145 (Dâ² 1.0, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sup>2</sup> 0.93â1.0) in all ancestries represented in the EXTEND participants.

                  <title>Analysis of clinical data.</title>
                  <p>The primary endpoint, 2-hour C-peptide mAUC, was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and dividing by the duration of the MMTT (120 minutes). For this computation, the âtime 0â C-peptide value was the average of C-peptide values measured at minutes â10 and 0. For âafter time 0â time points, actual time points were used (e.g., 14 minutes instead of the prescribed 15 minutes) in the calculation of mAUC. If a C-peptide measurement was below the lower limit of detection (LLD), Â½ the LLD was used.</p>
                  <p>The primary analysis of the primary endpoint used an ANCOVA model with change from screening to week 52 of the 2-hour C-peptide mAUC as the response and covariates of treatment, screening 2-hour C-peptide mAUC, and age. The primary analysis was done in the mITT sample on pediatric participants only. The mITT sample included randomized participants who received any study drug. For any participant who missed the week 52 MMTT assessment and whose last MMTT had at least 1 C-peptide result above the LLD, mAUC values were imputed using the estimates from a linear regression model with response of week 52 mAUC and covariates of age and mAUC at the most recent visit where mAUC was observed among participants in the same treatment arm. If all C-peptide time points from the most recent observed MMTT were below the LLD, then the last calculated mAUC was carried forward.</p>
                  <p>Secondary analyses for HbA1c and average insulin use per kilogram included ANCOVA models analogous to the primary analysis with no imputation for missing data. Furthermore, analogous ANCOVAs for C-peptide mAUC, HbA1c, and average insulin use per kilogram in adults and in the pooled cohort (pediatric and adult participants combined) were performed. In each age cohort and for each of C-peptide mAUC, HbA1c, and average insulin use per kilogram, mixed models using data from screening through week 52 were created. Covariates were treatment, study week ([MMTT assessment date â treatment start date]/7), age, treatment Ã study week, and age Ã study week. Random within-participant effects for intercept and slopes over time were included, and an unstructured covariance matrix was used. Fisherâs exact tests were used to compare the proportion of participants with a major hypoglycemic event through week 52, an infusion reaction, and hypersensitivity in each treatment group and age cohort.</p>
                  <p>For CGM data, summary statistics of mean, SD, coefficient of variation, and proportion of time in key ranges (&lt;54, 54 to &lt;70, &lt;70, 70â180, &gt;180 mg/dL) were calculated for each participant and visit. Sensor glucose values used in analysis came from the 2 weeks prior to a visit where at least 70% of the expected time points were available.</p>
                  <p>Minimal model analysis was used to calculate insulin sensitivity from the FSIVGTT results. For secondary and sensitivity efficacy analyses, corrections were not made for multiple comparisons. SAS version 9.4 was used for all analyses except for the FSIVGTT minimal model.</p>

                  <p>A target sample size of 78 pediatric participants was selected to detect a 39% improvement at week 52 in 2-hour C-peptide mAUC for tocilizumab over placebo using a 2:1 randomization with 80% power and a 2-sided test of significance at Î± = 0.05. This assumed a baseline C-peptide mAUC of 0.70 pmol/mL, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.22, a change of â0.31 pmol/mL in the placebo group, and a change of â0.158 pmol/mL in the treated group. Estimates of baseline mAUC, RMSE, and placebo group change came from 104 control group pediatric participants pooled from 5 new-onset T1D studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Treatment group comparisons for the DC subpopulations, %suppression CD25<sup>+</sup> of total CD4 at different Treg/Teff ratios, and serum IL-6 cytokines at a given visit, were performed using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA on log values, with baseline log values, visit, treatment, and visit Ã treatment as covariates. Treatment differences in the levels of IL-6R of total CD4, STAT3 phosphorylation in T cell subsets, and frequencies of Treg and Teff cell populations at each visit were analyzed with repeated measures 2-way ANOVA models on log values of fold change from baseline, controlling for visit, treatment, and visit Ã treatment. Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests were done for multiple-comparison adjustments. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

                <p>Percentage suppression of CD25 expression on Teff cells by Tregs. For all time points, Teff cells were cocultured with EF670-labeled Tregs and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Dynabeads (1:28 beads/Teff) for 48 hours. Four Treg/Teff ratios were tested: 1:4 (top left), 1:8 (top right), 1:16 (bottom left), and 1:32 (bottom right). For flow cytometry, Teff cells were in the EF670<sup>â</sup> gate and stained with anti-CD25 PE-Cy7. Percentage suppression was calculated as follows: <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> = ([<italic toggle="yes">a</italic> â <italic toggle="yes">b</italic>]/<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>) Ã 100, where <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> is the percentage CD25<sup>+</sup> in the absence of Tregs and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic> is the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> in the presence of Tregs. Data are represented as mean Â± SEM. There were no statistical differences between placebo and tocilizumab at any Treg/Teff ratio or any time point. Repeated measures 2-way ANOVA did not detect any statistically significant differences between the treatment groups at key time points.</p>
