                  <p>Elderly muscle seems less sensitive to the anabolic stimulus of a meal.
Changes in blood concentrations of leucine are suggested as one important trigger
of the anabolic response in muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether native whey protein, containing high amounts of leucine, may be a more
potent stimulator of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in elderly than regular whey
protein (WPC-80) or milk.</p>

                  <p>Participants received either 20 g of WPC-80 and native whey (n = 11) on

                  <p>Blood samples and muscle biopsies were collected to measure blood
concentrations of amino acids by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS),
phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 by immunoblotting and mixed muscle

                  <p>Native whey increased blood leucine concentrations more than WPC-80 (P &lt;
0.05), but not p70S6K phosphorylation or mixed muscle FSR. Both whey supplements
increased blood leucine concentrations (P &lt; 0.01) and P70S6K phosphorylation
more than milk (P = 0.014). Native whey reached higher mixed muscle FSR values
than milk (P = 0.026) 1-3h after exercise.</p>

                  <p>Despite greater increases in blood leucine concentrations than WPC-80 and
milk, native whey was only superior to milk concerning increases in MPS and
phosphorylation of P70S6K during a 5-hour post-exercise period in elderly
individuals.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Advancing age is accompanied by loss of muscle mass and strength. This condition
can proceed to sarcopenia, which is linked to loss of independent living
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>) and several comorbidities
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). The need to understand the causal
mechanisms of loss, and effects of interventions to counteract sarcopenia increases
with an increased aged population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>).
The loss of muscle mass must result from an imbalance between muscle protein
synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). Because fasting MPS has been
shown not to differ between young and old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>), focus has been on the response to the anabolic effect of
protein intake and resistance exercise in elderly. Several, but far from all,
studies have reported a reduced MPS response to protein ingestion and resistance
exercise in elderly compared to young, termed anabolic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Although the optimal post exercise protein
intake in order to maximally stimulate MPS remains to be identified it seems to be
somewhere between 20 and 40 g of high quality protein in young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) and increased with advancing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Reaching this higher protein intake may become
a challenge as appetite is often depressed in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). As a consequence, quality and the ability of a protein source
to stimulate MPS become more important in the elderly population. The anabolic
effect observed after protein intake is driven by the essential amino acids (EAA;
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) and especially leucine
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>)). Adding leucine to a suboptimal
protein dose can overcome the anabolic resistance and stimulate MPS in elderly to
the same levels as in young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Thus, a protein with higher
levels of leucine may allow for a greater stimulation of MPS when the protein dose
is suboptimal.</p>
              <p>Native whey protein is produced by filtration of unprocessed raw milk. This
production method leaves proteins intact and results in a higher leucine content
than other high quality proteins such as regular whey (WPC-80) and bovine milk.
WPC-80 is a sub-product of cheese production, during which it is chemically treated
and heated. WPC-80 is the most common protein used in protein supplements and is
often regarded as the gold standard of protein sources. The higher leucine content
may give native whey a greater MPS-stimulating ability than WPC-80. In addition, as
chemical and heat-treatment can render some amino acids unavailable for utilization
in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>) the more gentle
process of filtration may alter the physiological effects of native whey compared to
WPC-80 and milk. Earlier studies have shown beneficial effects of whey protein on
health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>) and soluble
(native) whey on muscular function in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). We have previously shown native whey to induce greater leucine
blood concentrations than WPC-80 and milk, in young participants after resistance
exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). Accordingly, we
hypothesize native whey would be a more potent stimulator of MPS than WPC-80 and
milk in elderly. The observation that studies combining protein supplementation and
resistance exercise report less anabolic resistance in elderly than either
intervention alone suggests this combination to be a promising approach in
preventing sarcopenia in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). We
therefore combined the protein intake with a bout of resistance exercise. This study
included elderly over the age of 70 years. As the loss of muscle mass and strength
is generally considered to accelerate after the age of 70 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>), interventions like the present may be most effective in this
age group.</p>
              <p>The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of post exercise
supplementation of WPC-80 or native whey on the acute (1-5 hours) MPS-response of
elderly participants. In addition, as a readily available high quality food source
of protein may be more preferable than supplements, we also compared the whey
proteins with similar amounts of bovine milk (1% fat).</p>

                <p>Twenty-two healthy, recreationally active elderly (+70 yrs) men and women were
included in the study (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 11
participants reported to be engaged in resistance exercise for an average 3 hours
per week. These participants were equally distributed between groups. All except
one participant reported recreational walking for an average of 2.5 hours per
week. One participant withdrew from the study due to illness before the start of
the experiment. All participants underwent a medical screening before entering the
study. To take part, participants had to be healthy and without any injuries to
the musculoskeletal system that could interfere with the exercise. Individuals
with lactose intolerance, milk allergy or using any dietary supplements were
excluded. Participants were nonsmokers with no cardiovascular disease. Two took
statins and three took medication for high blood pressure. The study was approved
by the Regional Ethics Committee for Medical and Health Research of South-East
Norway (2014/834/REK sørøst C) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All participants signed a written informed consent form before entering
the study.

                <p>This study was a double blinded, randomized, partial crossover, controlled
trial (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Each participant was
randomly assigned to one of two groups. The milk group did the protocol once,
whereas the whey group was exposed to the protocol two times, once consuming
WPC-80 and once consuming native whey, in a randomized order. The partial
crossover was chosen in order to have a stronger paired comparison between WPC-80
and native whey. Participants receiving WPC-80 or native whey had an average of 8
± 1.4 and 9 ± 1.6 days between experiments, respectively. After a standardized
breakfast participants performed a bout of highload leg-resistance exercise before
ingesting a drink containing 20 g of protein from milk, WPC-80 or native whey,
both immediately after and again 2 hours after exercise. The reason for giving two
servings of supplements was to avoid the large energy deficiency potentially
occurring during the later part of the 5-hour measurement period. Giving one 40 g
serving of supplement may have been enough to maximally stimulate MPS with all
supplements and thus disguise the effect of a higher quality of the whey
supplements. Blood samples were collected to measure concentrations of amino
acids, glucose, insulin, urea and creatine kinase (CK). MPS and related
intracellular signaling were measured during a 5-hour recovery period combining
biopsies and tracer infusion of [2H5] phenylalanine. In addition we measured
recovery of muscle force-generating capacity by maximal isometric voluntary
contractions (MVC) prior to, 10 min, 5.5 and 24 hours after exercise. The 24-hour
time point was chosen as we expected the participants to not be fully recovered by
this time and possible differences between groups to be evident. In addition time
of day variations in performance would not affect our results.</p>

dietitian conducted the recall interviews and analyzed dietary nutrient content
using the software Mat på Data 5.1 (Mattilsynet, Oslo, Norway, 2009). The
standardized breakfast was oatmeal with water, sugar and rapeseed oil, containing
25 kJ, 0.11 g of protein, 0.3 g of fat and 0.7 g of carbohydrates per kg body
mass. Participants were provided with a written individual diet plan (30 kcal/kg
and 1.3 g protein/kg per day) and pre-packaged food for the day before the
experiment, and for the rest of the experimental period (2.5 days with
standardized diet in total). Participants received dinner (salmon or meatballs,
Fjordland, Norway), cheese and Go`morgen yoghurt (Tine, Norway). Participants were
responsible for the remaining ingredients of the diet plan (whole grain bread,
butter, jam and fruits). In order to control for discrepancies between planned and
actual intake, participants registered their food intake.</p>

(Tine, Norway), lactose (Arla food ingredients, Denmark), and water was added to
WPC-80 and native whey (<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Drinks
were enriched with 6% [2H5] phenylalanine to avoid dilution plasma enrichment

were log-transformed prior to statistical analysis. All data are illustrated in
original form. Comparisons of WPC-80 with native whey were analyzed by one-way
repeated measures ANOVA. Comparisons with milk were made by a two-way ANOVA with
repeated measures (time x group). Tukey´s multiple comparisons test was used as a
post hoc test to specify the significant differences between groups and time
points. Comparisons between time points within groups were only made against the
pre-value and a Dunnett´s multiple comparison test was used as a post hoc test.
Subject characteristics and area under the curve differences between groups were
analyzed with a one-way non-repeated measure ANOVA. Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (r) was used to investigate relations between variables. Statistical
power was calculated using a standard deviation of 0.04 %/h, giving us an 80%
power to detect a true group mean difference of 0.024 %/h for the comparison
between native whey and WPC-80, and 0.053 %/h for the comparison between native
whey and milk with 10 participants in each group (StatMate, Graphpad Software, San

              <p>The present study tested the hypothesis that native whey would have a greater
acute anabolic effect on muscle than WPC-80, when supplemented as 20 g protein doses
immediately and two hours after resistance exercise in elderly individuals. We
observed no differences between WPC- 80 and native whey in the ability to stimulate
post exercise phosphorylation of P70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 or rates of MPS. <fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Mixed muscle FSR values following intake of milk, WPC- 80 and

exercise</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12603_2018_1105_Fig5_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p>
              <p>All supplements increased blood concentrations of amino acids, native whey more
so than WPC-80 for leucine, and the whey supplements more than milk for EAA, BCAA
and leucine. The observed changes in blood amino acids concentrations mirrored the
results from previous studies comparing whey proteins to casein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>) and milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The differences in blood concentrations of EAA and leucine
between the whey supplements and milk were smaller, and reached lower peak values
after the first serving in our elderly participants than previously observed in
young men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). This could be related
to altered digestion, absorption or a greater first pass splanchnic extraction of
protein in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). Still, the
combination of resistance exercise and supplementation was able to robustly increase
phosphorylation of P70S6K in the elderly participants reflecting the differences in
blood concentrations of leucine, BCAA and EAA on a group level.</p>
              <p>Phosphorylation of p70S6K was elevated with all supplements after exercise
(<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), and displayed the same
temporal pattern as previous studies supplementing with milk protein or EAA after
resistance exercise in elderly individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). We observed a
greater phosphorylation of p70S6K with native whey than milk and moderate positive
correlations between blood concentrations of leucine and p70S6K phosphorylation.
These data supports the central role of leucine in stimulating MPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Although we observed p70S6K phosphorylation
and the MPS response to be reflective of the leucine concentration in blood during
the early period, there were no correlations between MPS and leucine concentrations
in blood or p70S6K phosphorylation. Several factors might explain this: 1)
Regulation of MPS is complex and involves several pathways and kinases.
Investigating a few of these is likely to give an incomplete picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>), 2) The relationship between p70S6K and MPS is
not necessarily linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>), 3) A
factual correlation between the “snap-shot” nature of the biopsy for western
blotting and the prolonged measurement of MPS may easily be missed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>).</p>
              <p>Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was delayed relative to the peak MPS response
(<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Still, the time course of
4E-BP1- phosphorylation is similar to that reported in previous studies
investigating protein ingestion and resistance exercise in young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>) and elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>).
In contrast to previous studies in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>) we did not observe a decreased phosphorylation of eEF-2 in
response to resistance exercise and protein ingestion (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, studies in young have reported no change in
eEF-2 phosphorylation in response to resistance exercise and protein ingestion
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). Being substrates of mTORC1,
phosphorylation of p70S6K, 4E-BP1 and eEF-2 are expected to correspond. However,
differences in the timing of signaling events between these kinases, input from
other pathways and sensitivity towards different anabolic stimuli may complicate
this picture. In contrast to p70S6K, 4E-BP1 does not respond to rapamycin treatment
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>), which is thought to inhibit the
growth factor and amino acid response of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>). Thus, 4E-BP1 may not be as responsive to leucine as p70S6K, as
our results would suggest.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that in contrast to young participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) ingestion of 20 g whey protein seem to be
suboptimal for maximal stimulation of MPS in elderly, both at rest and after
unilateral leg resistance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>).
Further, adding 4.5 g of leucine to a suboptimal dose of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>) or 2.5 g of leucine to 20 g of casein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) enhanced the MPS-response in elderly. In the
current study we observed no difference in post exercise MPS with native whey
compared to WPC-80 in elderly participants. This may relate to the difference in
leucine content between the supplements. In the current study, native whey contained
only 0.6 g leucine more than WPC-80 per serving (1.2 g in total), which is
considerably less than in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>).
Alternatively, a saturation of the MPS-response could lead to similar results with
WPC-80 and native whey. In light of previous studies showing a dose response to whey
protein in elderly at least up to 40 g after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>), we believe this to be unlikely. Thus, this
study suggests that the dose of leucine added to a suboptimal dose of whey protein
should be greater than 0.6 g per serving in order to have an effect on MPS in
elderly. A small increase in the difference in leucine content between milk and
native whey (0.86 g per serving) did lead to a difference in MPS-response. However,
this difference may also be the result, at least in part, of other factors such as
rate of absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>WPC-80 did not increase significantly from baseline in the early period.
However, based on the values obtained and previous studies supplementing with whey
protein in elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>) this seems to be a matter of low statistical
power.</p>
              <p>Native whey reached higher MPS rates than milk during the early (1-3h), and
total period (1-5h). This is in agreement with previous studies in young
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>) and elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>) individuals comparing casein (making up 80% of
protein in milk) and whey supplementation after resistance exercise. Thus, ingestion
of native whey protein in combination with resistance training may be advantageous
compared to casein or milk in terms of combating sarcopenia. Long-term studies are
needed to answer this hypothesis.</p>
              <p>Although milk is considered a high quality protein source, we observed no
stimulatory effect of milk on post exercise MPS in elderly participants. This may
relate to anabolic resistance in our elderly participants. However, similar
responses have been reported in response to 22 g of micellar casein, in young
individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>). The concept of
anabolic resistance to protein intake and resistance exercise in elderly is complex,
and in need of further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the anabolic resistance in elderly
primarily manifests itself only when a suboptimal stimulus is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Thus, young should respond to lower training
volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>) and doses of protein than
elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). On the contrary, if the
stimuli are strong enough or combined, elderly would reach the same MPS responses as
young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). In the current study, we applied a relatively
large training volume for the legs and 2 x 20 g of high quality protein in all
groups. However, no significant effects were observed on MPS for milk or WPC-80 in
the early period, or any of the supplements in the late period. We hypothesize that
combining the two suboptimal 20 g servings into one potentially optimal serving of
40 g of protein would have elicited a greater effect on MPS over the total period.
The standardized breakfast may also have contributed to slightly elevated MPS-rates
in the baseline period, thus making it harder to observe a difference between
baseline and post exercise periods.</p>
              <p>We observed an 8-35% reduction in force-generating capacity measured 10 min
after the workout. Together with the small increases in blood CK levels, this
suggests mild to moderate muscular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). The small differences in MPS during the first hours after
exercise did not lead to a measurable difference in recovery of force-generating
capacity at 24 hours after exercise.</p>
              <p>We were unfortunately not able to measure MPB in this study. Earlier studies in
young individuals have found MPS to respond with greater changes than MPB
(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>). We therefore assume that our MPS measurements reflect the
major part of the net protein balance response to protein supplements after
resistance exercise. There was a larger part of women in the native whey group, but
we did not observe any significant sex differences for the measured variables. As
our participants were healthy and active our results are not necessarily
representative of the sedate and less healthy group of elderly, a group in which the
need for interventions might be greater.</p>
              <p>Future studies should investigate if the acute differences observed between
native whey and milk are evident during a training and supplementation intervention,
and whether functional capacity can be improved by supplementation.</p>

native whey and WPC- 80 in stimulating the phosphorylation p70S6K, eEF-2 and 4E-BP1

to further stimulate MPS by adding leucine to a suboptimal dose of whey protein in
