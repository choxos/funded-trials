                <p>Efforts to develop a range of HIV prevention products that can serve as behaviorally congruent viable alternatives to consistent condom use and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remain crucial. MTN-035 was a randomized crossover trial seeking to evaluate the safety, acceptability, and adherence to three placebo modalities (insert, suppository, enema) prior to receptive anal intercourse (RAI). If participants had no RAI in a week, they were asked to use their assigned product without sex. We hypothesized that the modalities would be acceptable and safe for use prior to RAI, and that participants would report high adherence given their behavioral congruence with cleansing practices (e.g., douches and/or enemas) and their existing use to deliver medications (e.g., suppositories; fast-dissolving inserts) via the rectum. Participants (N = 217) were sexual and gender minorities enrolled in five different countries (Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States of America). Mean age was 24.9 years (range 18–35 years). 204 adverse events were reported by 98 participants (45.2%); 37 (18.1%) were deemed related to the study products. The proportion of participants reporting “high acceptability” was 72% (95%CI: 65% - 78%) for inserts, 66% (95%CI: 59% - 73%) for suppositories, and 73% (95%CI: 66% - 79%) for enemas. The proportion of participants reporting fully adherent per protocol (i.e., at least one use per week) was 75% (95%CI: 69% - 81%) for inserts, 74% (95%CI: 68% - 80%) for suppositories, and 83% (95%CI: 77% - 88%) for enemas. Participants fully adherent per RAI-act was similar among the three products: insert (n = 99; 58.9%), suppository (n = 101; 58.0%) and enema (n = 107; 58.8%). The efficacy and effectiveness of emerging HIV prevention drug depends on safe and acceptable delivery modalities that are easy to use consistently. Our findings demonstrate the safety and acceptability of, and adherence to, enemas, inserts, and suppositories as potential modalities through which to deliver a rectal microbicide.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The HIV epidemic has affected people across the globe over the past four decades, with sexual and gender minorities (SGM; i.e., populations with same-sex or same-gender attractions or behaviors and who may identify with a non-heterosexual identity such as gay, bisexual, queer, etc.)carrying much of the burden of new diagnoses [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While HIV prevalence rates vary among SGM in different regions (4% sub-Saharan Africa, 32% South East Asia, 44% South America, and 55% North America), the risk of acquiring HIV is 28 times higher among men who have sex with men (MSM) than adult men and 14 times higher for transgender people when compared to adult women [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Innovative biomedical advancements across the HIV prevention continuum (e.g., HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) have offered new opportunities to curtail HIV incidence [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], yet new HIV infections have remained high globally due to acceptability, access, uptake, and adherence challenges to these highly effective biomedical prevention tools [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Optimal uptake and adherence to PrEP has been hindered further by financial barriers and social stigma [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], challenges accessing inclusive and sustained HIV prevention services [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or concerns regarding the possible side effects of systemic delivery of PrEP [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, efforts to develop a range of HIV prevention products that can serve as viable alternatives and/or complements to consistent condom use and oral PrEP, including formulations able to deliver multiple drugs (e.g., anti-HIV-1 and anti-HSV-2) in combination, remain crucial.</p>
              <p>Researchers and advocates have proposed expanding modalities of PrEP delivery, including the use of rectal microbicides (RMs); topical biomedical products being developed to reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for use with sexual activity [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If found to be safe and effective, RMs may offer an episodic prevention modality for individuals who would perceive a pericoital prevention strategy more feasible and preferable to systemic daily or on demand oral PrEP modalities [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a randomized, cross-over trial comparing daily oral PrEP to two regimens (daily use and event-driven) of a rectal microbicide gel candidate, MSM and transgender women varied in their preferred strategy after using the products [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], with nearly 30% of the sample rating daily oral PrEP as the least preferred prevention method. Twenty percent of participants preferred an event-driven rectal microbicide strategy when engaging in condomless anal sex. Therefore, it is crucial for RMs to be designed so that they can be delivered via mechanisms that not only deliver enough drug to block HIV/STI transmission but are also a good behavioral fit with the intended end-users based on their lifestyles.</p>
              <p>Most rectal microbicide candidates have been formulated as gels because of their similarities to lubricants, highlighting the potential for the rectal microbicide gel to be readily incorporated into users’ sexual practices [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While ideal from a behavioral congruence perspective, these gel formulations have required the use of an applicator to achieve sufficient drug delivery, which could present acceptability and adherence challenges for long-term uses [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], At this time, it is unclear if topical gels would be able to deliver protective levels of HIV prevention drugs when used without an applicator [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As such, researchers and advocates have argued that other rectal delivery modalities should be considered, including suppositories, fast-dissolving inserts, and enemas [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p>Survey research with SGM populations across various countries has found high hypothetical acceptability to a rectal microbicide formulated as a suppository, insert, or enema [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. while promising, the hypothetical nature of these studies limits our ability to understand whether SGM populations would find these modalities acceptable after using them with their partners prior to receptive anal intercourse (rai), and whether they would consistently use them when engaging in rai. to date, few studies with SGM populations have examined the acceptability, uptake of, and adherence to inserts, suppositories, or enemas as a rectal microbicide modality to be used prior to sex [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. in a randomized, crossover acceptability trial where HIV-negative MSM used both 35 ml of placebo gel and an 8g placebo suppository prior to three rai occasions, respectively, participants noted moderate acceptability for the suppository, with the greatest proportion of participants preferring the gel over the suppository [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. two clinical trials are examining the acceptability of rectal microbicide candidates as a fast-dissolving insert (mtn 039; nct04047420) and an enema (dream; nct04016233) for use among SGM populations, yet the results of these trials have yet to be released. moreover, no study has examined these modalities within the same trial, limiting our ability to compare their acceptability, safety, and adherence among SGM individuals who have used all three products rectally prior to rai. therefore, with the goal of supporting the development of behaviorally congruent rectal microbicide modalities for topical PrEP delivery, the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) developed MTN-035 (DESIRE; Developing and Evaluating Short-Acting Innovations for Rectal Use) to identify acceptable modalities among SGM in five different countries: Malawi, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States of America.</p>
              <p>The primary objectives of MTN-035 were to evaluate the acceptability and safety of and adherence to three placebo modalities–an insert, a suppository, and an enema–that could be used prior to RAI in a randomized, cross-over trial. We hypothesized that all three modalities would be acceptable and safe for use prior to RAI, and that SGM participants would report high adherence to these modalities given their behavioral congruence with cleansing practices (e.g., enemas) and their familiar use to deliver medications (e.g., suppositories; fast-dissolving inserts) via the rectum.</p>

                <p>Participants were recruited from a variety of sources, including outpatient clinics, universities, community-based locations, online websites, and social networking applications. In addition, participants were also referred to the study from other local research projects, research registries and other health and social service providers. At some sites, prospective participants were pre-screened by phone, using an IRB-approved phone script, to assess presumptive eligibility based on select behavioral and medical eligibility requirements. This includes a review of the prospective participants’ sexual history and engagement in receptive anal sex in their lifetime and within the previous three months. For those deemed presumably eligible when a phone screen was conducted, a screening visit was scheduled. A re- affirmation of all eligibility criteria was obtained and confirmed during a formal screening and enrollment visit, described below.</p>

                <p>Our primary safety endpoint was defined as the presence of a Grade 2 or higher related adverse events (AEs) as defined by the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017 and Addenda 1, 2 and 3 (Female Genital [Dated November 2007], Male Genital [Dated November 2007] and Rectal [Clarification dated May 2012] Grading Tables for Use in Microbicide Studies [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>

                <title>Primary acceptability endpoint</title>
                <p>Acceptability endpoints were based on participants’ responses to the CASI for each product at their respective product use end visits (Visits 3, 5 and 7). Using a 10-point scale (1 = Very Unlikely; 10 = Very Likely), participants were asked to answer the following question about their most recently used product: “Think about the positive and negative experiences you have had using the [study product] during the past 4-week period. If this [study product] was available and it provided some protection against HIV, how likely would you be to use it before receptive anal sex?”. The endpoint was operationalized as binary, with scores 1 to 6 grouped as “low acceptability” and scores 7 to 10 as “high acceptability”.</p>

                <title>Primary adherence endpoints</title>
                <p>Adherence to use of each assigned product, as per-protocol, was based on the number of weeks that a participant missed using an assigned product (0 to 4 weeks), using a given product use end visit CASI assessment: “The following questions refer to your use of the study provided rectal [study product: enema, insert or suppository] over the past 4 weeks. You were asked to insert the study provided rectal [study product] in your rectum at least once a week during the past 4 weeks. However, for different reasons, people might have encountered difficulties using the [study product]. Thinking about your experience during these past four weeks, in how many of the weeks did you miss a rectal [study product] application?”. The adherence per-protocol was operationalized as binary, with participants who reported not having missed any application classified as “adherent”.</p>
                <p>Additionally, adherence per RAI-act was defined (for participant-periods with at least one RAI act was reported) as the proportion of times that participants reported having used the study-provided enema, insert or suppository before RAI. We determined adherence per RAI act by dividing participants’ responses to their CASI assessments regarding the number of times a participant noted using the study product before RAI by the total number of RAI acts self-reported over the same 4-week period. Participants are classified as fully adherent per RAI-act if they reported using the study product for all reported RAI acts.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>There is no control group for comparison in this study. The main goal was not to compare between the three different placebo modalities, but to obtain overall rates of acceptability, adherence, and safety of each modality. The selected sample size provides at least 90% power to rule out rates of acceptability or adherence below 70%.</p>
                <p>Baseline characteristics are described for all enrolled participants. The study’s safety endpoint was evaluated among participants who received at least one of the study products (excluding any study periods when participants did not receive a product). The acceptability and adherence primary endpoints were evaluated among participants who received all three study products and completed the scheduled product use (which we refer to as the “per-protocol” subset), thus providing relevant data from all three periods of study. To support the generalizability of acceptability and adherence results, we compared baseline characteristics between participants in the per-protocol subset and those who were lost to follow-up.</p>
                <p>For the safety endpoint, the proportion of participants with Grade 2 or higher related AEs is reported, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) (Clopper-Pearson method). For adherence and acceptability endpoints, the proportion of participants classified as adherent, or who reported a high acceptability score, are also provided, along with 95% CIs.</p>
                <p>To test for potential effects of the assigned sequence and/or sites in the overall acceptability and adherence, generalized linear mixed models with a logistic link function were used. The participant’s assigned sequence, site, and the modality used in the study period were included as fixed effects, with a random effect at the participant level to account for the cross-over design. To test if overall differences exist between sites or assigned sequences, omnibus likelihood ratio tests were used. No adjustment of p-values was performed.</p>

                <p>We screened 257 individuals across the seven study sites and enrolled 217 participants in five countries; 40 were not enrolled: 29 were not eligible, five were eligible but did not enroll, and six did not complete their screening (see <xref rid="pone.0284339.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Overall, the retention rates were above 90% for all study visits.</p>
                <p>The mean age was 24.9 years (SD = 4.7), ranging from 18 to 35 years old. Most of the sample reported having a male sex indicator assigned at birth (n = 214; 99%). Twenty percent of the sample identified as a gender minority. Overall, 13 (14%) participants in the U.S sites identified as Hispanic/Latinx.

Two thirds of participants (n = 142; 65.4%) reported prior use of an enema, with fewer participants self-reporting that they had used a suppository (n = 8; 3.7%) or insert (n = 10; 4.6%) prior to RAI.</p>

                <p>A study product use period was considered completed if the participant received the study product and completed the scheduled study product use period. Study product use period completion rates were 94% for the insert, 95% for the suppository, and 95% for the enema. Among enrolled participants, 92% exited the study at their scheduled end of study visit. Reasons for early study terminations included “Participant refused further participation” [n = 2 (1%)], “Participant is unwilling/unable to comply with required procedures” [n = 6 (3%)], “Lost to follow-up” [n = 4 (2%)], “Investigator decision” [n = 1 (&lt;1%)], “Unable to contact participant” [n = 3 (1%)], “HIV infection” [n = 1 (&lt;1%)], and “Other, specify” [n = 1 (&lt;1%), participant relocating].</p>

One hundred sixty-seven (81.9%) were classified as not related to the study products, and the remaining 37 (18.1%) were classified as related to the study products and occurred in 24 (11.1%) of participants. Thirty-five product-related AEs were graded as mild; two were graded as moderate (our primary safety endpoint) and both occurred during periods of insert use. Product-related AEs included abdominal distention (n = 1), abdominal pain (n = 5), anal pruritus (graded as moderate, n = 1), anorectal discomfort (n = 7), constipation (n = 1), defecation urgency (n = 3), diarrhoea (n = 4), dyschezia (n = 1), flatulence (n = 6), nausea (n = 1), rectal haemorrhage (n = 1), rectal tenesmus (n = 4), and malaise (n = 2, one graded as moderate). No events were graded as potentially life-threatening or resulting in death. There were no pregnancies reported by participants in this study. Two participants tested positive for HIV infection during follow-up while enrolled in the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>RMs are needed for individuals with an increased chance of acquiring HIV through RAI, particularly young SGM across the globe [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Given ongoing challenges to ensure equitable uptake and adherence to systemic oral PrEP and the desire for a diverse suite of HIV prevention products, it is important to expand the HIV/STI prevention pipeline by exploring whether different types of products that could be delivered through various modalities are safe, acceptable and adherable, and behaviorally congruent with the intended end-users’ RAI practices [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>All three administration modalities with placebo products were found to be safe for use, with less than 20% of AEs deemed related to the study products/modalities and only two related events being graded as having moderate clinical severity or higher. These findings align with our study hypothesis. The safety profile of all three administration modalities with placebo products is promising and underscores the potential of all three modalities as viable for rectal drug delivery. The low incidence of distinct product-related AEs (e.g., diarrhea, flatulence) across study products is also noteworthy, as it mirrors common AEs reported when using over-the-counter rectal products (e.g., enemas) and prior rectal microbicide candidates in clinical trials (e.g., gels). while we should continue to reduce the occurrence of any AEs during product development, the promising safety profiles for the three modalities using placebo products employed in this trial offer a threshold whereby future clinical trials examining these same modalities with active drug ingredients can benchmark their safety endpoints.</p>
              <p>Consistent with our hypotheses for our acceptability and adherence endpoints, SGM participants reported high overall acceptability for all three products and high overall adherence per protocol and per RAI act. While survey research literature has noted high hypothetical acceptability to RMs as an HIV prevention strategy prior to RAI [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], there has been limited research exploring the real-world acceptability and adherence of these three products. The absence of these data is troubling from a product development perspective given the increasingly restrictive costs and resources required to empirically evaluate a promising biomedical HIV prevention candidate. In the absence of product acceptability and adherence data, the effectiveness of a PrEP candidate may be compromised if the intended end-users are not willing to use it. Future research examining the acceptability of and adherence to diverse PrEP candidates should remain a priority in clinical trials.</p>
              <p>While overall acceptability and adherence were high for each product, we observed differences in acceptability and adherence after SGM participants had used all three modalities. While the products were rated similarly in their acceptability and there were no differences based on participants’ assigned product sequence, adherence to the enema was higher when compared to the fast-dissolving insert or the suppository. Given the high prevalence of rectal douching prior to RAI among SGM globally [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the greater adherence to the enema may be indicative of congruence between the benefits afforded by the modality and users’ behavioral practices prior to RAI. In a recent study, for instance, Carballo-Diéguez and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that over 80% of SGM participants reported douching prior to RAI to rinse their rectum and feel clean, avoid smelling bad, and/or enhance their sexual pleasure. Given the limited data on the use of inserts or suppositories by SGM populations, however, it is unclear if these products could also yield behaviorally congruent benefits prior to or during RAI, including increasing sexual pleasure and lubricity during sex, and result in greater adherence in future studies.</p>
              <p>We also observed differences for both acceptability and adherence between participants living in the different communities across the five countries participating in the trial. Compared to San Francisco, participants in the other regions reported greater acceptability of the three rectal modalities under study. Consistent with prior research with hypothetical and real-world studies with rectal candidates [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0284339.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], these regional variations suggest that some modalities may be more acceptable or adherable in some contexts than others. It is possible that this difference in acceptability may be related to the various efficacious PrEP modalities already available in San Francisco (e.g., daily, and event-driven oral PrEP) and which may not be available or accessible in other regions. As such, participants in the San Francisco site may weigh acceptability differently given their ability to compare these placebo modalities against efficacious PrEP technologies. We also found differential adherence between participants in the San Francisco and the Johannesburg sites; however, it is unclear what may have contributed to these differences. Although the collected data suggests differences by sites, future research, both qualitative and quantitative, may be warranted given the number of comparisons and the absence of clear hypotheses to understand the factors contributing to these differences.</p>

                <title>Strengths &amp; limitations</title>
                <p>This study had several strengths. First, this is the first study to examine the safety and acceptability of and adherence to these three promising modalities for rectal drug delivery prior to RAI. Examining each product’s use in real life contexts strengthens the social validity of our findings and the potential use for these three modes of delivery in the future. Second, the crossover randomized design of our trial allowed us to assess SGM participants’ acceptability of and adherence to these three modalities within the same trial, offering a unique opportunity to compare their acceptability, safety, and adherence within individuals who used all three products prior to RAI. Third, given the variability in both legal protections and social acceptance of SGM people between and within these countries, our ability to recruit and retain a large sample of young SGM living in geographically and socio-politically diverse countries is noteworthy and strengthens the generalizability of our findings to diverse contexts. Finally, our efforts to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during our data collection period minimized interruptions to our trial and ensured that rigor was preserved [<xref rid="pone.0284339.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, our trial also had several limitations. First, self-reported responses tend to be favorable due to social desirability; however, we tried to minimize bias by having participants complete their questionnaires in a private location during their clinical visits. Second, there is a possibility of recall bias when participants completed their surveys. Third, we recruited a convenience sample of participants willing to use each of the study products at least once per week, as required by the protocol. We acknowledge that the generalizability of our clinical trial findings may not be representative of all individuals practicing RAI. Fourth, given the placebo nature of the three products used in our trial, we were unable to employ a biological confirmation method regarding participants’ product use and adherence, or examine the extent and duration of rectal coverage afforded by each product during and after sex. These data will be crucial in the future, particularly as drug candidates are embedded into these modalities and tested for safety and adherence. Fifth, we were unable to recruit the sexual partners of our study participants. Given existing data regarding partners’ roles in young SGMs’ decision-making when selecting HIV prevention strategies prior to sex, future research examining these dyadic dynamics may be warranted. Finally, while we designed our clinical trial to resemble participants’ product use to as close as ‘real-world’ settings possible while maintaining rigor, we acknowledge that the trial protocols may hinder the social validity of the findings. Future research examining these products in real-world situations may further clarify their potential for use as rectal microbicide modalities.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Advances in biomedical strategies for HIV prevention continue to emerge. Efforts to diversify HIV prevention options will strengthen our ability to reduce new HIV infections among SGM, whether some SGM desire systemic modalities (e.g., daily oral PrEP; PrEP injectables) or prefer topical protection (e.g., RMs). Regardless of the mode of administration, the effectiveness of these HIV prevention strategies will require that users have access to safe and acceptable products which are easy to use consistently. Our trial addresses the limited data available regarding the safety and acceptability of and adherence to enemas, inserts, and suppositories as potential modalities through which to deliver a rectal microbicide. findings from this trial demonstrate high safety profiles, alongside high levels of acceptability and adherence, among all three modalities. future research examining the acceptability, adherence, safety, and efficacy of promising prep candidates using these three rectal microbicide modalities is encouraged.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Bauermeister,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>

              <p>Overall, the reviewers have expressed their congratulations on the quality of the manuscript and have offered several suggestions to further enhance the study methodology. In particular, they have noted that the study population and eligibility criteria were not described in enough detail to allow for replication of the study. As a result, the reviewers have raised concerns about the generalizability of the results. The full details of their comments may be seen below.</p>
              <p>Could you please revise the manuscript to carefully address the concerns raised?</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This paper summarized the results of a RCT to assess acceptability and adherence to three methods for self-administering rectal microbicide PrEP for the prevention of HIV transmission via receptive anal sex. The paper is thorough in its description of methods and well written. I mostly have minor comments and points of clarification.</p>

              <p>Eligibility criteria: How was "general good health" assessed?</p>
              <p>This is more editorial, but there are a number of unusual acronyms (e.g., RM, PUEV) that reduce readability.</p>

              <p>Page 14: First paragraph under Study Product Use Period Completion: In one instance n = 1 is reported as 1%, in another n = 1 is reported as &lt;1%.</p>
              <p>Logistic mixed model results: There is a substantial difference in acceptability in the methods based on the point estimates here that is not clear in the raw estimates of acceptability. The authors address possible reasons for differences in acceptability by site in the discussion, but the models account for site. The confidence intervals are relatively wide, as well. Was the study powered for these analyses? Additional discussion about these points is warranted.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This study aimed to evaluate the safety, acceptability and adherence of three rectal microbicide placebo formulations for young sexual and gender minorities who engage in receptive anal intercourse. It is important to develop effective products such as these to complement currently available products such as oral PrEP and condoms. The paper is well written and detailed. However I do have some issues to raise.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>1. It would help to have more detailed characterisation of the study population. The cross-over procedure is explained in great detail, but the population is referred to as “sexual and gender minorities” without really explaining this, and the baseline characteristics table does not give sufficient detail either, only including gender and sex at birth, but not information such as MSM status or frequency of RAI practice.</p>
              <p>2. The compliance is extremely high, given the number of visits required, the number of invasive procedures and that at least some of the study was conducted during the pandemic. I would like to see further detail of how this was achieved, and even more importantly, how generalisable are these results? I can’t imagine that the study participants are representative of all those who practise RAI, or even “sexual and general minorities” populations specifically. I imagine acceptability and adherence would be considerably lower in populations less able to commit to the study schedule. Related to this, I feel that the recruitment procedure is skimmed over. How were individuals currently practising RAI targeted? So few individuals were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. One inclusion criterion is “a reported history of consensual RAI at least three times in the past three months”? How was that ascertained without administering some kind of pre-recruitment questionnaire as part of the screening process?</p>
              <p>3. It’s important to set out differences in results by setting more clearly. The authors provide odds ratios in Table 5 but no acceptability/adherence percentages stratified by setting. It’s important to understand how much acceptability and adherence vary by setting, so we have an idea how generalisable results may be between settings for future studies.</p>
              <p>4. The abstract doesn’t seem to talk about any differences in outcomes between the three products, even though the results showed that the enema had a higher adherence than the other products.</p>
              <p>5. Limitations section of Discussion: I think this should be extended. Following on from point 3 re generalisability, I think authors should comment on other populations practising RAI such as heterosexual women. The study population here was almost universally individuals born male. Participants were instructed on how to use the products and first used them in the clinic – is there any comment on potential for misuse of products if users are provided with written instructions only/guidance videos etc? Authors talk about “real-world acceptability” but the conditions in this study are very far from how such products would be used in a real-world situation. Are they really reaching the “intended end-users”? Authors mention social desirability bias but was there risk of recall bias (top page 12: “Thinking about your experience during these past four weeks, in how many of the weeks did you miss a rectal [study product] application?”?</p>
              <p>6. Any study such as this, evaluating acceptability, cries out for a mixed methods design. This study really suffers from having no qualitative research component to start to understand and interpret the quantitative outcomes. Additionally, at the many clinic visits, there would have been opportunity to ask pertinent closed and open-ended questions. Instead, there is quite a lot of conjecture in the Discussion which could have been answered with better questionnaire design e.g., enema use and user’s practices prior to RAI. Authors could have asked participants about these practices. Authors also mention that San Francisco-based participants may already have access to other PrEP products which may be responsible for the differences in acceptability by setting. One of the study questionnaires could have asked about this. This weakness needs to be acknowledged in the Limitations section.</p>
              <p>7. I wanted to see a lot more detail on RAI activity, including how many weeks participants reported no RAI. I’d have liked to see this in a table with frequency of RAI activity by baseline characteristics.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>1. There are quite a few abbreviations that I wouldn’t consider necessary such as AEs, RMs, SGM and PUEVs.</p>
              <p>2. Figure 1 refers to “douche” rather than “enema”. It also seems overly complicated.</p>
              <p>3. Abstract: it may be clearer if the abstract was structured (IMRAD format). “204 adverse events were reported by 98 participants” – provide percentage of participants reporting at least one adverse event.</p>
              <p>4. “The efficacy and effectiveness of emerging HIV prevention drug depends” – shouldn’t this be “HIV prevention products depend”?</p>
              <p>5. Introduction line 4: provide references for HIV prevalence by region statistics.</p>
              <p>6. Introduction paragraph 1 last sentence: shouldn’t it be “drugs targeting multiple STIs” rather than “multiple drugs”?</p>
              <p>7. Page 5 last sentence: any references at all for the “few studies with SGM populations have examined the acceptability, uptake of, and adherence to inserts, suppositories, or enemas”?</p>
              <p>8. The countries included should be stated in the abstract.</p>
              <p>9. First line of page 7: this should really be in the Results section.</p>
              <p>10. Figure 1 seems overly detailed, and there’s a lot of overlap with Table 1 – they can probably be combined. I think it should show the 1 week wash-out period in some way.</p>
              <p>11. Jacobson et al are mentioned (top page 11): please describe more about the overlap between papers and what further information Jacobson et al provides that would be useful to the reader when interpreting this paper.</p>
              <p>12. Adherence per sex act (page 16): shouldn’t this be referring to “per RAI act” rather than just “per sex act”?</p>
              <p>13. Discussion Strengths and Limitations paragraph 2: provide percentages for adherence per protocol and per sex act, and then the percentages for hypothetical acceptability reported by all the other studies that are cited, for comparison.</p>
              <p>14. Page 18 first sentence: “users’ behavioural practices prior to sex” – should be “prior to RAI”. Authors should be careful about these distinctions throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>15. Table 2 row headers: add country for each setting.</p>
              <p>16. Table 2 states that 100% of Blantyre participants were “Other African tribe” ethnicity. Surely, as 100% of participants from this site were from this one group, this could be more specific?</p>
              <p>17. Table 4 label “95% Confidence Interval” doesn’t seem quite right, as there’s a central estimate then 95%CI in brackets.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a generally well-conducted study. There are some aspects of the reporting that could be improved. In particular, I would recommend that the authors adhere to the CONSORT guidelines. For example, the first paragraph under "methods" reports results, which should be in the results section. Instead they could have began by describing the study design, followed by eligibility, study procedures, and outcomes. One key element which is completely omitted is how the study sample size was determined - this should be reported. The statistical analysis seems mostly okay; one minor suggestion is to report standard errors instead of standard deviations in the analysis of "adherence per-sex-act" (but keep standard deviations elsewhere where they have been reported for descriptive purposes).</p>

              <p>Reviewer 1</p>
              <p>This paper summarized the results of a RCT to assess acceptability and adherence to three methods for self-administering rectal microbicide PrEP for the prevention of HIV transmission via receptive anal sex. The paper is thorough in its description of methods and well written. I mostly have minor comments and points of clarification.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We have clarified the points raised below.</p>
              <p>Eligibility criteria. What does "ability and willingness to provide adequate locator information" mean? How was "general good health" assessed?</p>
              <p>• We appreciate the Reviewer catching the typo on our inclusion criteria. We now clarify that participants had to be able and willing to provide “adequate contact and location information”. We also clarify that they had to be “deemed in general good health by a healthcare provider at Screening and Enrollment”.</p>
              <p>Acronyms. This is more editorial, but there are a number of unusual acronyms (e.g., RM, PUEV) that reduce readability.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We have reduced abbreviations (i.e., RM and PUEV) to improve readability wherever possible.</p>
              <p>Prevalence. Page 14: First paragraph under Study Product Use Period Completion: In one instance n = 1 is reported as 1%, in another n = 1 is reported as &lt;1%.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We should have used &lt;1%. This was updated in our revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>Logistic mixed model results: There is a substantial difference in acceptability in the methods based on the point estimates here that is not clear in the raw estimates of acceptability. The authors address possible reasons for differences in acceptability by site in the discussion, but the models account for site. The confidence intervals are relatively wide, as well. Was the study powered for these analyses? Additional discussion about these points is warranted.</p>
              <p>• We would like to address the apparent difference in acceptability from the logistic model relative to raw estimates. Although raw estimates of the Odds Ratios (OR) are not provided in the manuscript, they are in fact not very different from those obtained from the adjust logistic model: </p>
              <p>OR(Insert vs Enema) = [0.72/(1-0.72)]/[0.73/(1-0.73)] = 0.95 (Adjusted OR = 0.97)</p>
              <p>OR(Suppositories vs Enema) = [0.66/(1-0.66)]/[0.73/(1-0.73)] = 0.72 (Adjusted OR = 0.69)</p>
              <p>We hope that the reviewer will agree that is the use of a different scale (odds ratio) what gives the impression of a more substantial difference between some of the modalities, rather than it being a consequence of including adjustment of other factors in the logistic model. That said, we would like to clarify that the principal objective of the study was not to compare the different modalities, but to evaluate the acceptability and adherence of each one and to provide estimates. While the sample size of the study allowed for high power for ruling out acceptability/adherence rates below 70%, the study was not powered for formal comparisons between modalities. The logistic regression model analysis was performed to test for any potential differences by randomize sequence (to check for possible effect of the order in which participants used the products, or possible carry-over effect), and (ii) to test for the differences observed between sites. While we think it reasonable to include the study product in these models (which in turns allowed us to make some statements regarding some of the differences being statistically significant), we acknowledge that failing to declare some of the differences as significant does not imply the absence of such differences. To avoid confusion, the Statistical Analysis section of the Methods has been updated to clarify the main objective of the study. We have also removed some statements previously included in the Results section, which probably unduly emphasized these statistical tests.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2</p>
              <p>This study aimed to evaluate the safety, acceptability and adherence of three rectal microbicide placebo formulations for young sexual and gender minorities who engage in receptive anal intercourse. It is important to develop effective products such as these to complement currently available products such as oral PrEP and condoms. The paper is well written and detailed. However I do have some issues to raise.</p>
              <p>• Thank you for your review. We respond to the points raised below, as well as in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Description of the study population. It would help to have more detailed characterisation of the study population. The cross-over procedure is explained in great detail, but the population is referred to as “sexual and gender minorities” without really explaining this, and the baseline characteristics table does not give sufficient detail either, only including gender and sex at birth, but not information such as MSM status or frequency of RAI practice.</p>
              <p>• We have now provided a definition of sexual gender minorities (i.e., populations with same-sex or same-gender attractions or behaviors and who may identify with a non-heterosexual identity such as gay, bisexual, queer, etc.) in the Introduction.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We note that the sample’s baseline sexual behaviors as part of their Inclusion criteria (i.e., individuals self-report engaging in consensual receptive anal sex at least three times in the past three months and have the expectation to maintain at least that frequency of RAI during study participation). As requested, we have also included additional baseline information regarding participants’ sexual behaviors in the prior 30 days and prior history with the three study products in the Results:</p>
              <p>“Participants reported having had an average of 3 male partners (SD=6.35; range: 0-70) in the prior 30 days. Participants’ average total number of RAI occasions during that 30-day period was 4.76 (SD=8.50; range: 0-100), with an average of 2.57 (SD=7.74; range: 0-100) condomless RAI occasions self-reported during the same period. Two thirds of participants (n=142; 65.4%) reported prior use of an enema, with fewer participants self-reporting that they had used a suppository (n=8; 3.7%) or insert (n=10; 4.6%) prior to RAI.”</p>
              <p>Generalizability of results. The compliance is extremely high, given the number of visits required, the number of invasive procedures and that at least some of the study was conducted during the pandemic. I would like to see further detail of how this was achieved, and even more importantly, how generalisable are these results? I can’t imagine that the study participants are representative of all those who practise RAI, or even “sexual and general minorities” populations specifically. I imagine acceptability and adherence would be considerably lower in populations less able to commit to the study schedule. </p>
              <p>• We agree that participants in a clinical trial may not be representative of the general population. We have expanded the limitations section to highlight this point. Specifically, we now state: “Second, we recruited a convenience sample of participants willing to use each of the study products at least once per week, as required by the protocol. We acknowledge that the generalizability of our clinical trial findings may not be representative of all individuals practicing RAI.”</p>
              <p>Recruitment and screening. Related to this, I feel that the recruitment procedure is skimmed over. How were individuals currently practising RAI targeted? So few individuals were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. One inclusion criterion is “a reported history of consensual RAI at least three times in the past three months”? How was that ascertained without administering some kind of pre-recruitment questionnaire as part of the screening process?</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We have expanded the recruitment paragraph to highlight the procedures that different sites undertook. We now state: Participants were recruited from a variety of sources, including outpatient clinics, universities, community-based locations, online websites, and social networking applications. In addition, participants were also referred to the study from other local research projects, research registries and other health and social service providers. At some sites, prospective participants were pre-screened by phone, using an IRB-approved phone script, to assess presumptive eligibility based on select behavioral and medical eligibility requirements. This includes a review of the prospective participants’ sexual history and engagement in receptive anal sex in their lifetime and within the previous three months. For those deemed presumably eligible when a phone screen was conducted, a screening visit was scheduled. A re- affirmation of all eligibility criteria was obtained and confirmed during a formal screening and enrollment visit, described below.</p>
              <p>Differences in results. It’s important to set out differences in results by setting more clearly. The authors provide odds ratios in Table 5 but no acceptability/adherence percentages stratified by setting. It’s important to understand how much acceptability and adherence vary by setting, so we have an idea how generalisable results may be between settings for future studies.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We have added results by-site in Table 4.</p>
              <p>Abstract. The abstract doesn’t seem to talk about any differences in outcomes between the three products, even though the results showed that the enema had a higher adherence than the other products.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We would like to clarify that the principal objective of the study was not to compare the different modalities, but to evaluate the acceptability and adherence of each one and to provide estimates. While the sample size of the study allowed for high power for ruling out acceptability/adherence rates below 70%, the study was not powered for formal comparisons between modalities. Therefore, we have not included this detail in the abstracts to avoid misdirecting the reader.</p>
              <p>Limitations section of Discussion: I think this should be extended. Following on from point 3 re generalisability, I think authors should comment on other populations practising RAI such as heterosexual women. The study population here was almost universally individuals born male. Participants were instructed on how to use the products and first used them in the clinic – is there any comment on potential for misuse of products if users are provided with written instructions only/guidance videos etc? Authors talk about “real-world acceptability” but the conditions in this study are very far from how such products would be used in a real-world situation. Are they really reaching the “intended end-users”? Authors mention social desirability bias but was there risk of recall bias (top page 12: “Thinking about your experience during these past four weeks, in how many of the weeks did you miss a rectal [study product] application?”?</p>
              <p>• Thank you for these comments. We have amended the Limitations section to note the potential for recall bias: “Second, there is a possibility of recall bias when participants completed their surveys.”. We have also made a note regarding the need for future research outside of a clinical trial design: “Finally, while we designed our clinical trial to resemble participants’ product use to as close as ‘real-world’ settings possible while maintaining rigor, we acknowledge that the trial protocols may hinder the social validity of the findings. Future research examining these products in real-world situations may further clarify their potential for use as rectal microbicide modalities.”</p>
              <p>• While we agree that it is important to scientifically study the sexual practices of other populations (e.g., heterosexual women who engage in RAI) and their potential for rectal microbicides, we have chosen not to make reference to this group for two reasons: (1) we want to centralize the experience of sexual and gender minorities, and (2) heterosexual women’s sociocultural and behavioral correlates to RAI are unique and may not be parallel to the experience of sexual and gender minorities.</p>
              <p>Mixed-methods design. Any study such as this, evaluating acceptability, cries out for a mixed methods design. This study really suffers from having no qualitative research component to start to understand and interpret the quantitative outcomes. Additionally, at the many clinic visits, there would have been opportunity to ask pertinent closed and open-ended questions. Instead, there is quite a lot of conjecture in the Discussion which could have been answered with better questionnaire design e.g., enema use and user’s practices prior to RAI. Authors could have asked participants about these practices. Authors also mention that San Francisco-based participants may already have access to other PrEP products which may be responsible for the differences in acceptability by setting. One of the study questionnaires could have asked about this. This weakness needs to be acknowledged in the Limitations section.</p>
              <p>• Thank you for your suggestions. The objective of this paper is to present the primary trial outcomes data for MTN 035. We collected qualitative data as part of MTN 035, yet these data will be presented elsewhere as they inform secondary and exploratory outcomes. It is beyond the scope of this manuscript to include all these data.</p>
              <p>RAI. I wanted to see a lot more detail on RAI activity, including how many weeks participants reported no RAI. I’d have liked to see this in a table with frequency of RAI activity by baseline characteristics.</p>
              <p>• Although we do not explicitly provide the number of participants that reported no RAI during the study product use periods, the summaries of adherence per-sex-act are calculated for participants who reported at least one sex act, with those numbers provided along with the summaries. Among participants who reported at least one sex act during the product use period, the percentages of participants fully adherent per RAI-act were similar among the three study products: insert (n=99/168; 58.9%), suppository (n=101/174; 58.0%) and enema (n=107/182; 58.8%). </p>
              <p>Abbreviations. There are quite a few abbreviations that I wouldn’t consider necessary such as AEs, RMs, SGM and PUEVs.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. We have reduced abbreviations to improve readability wherever possible.</p>
              <p>Abstract. It may be clearer if the abstract was structured (IMRAD format). “204 adverse events were reported by 98 participants” – provide percentage of participants reporting at least one adverse event. 8. The countries included should be stated in the abstract.</p>
              <p>• Thank you. These edits are now included.</p>
              <p>Grammatical edits and recommendations. “The efficacy and effectiveness of emerging HIV prevention drug depends” – shouldn’t this be “HIV prevention products depend”? Introduction line 4: provide references for HIV prevalence by region statistics. Introduction paragraph 1 last sentence: shouldn’t it be “drugs targeting multiple STIs” rather than “multiple drugs”? </p>
              <p>• Thank you. The requested edits have been made </p>
              <p>References. Page 5 last sentence: any references at all for the “few studies with SGM populations have examined the acceptability, uptake of, and adherence to inserts, suppositories, or enemas”?</p>
              <p>• The sentence focuses on acceptability and use prior to sex. We now of one study by Carballo-Dieguez et al. (citation 27) which did so and is already included in the text.</p>
              <p>Figure 1 and Table 1. Figure 1 seems overly detailed, and there’s a lot of overlap with Table 1 – they can probably be combined. I think it should show the 1 week wash-out period in some way.</p>
              <p>• We respectfully disagree. To ensure clarity, we have left Table 1 as the descriptor of the randomized cross-over design as an illustration. Figure 1 denotes the in-depth detail required for the CONSORT diagram. </p>
              <p>Jacobson paper. Jacobson et al are mentioned (top page 11): please describe more about the overlap between papers and what further information Jacobson et al provides that would be useful to the reader when interpreting this paper.</p>
              <p>• There is no significant overlap between the Jacobson paper and the current trial outcomes paper. The Jacobson et al. paper describes how pharmacists responded to site-specific COVID-19 protocols to minimize disruptions to the trial. </p>
              <p>Clarity regarding “per RAI act vs per sex act”. Adherence per sex act (page 16): shouldn’t this be referring to “per RAI act” rather than just “per sex act”? Page 18 first sentence: “users’ behavioural practices prior to sex” – should be “prior to RAI”. Authors should be careful about these distinctions throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>• Clarification has been made throughout the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Headers in Table 2. Table 2 row headers: add country for each setting.</p>
              <p>• Added as requested.</p>
              <p>Ethnic distribution of Blantyre participants. Table 2 states that 100% of Blantyre participants were “Other African tribe” ethnicity. Surely, as 100% of participants from this site were from this one group, this could be more specific?</p>
              <p>• Unfortunately, no further information about ethnicity of this participants was collected on case report forms.</p>
              <p>OR and CI labels. “95% Confidence Interval” doesn’t seem quite right, as there’s a central estimate then 95%CI in brackets.</p>
              <p>• We have clarified the labels accordingly to note Odds Ratio estimates, followed by lower and upper confidence intervals in our tables.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3</p>
              <p>This is a generally well-conducted study. There are some aspects of the reporting that could be improved. In particular, I would recommend that the authors adhere to the CONSORT guidelines. For example, the first paragraph under "methods" reports results, which should be in the results section. Instead they could have began by describing the study design, followed by eligibility, study procedures, and outcomes. </p>
              <p>• Thank you; we have made the appropriate changes to align with the CONSORT guideline.</p>
              <p>Sample size. One key element which is completely omitted is how the study sample size was determined - this should be reported. The statistical analysis seems mostly okay; one minor suggestion is to report standard errors instead of standard deviations in the analysis of "adherence per-sex-act" (but keep standard deviations elsewhere where they have been reported for descriptive purposes).</p>
              <p>• We thank the reviewer for his comment. Additional information about the sample size has been provided in the corresponding section. Also, standard errors (SEs) have been provided instead of standard deviations (SDs) when describing the reported average of sex acts.</p>

              <p>Table 4 “Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval” row looks like it's the percentage with high acceptability with missing data removed, with 95%CI i.e. not an odds ratio. I strongly agree that acceptability 95%CI should be quoted, especially now the authors have made it clear that 70% acceptability is an important benchmark. However, it seems odd to give the % Yes at the top of that table, which includes those with missing data in the denominator, then a few rows down present a very slightly different estimate (because missing data are removed). So the table needs correct labelling and clearer signposting as to which statistic (with or without those with missing data) is the most important outcome. Maybe just state number with missing data as a footnote and present the percentages excluding missing data only.</p>

              <p>• Thank you. We have removed the mislabeling in our row stating Odds Ratio and now clarify that it’s the percent of participants with high acceptability/adherence. </p>
              <p>• We have deleted the recommended rows noting missingness and added a Note instead that states:</p>
              <p>o Notes. Estimates exclude missing data for acceptability (Rectal insert (n=3); Suppository (n=2); Enema (n=5)) and adherence (Rectal insert (n=3); Suppository (n=3); Enema (n=2)).</p>
