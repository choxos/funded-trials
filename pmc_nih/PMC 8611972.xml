                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The past decade has seen increasing attention directed to the development of HIV prevention interventions for male couples, driven by epidemiological data indicating that main or primary – rather than causal – partnerships account for a substantial number of HIV infections in this population. Couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) has emerged as a standard of care in the US. This protocol describes a study that aims to evaluate the efficacy of two adjunct components to CHTC – communication training (CT) videos and a substance use module (SUM) – to reduce drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk behavior.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Eligible couples must include one participant who is aged 17-29, HIV-negative, and reports recent drug use. Both partners must be aged 17 or older, identify as cismale (assigned male sex at birth and currently identify as male gender), and communicate in English. Couples are randomized post-baseline to one of four conditions (CHTC as usual, CHTC plus CT video; CHTC + SUM and CHTC + CT video + SUM) in a full-factorial design. Follow up assessments are completed at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post baseline.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Results of this trial will enhance the application of CHTC. If found effective, adjunct components would comprise a brief and scalable drug use intervention that could be readily integrated into existing HIV testing settings.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p id="Par20">For a little more than a decade, considerable attention has been focused on the sexual health needs of sexual minority men (SMM) in same-sex relationships (including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men). The impetus for much of this work was provided by groundbreaking research that estimated 35-68% of new HIV infections among SMM were transmitted between main – or primary – relationship partners rather than casual sex partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Risk for main partner HIV infection was particularly high among younger SMM, with estimates as high as 79% among those aged 18-29 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These studies suggested that main partner HIV transmission risk may arise from the fact that SMM have sex with their main partners more frequently and are less likely to use condoms when having sex with their main partner. More recently, Starks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] identified that partnered SMM are more likely to have sex with casual partners on days they also have sex with their main partners. The co-occurrence of these behaviors may also enhance shared risk for HIV.</p>
                <p id="Par21">In response to the observed need for dyadic sexual health interventions for this population, couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) – originally developed for heterosexual couples in African nations with generalized epidemics – was adapted for use with male couples in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. CHTC is an 8-step intervention during which couples receive an HIV test together and learn their status together. The HIV tester also engages the couple in a discussion that reviews their current HIV prevention practices, clarifies their sexual agreement – and expectations around communication if the agreement were broken – and develops a shared HIV prevention plan with the couple.</p>
                <p id="Par22">More recent research supports the need for ongoing attention to this population. Evidence suggests that single SMM and those in non-monogamous relationships (where sex with casual partners is in some way permitted) engage in condomless anal sex (CAS) with casual partners at comparable rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, there are indications that SMM in monogamous relationships (wherein partners have agreed to forego sex with partners outside their relationship) who break their agreement and engage in CAS with casual partners may actually do so more frequently than non-monogamous and single men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par23">The use of illicit drugs has been consistently linked to sexual risk taking among SMM. In particular, the use of a number of illicit drugs (i.e., cocaine or crack, methamphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybuterate – GHB) has been associated with either the occurrence or frequency of CAS with casual partners across a range of studies (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). In their recent paper, Starks et al. examined data from a sample of more than 65,000 SMM and found that this association was significant across relationship status and sexual agreements, though it was significantly stronger among single and non-monogamous men compared to those in monogamous relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Separately, Starks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] have since observed an association between illicit drug use and CAS with casual partners in day-level data obtained from male couples.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Starks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] posited that CHTC – which in its standard form involves the negotiation of a sexual agreement and joint HIV prevention planning – might provide an opportunity for male couples to develop consensus related to rules or limitations on drug use. Furthermore, they hypothesized that augmenting CHTC with supplemental communication skills training might also enhance its efficacy. The team developed a communication training (CT) video to deliver dyadic skills training following a standard Cognitive Behavioral modeling paradigm. They also developed a substance use module (SUM) wherein partners create a calendar feedback tool, which is subsequently debriefed using a brief dose of Motivational Interviewing (MI). The MI component is delivered following the framework for couples MI derived by Starks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">Initial pilot results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] indicated that completion of the SUM alone was associated with statistically significant decreases in the odds of drug use (<italic>B</italic> = − 3.62; <italic>p</italic> = .03) and drug use related problems as measured by the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (<italic>B</italic> = − 0.75; <italic>p</italic> = .02) at 1-month post-intervention. While CT videos were not independently associated with reductions in drug use or DAST-10 scores; they significantly enhanced the long-term benefits of SUM completion. At 3-month and 6-month follow-up the SUM was only associated with significant decreases in the odds of drug use (<italic>B</italic> = − 2.79; <italic>p</italic> = .013 and <italic>B</italic> = − 3.93; <italic>p</italic> = .014 respectively) and DAST-10 scores (<italic>B</italic> = − 0.64; <italic>p</italic> = .01 and <italic>B</italic> = − 0.79; <italic>p</italic> = .003 respectively) among men who viewed the CT videos. In a direct comparison between the CHTC as usual condition and those participants who received both <italic>We Test</italic> adjunct components (CHTC+SUM+CT video), the combined condition had significantly lower odds of drug use at 1- and 3-month follow up and significantly lower DAST-10 scores at all follow-up time-points.</p>
                <p id="Par26">While promising, the results of Starks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] were limited in several ways. First, their study did not include biological markers for drug use and sexual risk taking to validate self-report responses. Second, the most distal follow-up was 6-months post-intervention. This was not sufficiently long enough to observe decay in the treatment effect for substance use outcomes. This limited the development of guidance or recommendations on the timing of CHTC-retesting with <italic>We Test</italic> module delivery. The next step in this program of research is to conduct a full scale efficacy trial that incorporates the use of biological markers in addition to self-reported behavioral data and a more extensive follow-up period with an expanded potential to observe decay in the intervention effect.</p>

                <p id="Par27">The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of CT and SUM adjunct modules that augment the existing CHTC protocol. Our primary hypotheses are that completion of the SUM will be associated with a statistically significant decrease in drug use and drug-related problems at all follow-ups. We also hypothesize that viewing CT videos will enhance the effect of SUM. Based upon our initial results, we anticipate that there will not be a direct effect of adjunct intervention components on HIV Transmission Risk Behavior (TRB); however, we have powered the study to examine indirect effects. We therefore propose secondary hypotheses in which the SUM and CT components significantly reduce sexual HIV transmission risk behavior as a result of decreases in drug use.</p>

Introduce CHTC and Obtain Concurrence: an introduction to the CHTC process and receiving the couples consent; 2.) Prepare For and Conduct HIV Test: explanation of the HIV test itself and possible results couples could receive, followed by a rapid HIV test; 3.) Explore Couple’s Relationship: an exploration of the couple’s relationship to build rapport; 4.) Discuss HIV Risk Concerns and Reasons for Seeking CHTC: discussion of current risks, reasons for testing and HIV prevention strategies (i.e. condom use, PrEP use, etc.); 5.) Discuss Couple’s Agreement: exploration of the couple’s sexual agreement and rules in regards to outside sexual partners; 6.) Provide Results: results are given to each member of the couple at the same time and can be the same (concordant negative or positive) or discordant; 7.) Develop Care, Treatment, and Prevention Plan Based on Result: discussion of future steps regarding HIV transmission risk prevention strategies (i.e. discussion of introducing condoms or PrEP use); and 8.) Link with Follow-up Services: referrals given in light of current HIV test results (i.e. referrals for confirmatory testing and other health services).</p>

Four couples are depicted in separate scenes discussing HIV testing, drug use, sexual agreements, and drug use during sex. Each scene is viewed twice. In the initial viewing, the couple in the video makes one or more communication errors. The scene is subsequently viewed a second time and the couple utilizes more effective communication skills, resulting in a more adaptive resolution.

Completion of the calendar is done using an excel spreadsheet displayed on a shared computer screen to facilitate remote intervention delivery. After completion of the calendar, the HIV tester asks a series of debriefing questions designed to elicit the couples’ perspective on their use, establish the couple’s goals and limits for drug use, and make plans to achieve these goals.</p>

CHTC training follows Sullivan and Stephenson’s curriculum, as adopted by CDC. Afterwards, providers complete a series of mock sessions. These begin with individual MI mocks to consolidate basic counseling skills. Subsequently a sequence of 4 CHTC mocks is completed so providers can practice each formulation of HIV test result delivery (concordant negative, concordant positive, and serodiscordant). The last 3 CHTC mocks include the SUM component.</p>

                  <p id="Par42">Power analyses were generated by Monte Carlo simulation using Mplus (version 8.0). All estimates were based upon 10,000 sample replications and power was defined as the percentage of randomly generated samples in which the specified parameter was statistically significant. All simulated models were multi-level, nesting participants (at Level 1) within couples (at Level 2). Models focused on detecting between-condition differences at any one follow-up time-point (as opposed to predicting slope factors). This allowed for more direct extrapolation of error variances from existing baseline data and is consistent with the primary aim of the study. The main effects of the two interventions (the drug use calendar and video-based communication skills training) as well as their interaction were modeled at level 2. Based upon the results of our previous studies, we anticipate 80% minimum follow-up retention at 12 months. These analyses therefore reflect a conservative analytic sample of 240 couples (480 individuals).</p>
                  <p id="Par43">Analyses indicated that the proposed study has power &gt; .80 to detect a simple main effect of SUM and/or CT videos corresponding to a 15% reduction in the odds of drug use and a 1.0 point reduction in DAST scores at any follow-up time point. The proposed study has power &gt; .80 to detect a 2% reduction in the odds of reporting HIV TRB. Effects of these magnitudes are plausible given our pilot data. <italic>We Test</italic> pilot data have indicated that mediational pathways linking CT videos with drug use outcomes likely involve depression. The effects of viewing ACTV were generally small across indices of communication skills and psychological functioning. The most promising (statistically significant) effects were associated with improvements in self- disclosure communication (β = .13) and depression (β = −.16). Notably, the indirect pathway between CT and depression through self-disclosure communication was of moderate size (β = −.12) indicating that communication skills may be one mechanism by which ACTV yields reductions in depression. Depression scores were, in turn, positively associated with the odds of drug use (β = −.45) and DAST scores (β = .06). Using these effects as preliminary estimates, Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the proposed study design has power &gt; .80 to detect the significance of direct pathways and implied indirect effects of intervention.</p>

The interview administration is facilitated by the use of a calendar data entry platform supported in Microsoft Access. The Research Assistant first identifies and records “anchor dates” or significant events on the calendar. Next, for participants who are prescribed PrEP, the Research Assistant records all days the participant indicated a missed dose of PrEP. Next, the Research Assistant records days on which the participant reported heavy drinking or the use of marijuana or other illicit drugs (i.e., cocaine or crack, MDMA, methamphetamine, ketamine, or GHB). Finally, the Research Assistant records sexual events. These entries included partner type (main or casual), the sex act performed (e.g., anal insertive, anal receptive), and whether a condom was used.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">Biological testing is coordinated through Molecular Testing Laboratory (MTL). All specimens are self-collected at home using materials supplied directly by MTL.

The presence of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (CT) and N. gonorrhea (NG) in self-collected urethral and rectal specimens will determined by using the Abbott Real Time CT/NG assay, an FDA-cleared real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for direct, qualitative detection of a region of the cryptic plasmid DNA of CT and the Opa gene of NG, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par52">Syphilis testing will be conducted on Dried Blood Spots (DBS). MTL provides a lancet for finger stick blood draw and DBS card for specimen collection. Syphilis specimens are tested with an RPR test. Initially reactive results are reported as a positive screening test, with referral for providers. If enough plasma is not available for a “neat” initial RPR, a 1:4 dilution RPR will be conducted. If negative, the negative report will be reported with a note that it was on a 1:4 dilution. This procedure lowers the sensitivity of the RPR but would still be expected to perform well for primary and secondary syphilis infections, with the exception of very early infection.</p>

At the individual level (Level 1), there are two types of effects: <italic>actor</italic> (the association between an individual’s score on an outcome and his own score on a predictor) and <italic>partner</italic> (the association between an individual’s score on an outcome and his partner’s score on a predictor). Couple-level (Level 2) effects are calculated for variables where both partners share a score (e.g., relationship length).</p>
                  <p id="Par61">A series of APIMs will be calculated to examine putative mediators. Due to model complexity, each drug and TRB outcome will be examined separately. As with primary outcome analyses described above, we will utilize growth modeling procedures to calculate an intercept and slope for each outcome over time. Similarly, models will also specify growth factors for mediators at Level 1 and Level 2 during the follow-up period. In this manner, growth factors for the outcome can be regressed on growth factors for the putative mediator at both Level 1 and Level 2. Subsequently, the effect of intervention (a couple-level predictor) will be determined by examining the regression coefficients associated with intervention in the prediction of growth factors for both the outcome of interest and the mediator at Level 2. Where indicated by the pattern of significant direct effects, indirect pathways from intervention condition through actor and partner effects of the mediator will be tested using bootstrapping tests of mediation. Where outcome distributions prevent the use of bootstrapping, we will utilize a model constraint approach to evaluating the significance of indirect effects.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Follow-up exploratory analysis will investigate a range of potential mediators and moderators. In particular, we will test whether drug use mediates intervention effects on sexual risk taking outcomes. In addition, individual variables assessing mental health, discrimination, perceptions of relationship functioning, and communication skills will be tested as potential mediators of intervention condition effects. Meanwhile, baseline differences in agreements, agreement satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, commitment, and decision-making power will be tested as potential moderators of intervention effects.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par72">CHTC uptake has been modest in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] despite high acceptability among SMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given the salience of main partner transmission for the U.S. HIV epidemic, expanding the reach of couples-based prevention is essential. Stephenson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] suggested this may be achieved in part through better service integration and by expanding the scope of CHTC to meet the unique antecedents of HIV experienced by male couples (i.e. substance use). Directly aligned with this, the adjunct components tested here integrate drug use intervention into CHTC. They may expand CHTC dissemination by drawing upon resources that support substance use treatment in addition to HIV testing. It may also enhance the appeal of CHTC among substance use treatment providers who might not otherwise offer the service.</p>
              <p id="Par73">This study also furthers research on applications of Motivational Interviewing with couples. Previous research on the involvement of relationship partners in Motivational Interviews have met with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Unlike these previous studies, which conceptualized couples Motivational Interviewing in terms of relationship partners involved as adjunct participants in the treatment of an identified client, the framework for couples Motivational Interviewing that underlies the SUM component tested here conceptualizes the couple in toto as the client [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While the approach has demonstrated promise in two pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], this is the first full-scale efficacy trial of an intervention guided by this framework.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Findings from this study will be subject to a number of limitations. First, CHTC has been acknowledged as a standard of care and its efficacy has been established in previous studies. It is therefore of limited scientific utility to include a no-treatment or attention control which would allow us to quantify the effect of CHTC delivered alone. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of adjunct <italic>We Test</italic> components. We therefore forgo the ability to provide a replication of the effect size for CHTC alone. Dyadic participation may present challenges– particularly for couples with poorer dyadic functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Results may not generalize to couples who are unable or unwilling to participate together. By selecting sites which represent urban centers of the US HIV epidemic, we maximize the feasibility and racial/ethnic diversity of our sample; however, our sample will under-represent men from rural areas. Eligibility criteria (one partner must be 17 – 29) limit life-span representation limits generalizability; however, this criterion is driven by the heightened risk and developmental salience of emerging adulthood. Exclusion of transgender people further limits generalizability. The decision reflects the limitations of our pilot data – which included only cis-male participants. It also reflects the content of CT videos which include only cis-male actors.</p>
              <p id="Par75">Despite these limitations, this study has the potential to contribute new knowledge about dyadic functioning and health among partnered SMM. This emphasis on relationship factors and sexual health reflects more than a decade of accumulating evidence that attention to main partnerships is an essential component of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy in the US. If found efficacious, the adjunct intervention components tested here may expand the reach and application of CHTC to the treatment of substance use.</p>
