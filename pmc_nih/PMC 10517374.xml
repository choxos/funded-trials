Filtering of decision support alerts by telemedicine clinicians may mitigate alert fatigue and reduce oversights in care.</p>
              <p>Adopting a user-centered design approach, we developed and implemented the Anesthesiology Control Tower (ACT), a real-time telemedicine decision support system.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The ACT combines remote intraoperative monitoring with customized clinical decision support using the AlertWatch platform. The ACT clinicians monitor multiple ORs and review decision alerts to assess patient safety risks and offer preemptive recommendations to intraoperative anesthesiology clinicians. The present study, Anesthesiology Control Tower–Feedback Alerts to Supplement Treatments (ACTFAST-3), was a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) evaluating the feasibility of an efficacy trial of the ACT and its impact on 2 quality of care measures: postoperative hypothermia and hyperglycemia.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Study Population</title>
                <p>All patients 18 years or older who underwent surgery in 1 of 48 designated ORs were enrolled. During our institutional transition to the Epic electronic health record (EHR) from May 21 to September 10, 2018, data were excluded due to data quality and technical issues. Patients were excluded if greater than 50% of their case duration (anesthesia start to anesthesia stop time) occurred outside of the ACT staffed hours, which were typically from <sc>7:00 am</sc> to 4:00 <sc>pm</sc> on Monday through Friday, with exclusions for technological failures and personnel shortages. The rationale for this exclusion was to focus on cases for which the ACT was able to make timely recommendations. For glycemic outcomes, patients without diabetes were excluded from analysis. Overall, 60 658 surgical procedures were performed during the study period. After exclusions (<xref rid="zoi230941f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), 26 254 patients (12 980 in the intervention group and 13 274 in the control group) were included in the analysis. Baseline patient characteristics were taken from the EHR; race, gender, and other characteristics were entered based on self-report. Race and ethnicity data were routinely collected for administrative purposes and subsequently taken from the EHR; they were not used in the study other than for reporting the demographic characteristics of the population.</p>

                <title>Randomization and Blinding</title>
                <p>To reduce contamination effects and improve protocol adherence, ORs (rather than patients) were randomized 1:1 to the control or intervention group each day using centrally generated sequences. All patients in each OR for that day had the same treatment assignment. Operating room randomization was balanced on a 1:1 ratio for each day; however, because some ORs had no cases on some days, the allocation ratio varied randomly, with a mean of 1. Randomization was included in the ACT display interface. Patients received either usual intraoperative care comprising medical direction from the anesthesia care team (control group) or usual care augmented by telemedicine decision support from the ACT (intervention group).</p>
                <p>Patients were blinded to group allocation. Operating room clinicians were unblinded if contacted by the ACT but were not aware of their allocation otherwise. Clinicians in the ACT monitored patients in the control group but did not contact intraoperative clinicians unless there was a patient safety issue necessitating immediate action, such as failure to deliver an anesthetic agent. There were no changes to OR staffing based on group allocation. Patients with another surgical procedure within 30 days after an index operation were analyzed according to their previous treatment assignment. Because the interface did not track individual-level previous randomizations, in subsequent procedures, patients received the treatment per the new OR day’s independent randomization. Surgical procedures received more than 30 days after an index operation were analyzed according to the new randomization. This strategy was chosen in the protocol to reduce contamination effects due to ACT-assisted management plans carried over to subsequent procedures. Sensitivity analyses excluded previous treatment assignments and used only the first operation in a 30-day window.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>The ACT is a remote suite staffed by an anesthesiologist who is supported by a study coordinator trained in the study procedures, the decision support software interface, and communication tools. A total of 1 to 3 personnel, including nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology resident physicians, and nurse anesthetist trainees, also participated daily. The suite computers accessed the EHR and a customized version of the decision support platform. Although the protocol envisioned live waveform display and audio-video monitoring of ORs, these technological features were not available.</p>
                <p>Descriptions of how the ACT interface was developed and adapted to clinician feedback to improve acceptability and usability have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The ACT protocols were refined with clinician stakeholders to maximize the value of recommendations. The ACT clinicians used a dashboard to prioritize review of high-acuity cases and cases with active alerts. The dashboard displayed patients in both the intervention and control groups. The decision support software display included physiological data, laboratory data, medical history, and other summaries as well as alerts.</p>
                <p>Interactions between the ACT and OR clinicians evolved during the study.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Initially, ACT clinicians filtered and communicated alerts to OR clinicians via phone calls because EHR-integrated messaging tools were not widely used by OR clinicians. The ACT shifted focus to delivering preemptive comprehensive assessments of patient risk and potential areas for risk mitigation in addition to communicating relevant alerts. The decision support software also evolved. For example, early in the pilot, a mean arterial pressure lower than 65 mm Hg would trigger an alert for hypotension, but later iterations included adjustable thresholds, tracked the overall duration of hypotension, and incorporated notes and recommendations based on that alert.</p>
                <p>After the Epic EHR implementation (June 2018), the Epic In Basket messaging system was used for case reviews and nonurgent alerts. Phone calls were used for time-sensitive alerts. Clinicians in the ACT were encouraged to log OR communications and case reviews in the decision support software and to select an action or reason for silencing each alert. In the log, ACT staff rated the importance (referred to as <italic>significance</italic> in the log) of each issue, whether the OR team had noted or acted on the issue, and whether the ACT-OR communication changed medical management.</p>

                <p>The primary outcomes were avoidance of hypothermia, defined as the proportion of patients who had a final recorded intraoperative core temperature greater than 36 °C, and avoidance of hyperglycemia, defined as the proportion of patients with diabetes who had a blood glucose level of 180 mg/dL or lower on arrival to the postanesthesia recovery area. These outcomes were selected because they were viewed as clinically meaningful opportunities for quality improvement and were plausibly affected by ACT-OR communication.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes included intraoperative hypotension, temperature monitoring, timely antibiotic redosing, intraoperative glucose evaluation and management, neuromuscular blockade monitoring, ventilator management, and volatile anesthetic overuse. Clinical outcomes included 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and postoperative acute kidney injury. Due to limited data availability, planned analysis of intraoperative awareness and surgical site infection outcomes were not conducted.

                <p>Randomized patients were considered to have received the intervention and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis regardless of whether the ACT communicated with the OR. Continuous outcomes (time with low mean arterial pressure, time without antibiotics, and fresh gas flow) were analyzed using a linear generalized estimating equation model clustering on OR and day. Standard errors were calculated using the heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) type 1 (HC1) estimator from sandwich package 3.0-0 in R software, version 4.0.4 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Acute kidney injury stage was analyzed using a proportional odds regression model with HC type 0 (HC0)–clustered SEs. All other outcomes were binary and analyzed with a Poisson regression model with HC0-clustered SEs to obtain rate ratios (RRs).<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Within each group of outcomes, <italic>P</italic> values were Holm adjusted for multiple testing. Confidence intervals were reported using Bonferroni-corrected α levels; this correction was not planned a priori but was compatible with the results post hoc. The threshold for statistical significance was 2-tailed <italic>P</italic> = .05. To visualize secular trends in intervention effects, we used regression analysis of each 3-month calendar segment and a linear generalized estimating equation model with the same SE approach used for other outcomes. The protocol planned comparison of patients in the intervention group with patients in the matched historical control group; however, the EHR transition halfway through the study made that comparison infeasible. A post hoc analysis was performed examining the type and frequency of alert communication to OR teams by the ACT clinicians. All data were analyzed using R software, version 4.0.4.</p>

              <p>Among 26 254 patients included in the analysis, 13 393 (51.0%) identified as female, 12 852 (49.0%) as male, and 9 (0.03%) as other genders (not specified in the EHR), with a median (IQR) age of 60 (47-69) years. A total of 297 patients (1.1%) were Asian, 5327 (20.3%) were Black, 20 169 (76.8%) were White, and 461 (1.8%) were of other race (including American Indian or Alaska Native, multiple races, other race, unknown race, and declined to respond). There were 7681 clusters (OR days) in the intervention group and 7875 in the control group. Minimal differences in demographic characteristics, surgery type, functional status, and comorbidities were observed between the control group (n = 13 274) and the intervention group (n = 12 980) (<xref rid="zoi230941t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 65 clinicians in the ACT logged communication to ORs before the transition to the Epic EHR, and 87 logged communication to ORs after the transition to the Epic EHR.</p>

              <p>As a pilot trial, demonstrating the ability to deliver the intervention was a main aim of this study. Gaps in staffing and software problems decreased over time. In 2017 (April 3 through December 31), the ACT was operational on 156 of 192 weekdays. From October 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, 182 of 192 weekdays were staffed. The number of staffed weekdays per month is shown in eFigure 1A in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>; temporal patterns in the number of alerts and the number of OR communications are shown in eFigure1B and eFigure 1C, respectively, in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>. The number of alerts, alert-related OR communications, and case reviews by randomization status and EHR are shown in eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>.</p>
              <p>Separation between the intervention and control ORs was excellent. Overall, the ACT contacted 1636 of 12 980 intervention ORs (12.6%) and 99 of 13 274 control ORs (0.7%). In the pre–Epic EHR period, 877 of 5808 intervention ORs (15.1%) and 40 of 6065 control ORs (0.7%) were contacted; in the Epic EHR period, 759 of 7172 intervention ORs (10.6%) and 59 of 7209 control ORs (0.8%) were contacted (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). Documented reasons for contacting a control OR included patient safety emergencies (n = 13) and researcher error (n = 6).</p>
              <p>In the pre–Epic EHR period, the ACT was characterized by contacts for alerts (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>); in the Epic EHR period, the ACT was characterized by a split between case review recommendations and alerts. The number of alerts increased substantially after the EHR transition (from 18 769 in the pre–Epic EHR period to 107 376 in the Epic EHR period) due to expanded alert definitions and a higher frequency of data updates. The most common alerts were related to hemodynamics and postoperative nausea prophylaxis, and few alerts were related to the primary outcomes of avoidance of postoperative hypothermia or hyperglycemia (eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). The ACT staff indicated that the issue being communicated was “significant” in 791 cases and that their communication affected management in 634 of these cases (80.2%). Overall, the ACT reported that management was affected in 603 of 12 980 cases (4.6%) in the intervention group and 31 of 13 274 in the control group (0.2%) (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Results for primary, secondary, and exploratory clinical outcomes are shown in <xref rid="zoi230941t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. For the primary outcomes, there was no significant difference in the avoidance of postoperative hypothermia (7602 of 11 447 patients [66.4%] in the intervention group vs 7783 of 11 672 [66.7%] in the control group; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.02) or postoperative hyperglycemia (7445 of 8676 patients [85.8%] in the intervention group vs 7559 of 8815 [85.8%] in the control group; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99-1.01) between the control and intervention groups. For secondary outcomes, there was a significant increase in the incidence of appropriate intraoperative glucose measurement among patients with diabetes in the intervention group (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15; Holm-corrected <italic>P</italic> = .02). Among the clinical outcomes, a nonsignificant increase in postoperative 30-day readmission was observed in the intervention group (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.00-1.37; Holm-corrected <italic>P</italic> = .07). Surgical site infections were removed from the analysis plan but did not differ between groups (372 of 10 178 patients [3.7%] in the intervention group vs 416 of 10 397 [4.0%] in the control group; RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79-1.05).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this pilot RCT with 26 254 patients, compared with usual care, a telemedicine decision support intervention for OR anesthesia clinicians did not significantly change 2 quality of care outcomes: avoidance of postoperative hypothermia and hyperglycemia. Although there was a small but statistically significant increase in intraoperative glucose measurement in the intervention group, there was no difference in the frequency of treatment for hyperglycemia, which may explain the lack of difference in postoperative hyperglycemia. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT of an intraoperative telemedicine intervention. In contrast to previous studies,<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> our study incorporated a novel telemedicine platform that combined real-time data and clinical decision support with a streamlined approach for collaborative decision-making with OR clinicians, allowing clinicians to monitor many ORs simultaneously.</p>
              <p>There are several potential reasons for the lack of an intention-to-treat effect with tight confidence bounds on these quality of care outcomes. First, there were likely substantial contamination and Hawthorne effects. All anesthesiology clinicians at the study site were aware that the ACT was monitoring all ORs and were aware of the process measures being studied. This awareness was reinforced by intermittent messages from the ACT about study patients, likely leading to spillover changes in practice as the clinicians looked for the same issues about which they tended to receive messages from the ACT. That is, the study estimand did not account for shared quality improvements due to ACT implementation and surveillance. For example, if the ACT reinforced institutional guidelines on blood glucose management for a clinician on 1 day, on a subsequent day during which that clinician was randomized to the control OR, they were likely to have remembered and followed those guidelines. Anesthesiologists could also supervise ORs in different treatment groups on the same day, increasing contamination.</p>
              <p>Second, the overall adherence to each measure at baseline was high, making statistically significant improvements difficult to achieve. Independent hospital-based quality improvement efforts targeting these measures probably mitigated the benefit of the ACT. For example, improved EHR alerts about antibiotic redosing reduced the need for ACT notifications. The unmodified decision support application with default alerts was available to intraoperative staff during the study, which could have decreased the effect of the ACT. However, our anecdotal impression was that few non-ACT clinicians used the software. Third, the rate of recommendations was lower than expected. The ACT contacted only 12.6% of intervention ORs and reported changing management in only 4.6% of intervention ORs (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>). The ACT clinicians relied on in-depth medical record review in addition to decision support, limiting their ability, time, and resources to find actionable recommendations. Recommendations for the primary outcomes depended minimally on detailed data, meaning that there were few mechanisms through which decision support could affect those outcomes. Relatively few alerts were related to the primary outcomes (eTable 3 in <xref rid="note-ZOI230941-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>In future studies, the high labor input per actionable recommendation could be improved using algorithms to better filter patients and issues for review. The ACT used alerts based on simple rules (eg, hypotension present). With the rapidly expanding value of machine learning, algorithms have been developed, validated, and implemented to track estimated postoperative mortality,<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> postoperative complications,<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> transfusion,<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and surgical progress and duration.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="zoi230941r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> These algorithms could improve the value and value per time spent of ACT review by identifying patients who may have greater benefit from anticipatory planning and by increasing timely risk mitigation recommendations. The study site is another factor potentially reducing the observed effect; an academic medical center during business hours provides a high baseline level of monitoring. The intervention could have been more useful in times and places with more thinly stretched resources, such as night shifts.</p>
              <p>Despite the lack of an impact on outcomes, the ACTFAST-3 pilot RCT provided a template for real-time intraoperative telemedicine support. Our approach incorporated 3 key aspects: an integrated data pipeline with granular EHR data, alerts for clinical decision support, and expert clinicians assessing the alerts and engaging in collaborative decision-making. There are several opportunities for improving intraoperative telemedicine support based on our experience. Refining the alert systems to recognize likely low-relevance alarms is a future direction. A recent interview and focus group study<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> found that OR clinicians appreciate telemedicine’s role in improving patient safety and providing a new perspective for review of perioperative data. Although the study occurred over 2 years and had a large sample, we consider it a pilot rather than a definitive trial because the intervention and its delivery evolved during the study, including workflow changes during an EHR transition period.</p>
              <sec id="H2-8-ZOI230941">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has several strengths. It is a large and rigorously conducted pragmatic trial using mixed methods to maximize the intervention.<sup><xref rid="zoi230941r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> An academic-private partnership allowed rapid development of substantial infrastructure, including adapting to a major EHR transition. By incorporating educational and quality improvement, a larger number of clinicians were able to work within the ACT and improve its relevance.</p>
                <p>This study also has limitations. Practices within the ACT and the decision support software evolved over the course of the trial. However, OR and ACT clinicians viewed these changes favorably, and there was no evidence of temporal heterogeneity. The trial was paused during an EHR transition period, which came with a learning curve for the ACT clinicians that included changing alerts, changing data availability, and new communication modalities. It is difficult to extrapolate the results beyond an academic center. There are multiple factors, including contamination and Hawthorne effects, which may have caused the study to underestimate the benefit of the ACT. A cluster-randomized study would be optimal to estimate the impact of the ACT on outcomes.</p>
