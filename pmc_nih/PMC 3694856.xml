                <p>During blood stage infection, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infected erythrocytes (IE) bind to host blood vessels. This virulence determinant enables parasites to evade spleen-dependent killing mechanisms, but paradoxically in some cases may reduce parasite fitness by killing the host. Adhesion of infected erythrocytes is mediated by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a family of polymorphic adhesion proteins encoded by <italic>var</italic> genes. Whereas cerebral binding and severe malaria are associated with parasites expressing DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> genes, relatively little is known about the non-brain endothelial selection on severe malaria adhesive types. In this study, we selected <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-IEs on diverse endothelial cell types and demonstrate that DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> genes were consistently among the major <italic>var</italic> transcripts selected on non-brain endothelial cells (lung, heart, bone marrow). To investigate the molecular basis for this avid endothelial binding activity, recombinant proteins were expressed from the predominant upregulated DC8 transcript, IT4var19. In-depth binding comparisons revealed that multiple extracellular domains from this protein bound brain and non-brain endothelial cells, and individual domains largely did not discriminate between different endothelial cell types. Additionally, we found that recombinant DC8 and DC13 CIDR1 domains exhibited a widespread endothelial binding activity and could compete for DC8-IE binding to brain endothelial cells, suggesting they may bind the same host receptor. Our findings provide new insights into the interaction of severe malaria adhesive types and host blood vessels and support the hypothesis that parasites causing severe malaria express PfEMP1 variants with a superior ability to adhere to diverse endothelial cell types, and may therefore endow these parasites with a growth and transmission advantage.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>The virulence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been linked to the ability of infected erythrocytes to bind to receptors on the endothelial lining of blood vessels and sequester from blood circulation. This phenotype enables parasites to avoid spleen removal and is associated with organ-specific disease complications. This binding interaction is mediated by a large family of adhesion proteins, termed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP1), but relatively little is known about endothelial tissue selection and if there are parasite selective advantages to potentially deadly binding variants. In this study, we showed that two PfEMP1 subtypes that have been associated with severe malaria infections (DC8 and DC13) were among the best binders to a diversity of endothelial cell types. This avid endothelial binding phenotype was associated with PfEMP1 proteins that encoded multiple binding domains with widespread endothelial binding activity to brain, heart, lung, and bone marrow cells. These traits may give parasites expressing DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1 variants a growth and transmission advantage, even though sequestration in these tissues may result in deadly complications in a subset of hosts.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is a mosquito-borne infectious pathogen that is responsible for about 200â300 million illnesses and around 700,000 deaths each year <xref rid="ppat.1003430-World1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. A major virulence determinant for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the cytoadherence and sequestration of infected erythrocytes in capillaries and post-capillary venules of host organs, particularly the small intestine, heart, lung, and brain <xref rid="ppat.1003430-MacPherson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Pongponratn1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Cytoadhesion is mediated by the large and diverse <italic>var</italic> gene or <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Baruch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>Var</italic> genes undergo transcriptional switching to modify the binding and antigenic properties of IEs <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Roberts1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although several endothelial binding properties have been mapped in PfEMP1 proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> relatively little is known about how PfEMP1s determine microvascular tropism.</p>
              <p>Analysis of <italic>var</italic> gene sequences indicates that the family is evolving into separate groups defined by distinct upstream sequences, protein domain architectures, and protein binding properties <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Smith2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The majority of PfEMP1 proteins are classified into groups A, B, or C based on chromosome location and upstream sequence <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Kraemer2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. There is also a small subset of chimeric <italic>var</italic> genes, termed group B/A, and three unusual strain transcendent <italic>var</italic> genes (VAR1CSA, VAR2CSA, and Type 3 var) found in most or all parasite genotypes <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Trimnell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. PfEMP1 are large proteins that contain between two to nine adhesion domains termed Duffy binding-like (DBL) and cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR). Most proteins encode a semi-conserved head structure composed of an N-terminal DBL domain followed by a CIDR domain <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Su1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The CIDR1 domain in the PfEMP1 semi-conserved head structure plays a key role in IE binding. This domain is under strong selection to bind the host receptor CD36 in most group B and C PfEMP1 variants, but does not bind CD36 in the group A and B/A proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Significantly, group A and B/A proteins tend to be expressed in young children with limited malaria immunity and a subset of group A and B/A proteins termed DC8 and DC13 mediate cerebral binding and have been associated with severe malaria complications <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Warimwe2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similarly, the isolate-transcendent VAR2CSA variant is directly linked to pregnancy associated malaria <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Salanti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Both the hierarchical expression of distinct PfEMP1 binding variants in African children's infections and the specialization of VAR2CSA for placental binding suggest that <italic>var</italic> groups are evolving for distinct binding and host niches.</p>
              <p>The <italic>var</italic> gene family has ancient origins in a lineage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-like species that infect humans and chimpanzees <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Trimnell1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Escalante1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The low frequency of serious clinical complications arising from malaria infections (â¼2%) suggests the cytoadhesion traits have evolved to limit life-threatening reactions in the host, although IE cytoadhesion in brain and placenta are associated with severe disease. While placental malaria leads to low birth weight infants who are at greater risk of death, it generally does not kill pregnant women in higher malaria transmission areas <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Brabin1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Conversely, cerebral malaria is a major life-threatening complication that carries a 15â20% case fatality rate in hospital settings and kills hundreds of thousands of children each year <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Beales1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Although DC8 and DC13 variants are not restricted to severe malaria infections <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Lavstsen2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it is therefore surprising that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> retains a subset of PfEMP1 proteins, which might be expected to reduce parasite fitness by rapidly killing the host. The nature of the selective advantage that maintains these potentially deadly adhesion traits in the parasite population is unclear.</p>
              <p>In order to investigate this seemingly paradoxical characteristic of DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> genes, we developed an in vitro assay to investigate the endothelial selection on PfEMP1 proteins. This analysis revealed that DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> genes were preferentially selected on diverse endothelial cell types and that multiple adhesion domains in DC8 variants bind host receptors with widespread endothelial distribution (brain, heart, lung, and bone marrow). This unexpected adhesion property could contribute to parasite fitness and at least partially explain why these severe malaria adhesion types tend to be expressed in malaria naÃ¯ve hosts and have been retained in the parasite population.</p>

                <p>Prior to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-IE selection, endothelial cells were compared for surface receptor expression. All of the endothelial cells stained positively for the endothelial cell makers von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and PECAM1 (CD31) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s005">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In addition, we found that the rolling adhesion receptor ICAM1 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Cooke1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Ho1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> is highly expressed by over 90% of transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cells (THBMEC), human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC), and human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC), but was expressed at much lower levels and on only 25% of bone marrow endothelial cells (CDC-BMEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s005">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

HPMEC had the highest CD36 expression levels and greatest percentage of surface positive cells (33%), while CD36 was expressed on less than 5% of HCMEC, THBMEC, and CDC-BMEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s005">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) was moderately expressed by THBMEC, but was weak or absent on other endothelial cells. Endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM1) and fractalkine (CX3CL1) were generally not expressed on any resting endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s005">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Lastly, THBMEC expressed little or no intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM2), whereas it was strongly expressed by HPMEC, HCMEC, and CDC-BMEC.</p>
                <p>Similar to primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the starting A4long and ItG-ICAM-1 parasite lines adhered to only a minor subpopulation of non-brain endothelial cells in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The initial binding for both starting parasite lines was strongly dependent on CD36 (30â90% inhibition via anti-CD36 antibodies) and partially dependent on ICAM1 (10â40% inhibition with anti-ICAM1 antibodies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g002">Figure 2AâB</xref>). However, after panning the parasites three times on each of the non-brain endothelial cell lines, binding levels increased 3â10 fold for the different selected parasite lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and the IEs exhibited a new dispersed binding phenotype on all of the different endothelial cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, all six sets of parasites selected on the non-brain endothelial cells had acquired a new binding phenotype and were no longer dependent on CD36 or ICAM1 for endothelial binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The only minor exception was the A4long parasite line selected on HPMEC cells, which was weakly inhibited (â¼20%) by anti-CD36 and anti-ICAM1 antibodies. In summary, panning on non-brain endothelial cells selected for new parasite adhesion types that displayed a more dispersed binding phenotype and were not as dependent on CD36 or ICAM1 for adhesion.</p>

                <p>In addition to the 4 major <italic>var</italic> transcripts selected on all non-brain endothelial types, there were also some tissue-specific <italic>var</italic> transcripts. For instance, <italic>IT4var62</italic> and <italic>IT4var66</italic> (group C) were expressed by the starting A4long parasite line prior to selection and remained expressed at the same or a slightly reduced proportion of the total <italic>var</italic> transcripts in parasites selected on pulmonary and cardiac endothelial cells. However, they were down-selected in bone marrow endothelial cells and were not selected in the ItG-ICAM-1 parasite line. In addition, <italic>IT4var4/var2CSA</italic> (group E) was selected on bone marrow endothelial cells. Conversely, the starting <italic>IT4var16</italic> transcript in the ItG-ICAM-1 parasite line was strongly down-selected in all of the endothelial panned parasite lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g003">Figure 3</xref>), despite the fact that IT4var16 binds CD36 and ICAM-1 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Smith3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> and all of the endothelial cells were strongly surface positive for ICAM1, except for CDC-BMEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s005">Table S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>To rule out the possibility that the parasites expressing DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1s were selected as a consequence of more rapid growth rather than more robust adhesion to the various endothelial cell types, we compared the growth rate of the starting ItG-ICAM-1 parasite line (ICAM-1 binder) to cloned parasite lines expressing one of the upregulated DC8 <italic>var</italic> (<italic>IT4var19</italic>) or a CD36 binding variant (<italic>IT4var31</italic>). All three parasite lines had similar growth rates over 4 cycles of parasite growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We therefore concluded that the emergence of the parasites expressing DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1s after panning was attributable to the adhesion traits mediated by these proteins, rather than more rapid growth amongst parasites in which these <italic>var</italic> genes had been upregulated. On this basis we determined that the DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> products, which do not encode CD36 or ICAM1 binding activity <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, were likely to be responsible for the new dispersed endothelial binding phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with this broad endothelial binding phenotype, we focused on one of the DC8 transcripts (<italic>IT4var19</italic>) that was consistently upregulated on the four endothelial cell types. TNF-Î± is produced during malaria infection <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and upregulates adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium, such as ICAM1 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, the binding activity of a highly monoclonal parasite line expressing a DC8 variant (IT4var19) <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> did not increase on any of the TNF-Î± activated endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), which suggests that DC8 parasites are not dependent on the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± for tight endothelial binding.</p>
                <p>IT4var19 contains five DBL domains and two CIDR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The DC8 cassette is defined by the tandem arrangement of the first four N-terminal domains (NTS-DBLÎ±2, CIDRÎ±1.1, DBLÎ²12, and DBLÎ³6) <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We previously expressed three of the four DC8 domains and found that NTS-DBLÎ±2, CIDRÎ±1.1 and DBLÎ²12 bind brain endothelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Here, we expressed the remaining four domains in the IT4var19 protein (DBLÎ³6, DBLÎ´1, CIDRÎ²1, and DBLÎ³9) as His-MBP-strepII fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) to investigate whether any of the seven IT4var19 domains discriminated between different endothelial cell types.

All of the recombinant proteins migrated at the expected molecular weight in SDS/PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We were able to produce all but two of the proteins at yields of 100 Âµg/L or more.

                <p>In order to ensure that differences in the observed binding levels were due to differences in the adhesive properties of the endothelial domains, rather than artifacts generated by variations in the quantity of recombinant protein coupled to the beads, the coated beads were analyzed by flow cytometry using antibodies against the C-terminal strepII tag in the recombinant proteins.

                <p>To further investigate the endothelial specificity of different domains, the five IT4var19 domains produced at higher yield were also evaluated in a flow cytometry assay. In this assay, endothelial cells were lifted from tissue culture dishes and then incubated with recombinant proteins. All five recombinant proteins bound in a dose-dependent fashion to THBMEC, HPMEC, and CDC-BMEC, but there was little or no binding of the negative control proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In this assay, DBLÎ±2, CIDRÎ±1.1, and CIDRÎ²1 had the highest binding activity to brain and lung endothelial cells, DBLÎ³6 had moderate activity, and DBLÎ²12 had lower activity. The higher binding activity of the soluble CIDRÎ²1 domain compared to the CIDRÎ²1-coated beads could be due to steric hindrance. Taken together, all seven extracellular domains in DC8-IT4var19 encoded endothelial binding activity and most domains did not discriminate between endothelial cell types, although individual domains did exhibit differences in the level with which they bound to particular cell types.</p>

Of the six, the DBLÎ±2, DBLÎ²12, and CIDRÎ²1 had similar protease sensitivities. In contrast, adhesion of CIDRÎ±1.1 was not affected when THBMEC were pretreated with the three proteases, although there was a slight decrease of CIDRÎ±1.1 binding to THBMEC after treatment with ten-fold higher concentrations of trypsin and chymotrypsin (1 mg/ml). However, protease treatment at these concentrations also degraded the THBMEC membranes, which resulted in much higher background (data not shown). Of interest, none of the IT4var19 domains were sensitive to neuraminidase pretreatment, except for DBLÎ³6. This is the only domain that bound to CHO-745 cells and may interact with a sialoglycoprotein. Based on the differential protease sensitivities, we hypothesize there may be at least three host receptor specificities encoded by the intact IT4var19 PfEMP1 protein.</p>

                <title>DC8 and DC13 CIDR1 domains exhibit widespread endothelial binding activity</title>
                <p>The CIDR1 domain in the PfEMP1 semi-conserved head structure plays a key role in infected erythrocyte binding. This domain has diverged into different sequence types (Î±1, Î±2-6, Î², Î³, or Î´) that differ in CD36 binding activity <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rask1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Group B and C PfEMP1 variants encode CIDR Î±2-6 sequence types that usually bind CD36, while group A and B/A encode other CIDR sequence types (Î±1, Î², Î³, or Î´) that do not bind CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. To investigate binding selection on the group A protein head structure, we produced representative CIDR1 recombinant proteins (Î±1, Î³, and Î´ sequence types) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and compared them for binding to different endothelial cells with a control CD36-binding domain from IT4var14 (CIDRÎ±5). In the coated bead binding assay, var19 CIDRÎ±1.1 (DC8) and var7 CIDRÎ±1.4 (DC13) exhibited strong and dispersed binding to all four endothelial cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). By comparison, var14 CIDRÎ±5, var02 CIDRÎ´1, and var09 CIDRÎ³3 all displayed low and patchy binding to different endothelial cells types. Likewise, in a flow cytometry binding assay with THBMEC, var19 CIDRÎ±1.1 (DC8) and var7 CIDRÎ±1.4 (DC13) bound at high levels, var02 CIDRÎ´1 bound at low levels, and var09 CIDRÎ³3 and var14 CIDRÎ±5 bound at very low or negligible levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). As expected, the positive control var14 CIDRÎ±5 domain from group B was the only one that bound to CHO-CD36 cells, indicating group A CIDR1 domains employed non-CD36 binding interactions.</p>

                <p>We previously showed that 100 Âµg/ml IT4var19 CIDRÎ±1.1 domain could partially inhibit IT4var19-IE binding to brain endothelial cells by â¼50%, but not the DBLÎ±2 or DBLÎ²12 domains <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. When we tested the four new DC8-IT4var19 recombinant proteins, none of the individual domains at 100 Âµg/ml or mixtures of the four domains (total concentrationâ=â100 Âµg/ml) inhibited IT4var19-IE binding to THBMEC, but again the CIDRÎ±1.1 domain on its own inhibited binding by â¼40â50% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In addition, the var7 CIDRÎ±1.4 (DC13) strongly cross-inhibited IT4var19-IE binding to brain endothelial cells (â¼80â90%, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003430.s004">Figure S4</xref>), while the CD36-binding var14 CIDRÎ±5 domain did not. The strong cross-inhibitory activity of var7 CIDRÎ±1.4 could be because it appeared to have slightly higher endothelial binding activity than var19 CIDRÎ±1.1 in the coated bead and flow cytometry binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003430-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that CIDRÎ±1.1 and Î±1.4 subtypes in the PfEMP1 head structure engage in a key binding interaction with brain endothelial cells and that DC8 and DC13 CIDR1 domains may bind the same receptor.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite the importance of PfEMP1 as a virulence factor, relatively little is known about how PfEMP1 binding specificity may influence parasite tropism for tissue sites other than brain and placenta tissue <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Claessens1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Salanti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Fried1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. It has been hypothesized that the adhesion traits encoded by UpsA PfEMP1 variants may confer a selective advantage on parasites displaying these proteins in malaria naÃ¯ve hosts <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Bull1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Bull2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, this concept has received limited experimental investigation. One of the best studied adhesion receptors is CD36 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Barnwell1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Ockenhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This adhesion property is encoded into most or all group B and group C PfEMP1 proteins <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but it is not associated with group A and B/A PfEMP1 variants, which tend to be expressed in individuals with limited malaria immunity and have been associated with more severe infections <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Cham1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>â<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Warimwe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. As CD36 expression differs between microvascular sequestration sites <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, it is possible that diversification of PfEMP1 proteins into CD36 binding and non-CD36 binding variants could be shaped by within-host competition for binding niches and may be a strategy to maximize parasite survival and transmission.</p>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrate that non-CD36 binding DC8 and DC13 variants were the major <italic>var</italic> transcripts selected on diverse microvascular endothelial cell types, including those that mostly lack CD36 surface expression (brain, heart, bone marrow) and those containing a mixture of CD36<sup>+</sup> and CD36<sup>â</sup> cells (lung). Although CD36 is generally thought to be a relatively ubiquitous receptor on microvascular endothelial cells, it is not expressed on the endothelial lining of brain, placenta or bone marrow sinuses and is strongly expressed by liver, spleen, and lung endothelial cells <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Turner2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Candal1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Schweitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Our findings suggest that the importance of non-CD36 expressing vascular beds may have been underappreciated for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-IE sequestration and further indicate that DC8 and DC13 variants may even outcompete CD36 binding variants in sequestration sites with variegated CD36 levels, as observed in the lung endothelial selection. Of interest, the binding activity of a DC8-infected erythrocyte was not increased on TNF-Î± activated endothelial cells, although this is known to upregulate potential cytoadhesion receptors on endothelial cells, such as ICAM1 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. It is possible that this lack of TNF-Î± dependence may give DC8 variants an advantage at early stages of malaria infection before widespread endothelial activation.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, all seven DBL and CIDR domains in IT4var19 DC8 variant bound endothelial cells and individual PfEMP1 domains were largely not discriminatory between brain, lung, heart and bone marrow endothelial cells. Based on protease-treatments, there appear to be at least three different host receptor binding specificities on brain endothelial cells. Although the binding of individual PfEMP1 domains may not always reflect the activity of native protein, several PfEMP1 adhesion traits such as CD36, ICAM1, complement receptor 1, and others have been mapped to individual PfEMP1 domains <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Rowe1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This analysis suggests that DC8 domains do not bind the common cytoadhesion receptors CD36 and ICAM1. Future work will need to define the DC8 binding partner interactions. The redundancy of DC8 domain-receptor interactions may strengthen the IE-endothelial interaction. Indeed, most individual DC8 domains were unable to inhibit IE binding to brain endothelial cells, except for CIDRÎ±1.1 <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Avril1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These findings have important implications because it suggests there is likely to be competition between different microvascular sites for DC8 parasite binding depending on an array of host receptor expression levels. Furthermore, it is possible that non-brain microvascular sites may be reservoirs for cerebral binding variants and anti-adhesion strategies focused on individual domains may only be partially effective.</p>
              <p>The CIDR1 domain in the PfMEP1 protein head structure plays a key role in IE binding and has diverged into CD36 binding and non-binding types <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Janes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Robinson1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Our findings confirm that group A CIDR1 domains are not under strong selection to bind CD36 and suggest that DC8 and DC13 CIDR1 domains bind a common receptor with widespread endothelial distribution. By comparison, two other Group A head structures (CIDRÎ³ and Î´) bound at low or negligible levels to all of the endothelial cells tested. CIDRÎ³ and CIDRÎ´ are frequently found in PfEMP1 variants that bind red blood cells and facilitate infected erythrocyte rosetting with uninfected erythrocytes <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Ghumra1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Thus, it remains to be established if the CIDR1 domain is under strong endothelial binding selection in rosetting parasite variants.</p>
              <p>Although DC8 and DC13 <italic>var</italic> gene expression is not restricted to severe malaria infections <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Lavstsen2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, it might be expected that potentially deadly adhesive traits would be at a selective disadvantage. Survival versus reproductive trade-offs is a key concept in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary theory predicts that fast growing parasites benefit from a larger pool to produce transmissible gametocytes but there is a trade-off with increasing risk of host death <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Pollitt1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Reece1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Whereas antigenic variation is generally thought to increase transmission success by enhancing infection chronicity, specific <italic>P. falciparum</italic> adhesion traits such as placental binding may increase parasite transmission success by providing new transmission opportunities <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Deitsch1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Our findings support the hypothesis that DC8 and DC13 variants give parasites a growth and transmission advantage and could also explain why they tend to be expressed in early childhood infections, before children in malaria-endemic areas have acquired antibodies that can effectively counter this set of PfEMP1 proteins. In a related finding that is also of interest, bone marrow aspirates from patients with cerebral malaria showed IEs adhering within bone marrow sinuses <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Wickramasinghe1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Bone marrow sinuses offer close proximity to reticulocytes that are preferentially invaded by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003430-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> and it is also the major site of gametocyte sequestration <xref rid="ppat.1003430-Smalley1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. It will be interesting to investigate if these traits are linked, such that bone marrow sequestration promotes red blood cell invasion efficiency or sexual conversion efficiency.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this study suggests that the severe malaria associated DC8 variants are under selection to bind to diverse microvascular endothelial cells via multiple domain-receptor interactions. This avid binding trait may enhance parasite growth and confer a transmission advantage sufficient to keep these potentially deadly adhesion traits in the <italic>var</italic> gene repertoire, despite their association with relatively rare instances of severe disease in immunonaÃ¯ve hosts.</p>

                <title>Binding of PfEMP1 domain-coated Dynal beads to human endothelial cells</title>
                <p>For the coated bead binding assay, recombinant proteins were coated onto 10<sup>7</sup> sheep anti-mouse IgG coated Dynal beads (Invitrogen, 110.31) using 1.5 Âµl of a mouse anti-MBP monoclonal antibody diluted into PBS/0.1% BSA at 1 Âµg/Âµl (NEB, E8032S) for 1 hr under rotating agitation. After two washes, antibody-coupled beads were incubated with His-MBP-insert-StrepII fusion protein or His-MBP protein for 1â2 hrs, followed by two washes. The extent of recombinant protein binding to beads was analyzed by labeling beads with rabbit polyclonal anti-StrepII tag antibodies (1/40, Genscript, NWSHPQFEK antibody, A00626) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa488 coupled antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1/500) and detecting by flow cytometry in an LSRII (Becton Dickinson) and FLOWJO 8.1 software (Tree Star Inc.). For the binding assay, THBMEC, HPMEC, HCMEC, CDC-BMEC, CHO-CD36, or negative control CHO-745 cells were grown on coated 8-well slides. One million protein coupled Dynal beads were resuspended in 0.3 ml of binding medium (RPMI-1640 medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 6.8) and added to each monolayer of cells per well. After 1 hr incubation at 37Â°C, each slide was inverted into a 37Â°C warmed bath of binding medium for 10 min to let the unbound beads fall by gravity. Slides were then fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. The number of beads adhering per endothelial cells was evaluated in random fields under 200Ã magnification and pictures were captured using the Qcapture software.</p>
                <p>For flow cytometry binding analysis with soluble PfEMP1 recombinant proteins, endothelial cells were lifted by 10 mM EDTA and 5Ã10<sup>5</sup>cells/ml were incubated with different concentrations of PfEMP1 recombinant proteins for 30 min on ice. After washing with 1Ã PBS, recombinant protein binding was detected by labeling with rabbit polyclonal anti-StrepII tag antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa488 coupled antibodies (Molecular Probes). Flow cytometry was done as described above.</p>

                <title>Binding of DC8-<italic>var19</italic> recombinant proteins to THBMEC after protease digestion</title>
                <p>For each protease treatment, one T25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask of THBMEC was seeded to reach confluency on the day of experiment. Cells were first washed once with 1Ã PBS. Then, either 2 ml of Trypsin TPCK (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma T1426) or Chymotrypsin TLCK (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma C3142) was applied for 15 min at 37Â°C. Digestion was stopped by adding 2 ml Trypsin-Chymotrypsin inhibitor (Soybean, 1 mg/ml, Sigma T9777) for 5 min. For neuraminidase digestion, 2 ml at 0.1 unit/ml was incubated with the cell monolayer for 30 min at 37Â°C before stopping the reaction with THBMEC media for 5 min. For the V8 protease digestion, a T25 cm<sup>2</sup> of THBMEC cells were lifted with 10 mM EDTA and pelleted. Cells were resuspended into 0.5 ml V8 protease solution (10 unit/ml, endoproteinase Glu-C, Roche #10791156001) for 5 min at 37Â°C. V8 protease digestion was stopped by adding THBMEC media and cells were washed with washing buffer. Flow cytometry was done as described above.</p>
