weight loss. However, methods of measuring self-weighing frequency need to

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P2">Data came from a 24-month RCT. Participants received 12 months of a
behavioral weight loss program and were randomly assigned to: 1) daily
self-weighing, 2) weekly weighing, or 3) no weighing (excluded from
analysis). Objective weighing frequency was measured by Wi-Fi enabled scales
and self-reported weighing frequency was assessed every 6 months by
questionnaire. Objective weights were categorized to match the scale of the
self-report measure.</p>

                <sec id="S3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="P3">At 12 months, there was 80.8% agreement between self-reported
and objective weighing frequency (weighted kappa = 0.67, p &lt;
0.001). At 24 months, agreement decreased to 48.5% (kappa =
0.27, p &lt; 0.001). At both time points where disagreements occurred,
self-reported frequencies were generally greater than objectively assessed
weighing. Both self-reported and objectively assessed weighing frequency
were associated with weight loss at 12 and 24 months (p’s &lt;
0.001).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="P4">Self-reported weighing frequency is modestly correlated with
objective weighing frequency; however, both are associated with weight
change over time. Objective assessment of weighing frequency should be used
to avoid overestimating actual frequency.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Self-monitoring is a central recommendation for behavioral weight loss
interventions [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In many cases, this includes regularly
recording dietary intake, physical activity, and body weight [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While self-monitoring of physical activity
and diet are recommended each day, or multiple times per day, the recommendations
for self-weighing (hereafter referred to as “weighing”) are less
clear. Many interventions provide recommendations for weighing, although these vary
and are often not included in published descriptions of interventions. As an
example, weighing is mentioned in the description of the Look AHEAD trial but the
frequency of weighing is not explicit [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the publicly available intervention materials, weighing
frequency is left up to the individual with the instructions “Weigh yourself
at the same time of day. We think you should weigh yourself at least once per week
on the same day each week. More often is fine if you’d like”
[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P6">Greater frequency of self-monitoring weight has been associated with greater
weight loss across multiple studies [e.g., <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A systematic review of these studies
concluded that although the association between weighing and weight loss is present
in most studies, the effect sizes and measurement of weighing frequency are
inconsistent [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to these
inconsistencies, it is currently unknown which frequency of weighing is required to
achieve significant weight benefits, and therefore a precise recommendation for
weighing frequency to produce the greatest weight loss outcomes cannot be made.</p>
              <p id="P7">One challenge to determining the appropriate recommendation for weighing is
in measuring how often people weigh themselves when given specific weighing
recommendations. Most studies relating weighing to weight loss have relied on
self-report of weighing frequency (i.e., 9 of the 12 cited in Zheng et al., 2015).
This is potentially problematic for a number of reasons. First, the recall of
weighing frequency often occurs after significant time has passed, typically
included as part of assessments three to six months after the start of a weight loss
attempt. Second, weighing habits may change over time, so reports of average
frequencies may not be meaningful. The challenges of using self-reported behaviors
in other areas of weight loss, including diet [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and physical activity [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been well documented.</p>
              <p id="P8">Weighing frequency can be assessed more accurately by utilizing Internet
connected scales that automatically record and transmit weights and frequency data
to servers. These scales have been used in prior weight loss programs [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but none of these studies have compared objective weighing
frequency to self-reported frequency. Because of the additional cost of these scales
(approximately $100 per scale), it is important to know for measurement purposes
whether these scales are needed or if self-reported weighing frequency is sufficient
to assess the behavior accurately.</p>
              <p id="P9">The purpose of this analysis was to compare self-reported weighing frequency
to objective measures of weighing frequency over 24 months. First, we examined the
degree of agreement between self-reported and objective measures. Second, we
examined the relationships between self-reported and objective weighing frequency
and weight loss to examine the measures’ validity over time.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec sec-type="methods" id="S6">
              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="P10">Data for this analysis came from the Tracking Study: a randomized controlled
trial evaluating the effect of self-weighing frequency on weight loss with
randomized comparisons of daily, weekly, and no weighing conditions (PI: Linde;
R01DK093586; NCT01646086). All participants in the Tracking Study received 32
sessions of the same behavioral weight loss program delivered via six months of
weekly group sessions and six months of sessions tapered to bi-weekly and then
monthly sessions over the course of one year. All groups received the same
recommendations for changing diet and exercise. A broader description of the
intervention has been published elsewhere [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P11">Participants randomized to daily and weekly self-weighing conditions were
provided with Withings Wi-Fi enabled body weight scales (Model WS-30) and
instructions for weighing at home. Both groups were encouraged to weigh themselves
consistently at the same time of day (preferably upon waking) in either light
clothing or without clothes. The daily weighing group was instructed to weigh
themselves each day while the weekly weighing group was instructed to weigh
themselves once per week on the same self-selected day. During the group
intervention sessions, participants were encouraged to adhere to their assigned
weighing frequency. The no weighing group was encouraged to use alternative methods
to monitor progress (e.g., clothing size, feedback from others, energy levels) and
were discouraged from weighing themselves. The no weighing group did not receive the
Wi-Fi enabled scales until they completed the study at 24 months. Because the goal
of this analysis was to compare objective to self-reported weighing frequency, data
from the no weighing condition were not included here.</p>
              <sec id="S7">
                <title>Participants and recruitment</title>
                <p id="P12">Participants for this study were recruited from a mid-sized Midwestern
city in 2012 to 2013 using a combination of print advertisements, radio
advertisements, flyers, and at community events. To be eligible for the study,
participants needed to have a BMI 25-40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, be 18-64 years old,
have wireless internet at home, and be free of significant health conditions.
Participants were excluded if they had significant depressive symptoms, binge
eating disorder, or a history of an eating disorder. A full listing of inclusion
criteria are available elsewhere [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All participants provided informed consent prior to
participating in the study and all procedures for this study were reviewed and
approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S8">
                <title>Measures</title>
                <p id="P13">Self-reported weighing frequency was assessed at baseline, 12, and 24
months via the question: “How often do you weigh yourself?”
Response options were: never, once a year or less, every couple of months, once
a month, once a week, once a day, or more than once a day [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to low response for the
least and most frequent categories, these responses were recategorized as Daily,
Weekly, or Less than Weekly.</p>
                <p id="P14">Objective weighing frequency was measured using data collected from the
Withings scales. Weights were automatically transmitted from the scale to the
Withings website. Research staff downloaded data for study participants each
week of the intervention (49 weeks for cohort 1; 50 weeks for cohort 2; 51 weeks
for cohort 3) and each week of the follow-up period (52 weeks for cohort 1; 50
weeks for cohort 2; 48 weeks for cohort 3). Weights that were recorded within a
15-minute period were counted as one weighing event. The scale automatically
detected whether weights were from the study participants (i.e., the registered
user) or from other users. Only the weights from study participants were
transmitted to the Withings website and were downloaded by study staff.</p>
                <p id="P15">Objective weighing frequency was classified to match the self-report
categories of Daily, Weekly, or Less than Weekly, based on approximately
70% or more of expected weighing frequency. This level of adherence was
selected in order to allow for some missing days (e.g., unreported data capture
errors, participants traveling without access to the Withings scale) while still
indicating a high level of consistency with the self-report categories. With an
average of 50 weeks between assessments, complete adherence to daily weighing
would have yielded an average of 350 weights, therefore participants with 245
weights or greater were classified as “Daily”. Similarly, as
there were 50 weeks between assessments, those with 35 to 244 weights were
classified as “Weekly”, and less than 35 weights were classified
as “Less than Weekly”. Other cut points were also considered and
yielded similar results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental File</xref>).</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="S9">
                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p id="P16">Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4. Missing data were handled using
pairwise deletion where analyses used all available data for that time point and
variables used. Sample sizes (n) are provided separately for each analysis.
Agreement between self-reported and objective weighing frequency were assessed
using weighted kappa statistics [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A Bland-Altman plot was considered to graphically
represent the similarity of the two measures [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, because our data are
categorical and therefore have few points on the graph (i.e., 7 possible
points), histograms showing the frequency of the difference scores are presented
instead [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Objective
and self-reported weighing frequency were tested as predictors of weight loss
using linear regression models, controlling for treatment condition.</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p id="P17">Demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Most randomized participants took part in the
12-and 24-month assessments (90.6% and 83.0%, respectively); there
was no statistically significant difference in assessment completion rates between
study groups at 12 months (p = 0.74) or 24 months (p = 0.57).
Participants who took part in the 24-month assessments were older (p = 0.01;
<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), had a lower starting BMI (p
= 0.02), were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (p = 0.04), and
were more likely to be married (p = 0.001) than those who did not take part.
At baseline, 57.4% (n = 128) of participants reported weighing less
than once per week, 34.1% (n = 76) weighed once per week, and
8.5% (n = 19) reported weighing daily.</p>
              <p id="P18">A similar proportion of participants in both the weekly (5.6%, n
= 6) and daily (6.1%; n = 7) treatment arms did not use the
Wi-Fi scales (p = 0.84); therefore, no objective weights were recorded
during the study for these participants and they were excluded from the analysis. An
additional four participants in each treatment group changed their Withings account
password post-intervention and thus their weighing data during months 12-24 were not
available (available sample size: Daily group n = 103; Weekly group n
= 99). Forty-seven (23.3%) of participants did not weigh using the
Wi-Fi scales during the 12 to 24 month period. These people with included in the
analysis as having zero objective weights.</p>
              <p id="P19">As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, between baseline
and 12-months, average objective weights per week varied by self-reported weighing
frequency assessed at 12 months (F = 23.96; p &lt; 0.001), controlling
for treatment group. Each self-reported category was significantly different the
others on weighing frequency (all p’s &lt; 0.05). Between the 12- and
24-month assessments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), average
objective weights per week also varied by self-reported weighing frequency assessed
at 24 months (F = 20.31, p &lt; 0.001). Again, each self-reported
category was significantly different from the others on objective weighing frequency
(all p’s &lt; 0.05).</p>

                <title>Comparison of Self-Report to Objective Self-Weighing</title>
                <p id="P20">As shown in <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, there were
matched classification for 80.8% and 48.5% of participants at 12
and 24 months, respectively. The weighted kappa for the agreement between
self-reported and objective weighing frequency was 0.67 at 12 months and 0.27 at
24 months; both kappa values were significantly different than zero (p &lt;
0.01). <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> visualizes the percentage
of agreement between self-reported and objective weighing frequency. For
participants for whom self-report and objective categorization differed,
self-report was greater (indicated by a positive difference score; 17.5%
of sample). Similarly, at 24 months (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure
2</xref>), 46.1% of the sample had a positive difference score
indicating a self-report category greater than the objective category. There
were no differences between those who over reported their weighing frequency
versus those who correctly reported on age, baseline BMI, gender,
race/ethnicity, education, marital status, or baseline weighing frequency (all
p’s &gt; 0.05).</p>

                <p id="P21">To test the predictive validity of the self-reported and objective
measures of weighing, we compared the measures’ associations with weight
change during the subsequent assessment. For example, objective weighing
frequency between baseline and 12 months used to predict weight change at 12
months. Self-reported weighing frequency assessed at 12 months was used to
predict weight change between baseline and 12 months. As shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, both self-reported and objective
self-weighing were associated with weight loss at both time points with similar
effect sizes. In each case, weight change was negatively associated with
weighing frequency in all cases (i.e., more frequent weighing was associated
with greater weight loss).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P22">In this analysis, we compared the self-reported frequency of weighing to
objective measures of weighing collected using Wi-Fi connected scales. The
self-reported measure agreed with the objective measurements moderately to poorly,
based on interpretation of the kappa statistics [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Where disagreement occurred, self-report
frequency was generally higher than the objective measure. However, both
self-reported weighing frequency and objective weighing frequency were inversely
associated with weight change, as expected based on prior studies where greater
weighing frequency was associated greater weight loss [e.g., <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="P23">This study is the first to compare self-reported weighing frequency to
objective weighing frequency. To date, most studies that have investigated the
effects of weighing on weight loss have using the same single-item measure of
self-weighing frequency used in this analysis. Similar to these other studies,
self-reported weighing frequency was assessed at dispersed intervals (e.g., every 6
months). This approach has yielded positive associations with weight loss
[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as confirmed in this study. Unfortunately, this
self-reported measurement is likely overestimating weighing frequency, for daily
weighing in particular.</p>
              <p id="P24">The self-report measure asks participants to categorize their weighing
behavior over the past several months into one of seven categories (i.e.,
“never” to “multiple times per day”). These
categories may be insufficient to capture the true frequency of weighing and forces
participants to either over- or under-report their weighing behavior. As an example,
of participants who weighed between 1 and 2 times per week between the 12 and
24-month assessments (n = 28), 32% self-reported weighing daily
while 54% reported weighing weekly, as shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. These participants did not have an option to
select ‘1-2 times per week’ on the survey and were forced to choose
between ‘weekly’ and therefore discount their more frequent weighing
or ‘daily’ and overestimate how frequently they were weighing
themselves. While this study brings to light the limitations of this measure, the
implications of misreporting self-weighing are certainly of interest for behavioral
weight loss intervention development. That is, a better understanding of the impacts
of over or under reporting of self-weighing is a necessary next step in this
research.</p>
              <p id="P25">An important consideration of measures of weighing frequency is the
association with objectively assessed weight change. Both objective weighing
frequency and self-reported weighing frequency were associated with weight change at
12 and 24 months, though to varying degrees. At 12 months, objective weighing
frequency was a stronger predictor than self-report whereas at 24 months, both
measures of weighing frequency were similarly and more weakly associated with weight
change. While we can only speculate why neither measure was strongly associated with
weight change during this later period, one potential explanation is the overall
decrease weighing observed during that period (using either the self-report or
objective measures). It is possible that without consistent weighing, frequency is
less associated with weight loss, although future analyses will be needed to test
this hypothesis. The poorer predictive value of self-reported weighing frequency at
12 months may have been influenced by the intervention study from which these data
were collected. Participants were assigned to either daily or weekly weighing as
part of a comprehensive weight loss intervention. Participants may have felt
compelled to report weighing frequency that matched their assigned treatment group
rather than accurately reflect their weighing frequency. This would have diluted the
predictive association between self-reported weighing frequency and weight loss.</p>
              <p id="P26">To overcome the shortcomings of the current self-report measure, several
options are possible. Based on these results of this analysis, it is recommended
that future studies interested in examining the direct effects of weighing frequency
on weight loss use an objective assessment of weighing frequency, such as that
provided by readily available “smart” scales. When objective
measures are not possible, a second approach is to modify the self-reported measure
to provide more options for weighing frequency by allowing choices between
“daily” and “weekly.” Few participants
(12.6%) reported weighing less often than monthly so removing those options
and instead using a more granular assessment of frequent weighing (e.g., 1-2 times
per week; 3-5 times per week) during a weight loss program may be appropriate. This
new approach will need to be validated prior to use to ensure that recall of this
behavior is possible at this level. In particular, it will be important to assess
whether participants can accurately recall from memory their behaviors over the
prior 3-6 months.</p>
              <p id="P27">This study addresses an important need to validate an often-used measure in
weight loss research. Other strengths of the study include: a long follow-up period
(24 months), the inclusion of treatment and no-contact follow-up intervals to
examine the measures during both phases of weight control, and a sufficiently large
sample to address the research questions. A notable limitation of this study is the
inability to separate self-report of weighing frequency from reporting of
self-weighing frequency to match the assigned treatment group. This study design
likely increased the overall frequency of weighing from baseline, limiting the range
of weighing frequency that could be examined (i.e., most participants reported
weighing at least weekly). Another limitation is related to the reduced sample used
in this analysis: because self-reported weighing frequency was assessed only at
study assessment visits, the approximately 18% of participants who did not
complete the study assessment questionnaires were excluded from the sample. Finally,
the sample used in this study was comprised primarily of non-Hispanic, white women,
though representation of men in this study (36.3%) is greater than average
across weight loss studies [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Future studies investigating self-weighing will need to use a
more diverse sample to enhance generalizability of results. Additional studies are
also needed that investigate the relationships between self-reported self-weighing
and objective self-weighing that do not explicitly provide weighing recommendations
or a structured weight loss curriculum, to better understand these relationships in
a more naturalistic setting.</p>
              <p id="P28">In order to better understand the frequency of weighing that is associated
with the greatest weight loss, an accurate assessment of participant behavior is
needed. Because self-reported weighing overestimates weighing frequency and is open
to error due to social desirability, memory of participants, and other shortcomings,
it will be important for researchers interested in studying the effects of
self-weighing frequency on weight loss to use objectively measured self-weighing
frequency when possible. For those unable to use objective measures, self-reported
frequency may be sufficient for some research questions, but its limitations need to
be considered.</p>
