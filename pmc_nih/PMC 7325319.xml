                <p>Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient arylsulfatase A (ASA) activity, which leads to neuronal sulfatide accumulation and motor and cognitive deterioration. Intrathecal delivery of a recombinant human ASA (TAK‐611, formerly SHP611) is under development as a potential therapy for MLD. We used serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) TAK‐611 concentrations measured during the phase I/II trial of intrathecal TAK‐611 to develop a pharmacokinetic (PK) model describing drug disposition. CSF data were well characterized by a two‐compartment model in the central nervous system (CNS); a single central compartment described the serum data. Estimated parameters suggested rapid distribution of TAK‐611 from CSF into the putative brain tissue compartment, with persistence in the brain between doses (median distributive and terminal half‐lives in the CNS: 1.02 and 477 hours, respectively). This model provides a valuable basis for understanding the PK distribution of TAK‐611 and for PK/pharmacodynamic analyses of functional outcomes.</p>

                <p>☑ Intrathecal delivery of recombinant human arylsulfatase A (TAK‐611) is currently under investigation as a potential therapy for metachromatic leukodystrophy. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of intrathecal TAK‐611 has not yet been reported.
<list list-type="simple" id="cpt1752-list-0002"><list-item><p><bold>WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?</bold></p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>☑ This analysis aimed to characterize the effect of different dosing regimens on the disposition of intrathecally administered TAK‐611, to predict the extent to which the drug may reach and persist in the central nervous system (CNS), and to simulate the predicted PK profile of new dosing regimens.
<list list-type="simple" id="cpt1752-list-0003"><list-item><p><bold>WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?</bold></p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>☑ This model provides the first PK characterization of intrathecal TAK‐611. It suggests that the drug is distributed rapidly from the cerebrospinal fluid into a putative CNS compartment, where it persists between doses.
<list list-type="simple" id="cpt1752-list-0004"><list-item><p><bold>HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?</bold></p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>☑ The model will be used as the basis for exposure–response analyses to evaluate and predict relevant clinical outcomes in patients receiving intrathecal TAK‐611. In addition, these findings may inform PK analyses of other therapeutic enzymes for intrathecal administration.</p>

              <p>In a mouse model of MLD, intrathecal (IT) administration of a recombinant human ASA (TAK‐611, formerly SHP611; Shire, Lexington, MA, a Takeda company) was associated with a reduction in the lysosomal marker LAMP‐1 in the white and gray matter of the brain, suggesting that TAK‐611 may have therapeutic activity <italic>in vivo.</italic>
<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Further to this, a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01510028) of IT TAK‐611 administered via an IT drug delivery device (IDDD) in subjects with MLD has now been completed, and the drug was found to be generally well tolerated, with no drug‐related or intrathecal device‐related deaths or discontinuations.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> In addition, a mean decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sulfatide levels was observed in individuals receiving the two higher doses, 30 and 100 mg every other week (EOW), and the decline in gross motor function was less pronounced in some subjects receiving 100 mg EOW (the highest dose).<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Subjects who completed the phase I/II study could choose to continue receiving TAK‐611 at the highest dose tested (100 mg) in an extension study, which is ongoing (NCT01887938).</p>
              <p>To evaluate and predict the potential efficacy of ERT with IT TAK‐611 more effectively in patients with MLD, there is a need to understand the physiological distribution of the drug and variables that may affect this. Here, we describe the development of a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model based on serum and CSF TAK‐611 concentrations measured during the phase I/II trial of TAK‐611. This model characterizes the disposition of TAK‐611 following IT administration in patients with MLD.</p>

                <title>Subjects and trial design</title>
                <p>The phase I/II clinical trial of TAK‐611 (NCT01510028) was a multicenter, open‐label, dose‐escalation study carried out in accordance with The Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board and/or independent ethics committee at each site participating in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from the parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s) of each patient before enrollment.</p>
                <p>In total, 34 subjects were screened; 24 were enrolled across four dose cohorts (<italic>n</italic> = 6 per cohort). Individuals in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 received TAK‐611 10, 30, and 100 mg (process A), respectively; those in cohort 4 received TAK‐611 100 mg produced using a revised manufacturing process, which increases the levels of mannose‐6‐phosphate and sialic acid (process B; described in Wright <italic>et al</italic>.).<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> A placebo control cohort was not included owing to the unacceptable risk/benefit ratio associated with IT delivery of an inactive comparator. Participants in all cohorts had to meet the following eligibility criteria: confirmed MLD diagnosis (by deficient enzyme activity with an ASA‐deficiency assay in leukocytes and an elevated sulfatide concentration in urine); first appearance of MLD symptoms at or before 30 months of age; ambulatory (able to walk 10 steps with one hand held) at the time of screening; and neurological signs of MLD at screening. In addition, subjects in cohorts 1–3 had to be younger than 12 years of age at screening, whereas those in cohort 4 had to be younger than 8 years of age at screening, with a Gross Motor Function Measure‐88 (GMFM‐88)<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> total score ≥ 40 at the time of screening and ≥ 35 at baseline.</p>
                <p>An IDDD was surgically implanted in each patient after enrollment. All subjects received TAK‐611 via the IDDD EOW for 38 weeks, with the end of study (EOS) defined as week 40, such that up to 20 doses were received in total. If the use of the IDDD was precluded on a scheduled dosing day, TAK‐611 was administered by lumbar puncture. TAK‐611 was produced by Shire (Lexington, MA; a Takeda company) using a genetically engineered human cell line via the original or revised manufacturing process,<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and was formulated at 30 mg/mL recombinant human ASA in an aqueous isotonic solution containing 154 mM sodium chloride and 0.005% polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. Twelve subjects missed one or more doses of TAK‐611 (six subjects missed one dose, five subjects missed two doses, and one subject missed three doses). All subjects who completed the study were eligible to continue to receive TAK‐611 as part of an extension study, which is ongoing (NCT01887938).</p>

                <title>Sampling and analytical methods</title>
                <p>Serum samples used for measurement of TAK‐611 concentrations were collected at the time of the first dose (week 0) and the last dose (week 38). Samples were collected 1 hour before injection and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after completion of the injection. TAK‐611 concentrations in CSF were measured in single samples collected before injection at baseline and initially every 2 weeks thereafter, with the frequency reduced to every 4 weeks via protocol amendment, until EOS. The presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) was determined in serum and CSF samples collected at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter until EOS. Serum and CSF samples could not be obtained for all subjects at all planned time points; the model was developed based on all available measurements.</p>
                <p>All TAK‐611 and ADA assays were performed by Covance Laboratories (Chantilly, VA). TAK‐611 concentrations in serum and CSF were measured using validated enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay methods, which had a detection range of 19.5–1,250 ng/mL. The presence of ADAs was determined in serum and CSF using an electrochemiluminescence bridging immunoassay (Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC, Rockville, MD) that utilized biotinylated and sulfo‐tagged TAK‐611 for capture and detection, respectively. ADA‐positive samples were subsequently assessed for titer and neutralizing activity using an arylsulfatase A activity assay with 4‐nitrocatechol sulfate as the substrate.</p>

                <title>PK modeling</title>
                <p>To be included in the PK analysis, subjects needed to have received at least one dose of TAK‐611 and to have had at least one CSF or serum TAK‐611 concentration measurement recorded. Dosing, covariate, ADA, and TAK‐611 concentration data from the study were merged, formatted for analysis, and saved as comma‐delimited text files in version 3.2 or above of R (R Foundation; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). Although predose TAK‐611 concentrations in the CSF were generally recorded 14 days after the previous dose in line with the EOW regimen, some subjects missed one or more TAK‐611 doses or CSF sampling events. On occasions when doses were missed, subsequent predose TAK‐611 concentrations in the CSF used in model development were, therefore, recorded &gt; 14 days after the previous dose. TAK‐611 concentrations reported as being below the limit of quantification (BLOQ) were flagged in the dataset and excluded from the analysis, as attempts to treat the missing data as censored using likelihood‐based methods<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> were unsuccessful. Covariate data were excluded from the analysis if &gt; 10% of the values were missing; otherwise, missing values were imputed using a single imputation method based on the available data. Missing ADA values were filled in using linear interpolation between the measured values.</p>
                <p>R was used to assemble datasets and to produce plots and summaries of the data; population PK analyses were performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling software (NONMEM, version 7.3; ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD). TAK‐611 concentrations in CSF and serum were modeled simultaneously with differential equations using the Predictions for Population Pharmacokinetics subroutine ADVAN13, designed for solving mixed systems of stiff and nonstiff nonlinear differential equations. The first‐order conditional estimation with interaction estimation method was used to estimate fixed effects (θs) and random effects (interindividual variability: ƞs; residual variability: Ɛ); the distribution of interindividual random effects was assumed to be log‐normal with variance–covariance matrix Ω. Concentrations were log‐transformed before analysis and an additive residual error model on the log‐scale was used.</p>
                <p>During model elaboration, assessment of the model and decisions to increase complexity were based on goodness‐of‐fit criteria, including the following: visual inspection of diagnostic scatter plots (e.g., observed vs. predicted concentrations); successful convergence of the minimization routine with at least three significant digits in parameter estimates; plausibility of parameter estimates; precision of parameter estimates; and correlation between model parameter estimation errors (e.g., correlation between η<italic>CL</italic> and η<italic>V</italic>
<sub>central</sub>) &lt; 0.95. All parameter estimates were reported with a measure of estimation uncertainty using the standard error of the estimates (obtained from the NONMEM $COVARIANCE step). Age and weight were the main covariates included in the PK modeling; the ADA covariates (titer and neutralizing activity) were evaluated graphically. The model was used to estimate subject‐specific PK parameters, which were reported and summarized. Confidence intervals (CIs) for parameter estimates were calculated via a bootstrap procedure.</p>
                <p>The allometric model used to evaluate weight‐based scaling was described by the following equations:<disp-formula id="cpt1752-disp-0001"><mml:math id="nlm-math-1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TV</mml:mtext><mml:mi>_</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>central</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mtext>central</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=""><mml:mfrac><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>15</mml:mn><mml:mtext>kg</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>

                <p>Initial model development was based on a single CSF compartment connected via a transit compartment to a single central serum compartment. However, this starting model was unable to accommodate the observed CSF concentration data. The inclusion of a compartment peripheral to CSF, potentially representing the central nervous system (CNS) brain tissue, greatly improved the prediction of CSF data without adversely affecting the prediction of serum data. Model fit (as assessed by the Bayesian information criterion) was further improved by replacing weight‐based allometric scaling of the CSF and CNS volumes with an age‐based scaling method, which incorporated data on volumetric changes in CSF and white and gray matter in children aged 1–120 months.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>

                <p>In addition to subject age, which was included in the model as described above, several other covariates were analyzed to determine their potential influence on the PK model. One of these was the drug‐manufacturing process: subjects in cohorts 1–3 received TAK‐611 manufactured using the original process (process A), whereas those in cohort 4 received TAK‐611 manufactured using a revised process (process B; described in Wright <italic>et al.</italic>).<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> The estimated bioavailability of TAK‐611 produced using process B (0.948; 95% CI: 0.546, 1.350) was not significantly different from that of TAK‐611 produced using process A (reference value of 1).</p>
                <p>Subject weight was also considered as a potential covariate for the systemic components of the model (clearance and <italic>V</italic>
<sub>central</sub>). Baseline weight was used in initial model development, but it was considered that accounting for changes in the weight of subjects throughout the study might improve model performance. Continuous weight was calculated using linear interpolation between quarterly weight measurements; however, as may be expected given the relatively short study time and limited changes in body weight, inclusion of this variable in the model did not improve the fit of the data (objective function value increased by 3.649).</p>

                <p>The PK model was applied to simulate concentrations of TAK‐611 in the CSF and CNS over time for different dose regimens, using a weekly PK sampling simulation for all regimens (<bold>Figure </bold>
<xref rid="cpt1752-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). At 100 mg EOW, the simulation predicted that it would take ~ 16 weeks to achieve steady‐state, which is consistent with the dosing interval of 2 weeks and the median terminal half‐life of distribution from the CNS brain tissue of 477 hours (2.8 weeks).</p>
                <p>Higher trough concentrations were maintained when an initial weekly dosing regimen was simulated (weekly dosing for 12 weeks with TAK‐611 100 or 150 mg, followed by dosing EOW) compared with the 100 mg EOW regimen (<bold>Figure </bold>
<xref rid="cpt1752-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material"><bold>S2</bold></xref>). Consistent with the transition from weekly to EOW dosing, these simulations were associated with a predicted rapid accumulation of TAK‐611 to a high concentration in both the CSF and CNS, followed by a fall toward the lower steady‐state concentration. The highest predicted steady‐state TAK‐611 concentrations overall were observed using a 150 mg weekly dosing simulation throughout the 2‐year period, with concentrations approximately twice as high as those observed with the simulation of 150 mg initial weekly dosing followed by 150 mg EOW, in both the CSF and CNS. The simulations also suggested that use of an age‐based dosing scenario, in which the dose was increased in line with age, would generally achieve more consistent steady‐state trough concentrations of TAK‐611 over time for all three age groups (data not shown).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The aim of this analysis was to develop a population PK model to describe the disposition of TAK‐611 following IT administration in patients with MLD. We found that the sparse CSF concentration data and dense serum concentration data from the phase I/II trial of IT TAK‐611 were well characterized by a model that included a putative CNS tissue compartment alongside central CSF and serum compartments. Evaluation of the model generally confirmed its ability to reproduce observed measurements effectively at the individual and population levels, supporting its further use. We anticipate that development of pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses based on this PK model is likely to be an important next step for evaluating and predicting treatment outcomes in patients receiving this investigational therapy.</p>
              <p>Although our initial model was based on serum and CSF compartments only, we found that an additional compartment peripheral to the CSF was necessary to characterize the data. We inferred that this may represent a component of brain tissue in the CNS. Potential mechanisms by which TAK‐611 could enter the brain parenchyma include transependymal movement from ventricles through ependymal cells via gap junctions,<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> and perivascular and paravascular (glymphatic) movement via the pia/glia limitans.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Inclusion of a transit compartment in the model was necessary to account for the delayed appearance of TAK‐611 in serum, which is likely to reflect CSF drainage into the systemic circulation via the glymphatic and lymphatic systems.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>
</p>
              <p>Body weight was used as a covariate to allometrically scale the systemic components of the model. Incorporation of predicted age‐based CSF and CNS volumes<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> in place of body weight‐based volumes improved the overall fit of the model. Brain size (white matter, gray matter, and CSF volumes) develops on a different timescale to body weight, with rapid development during the first years of life and stabilization by age 4–5 years.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The use of different scaling methods for the brain and systemic components of the model, therefore, accommodated for these different physical maturation rates of the brain and the rest of the body. In addition, the relationship between age and weight is often more complex in children with late‐infantile MLD than in healthy children. Body weight in children with MLD can be substantially reduced for age, partly as a result of progressive paralysis and loss of muscle mass owing to limited use,<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> whereas the correlation between age and brain size is relatively preserved by comparison. The use of age and body weight to scale different components of the model may allow further model scaling to more accurately simulate exposures in patients younger than those in this trial.</p>
              <p>The individual parameter estimates provided further insights into TAK‐611 disposition. The median transit half‐life of TAK‐611 from CSF to serum (1.19 hours) is consistent with the physiological rate of CSF turnover of four to six times per day.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> In addition, the long terminal half‐life of TAK‐611 in the putative CNS compartment (almost 3 weeks) suggests significant uptake into brain tissue with a slow release back to the CSF, which would allow the drug to persist in the brain between doses delivered EOW. This extended persistence is likely to be important for the intended target site of the drug within the lysosomes of brain white‐matter cells.</p>
              <p>The investigation of several covariates during model development gave important insights into variables that may affect IT TAK‐611 disposition. The comparable PKs of TAK‐611 produced using the original and revised manufacturing processes was consistent with findings from nonclinical comparability studies,<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> and supports the relevance of the PK model for patients receiving TAK‐611 produced by either process A or process B. Incorporation of continuous subject weight as a covariate did not confer any improvement on the serum PK model, which is likely to reflect the relatively limited weight changes in the population during the 10‐month study period.</p>
              <p>Although ADA titers were not included formally as covariates in the model, the graphical evaluation did not suggest a clear dose response for the production or neutralizing ability of ADAs. For some subjects, however, there was an apparent association between high ADA titers and reduced serum and/or CSF TAK‐611 concentrations, particularly in the 10 mg dose group. Further investigations will be required to assess possible implications for treatment efficacy, because the effects of ADAs on treatment outcomes vary for other LSDs.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Over 200 disease‐causing mutations have been identified for MLD; among these, some lead to the production of a nonfunctional ASA protein, whereas others result in heavily reduced levels of ASA expression.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> In the phase I/II clinical trial, genetic analysis suggested that patients with the 465+1G&gt;A null mutation, which is predicted to result in negligible levels of endogenous ASA, may be more likely to produce ADAs than individuals with other mutation types. These findings require further validation, but are consistent with previously reported associations between severe gene deletions/rearrangements and an increased likelihood of ADA production for other protein‐based therapies.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>
</p>
              <p>Simulations of TAK‐611 trough concentrations in the CSF and CNS suggested that PK steady‐state is achieved after ~ 16 weeks of treatment with the 100 mg EOW regimen, consistent with the predicted median TAK‐611 elimination half‐life of 477 hours for the CNS. Although dosing scenarios higher than 100 mg EOW were not evaluated in the phase I/II clinical study, the higher trough concentrations of TAK‐611 predicted when simulating the 150 mg weekly dose or initial weekly dosing for 12 weeks with 100 or 150 mg may support further investigation of these alternative regimens. The nonclinical studies of TAK‐611 did not measure a steady‐state trough concentration in the CSF, which could have been used to define a target concentration for these simulations. The observed clinical effects on decreased CSF sulfatides, motor function, and brain tissue changes will require further evaluation to identify a target clinical CSF concentration.</p>
              <p>Although the data were generally well characterized by the PK model, it is important to consider the limitations of the approach. As may be expected for studies involving rare diseases, the study sample size was small, leading to a lack of precision, especially in interindividual variability estimates. In addition, missed doses and measurements for some subjects further reduced the amount of data available for model development. However, missed doses may also have helped to improve the estimates of TAK‐611 terminal half‐life in the CNS, by providing CSF concentrations that were measured &gt; 2 weeks after the previous dose. The sparse sampling of CSF TAK‐611 concentrations also presented a challenge during model development, and the description of the concentration profile and model parameter estimates could be improved by recording CSF TAK‐611 levels at one or more additional time points. In addition, the inability to include ADA titer as a formal covariate during model development may have biased certain results; for example, efficacy predictions in future PK/PD modeling may be underestimated. The age‐based scaling applied to the model may also have been further improved by using observed CNS and CSF volumes obtained via brain magnetic resonance imaging from the children in this study given that children with MLD tend to have slightly reduced gray matter volumes relative to healthy children.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>
</p>
              <p>Despite these limitations, the PK model effectively characterizes the disposition of TAK‐611 following IT delivery in patients with MLD. The rapid uptake (distribution) and the predicted long half‐life of the drug in the CNS between doses support the use of IT administration as an effective method of delivering TAK‐611 to the intended target site. In the future, this model will be used as the basis for development of PK/PD analyses to explore the relationship between drug concentration in the CSF and relevant functional outcomes for patients, including CSF sulfatide concentrations, brain tissue changes, and motor function outcomes as assessed by GMFM‐88 total score.<xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="cpt1752-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Such analyses will provide important insights into the target TAK‐611 exposure required to achieve therapeutic efficacy. Ultimately, this will help to guide decisions on the most appropriate dosing regimens and inform future development of this investigational therapy.</p>
