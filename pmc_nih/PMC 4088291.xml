                <p id="P1">Older adults experience deficits in working memory (WM) that are acutely exacerbated by the presence of distracting information. Human neurophysiological studies have revealed that these changes are accompanied by a diminished ability to suppress visual cortical activity associated with task-irrelevant information. Although this is often attributed to deficits in top-down control from a prefrontal cortical source, this has not yet been directly demonstrated. Here we evaluate the neural basis of distraction’s negative impact on WM and the impairment in neural suppression in older adults by performing structural and functional MRIs while older participants engage in tasks that require remembering relevant visual stimuli in the context of overlapping irrelevant stimuli. Analysis supports both an age-related distraction effect and neural suppression deficit, and extends our understanding by revealing an alteration in functional connectivity between visual cortices and a region in the default network, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, within the older population, the magnitude of WM distractibility and neural suppression are both associated with individual differences in cortical volume and activity of the mPFC, as well as its associated white-matter tracts.</p>

              <p id="P2">Interactions with the external environment involve engaging with multiple, competing, sensory stimuli<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Goal-directed, attentional mechanisms orient our limited cognitive resources toward task-relevant information and away from task-irrelevant, distracting stimuli<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that as we age, individuals become increasingly susceptible to a negative impact of distracting information on a diverse set of performance measures, suggesting a diminished capacity to effectively filter task-irrelevant stimuli (i.e., the inhibitory deficit hypothesis)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold and manipulate information in mind to guide subsequent behavior<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Consistent with the inhibitory deficit hypothesis, older adults often experience greater impairment in WM performance in the presence of irrelevant, distracting information<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P3">When an individual is presented with task-irrelevant stimuli, the neural representation of this information in stimulus-selective visual cortices is suppressed via top-down control mechanisms<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. The prefrontal cortex has been established as a source of this goal directed, top-down modulation of activity in sensory cortex that serves to bias subsequent WM performance<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Older adults exhibit a selective deficit in the suppression of sensory based neural activity to irrelevant information that is predictive of their WM performance declines<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Despite the many studies characterizing this age-related top-down suppression deficit<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, the underlying neural mechanisms – notably the role of the prefrontal cortex – and the basis for individual differences within the older population that mediate the impact of distraction on WM performance remain elusive.</p>
              <p id="P4">The primary goal of this study was to explore how individual differences in the structure and function of prefrontal cortical control regions – particularly those linked to the process of neural suppression – relate to differences in suppression and WM distractibility within a population of older adults. Recent evidence in younger adults revealed that a network of distributed cortical regions that are deactivated during cognitively demanding tasks (i.e., the default network<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, notably the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)) are functionally coupled to visual areas that selectively process irrelevant visual stimuli <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, functional connectivity between mPFC and visual cortex is predictive of the degree of neural suppression and WM distractibility in younger adults. Since the mPFC seems to play a vital role in the active suppression of task-irrelevant information, we hypothesized that a functional disconnection between mPFC and visual cortical regions modulates the age-related selective suppression deficit. Although age-related alterations in the function of the default network, such as the mPFC, have been reported<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, a link has not yet been established with neural suppression abilities or WM distractibility in older adults.</p>
              <p id="P5">In the current study, healthy older adults (60-85 years old) engaged in a selective-attention, working memory paradigm during an MRI recording session. Both univariate and functional connectivity fMRI data were directly compared to a previously collected dataset from younger adults (18-35 years old)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, high-resolution structural and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired to probe neural and behavioral relationships within the older group, specifically assessing if individual differences in gray-matter volume and white-matter integrity correlate with measures of neural suppression and WM distractibility in older adults. The experimental paradigm involved 5 conditions presented in blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In two WM conditions, sequential images of two faces or two scenes were presented (i.e., no distraction) and participants were instructed to remember both stimuli over a short delay period and then respond to a memory probe (face-memory (FM) and scene-memory (SM)). In the remaining three conditions, the stimuli consisted of transparent faces overlapped with transparent scenes. Instructions prior to each block designated which stimuli should be remembered, with the other stimuli serving as distractors (face-memory-overlap (FM-O), scene-memory-overlap (SM-O)), or if the overlapping stimuli should be passively viewed with no memory goals (passive-view-overlap (PV-O)). The advantage of this design is that neural indices of top-down suppression of visual cortical activity to irrelevant stimuli (‘suppression’) can be extracted by contrasting activity measures from the overlap WM conditions with the overlap Passive View condition, and behavioral indices of the impact of distraction on WM performance (‘distractibility’) can be obtained by comparing accuracy on overlap WM conditions with non-overlap WM conditions<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Results converge to show that distractibility and suppression deficits in older adults stem from individual differences in the structure and function of the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

                <title>Age-related Changes in Distractibility</title>
                <p id="P6">To investigate age-related changes in WM performance, accuracy and response time (RT) data were subjected to a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA with age (Younger, Older), distraction (Overlap, Non-overlap) and stimulus (Faces, Scenes) as factors. Analysis of accuracy data revealed a main effect of age (F(1,38)=12.36, p&lt;0.001), such that younger participants showed significantly better WM performance (i.e. increased accuracy) compared to older participants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>). In addition, there was a main effect of distraction (F(1,38)=108.11, p&lt;0.0001), such that participants exhibited better WM performance on conditions when stimuli were not overlapped (FM and SM) compared to conditions with overlapped stimuli (FM-O and SM-O). No main effect of stimulus-type (i.e. Faces vs. Scenes) was observed (F(1,38)=1.72, p=0.2). Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between distraction and age (F(1,38)=1.46, p=0.2) and there were no other significant interactions for accuracy data (each p &gt; 0.2).</p>
                <p id="P7">For the ANOVA of correct-only RT, main-effects were significant for both age (F(1,38)=4.08, p&lt;0.05) and distraction (F(1,38)=72.37, p&lt;0.0001), such that older participants responded more slowly for all conditions compared to younger adults and the participants’ responses were slowed by the presence of overlapped, distracting stimuli. No significant effect was observed for stimulus-type (F(1,38)=3.33, p=0.1). In contrast to accuracy data, a significant interaction was observed between age and distraction (F(1,38)=4.07, p&lt;0.05), such that older adults showed a significantly greater impact of distraction on RT in the overlapped conditions vs. non-overlapped conditions compared to the older adults ([FMO+SMO]-[FM+SM]; t(38)=2.02, p&lt;0.05). That is, older adults disproportionately slowed their responses in the setting of distraction relative to young adults, revealing the presence of an age-related distraction effect that impacted WM performance by delaying the speed of recognition. No other significant interactions for RT were observed (each p &gt; 0.2).</p>

                <title>Age-related Changes in Suppression</title>
                <p id="P8">To evaluate age-related changes in the top-down modulation of visual processing, activity measures were derived by modeling encoding-period activity using a general linear model. Parameter estimates (beta values) were computed for correct trials only from a scene-selective region of interest (ROI), the left parahippocampal place area, (PPA)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, which has been shown to be the most robustly activated visual cortical region for scene stimuli<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Note that the FFA was not evaluated in this study, as even younger adults do not display suppression in this region (shown in previous reports<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>) and thus the FFA does not serve as a useful region to explore age-related changes in suppression. In the PPA of younger participants, the data revealed that scene stimuli presented in isolation induced significantly greater activity than face stimuli presented in isolation (bottom-up, stimulus-driven effect) (SM &gt; FM: t(21)=7.12, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). In addition, there was a significant effect of top-down modulation, such that all three overlapped conditions revealed significantly different levels of activation depending on task goals: enhancement of PPA activity when scenes were relevant compared to passive-view baseline (SM-O &gt; PV-O; t(21)=3.33, p&lt;0.005), and significant suppression of PPA activity when scenes were irrelevant compared to baseline (FM-O &lt; PV-O; t(21)=2.34, p&lt;0.05). These three levels of activation (SM-O &gt; PV-O &gt; FM-O) represent a pure, top-down effect because bottom-up information was constant throughout the task. Moreover, the magnitude of the effects for the overlapped conditions fell between the levels attained in pure conditions (SM &gt; SM-O &gt; PV-O &gt; FM-O &gt; FM, p&lt;0.05).</p>
                <p id="P9">PPA data from the older participants also showed selectivity for scenes (SM) compared to faces (FM), such that scenes elicited a greater response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>; SM &gt; FM: t(17)=7.95, p&lt;0.0001), displaying the bottom-up selectivity of this region. In addition, older participants demonstrated neural enhancement when overlapped scenes were task-relevant compared to passive (SM-O &gt; PV-O: t(17)=3.96, p&lt;0.001). However, there was no significant top-down suppression when scenes were task-irrelevant compared to passive (FM-O &lt; PV-O: t(17)=0.10, p=0.9). Since the current experimental paradigm included a direct measure of PPA bottom-up stimulus selectivity (i.e. SM vs. FM), the top-down effects (SM-O vs. PV-O vs. FM-O) can be normalized by each participant’s stimulus selectivity. When the measure of suppression (PV-O – FM-O) was expressed as a percentage of stimulus selectivity (SM – FM) there was still no significant level of suppression for older participants (t(17)=0.76, p=0.5), while enhancement was significant (t(17)=2.27, p&lt;0.05).</p>
                <p id="P10">Univariate data from the PPA were directly compared between younger and older participants using a 2×3 ANOVA with age and conditions (overlapped stimuli FM-O, PV-O, and SM-O) as factors. Analysis revealed a main-effect of condition (F(2,76)=27.23, p&lt;0.0001), but not of age (F(2,38)=0.02, p=0.9). However, a significant interaction was observed between age and condition (F(2,38)=3.59, p&lt;0.03). Post-hoc analysis revealed that younger and older participants did not show significant differences in enhancement at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, SM-O &gt; PV-O: t(38)=-0.68, p=0.5), even when normalized for differences in bottom-up selectivity (t(38)=-0.45, p=0.7), but did show different degrees of suppression, such that younger participants showed significantly greater suppression than older participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>, t(38)=1.83, p&lt;0.05). This finding is consistent with a previous study demonstrating a selective age-related suppression deficit, wherein older participants exhibited diminished suppression of task-irrelevant visual stimuli in the setting of preserved enhancement<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Importantly, this age-related selective suppression deficit exists even when normalized for differences in bottom-up stimulus selectivity (t(38)=1.92, p&lt;0.05), demonstrating that the observed effect is not driven by a loss of visual association cortex (VAC) selectivity in aging<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>

                <p id="P11">To investigate age-related changes in functional brain networks that are associated with neural suppression (‘the suppression network’), functional connectivity maps were generated and compared across age groups. Capitalizing on trial-by-trial variability, whole-brain functional connectivity maps were assessed by correlating activity from the left PPA seed region with voxels from the rest of the brain<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Regions that are highly correlated with a seed region across trials are presumed to be functionally connected, thereby defining large-scale networks associated with activity modulation within those regions. A suppression network map was generated by contrasting the PPA connectivity maps obtained from the FM-O and PV-O conditions (i.e., comparing the condition when scenes were task-irrelevant to the condition when there were no top-down attentional demands)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="P12">As previously reported in younger participants, the suppression network (FM-O &gt; PV-O) includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), retrosplenial cortex (ReSp), and bilateral parietal cortex (PC), which overlaps with the classically described default network<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). However, this same analysis in older participants did not reveal the mPFC to be a node in the suppression network, although PCC and, to some extent, bilateral PC connectivity were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). A difference in PPA-mPFC connectivity between younger and older participants was confirmed to be significant by a whole-brain contrast between younger and older data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). PCC and right PC functional connectivity with the PPA did not show age-related differences, although the left PC did. Interestingly, older adults did show a significant increase in functional connectivity between the PPA and supplementary motor area (SMA) and the PPA and left superior parietal lobule. These network changes may represent a compensatory mechanism in the older brain, which is insufficient to prevent a decline in suppression abilities.</p>
                <p id="P13">These results demonstrate that in addition to the suppression deficit in older participants, the suppression network is significantly altered in aging, notably the coupling between the mPFC and visual cortices representing irrelevant stimuli.</p>

For the goals of this study, it was demonstrated that brain regions of the default network (notably the mPFC and PCC) are functionally connected with visual cortical regions in a manner predictive of the degree of suppression of irrelevant information in the stimulus-selective visual cortex (i.e., in the PPA)<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. Here, we evaluated age-related changes within default network to assess if these changes are consistent with our observed reduction in mPFC/visual-cortical functional connectivity. Default network activity modulation was derived using an independent task, distinct from the main experimental paradigm (see Materials and Methods), in both the younger and older adults, to assess deactivation patterns during an attentionally demanding visual n-back task relative to rest<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

                <p id="P16">It should be noted that this analysis of default network activity identified age-based declines in an mPFC region (center of mass in MNI coordinates [−2 50 4]) that has 25.4% overlap with the age-based decline in mPFC activity identified by the suppression network analysis (center of mass in MNI coordinates [−4 58 0]). Therefore, these separate analyses converge to show age-related declines in a common subregion of the mPFC (overlapping center of mass MNI coordinates [−4 56 4]). To address whether the precise location of these age-related changes in mPFC are consistent with previous reports of mPFC involvement in the default network, an mPFC ROI was created (7 mm radius sphere centered at Talairach coordinates [1 40 16]) from a previous report of age-related declines in default-mode activity <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Default mode activity was averaged within this mPFC ROI for each participant and compared between the two age groups. Confirming our previous analyses, older adults exhibited less mPFC default mode deactivation (t(38)=2.22, p&lt;0.05). This result extends our previous findings to show consistency with prior reports regarding the mPFC location of this age-based decline in default mode processes.</p>

The WM distractibility data demonstrated a prominent correlation with the volume of gray matter in the mPFC (corrected for multiple comparisons), such that older adults with the least mPFC gray matter volume (MNI coordinates: [−2,62,14]) exhibited the greatest impact of distraction on WM performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref>). The suppression analysis also revealed a parallel finding, such that reduced cortical volume within the mPFC (MNI coordinates: [2,62,2]) was associated with reduced suppression of activity within the PPA in the presence of irrelevant scenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Although we report different coordinates for the center-of-mass of these mPFC clusters, there is significant overlap between these mPFC regions at the group level. Taken together, these results reveal a dependency on cortical volume of the mPFC in older adults to resist the negative influence of distraction on WM performance, as well as to effectively engage top-down suppression mechanisms. Interestingly, although the mPFC is one of several nodes comprising the canonical default network, it was the only default network region that was revealed in these analyses.</p>

Our analytical approach involved a series of across age group comparisons and within-group regression analyses of MRI and behavioral measures to capitalize on individual differences between older adults. Several age-related changes consistent with previous studies were revealed: Older adults exhibited: 1) WM impairment<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, 2) a more negative influence of irrelevant information on WM performance <sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>, 3) a deficit in the suppression of activity in visual cortical regions representing irrelevant information<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and, 4) a diminished ability to suppress activity in the mPFC default network region in response to an attentionally demanding task <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>-<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Also, consistent with previous findings, older adults who exhibited less suppression of visual cortical activity associated with task-irrelevant information experienced a more negative impact of distraction on WM performance<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Importantly, several novel results were obtained: 1) Older adults exhibited an alteration in functional connectivity of the suppression network relative to younger adults, notably a lack of coupling between visual association cortex and mPFC. 2) Those older adults with diminished task-induced mPFC suppression exhibited less suppression of irrelevant face information in the PPA and a greater impact of distraction on face WM performance. 3) The magnitude of both PPA activity suppression and WM distractibility were correlated with gray-matter volume of the mPFC, such that older adults with lower volume showed greater WM distractibility and lower levels of suppression. 4) A similar relationship was observed for white matter integrity in prefrontal regions, such that reduced FA values in these pathways were correlated with increased WM distractibility and decreased suppression. Together, these results reveal a novel association between structural, functional, and behavioral measures in older adults, providing converging evidence that anatomical and physiological differences between older individuals in the mPFC, and associated fiber tracts, are associated with the impact of distraction on WM and the neural suppression of irrelevant information.</p>
              <p id="P24">One prominent view of cognitive aging maintains that older adults exhibit a diminished ability to filter task-irrelevant, distracting information (inhibitory deficit hypothesis) <sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. Results from a previous experiment from our lab using sequentially-presented face and scene stimuli, offered a neurophysiological basis for this hypothesis by revealing a selective suppression deficit in stimulus-selective visual cortices of older adults<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

Here, we extend these findings by showing that the suppression deficit is present in older adults even when they are confronted with distracting stimuli that spatially and temporally overlap with task-relevant stimuli. This shows that simultaneous demands for visual processing resources that likely engage biased-competition mechanisms of suppression<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> do not resolve this age-related deficit.</p>
              <p id="P25">The design of the present study further clarified the top-down nature of the suppression deficit. Others have revealed that visual cortical areas become less stimulus-selective in older adults<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Although it seems unlikely that such a change would be the basis of a selective deficit in suppression that occurs in the setting of preserved neural enhancement of relevant information, this possibility could not be directly assessed with previous datasets<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. In the current study, conditions were included that contained no distracting information (FM and SM). Thus, top-down effects (FM-O vs. PV-O vs. SM-O) could be normalized for bottom-up differences in stimulus representation (FM vs. SM) to determine if the age-related suppression deficit occurred through top-down mechanisms. Analysis revealed that the suppression deficit was observed even when normalizing for stimulus processing levels in the absence of distraction, supporting the conclusion that the age-related suppression deficit is due to changes in top-down modulation.</p>
              <p id="P26">Of note, WM RT exhibited differences in distractibility between age groups while WM accuracy correlated with PPA suppression in older adults. Although this could reflect how different types of variance influence these statistical test results (i.e., across group ANOVA vs. within group regression), it might be argued that accuracy and RT reflect independent aspects of WM performance, thereby creating a disconnect between the observed PPA suppression deficit in older adults and age-related declines in WM performance. To address this, a regression analysis was conducted across all participants between distractibility measures of accuracy and RT. Results showed a significant correlation between these measures (r=0.31, p=0.05), supporting previous reports that suggest accuracy and RT are not independent measures of WM performance <sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. Moreover, it should be noted that both age groups exhibited declines in WM accuracy due to distraction, and that older adults were less accurate overall. Therefore, older adults may have disproportionately slowed their responses in the setting of distraction in order to maintain accuracy, which was already deficient relative to younger adults.</p>
              <p id="P27">Importantly, the present results offer novel evidence for a role of the mPFC in distractibility and suppression abilities in older adults: 1) An age-related alteration in the suppression network prominently involves the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>), 2) Activity regulation in regions of the default network, notably the mPFC, is compromised in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), 3) Activity suppression in this region predicts WM distractibility and neural suppression of irrelevant information in older adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), and 4) The structural integrity of the mPFC and its white matter connections are associated with individual differences in inhibitory abilities in the older population: i.e., across-participant regression analysis revealed significant correlations between WM distractibility and neural suppression and mPFC gray matter volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><bold>)</bold> and FA in underlying white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref><bold>)</bold>. Although this data is correlational and does not address whether structural changes in aging are causal of observed functional and behavioral effects, we hypothesize that gray and white matter structural changes precede functional changes and that this induces performance alterations; i.e., increased distractibility. Of note, we are not claiming that the role of the mPFC in these processes is the result of the aging process. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated a role of the mPFC in distractibility and suppression of irrelevant information in younger adults<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. In the context of other studies that have shown the mPFC and underlying white matter are sensitive to age-related changes<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that alterations in the integrity of this region and its distributed networks occurs to varying degrees in older individuals resulting in a suppression deficit and distractibility that exceeds younger adults. Future research will be conducted to understand the root cause of the reported individual variability. In addition, exploring the progression from structural to functional to behavioral changes is critical for a comprehensive characterization of age-related cognitive changes and may be best accomplished via longitudinal studies.</p>
              <p id="P28">Although these data reveal a novel role of the mPFC in cognitive aging, alterations in this brain region in older adults have been reported. From a functional perspective, there are consistent descriptions that older individuals do not suppress mPFC activity during externally-directed tasks to the same degree as younger adults, most notably during more demanding tasks, and this has been associated with performance deficits on those tasks<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. These mPFC changes are often considered to be reflective of more widespread, age-related default network dysfunction<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Functional connectivity between the mPFC and other regions of the default network during tasks are reduced in older adults<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, and this has been related to disrupted cognitive performance<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> and compromised white matter integrity<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, the default network as assessed by resting state functional connectivity is also diminished in aging, and this is associated with cognitive deficits<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>, although this may depend on the method used<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>. The current findings are supportive of these emerging trends in the literature that reveal functional and structural dysfunction of the mPFC and its network connections in older adults, and extend them to deficits in the critical domain of inhibitory function (both neural measures and behavioral consequences).</p>
              <p id="P29">A role of the mPFC in the age-related suppression deficit is consistent with recent findings that this region serves as a prominent node of the suppression network in younger adults, and that the degree of functional coupling between the mPFC and visual cortices is predictive of the neural suppression of task-irrelevant information. Accumulating evidence suggests that the default network is related to introspective or internalized cognitive processes, such as mind-wandering<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> and retrospective and prospective memory<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>.

Consistent with this notion, studies have found that the degree of deactivation and fidelity of this network in aging is predictive of performance<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. We interpret the finding of a relationship between the suppression network and default network in younger adults, characterized as correlated activity modulation between mPFC and visual cortical areas that represent irrelevant stimuli, as evidence that suppression of external, distracting stimuli is coupled to the inhibition of internally-generated, distracting thoughts<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. In other words, a common mode of suppression is engaged for interference with task goals, whether it is present in the internal or external environment. The current finding suggests that dysfunction of the default network in aging, particularly the mPFC, is associated with a disturbance of this relationship, resulting in greater WM distractibility and impaired neural suppression in agreement with others<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P30">The results of the present study support previous reports that demonstrate successful suppression of task-irrelevant information is associated with better WM performance in both younger and older adults<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup>.

                <title>Experimental Design</title>
                <p id="P33">The experimental paradigm was comprised of five similar tasks in a delayed-recognition WM task design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>), similar to previously published work<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Each task consisted of the same basic temporal sequence with only the instructions differing across tasks. All tasks involved viewing two images (Stim1, Stim2), each displayed for 800 ms (with a 400 ms inter-stimulus interval [ISI]) followed by a 8 second period (Delay) in which the images were to be remembered and mentally rehearsed. After the delay, a third image appeared (Probe) for 1000 sec. Each participant was instructed to respond with a button press (as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy) whether or not the Probe image matched either of the previous two images (Stim1 or Stim2). This was followed by an inter-trial interval (ITI) lasting 9 seconds.</p>
                <p id="P34">For three of the five tasks, the Stim1 and Stim2 images were comprised of both a scene and a face superimposed upon each other. Participants were instructed to focus their attention on and remember either the face or the scene, while ignoring the other. In the face memory-overlap task (FM-O), the faces were remembered while the scenes were ignored, and vice versa in the scene memory-overlap task (SM-O). When the Probe image appeared, it was composed of an isolated face in the FM-O task, and an isolated scene in the SM-O task. For the passive view (PV-O) task, participants were instructed to view the overlapped images without trying to remember them, after which they responded to an arrow direction (in place of the Probe image) with a button press. In this way, the PV-O condition maintains the same visual characteristics as FM-O and SM-O, with only the cognitive goals being changed. For the other two tasks, the Stim1 and Stim2 images were composed of a single stimulus without any distracting/overlapping information: a face in the face memory task (FM) and a scene in the scene memory task (SM). The task was presented in blocks of 15-trials with the same condition presented for the entire block. Each condition was presented in two blocks (for a total of 30 trials per condition and 60 total Encode period images per condition), counterbalanced in random order across all participants. Thus, 10 blocks were presented to each participant (2 blocks for each of the 5 conditions), and each block lasted 5 minutes.</p>

Hair and ears were removed digitally, and a blur was applied along the contours of the face as to remove any potential non-face-specific cues. The gender of the face stimuli was held constant within each trial. Images of scenes were not digitally modified beyond resizing and grayscaling. For the tasks consisting of overlapped faces and scenes, one face and one scene were randomly paired, made transparent, and digitally overlapped using Adobe Photoshop CS2 such that both were equally visible. Overlapped and isolated images were randomly assigned to the different tasks.</p>

To ensure participant’s maintained vigilance, they were asked to press a button whenever they saw the exact same stimulus presented twice in a row (10% of stimuli presented). fMRI data were acquired and processed as described below. A contrast was created from the general linear model (GLM) ß-maps for scenes and faces and the most active 35 voxels (~0.390 cm<sup>3</sup>) were selected from the approximate anatomical location for the left PPA (lPPA)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>.

Echoplanar imaging (EPI) data were acquired (FA=90, TE = 25 ms, TR = 2 sec) with 33 interleaved axial slices (with a 0.5mm gap) for a final resolution of 1.79×1.79×3.5mm/voxel (FOV = 23 cm; 128×128 matrix). All data preprocessing was conducted in SPM5 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, England). Raw blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data were corrected offline for slice-timing acquisition and motion-artifacts. To further ensure age-based differences did not arise from group differences in motion-artifacts, movement parameters (X, Y, Z,roll, pitch, yaw) were compared between groups for both mean offset and rate of drift (i.e., slope of movement parameters over time). No differences were observed between groups for any of the 12 comparisons (each comparison, p &gt; 0.6, corrected). A 5mm isotropic Gaussian smoothing kernel was applied using SPM5 prior to modeling the data. In addition to the EPI data, high-resolution T1-MPRAGE images (1 × 1 × 1 mm voxel size; FOV = 160 × 240 × 256 mm, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 3 ms, FA = 90) were acquired to aid in anatomical localizations of activity and to screen for any undiagnosed neurological trauma.</p>

However all participants from both age groups were modeled with the same approach, and so we do not feel this has impacted our conclusions.
