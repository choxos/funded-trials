                <p>Two open‚Äêlabel studies assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Oxbryta (voxelotor) in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. Eight subjects with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30¬†mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and 8 healthy age‚Äê, sex‚Äê, and body mass index‚Äìmatched controls were administered a single oral dose of voxelotor 900¬†mg. Seven patients with mild (Child‚ÄêPugh A), moderate (Child‚ÄêPugh B), and severe (Child‚ÄêPugh C) hepatic impairment and healthy age‚Äê, sex‚Äê, and body mass index‚Äìmatched controls (7:7:7:7) were administered a single oral dose of voxelotor 1500¬†mg, except those with severe hepatic impairment (600¬†mg). There was no apparent effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor based on comparable half‚Äêlife values between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy matched controls. Mean area under the concentration‚Äêtime curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub>) values were lower by approximately 50% (plasma) and 25% (whole blood) in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with controls. Accordingly, dose adjustment is not required in patients with severe renal impairment. Voxelotor plasma and whole‚Äêblood exposures were slightly increased in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Mean AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> values were approximately 9% to 18% higher compared with those of healthy matched controls. Dose adjustment is therefore not required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Voxelotor mean AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> values were approximately 90% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. A lower voxelotor dose (1000¬†mg) is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment. Voxelotor was well tolerated in all treatment groups.</p>

            <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating disease that afflicts approximately 100¬†000 people in the United States and millions worldwide.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0001" ref-type="ref"><sup>1</sup></xref> SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the Œ≤‚Äêchain of hemoglobin that leads to the production of sickle hemoglobin.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0002" ref-type="ref"><sup>2</sup></xref> When deoxygenated, sickle hemoglobin polymerizes and deforms red blood cells (RBCs) into a sickle shape, leading to cell membrane damage and abnormalities.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0003" ref-type="ref"><sup>3</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref> These damaged RBCs block capillaries and undergo hemolysis, which can trigger downstream effects, including anemia, fatigue, tissue ischemia, painful vaso‚Äêocclusive crisis, vascular injury, reduced quality of life, significant end‚Äêorgan damage, and early death.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0004" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0005" ref-type="ref"><sup>5</sup></xref>

            <p>Oxbryta 1500‚Äêmg tablets taken once daily (voxelotor; previously called GBT440) is a first‚Äêin‚Äêclass oral therapy approved for patients with SCD aged ‚â•12¬†years. Voxelotor modulates hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, preventing sickling of RBCs, with potential interruption in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. The most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;10%) include headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, rash, and pyrexia.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref>
</p>
            <p>The pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of voxelotor has been extensively characterized in healthy subjects.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> Voxelotor is rapidly absorbed, with an oral bioavailability of &gt;35% and a median time to reach maximum observed concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) of 2¬†hours in plasma and 6¬†hours in whole blood. The drug binds to protein at 99.8% and has a long half‚Äêlife (t<sub>1/2</sub>). The t<sub>1/2</sub> of voxelotor is approximately 3¬†days in healthy subjects and 36¬†hours in patients with SCD. In healthy subjects, accumulation is approximately 6‚Äêfold, and in patients with SCD the accumulation is approximately 3.5‚Äêfold. In addition, it preferentially partitions into RBCs relative to plasma, which is consistent with a high specificity of binding to hemoglobin, thus maximizing the therapeutic index and potentially minimizing off‚Äêtarget toxicities.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0008" ref-type="ref"><sup>8</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0009" ref-type="ref"><sup>9</sup></xref> The apparent volume of distribution after oral administration is estimated at 754¬†L in plasma, 15.9¬†L in whole blood, and 7.27¬†L in RBCs. Voxelotor exposure increases proportionally with dose for both single and multiple doses. Voxelotor concentrations decline mono‚Äêexponentially, with a terminal elimination phase for voxelotor in plasma, whole blood, and RBCs in a parallel manner and with approximate terminal elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> values of 98.0¬†hours in plasma, 66.3¬†hours in whole blood, and 65.8¬†hours in RBCs. In healthy subjects, a high‚Äêfat, high‚Äêcalorie meal was shown to increase voxelotor area under the concentration‚Äêtime curve (AUC) by 42% and maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) by 45% in whole blood, and to increase voxelotor AUC by 42% and C<sub>max</sub> by 95% in plasma relative to those in a fasted state.</p>
            <p>Voxelotor is extensively metabolized by phase I (oxidation and reduction) and phase II (glucuronidation) processes. Oxidation of voxelotor is mediated primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme CYP3A4, with minor contribution from CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2C9.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> Based on results from the human absorption, metabolism, and excretion study, unchanged voxelotor was the most abundant circulating radioactive component in blood, accounting for 97.5% of the total radioactivity in the blood samples. Three circulating metabolites were tentatively identified in whole blood and accounted for 2.5% of the total radioactivity in the blood samples. Voxelotor and metabolites are primarily excreted in feces (62.6%) and urine (35.4%) after oral administration. Approximately two‚Äêthirds of the administered dose is excreted as metabolites into urine and feces, and one‚Äêthird is excreted as unchanged drug in the feces, presumably as unabsorbed drug. Approximately 0.08% of voxelotor is excreted unchanged in the urine. GBT440 glucuronidation and reduction‚Äêglucuronidation products, which are phase II metabolites, were the most abundant metabolites in urine, accounting for a combined 9.22% of the dose.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0010" ref-type="ref"><sup>10</sup></xref> As the major route of voxelotor elimination is via metabolism,<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> it is important to evaluate the impact of both renal and hepatic impairment on the plasma and the whole‚Äêblood PK of voxelotor.</p>
            <p>Considering that impaired renal and hepatic function may alter voxelotor exposure, studies were conducted to assess the safety and PK of voxelotor in patients with varying degrees of renal or hepatic function and to determine whether dosage adjustments were needed in these populations.</p>

Subjects with severe renal impairment had mean CrCl of 12.5¬†mL/min and lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels compared with those of the healthy matched control subjects.</p>

                  <p>Voxelotor plasma and whole‚Äêblood concentration‚Äêtime profiles are shown in Figure¬†<xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and¬†<xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, and plasma PK parameters are shown in Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Mean plasma voxelotor exposures were approximately 50% lower in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with those of their matched healthy controls. GMRs for voxelotor AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were approximately 50% and 44% lower, respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy controls. In contrast, mean terminal elimination t<sub>1/2</sub> values were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment (mean¬†¬± SD¬†= 63¬†hours¬†¬± 11) and healthy controls (mean ¬± SD = 73¬†hours ¬± 12). Median plasma voxelotor t<sub>max</sub> values were comparable between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy controls, with median values of 5.0 and 4.0¬†hours, respectively, and individual minimum and maximum values ranging from 2.0 to 24¬†hours in both groups. Mean plasma voxelotor CL/F values were approximately 2 times higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in healthy controls. There was no apparent effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor based on similar postpeak mean plasma voxelotor concentration decline rates between both groups (Figure¬†<xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Fu varies in renal disease, making interpretation based on total plasma concentration more problematic. Unbound plasma voxelotor PK parameters are shown in Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. As expected, the Fu of voxelotor was higher in subjects with severe renal impairment (‚àº0.83%) compared with that in healthy controls (‚àº0.38%), leading to comparatively higher unbound voxelotor exposures in those with severe renal impairment. AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf,u</sub> and C<sub>max,u</sub> values were approximately 18% to 25% higher in healthy controls. Mean CL<sub>,u</sub>/F and V<sub>z,u</sub>/F values were 16% and 28% lower in subjects with severe renal impairment than in healthy controls, respectively. However, the individual values (data not shown) show that unbound voxelotor plasma concentrations were comparable between those with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Therefore, there seems to be no effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor based on comparable unbound plasma CL values and the similar postpeak mean unbound plasma voxelotor concentration decline rates between both groups (Figure <xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>).</p>

                  <p>Mean plasma voxelotor PK parameters were lower in severe renal impairment subjects (lower eGFR) compared with healthy controls (higher eGFR); however, no clear trend was observed between unbound plasma voxelotor PK parameters in severe renal impairment subjects and healthy controls. In addition, there was no apparent relationship between voxelotor exposures to eGFR for the total or unbound plasma PK parameters.</p>
                  <p>Mean plasma voxelotor V<sub>z</sub>/F values were approximately 1.5‚Äêfold higher in those with severe renal impairment (mean ¬± SD = 774.8 L ¬± 254.3) than in healthy controls (mean ¬± SD = 502.2 L ¬± 181.0). There was no apparent effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor based on the comparable plasma voxelotor t<sub>1/2</sub> and CL<sub>,u</sub>/F values between the 2 groups; however, plasma voxelotor AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> values were reduced by approximately 50% in severe renal impairment subjects compared with those in the healthy controls.</p>
                  <p>Similarly to plasma voxelotor exposures, mean whole‚Äêblood voxelotor exposures were lower in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy control subjects but to a lesser degree: AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> values were approximately 21% and 14% lower, respectively (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and postpeak mean whole‚Äêblood voxelotor concentration decline rates were comparable between both groups and seemed to decline in a monophasic manner (Figure <xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Mean whole‚Äêblood voxelotor CL/F and V<sub>z</sub>/F values were approximately 33% and 25% higher in severe renal impairment subjects than in healthy controls, respectively. Mean whole‚Äêblood voxelotor t<sub>1/2</sub> values were comparable between severe renal impairment subjects (approximately 54¬†hours) and healthy controls (approximately 57¬†hours). Whole‚Äêblood voxelotor PK parameters were slightly lower in severe renal impairment subjects (lower eGFR) compared with healthy controls (higher eGFR). Whole‚Äêblood voxelotor exposure did not appear to correlate with eGFR.</p>
                  <p>Median whole‚Äêblood voxelotor t<sub>max</sub> values were delayed by 6.0¬†hours in severe renal impairment subjects (24¬†hours) compared with healthy controls (18¬†hours). Furthermore, due to apparent drug partitioning into RBCs, blood:plasma ratios (ranging from approximately 13 ¬± 3 to 61 ¬± 29 in subjects with severe renal impairment and from 9 ¬± 2 to 46 ¬± 69 in healthy controls) show variability, as anemia is associated with renal impairment (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As expected, subjects with severe renal impairment had lower baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit levels compared with those of the healthy matched control subjects (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>

                  <p>A total of 29 subjects were dosed, and 28 subjects (97%) completed the study. The additional subject was dosed in error and discontinued from the study. Data from all 28¬†subjects were included in the safety analyses, and 27 subjects were included in the PK analysis (1 subject had all‚Äêplasma and whole‚Äêblood voxelotor concentrations below the limit of quantification, although they were dosed). Study groups were well matched for sex, age, and BMI, as presented in the key demographic and baseline characteristics (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). All participants with hepatic impairment were taking medications before participation in the study. Furosemide (9/20; 45%) and spironolactone (7/20; 35%) were the most frequently used concomitant drugs.</p>

                  <p>In comparison with subjects with normal hepatic function, the plasma and whole‚Äêblood voxelotor AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> exposures were approximately 9% to 21% higher and 14% to 15% higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. Plasma and whole‚Äêblood voxelotor AUC<sub>0‚Äêinf</sub> exposures adjusted for dose were approximately 90% to 93% higher and 87% to 90% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, respectively. In comparison with subjects with normal hepatic function, whole‚Äêblood C<sub>max</sub> was 19%, 6%, and 39% higher and plasma C<sub>max</sub> was 18%, 51%, and 45% higher in the mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment subjects, respectively. Due to preferential partitioning of voxelotor into RBCs (RBC:plasma ratio range, 67:1 to 111:1), plasma voxelotor exposures represent a small percentage of total voxelotor exposures.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> Thus, the increase in plasma exposure (51%) was not considered clinically significant, and no safety concerns were observed in this group. The median t<sub>max</sub> was similar for all hepatic function groups. Subjects with normal hepatic function and those with mild and moderate hepatic impairment had a similar mean t<sub>1/2</sub> and CL/F. In comparison, the t<sub>1/2</sub> was longer and the CL/F was lower in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared with those with normal hepatic function. The Fu of voxelotor measured at the 4‚Äêhour time point was similar across all groups (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>), and the unbound parameters showed similar results to the bound parameters.</p>

                  <p>In study 2, 11 of 21 subjects (52.4%) with hepatic impairment reported 17 AEs, including 4 of 7 subjects (57.1%) with mild hepatic impairment, 6 of 7 subjects (85.7%) with moderate hepatic impairment, and 1 of 7 subjects (14.3%) withsevere hepatic impairment. No AEs were reported in the subjects with normal hepatic function. The most common AE reported was 7 events of diarrhea in 7 subjects (25% of subjects), followed by 2 events of dyspepsia in 2 subjects (7.1% of subjects) (Table <xref rid="jcph1757-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). All AEs resolved. Fifteen AEs were considered mild in intensity (grade 1), including diarrhea (7 events), dyspepsia (2 events), vomiting (1 event), sinus tachycardia (1 event), pyrexia (1 event), influenza (1 event), ligament sprain (1 event), and headache (1 event). Two nonrelated AEs (nephrolithiasis due to kidney stones and dyspnea due to worsening ascites) were considered moderate in intensity (grade 4). A total of 7 subjects (25.0%) reported 8 AEs that were considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator. These included 6 events of diarrhea, 1 event of dyspepsia, and 1 event of headache. Overall, liver enzymes generally remained within normal range in all treatment groups. For some subjects, liver enzymes were out of normal range after treatment with voxelotor, but these instances were deemed not clinically significant.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Renal dysfunction is a common comorbidity in patients with SCD. In a retrospective analysis from 2007 to 2012, the annual rate of incidence of acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease was 2‚Äê to 3‚Äêfold higher in patients with SCD compared with those without SCD.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0014" ref-type="ref"><sup>14</sup></xref> Liver dysfunction is estimated to have a prevalence of 10% in adults with SCD and is expected to increase in the older population.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0015" ref-type="ref"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>In 2 open‚Äêlabel clinical studies, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of voxelotor in subjects with various degrees of renal or hepatic insufficiency. The studies used a single‚Äêdose design, as voxelotor demonstrated linear, dose‚Äêproportional PK in single‚Äê (dose range, 100‚Äê2800¬†mg) and multiple‚Äêdose (dose range: 300‚Äê900¬†mg) cohorts of healthy subjects.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref> Therefore, the results from the single‚Äêdose studies on voxelotor can be extrapolated to multiple‚Äêdose PK. Due to the preferential partitioning of voxelotor into RBCs, both whole‚Äêblood and plasma PK have been considered where appropriate in these studies. Because voxelotor binds to hemoglobin, whole‚Äêblood concentrations were used to determine efficacy, and plasma concentrations of voxelotor were considered relevant for safety assessments.</p>
              <p>There was no apparent effect of renal function on the excretion of voxelotor based on comparable t<sub>1/2</sub> values between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy matched control subjects. AUC<sub>0‚Äêt</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> values were lower by approximately 50% (plasma) and 25% (whole blood), respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with those in healthy matched control subjects. This is likely due to the lower hemoglobin/hematocrit levels observed in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with the healthy matched control subjects. A single oral dose of voxelotor 900¬†mg, administered under fasting conditions to subjects with severe renal impairment and to matched healthy controls, seemed to be safe and well tolerated. No specific dose adjustment is warranted for patients with impaired renal function, as the excretion of voxelotor is mainly nonrenal, and renal function was shown to have minor effects on voxelotor exposure. However, it is important to note that voxelotor has not been evaluated in patients with end‚Äêstage renal disease requiring dialysis.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>Whole‚Äêblood and plasma voxelotor exposures were 87% to 93% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, whereas those in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment were only 9% to 21% higher compared with those in subjects with normal hepatic function. Voxelotor was well tolerated at a dose of 1500¬†mg in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild and moderate hepatic impairment; it was also well tolerated at a dose of 600¬†mg in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. There was no apparent difference in the incidence or severity of AEs between subjects with severe hepatic impairment at 600‚Äêmg doses and other impairment groups. No dose adjustment was warranted in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. However, based on this increase in exposure in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment to 1000¬†mg is recommended.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> The dose recommendation is limited by the commercially available tablet strength (500¬†mg), and a further dose reduction to 500¬†mg daily would lead to considerable underexposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In both studies, there were no deaths, serious AEs, or subject discontinuations due to AEs. AEs were mostly mild in severity. These safety and tolerability findings are consistent with those reported in voxelotor clinical trials.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0007" ref-type="ref"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0016" ref-type="ref"><sup>16</sup></xref>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, our results indicate that a dosage adjustment of voxelotor is not required in patients with severe renal impairment or in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. A reduction in voxelotor dose to 1000¬†mg once daily is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.<xref rid="jcph1757-bib-0006" ref-type="ref"><sup>6</sup></xref> With this dose adjustment, whole‚Äêblood and plasma C<sub>max</sub> values in patients with severe hepatic impairment are expected to be approximately 25% higher than those in patients with normal hepatic function treated at the Food and Drug Administration‚Äêapproved dose of 1500¬†mg daily. Considering the broad safety margin for voxelotor, the dose of 1000¬†mg in patients with severe hepatic impairment is expected to provide a risk‚Äêbenefit profile similar to that of the dose of 1500¬†mg in patients with normal hepatic function. PK parameters analyzed in this study are not expected to be different in patients with SCD. Therefore, voxelotor may be considered as a treatment option for patients with SCD with renal or hepatic impairment.</p>
