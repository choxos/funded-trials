                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Herbs and spices are rich in polyphenolic compounds that may influence gut bacterial composition. The effect of culinary doses of herbs and spices consumed as part of a well-defined dietary pattern on gut bacterial composition has not been previously studied.</p>

                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The aim of this prespecified exploratory analysis was to examine gut bacterial composition following an average American diet (carbohydrate: 50% kcal; protein: 17%; total fat: 33%; saturated fat: 11%) containing herbs and spices at 0.5, 3.3, and 6.6 g.d<sup>–1</sup>.2100 kcal<sup>–1</sup> [low-, moderate-, and high-spice diets, respectively (LSD, MSD, and HSD)] in adults at risk for CVD.</p>

                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Fifty-four adults (57% female; mean ± SD age: 45 ± 11 y; BMI: 29.8 ± 2.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; waist circumference: 102.8 ± 7.1 cm) were included in this 3-period, randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. Each diet was provided for 4 wk with a minimum 2-wk washout period. At baseline and the end of each diet period, participants provided a fecal sample for 16S rRNA gene (V4 region) sequencing. QIIME2 was used for data filtration, sequence clustering, taxonomy assignment, and statistical analysis.</p>

                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>α-diversity assessed by the observed features metric ( <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.046) was significantly greater following the MSD as compared with the LSD; no other between-diet differences in α-diversity were detected. Differences in β-diversity were not observed between the diets ( <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.45). Compared with baseline, β-diversity differed following all diets ( <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .02). Enrichment of the Ruminococcaceae family was observed following the HSD as compared with the MSD (relative abundance = 22.14%, linear discriminant analysis = 4.22, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.03) and the LSD (relative abundance  = 24.90%, linear discriminant analysis = 4.47, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.004).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The addition of herbs and spices to an average American diet induced shifts in gut bacterial composition after 4 wk in adults at risk for CVD. The metabolic implications of these changes merit further investigation. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03064932.</p>

              <p>Diet, especially nondigestible dietary compounds, shapes gut bacterial composition by serving as the substrates for bacterial metabolism. Evaluation of fecal bacterial changes in response to dietary intervention reveals signatures reflective of intake patterns. Shinn et al. (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) recently showed dietary intake of specific whole foods (almonds, avocados, broccoli, walnuts, whole grain barley, and whole grain oats) could be predicted with 70%–85% accuracy from the relative abundance of 15–22 fecal bacteria. These foods are all sources of fiber, a well-established modulator of gut bacterial composition (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Polyphenols—a large class of structurally diverse chemicals, including phenolic acids (derivatives of benzoic acid and cinnamic acid) and stilbenoids (stilbenes)—are usually poorly absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract and pass into the large intestine, where they become accessible to gut bacteria. In vivo studies show that gut bacteria have a strong influence on the bioavailability and bioactivity of a range of dietary polyphenols (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Herbs and spices are rich in polyphenolic compounds (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) that may influence bacterial composition. An analysis of herbs and spices from the botanical families Lamiaceae (rosemary, thyme, and oregano), Apiaceae (cumin), and Lauraceae (cinnamon and bay leaf) identified 52 phenolic compounds with clear differences in composition by family (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, to date, there has been limited investigation of the effect of herbs and spices on gut bacterial composition. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded pilot study showed that intake of a 5-g capsule containing spices [cinnamon: 1 g (20%); oregano: 1.5 g (30%); ginger: 1.5 g (30%); black pepper: 0.85 g (17%); cayenne pepper: 0.15 g (3%)] resulted in a difference in 26 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) when compared with a placebo (maltodextrin) after 2 wk (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>This suggests that herbs and spices and their phenolic constituents serve as substrates for gut bacteria and induce compositional changes; however, this was a relatively short study, and the herbs and spices were given in capsule form, which is not representative of culinary exposure. Furthermore, the results are potentially confounded by the background diet. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have examined the effect of repeated exposure (longer-term intake) to culinary doses of mixed herbs and spices as part of well-defined dietary patterns on gut bacterial composition.</p>
              <p>The present prespecified exploratory analysis examined the effect of an average American diet (carbohydrate: 50% kcal; protein: 17%; total fat: 33%; saturated fat: 11%; sodium: 3000 mg/d; fiber: 22 g/d) containing herbs and spices at 0.5, 3.3, and 6.6 g.d<sup>–1</sup>.2100 kcal<sup>–1</sup> [low-, moderate-, and high-spice diets, respectively (LSD, MSD, and HSD)] on gut bacterial composition in adults at risk for CVD. It was hypothesized that herbs and spices would affect gut bacterial composition in a dose–response manner in adults at risk for CVD, which is a population where aberrant microbiota may contribute to the development of CVD and other metabolic diseases (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p>

Briefly, baseline testing was conducted on 2 separate days following a 12-h fast and avoidance of alcohol and over-the-counter medication for 48 h. On both days, weight was measured, and a fasting blood draw was taken for analysis of lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, and hs-CRP. On one of the test days, blood pressure and waist circumference were measured. Waist circumference was measured at the iliac crest by 2 nurses while participants were standing with their feet shoulder-width apart with clothing removed from the waistline. Two measurements were taken to 0.1 cm and averaged; if measurements differed by &gt;0.5 cm, a third measurement was taken, and the 2 closest measures were averaged.</p>
                <p>Plasma glucose and serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and hs-CRP were measured in samples from both test days by the Pennsylvania State University Biomarker Core Lab using a Cobas c311 chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Day 1 and 2 values were averaged for data analysis. Blood pressure was measured with an automated sphygmomanometer (SphygmoCor XCEL; AtCor Medical). Measurements were performed in the seated position after a 5-min rest period; 3 measurements were taken, and the average of the last 2 measurements was used for data analysis. If systolic blood pressure was inconsistent (i.e., difference &gt;10 mm Hg), a fourth measurement was taken, and the 2 closest measurements were averaged.</p>

                  <p>α-diversity was calculated by subsampling the ASV table at 10 depths, ranging from 800 to 8000 sequences, for the following metrics: Faith's phylogenetic diversity (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), observed features (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and Pielou's evenness (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). At each depth, 20 iterations were performed to obtain mean α-diversity values for the different metrics. A rarefaction plot was created with the results of this subsampling to confirm that diversity approached an asymptote and slope decreased as depth increased. The mixed models procedure (PROC MIXED, SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used to examine the effect of diet on each aforementioned α-diversity metric. Participant was modeled as a repeated effect to account for the repeated measures crossover design. Diet was modeled as a fixed effect. Diet period was included as a fixed effect, and the diet period × diet interaction was examined for evidence of carryover effects. No significant diet period × diet interactions were observed, so diet period was removed from the final model. When a main diet effect was detected, post hoc tests were conducted and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Tukey-Kramer method. The normality of the residuals was assessed using univariate analysis (PROC UNIVARIATE) to quantitatively evaluate skewness and to visually inspect the distribution and normal probability (<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic>) plots. Selection of model covariance structures was based on optimizing fit statistics (evaluated as the lowest Bayesian information criterion). In the primary analyses, the between-diet difference was assessed. Secondary analyses examined the within-diet change in each α-diversity metric relative to baseline (PROC MIXED).</p>

                <p>16S rRNA gene PCR amplification of the V4 region was completed for all samples. High-quality sequence data were obtained for 195 of 202 fecal samples (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 5</xref></bold>). Overall, sequencing depth ranged from 2937 to 276,710 sequences per sample. A total of 5,578,974 sequences were obtained after quality filtering and merging, as well as chimera, chloroplast, and mitochondria removal. After quality filtering, sequence counts ranged from 1933 to 130,595 sequences per sample for analysis. An overall 195 samples had a sequencing depth exceeding 1000 sequences and were incorporated into the community analyses and a cumulative sum scaling–normalized ASV table.</p>

Values are presented as median (line), IQR (box), 95% CI (error bars), and outliers (circles). Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The mixed models procedure (PROC MIXED) was used to determine the effect of diet on each α-diversity metric.

              <p>In this study, we evaluated shifts in gut bacterial composition following intake of an average American diet with 3 doses of herbs and spices in adults at risk for CVD. Our findings suggest bacterial metabolism of culinary doses of herbs and spices when consumed as part of a well-defined constant background diet. We saw differences in α-diversity between the LSD and MSD, as well as the HSD and MSD, compared with baseline. No difference in β-diversity was seen between the diets. Differences in taxonomic enrichment occurred between the diets. The Ruminococcaceae family was enriched after the HSD as compared with the MSD and LSD, as well as after the HSD and MSD as compared with baseline. These findings suggest that culinary doses of herbs and spices modulate gut bacterial composition within 4 wk in adults at increased risk of CVD.</p>
              <p>α-diversity, or ASV richness, was higher according to the observed features metric following the MSD when compared with the LSD. However, based on the Pielou's evenness α-diversity metric, no between-diet differences were noted. This suggests that the MSD increased the number of ASVs present but not the uniformity of those ASVs’ abundances, possibly because 24 herbs and spices were incorporated into the 7-d menu in relatively small doses; therefore, a limited amount of substrate was available for bacterial metabolism. In further support of herb/spice-induced increases in species richness, a tendency toward a dose–response increase in α-diversity after the spice diets as compared with baseline was apparent according to Faith's phylogenetic diversity metric. However, these within-diet findings should be interpreted with caution because prior to baseline testing, participants were consuming their habitual diets, not the standardized study diet. Substantial variation was seen with all 3 α-diversity metrics, which likely attenuated the results for the between-diet comparisons toward the null.</p>
              <p>Our α-diversity results contrast with Lu and colleagues’ (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) findings of no effect of a 5-g capsule containing herbs and spices (cinnamon: 20%; oregano: 30%; ginger: 30%; black pepper: 17%; cayenne pepper: 3%) on α-diversity after 2 wk when compared with a maltodextrin placebo. The HSD in the present study contained a similar amount of cinnamon to the capsule tested by Lu et al., although the doses of oregano, ginger, and black pepper were much lower in the present study and cayenne pepper was not used. Thus, the divergent findings may be explained by differences in the study duration (4 wk compared with 2 wk), the study population (adults at risk of CVD compared with healthy adults), the spice delivery (part of a diet compared with a capsule), the herb/spice composition (24 compared with 5 unique herbs/spices), or doses tested (0.5, 3.3, and 6.6 g.d<sup>–1</sup>.2100 kcal<sup>–1</sup> compared with 5 g/d).</p>
              <p>We saw differences in β-diversity following the spice-containing diets as compared with baseline, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously because they may reflect a change in the background diets rather than the presence of herbs and spices in the study diets. The lack of between-diet differences in β-diversity in our study aligns with Lu and colleagues’ (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) β-diversity findings.</p>
              <p>At a taxonomic level, the Ruminococcaceae family was enriched after the HSD as compared with the MSD and LSD and after the MSD and HSD as compared with baseline. In alignment, Lu et al. (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) saw enrichment of 4 OTUs within the Ruminococcaceae family. An analysis of healthy females from the TwinsUK registry showed OTUs assigned to the Ruminococcaceae family were associated with lower long-term weight gain (median follow-up: 9 y) after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, calorie intake, physical activity, and family relatedness (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In mice, changes in gut bacterial composition including enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">Clostridia</italic> from the Mogibacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae families were shown to contribute to suppression of diet-induced obesity with exposure to cold temperature (12 °C) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). This suggests that gut bacteria contribute to metabolic pathways that increase energy expenditure to protect against diet-induced obesity in response to cold exposure.</p>
              <p>Capsinoids, found in red peppers, have been shown to increase activation of brown adipose tissue and increase energy expenditure, although to a lesser extent than cold exposure (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Preclinical studies suggest a role of gut bacteria in capsinoid-induced increases in energy expenditure and protection against diet-induced obesity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Therefore, the enrichment of the Ruminococcaceae family observed with the HSD may be in part a response to the capsinoid content of the diet and may confer a lean phenotype. In the present study, the diets were designed for weight maintenance, and there were no between-diet differences in body weight, although after all 3 diets, body weight was slightly reduced from baseline (0.8–1.1 kg). Therefore, future studies are needed to examine the role of herb/spice intake in bacterial-related changes in energy expenditure, body weight regulation, and obesity.</p>
              <p>We saw enrichment of the <italic toggle="yes">Agathobacter</italic> genus after the HSD as compared with the MSD and LSD, and Faecalibacterium was enriched after the HSD when compared with baseline. <italic toggle="yes">Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Agathobacter</italic> are known to produce SCFAs, such as butyrate and propionic acid. Butyrate is the primary energy source for colonocytes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and is essential for intestinal epithelium maintenance, barrier function, and regulation of cell turnover (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory effects in the intestinal mucosa (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In alignment, we saw reductions in proinflammatory cytokines with the spice-containing diets from baseline (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that changes in the gut bacteria mediated the spice-induced anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
              <p>The analyses conducted to predict the functional capabilities of the enriched gut bacteria revealed predicted enrichment of several functional pathways and 1 functional gene after the HSD as compared with the MSD and LSD, which are related to genetic information processing, cellular processes, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Following the HSD compared with baseline, several functional pathways related to genetic information processing were predicted to be enriched, including the mismatch repair pathway, which has a key role in maintaining genetic stability. Herbs and spices are known to have antioxidant properties, such as high free radical scavenging activity and reducing power (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In addition, herbs and spices exert anti-inflammatory effects (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and we observed enrichment of <italic toggle="yes">Faecalibacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Agathobacter</italic>, SCFA-producing bacteria, which may contribute to reducing intestinal inflammation. Further investigation is needed to confirm these predictive analyses.</p>
              <p>In this randomized controlled feeding study, the effect of 4 wk of exposure to mixed herbs and spices on gut bacteria composition was evaluated, to our knowledge, for the first time. Strengths of the study include the controlled feeding design whereby known doses of herbs and spices were provided in the context of a constant, well-characterized background diet, therefore minimizing confounding from other dietary factors, particularly dietary fiber. In addition, self-reported adherence was high. However, this study is limited by the exploratory nature of the analyses, inclusion of a subset of the original study sample that consented to participate in this substudy, and an inflated risk of type I statistical errors from testing multiple outcomes. In addition, we did not screen participants based on prior antibiotic or probiotic use, which may affect gut microbiota composition. Only 1 participant reported taking antibiotics during the study (in diet period 1); information on probiotic supplement use was not collected. Furthermore, 24 herbs and spices were included in the test menus, which limits inferences about the effect of individual ones. In addition, each day in the 7-d menu included different combinations and amounts of the 24 herbs and spices; therefore, a consistent daily exposure was not provided. This study is also limited by the lack of data about habitual herb/spice intake at baseline and the lack of chemical analysis to verify the composition of the test herbs and spices. Prior research has documented differences in microbiota composition in individuals with obesity as well as other risk factors for CVD (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>); thus, the findings from this sample of adults at risk for CVD need to be confirmed in a sample of healthy adults. Finally, PICRUSt2 was used to predict functional implications of the changes in gut bacterial composition; as such, these results need to be confirmed by metatranscriptomics.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the findings of this prespecified exploratory analysis showed compositional shifts in gut bacteria following intake of an average American diet with 3 doses of herbs and spices for 4 wk in adults at risk for CVD. In response to the increasing doses of herbs and spices, there was a tendency toward greater ASV diversity. Furthermore, after a US-style dietary pattern with a high culinary dose of mixed herbs and spices (6.6 g.d<sup>–1</sup>.2100 kcal<sup>–1</sup>), the Ruminococcaceae family was enriched when compared with matched dietary patterns with lower doses (0.5 and 3.3 g.d<sup>–1</sup>.2100 kcal<sup>–1</sup>). This study suggests that incorporation of culinary doses of herbs and spices into an average American diet changes gut bacterial composition in adults at risk for CVD. Further investigation of the metabolic implications of these bacterial changes is needed.</p>
