GWL participants had slightly more cigarette abstinence periods per week than the US pack group, but the difference was not significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.13). At 3 months, there was no between-group difference in any smoking behavior. The blank pack group was similar to the US pack group on all measures.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Graphic warning labels (GWLs) on tobacco packages are recommended as a cost-effective means to increase public awareness about the dangers of tobacco at the time of use.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> When combined with other strategies, such as smoking cessation assistance, they can provide a way for governments to reduce the health costs associated with cigarette smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> GWLs on cigarette packs were mandated by the US Congress in 2009. However, the US Food and Drug Administration’s planned implementation, first in 2012 and again in 2020,<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> was challenged by tobacco industry lawsuits, and the issue is still before the courts.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Smokers usually have their cigarette pack in easy reach, thus providing a unique opportunity to reinforce marketing messages at the time a person considers smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Industry marketing research<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and peer-reviewed publications<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> show that package imagery can influence smokers’ ratings of cigarette taste and satisfaction, as well as their cognitions regarding cigarettes’ safety compared with alternatives.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The health and societal costs that follow a long-term cigarette addiction provide governments with a vested interest to restrict or counter marketing that promotes cigarette smoking, leading to bans or limits on cigarette marketing in the US and elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> More than 120 countries have mandated that sections of the cigarette pack feature GWLs depicting the health consequences of smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Seven countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, have required the removal of all industry branding to eliminate any marketing that might encourage smoking.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Typically, these countries have also required larger GWLs than those proposed for US packs.</p>
              <p>Earlier US trials<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> identified that GWLs that produced negative affect in smokers resulted in higher risk perceptions and quit intentions. There is also evidence of increased quit attempts when smokers had a GWL affixed to their cigarette pack.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, because GWLs also force a reduction in brand imagery on packs, there is a need for research to identify whether displacing branding or adding GWLs to packaging is associated with changes in smoking cognitions and behavior. Two studies have investigated whether GWLs are associated with changes in smoking behavior: a time-series analysis of Canadian data reported that GWLs were associated with reduced smoking behavior,<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> whereas an analysis of similar data from 60 countries found no such association.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This article presents the results of a randomized clinical trial examining a real-world experience with different cigarette packaging among US smokers.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Participants were randomized to a study-manufactured blank pack, a pack with a GWL, or their usual US pack and purchased these cigarettes from a study website for 3 months. We previously demonstrated among these participants that such repackaging was associated with markedly different affective reactions.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This study’s 3 aims investigate between-group differences in smokers’ concern about health risks (assessed weekly), positive perceptions about their cigarettes (assessed daily), and changes in consumption and smoking status before and after the intervention.</p>

              <p>From September 2016 through December 2019, we recruited daily smokers (daily smoking was defined as ≥5 cigarettes per day) aged 21 to 65 years who were not ready to quit using community and social media advertising. Participants were from San Diego, California, and signed an informed consent form approved by the institutional review boards of University of California San Diego and California State University San Marcos, both of which also approved this study.

                <p>The enrollment target was 150 participants per group to give power greater than 0.85 (α = .025) for medium between-group effects (Cohen <italic>d</italic> ≥ 0.25) with dropout at 20%. Community recruitment methods elicited contacts from 5890 smokers, although only 476 smokers (13.7% of eligible smokers) attended the baseline visit (visit 1), with most of those eligible either declining or not attending visit 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi210629f1">Figure 1</xref>). A further 26 participants were excluded (2 did not complete visit 1, and 24 were unable to purchase cigarettes), and 450 participants started a 1-month run-in period. There were 359 participants who adhered to the study protocol. After stratifying them on 3 variables with 2 levels each—age (&lt;45 or ≥45 years old), sex (male or female), and nicotine dependence scores<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (low-to-moderate dependence or high dependence)—we used an urn randomization method<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> to allocate participants to the study’s 3 groups (US pack, GWL pack, or blank pack). Two postrandomization exclusions (participants in different study groups were cohabitating) resulted in a study population of 357. One participant from each of the GWL and blank pack groups did not purchase any study cigarettes and, hence, did not receive the intervention. Of those randomized, 115 participants in the US pack group (99%), 114 participants in the GWL pack group (97%), and 124 participants in the blank pack group (99%) completed some daily interactive texting and were included in the ecological momentary assessment (EMA) analysis by interactive daily texting to assess short-term smoking behavior and cognitions. Long-term (3-month) smoking behavior change was assessed at the 3-month visit (visit 2) that was completed by 343 participants (96% of those randomized).</p>

                <p>EMAs delivered randomly twice daily (once early in the day and once late in the day) allowed interactive texting to capture real-time measures of smoking cognitions and behavior. Positive perceptions of cigarettes were assessed with 4-point Likert scale responses (strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree) to these statements: “My last cigarette was satisfying,” “I enjoyed the taste of my last cigarette,” and “My last cigarette relieved my craving.” Smoking behavior was assessed with this question: “In the last 4 hours, how many cigarettes did you smoke?” We documented the proportion of participants with at least 1 weekly 4-hour period of cigarette abstinence.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>We aggregated the texting data to provide a normalized mean daily score (daily mean of participant’s observed scores minus participant’s mean score for the run-in period) across the 3 questions that made up a positive perceptions scale (satisfaction, taste, and craving relief) and the 2 questions on health concerns. To compare patterns across study groups, we used a generalized linear or linear mixed-effect model with compound symmetry covariance structure for each outcome of interest. The mean was modeled as a linear trend over time, with 0 slope for each group in the run-in period and arbitrary slope (group times slope interaction) for each group in the intervention period. For the intervention period for each group, we also allowed a knot at 60 days (to allow for change in slope during the third intervention month) if supported by a likelihood ratio test. We used a Wald test for statistical inference regarding the model-fitted mean difference in intervention effects between any 2 study groups and for differences between slopes for any 2 study groups. Mean differences are presented normalized to the SD of the measure (mean difference of a measure divided by the SD of the measure) for comparability. For binary outcomes (such as the proportion with at least 1 weekly 4-hour period of smoking abstinence), the logit link function was used to compare the odds of reporting at least 1 abstinence period between groups, with adjustment for abstinence level during the run-in phase. For cigarette consumption and other outcomes, a linear regression model (identity link) was used. All models were adjusted for age group (&lt;45 vs ≥45 years), sex, and baseline nicotine dependence levels. We used R statistical software version 4.0.4 (R Project for Statistical Computing).<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> All tests were 2-sided and used a priori significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.

Intervention changes in this scale were best fit by a model with a knot at 60 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi210629f2">Figure 2</xref>A).

                    <p>A, Positive perceptions of recent cigarettes are rated on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree) formed from 3 questions on satisfaction, craving relief, and taste of recent cigarettes assessed during daily EMAs throughout the study. Data were available for 111 participants in the US pack group, 112 participants in the graphic warning label (GWL) pack group, and 123 participants in the blank pack group and were normalized to reflect differences from an average rating during the 1-month baseline period. B, The Health Perception Scale is a 4-point scale formed from 2 questions on how the participant’s smoking impacted their health and that of others, assessed on weekly EMAs. Data were available for 109 US pack participants, 109 GWL pack participants, and 113 blank pack participants and were normalized to reflect differences from a mean rating during the 1-month baseline period. During the run-in period, all groups received the US pack. At week 0 (randomization), participants were allocated to a study pack group. The solid line denotes the mean predicted values from a mixed-effects model with compound symmetry covariance structure; run-in slope was set to 0; randomization period slope incorporates a knot at 60 days (panel A). Vertical segments are observed mean changes in scores and their 95% CIs.

                    <p>Quitting cognitions were assessed on a 4-point scale during weekly EMAs. Weekly abstinence was the proportion of participants with at least 1 daily 4-hour interactive text period in which no smoking was reported. For both variables, data were available for 109 US pack group participants, 109 graphic warning label (GWL) pack group participants, and 113 blank pack group participants.

              <p>In this real-world, randomized clinical trial, we examined the effect of cigarette packs with GWLs on cigarette smokers. We succeeded in encouraging US smokers to purchase cigarettes that were repackaged into either GWL or blank packs and delivered to them, with 96% of those randomized completing their postintervention assessment. Across the first 2 months of the intervention, only those in the GWL pack group reported a consistent decrease in their positive perceptions of the cigarettes that they smoked, although the expected increase in perceived health concerns was not significant. Although there was a significant increase in cognitions about quitting in the GWL group, there was no evidence of increased quitting or reduced consumption, and this was biochemically validated at the postintervention visit.</p>
              <p>Tobacco branding on a cigarette pack typically increases a smoker’s perceptions of satisfaction, craving relief, and taste of cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210629r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, in this study, removal of tobacco branding on the blank pack was not sufficient to decrease these positive perceptions. It was only the GWL pack group that had lower positive perceptions. Such an effect might be expected from psychological experiments that found that the most effective way to reduce affect-based cognitions was to expose individuals to ones with an opposite affect valence.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Health concerns increased in all study groups during the intervention, with only a marginal increase in the GWL pack group. As the theory supporting mandated GWLs expects that their effect will be achieved through increased health concerns, this lack of a marked between-group difference was unexpected. The increase in health concerns among the US pack group is likely associated with the continual interactive text messaging on thoughts about the health consequences of smoking. That the GWL pack did not experience a significant increase these cognitions may reflect the high level of awareness of the health consequences of smoking,<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> which was also seen in our study. In the real world, daily EMA texts would not occur, which might result in a GWL effect on these health concerns that was not apparent in this study.</p>
              <p>Although the GWL group participants were more likely to think about quitting during the study intervention, there was no evidence of increased quitting behavior. Our measure of at least 1 weekly 4-hour smoking abstinence was designed to maximize the possibility of identifying early quitting activity. What was surprising is that the GWL group participants, who were more likely to think about quitting, were not much more likely to report these short smoking abstinences or to report lower daily cigarette consumption. Our study is in line with previous research indicating that intentions to change are rarely sufficient to achieve change in an addictive behavior.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Our repackaging of participants’ cigarettes into GWL packs provided a realistic packaging design; however, home delivery of cigarettes may mean that the results might be different from cigarettes purchased in a store. Before the study, our participants described the GWL packs as aversive.<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Given that branded packs were readily available to participants, the study’s 15% per pack discount<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> was not sufficient to prevent participants from obtaining approximately one-half of their cigarettes from nonstudy sources. Ultimately, the intervention still achieved substantial exposure to the study packs.</p>
                <p>The use of EMAs through interactive texting to obtain daily participant self-reports of cognitions and behavior was essential to assess an effect on cognitions close to the time of smoking. However, such continual prompting can itself be an intervention,<sup><xref rid="zoi210629r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> as demonstrated by the changes in perceptions of health effects and thoughts about quitting in the US pack group. Although self-reported changes in smoking are a limitation, changes were validated biochemically, which is a major advance on previous studies.</p>
                <p>In this study, we chose the Australian standardized packaging for our GWL packs rather than the hybrid packs proposed for implementation in the US. Legal advice recommended using an existing pack design and against manufacturing packs that required us to alter a current tobacco company design.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, this randomized clinical trial presents strong evidence that GWLs, but not simply the removal of tobacco industry marketing, can counter the appeal of tobacco marketing on cigarette packs and increase cognitions about quitting. However, on their own, they are not a strong enough tobacco control measure to reduce cigarette consumption among those not ready to quit.</p>
