                <p id="P16">Overcoming intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint blockade for microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal (CRC) and pancreatic (PDAC) cancer remains challenging. We conducted a single-arm, non-randomized, Phase 2 trial (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03104439" ext-link-type="uri">NCT03104439</ext-link>) combining radiation, ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC (n=40) and PDAC (n=25) with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) by intention to treat. DCR was 25% for CRC (10/40; 95% CI: 13–41%) and 20% for PDAC (5/25; 95% CI: 7–41%). In the per-protocol analysis, defined as receipt of radiation, DCR was 37% (10/27; 95% CI: 19–58%) in CRC and 29% (5/17; 95% CI: 10–56%) in PDAC. Pretreatment biopsies revealed low tumor mutational burden for all samples, but higher expression of NK cells and the HERVK repeat RNA in patients with disease control. This study provides proof-of-concept of combining radiation with immune checkpoint blockade in immunotherapy resistant cancers.</p>

              <p id="P17">Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains incurable for the vast majority of patients. While significant advances have been made with cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations and to lesser extent biologics in CRC, virtually all patients with unresectable disease will die from the cancer within 5 years<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Similarly, while cytotoxic chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX has improved short term outcomes in PDAC, longer term outcomes remain dismal<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Immunotherapy represents a promising development in the treatment of cancer but has had limited efficacy in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC and PDAC<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Both single-agent and dual-agent immunotherapy has been tried with limited efficacy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Most recently, a study of an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (durvalumab) given as monotherapy or in combination with an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody (tremelimumab) in patients with metastatic PDAC was ineffective with response rates of 0% and 3% respectively<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. One study with radiation that used a different dosing schedule and sequence when compared to our proposed study showed a response rate of 5%<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The only group that reliably responds to immunotherapy are patients with tumors that have microsatellite instability, presumably due to the high mutational rate leading to a large neoantigen burden. In a seminal study by Le and colleagues, patients with mismatch-repair deficient colorectal cancers had a 40% response rate to pembrolizumab. In contrast, no patients with a MSS colorectal cancer responded<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, Keynote-158 demonstrated some responses in patients with PDAC, but only in the rare subset of MSI positive patients<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P18">Radiation therapy has been suggested as a modality that may increase the likelihood of systemic response to immunotherapy via a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect in which local treatment of a tumor leads to antitumor response at distant sites. Mechanistically, pre-clinical data has shown that radiation potentially can increase susceptibility of tumor cells to immune-mediated killing as it has been shown that radiation can increase negative feedback mechanisms such as checkpoints that can hinder the immune response while also promoting release of tumor specific antigens.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Most recently, data in non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated that treatment with anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab) and stereotactic body radiotherapy doubled out-of-field responses<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Previous pre-clinical mouse studies with anti-CTLA4 and radiation identified PD-L1 as a common mechanism of resistance, which could be overcome with anti-PD-L1 therapy<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. These promising early clinical trials and pre-clinical proof of concept led to this study of combined dual blockade of PD-1 (nivolumab) and CTLA4 (ipilimumab) with radiation therapy in an attempt to stimulate immune responses in metastatic MSS CRC and PDAC.</p>

                <p id="P19">A total of 40 patients with CRC and 25 patients with PDAC were enrolled in this study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). All patients were confirmed MSS by PCR and/or IHC and had metastatic disease at enrollment. In the CRC cohort, there were 18 women and 22 men with a median age of 59 years (range 26–83). 95% of patients were white, 65% had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, median number of prior treatments was 4 (range 1–13). The majority of patients (N=23, 58%) were metastatic at diagnosis and median time from diagnosis to cycle 1 day 1 was 44.9 months (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the PDAC cohort, there were 7 women and 18 men: median age, 60 years (range 32–75). 92% of patients were white, 44% had an ECOG PS of 0, median number of prior treatments was 2 (range 1–4). The majority of patients (N=18, 72%) had locally advanced or metastatic disease at diagnosis and median time from diagnosis to cycle 1 day 1 was 16.9 months (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All patients with PDAC had progressed on chemotherapy prior to entry and only 1 patient with CRC had stable disease prior to entry but had progressed on 2 prior lines of therapy. Only 1 patient with PDAC had received prior immunotherapy on a previous trial, but this patient did not benefit.</p>
                <p id="P20">In the 40 CRC patients who enrolled and started treatment, the disease control rate (DCR) was 25% (10/40; 95% CI: 13–41%) with an objective response rate (ORR) of 10% (4/40; 95% CI: 3–24%) by intention to treat (ITT) analysis. The CRC cohort had a median PFS of 2.4 months (95% CI: 1.8–2.5) and median OS of 7.1 months (95% CI: 4.3–10.9)(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Similarly, the 25 PDAC patients had a DCR of 20% (5/25; 95% CI: 7–41%) with an ORR of 12% (3/25; 95% CI: 3–31%) by ITT analysis. Median PFS was 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.6–2.8) with a median OS of 4.2 months (95% CI: 2.1–6.4)(<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). A total of 34 patients were treated with photons and 12 with protons. In both cohorts, 32% (CRC 13/40; PDAC 8/25) discontinued prior to radiation therapy given autoimmune toxicity leading to clinical decline (N=4), clinical progression (N=7), or progression confirmed by scans (N=10) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Of the 15 patients who derived clinical benefit, only 1 patient had evidence of some response prior to radiation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P21">Four patients in the per-protocol group who received radiation therapy discontinued due to toxicity. In the CRC cohort, adverse events (AEs) related to immunotherapy Grade ≥3 were reported in 70% of patients (53% grade 3, 15% grade 4 and 3% grade 5). The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were lymphopenia and fatigue, and the grade 5 toxicity was pneumonitis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 4</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">5</xref>). In the PDAC cohort, AEs related to immunotherapy of Grade ≥3 were reported in 56% of patients (44% grade 3, 12% grade 4 and 4% grade 5). The most common Grade ≥3 AEs were lymphopenia, elevated lipase and mucositis. The grade 5 toxicity was hepatic encephalopathy, possibly related to treatment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 6</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">7</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">In a per-protocol analysis of patients who received radiation therapy, the CRC cohort DCR was 37% (10/27; 95% CI: 19–58%) and ORR was 15% (4/27; 95% CI: 4–34%) and the PDAC cohort DCR was 29% (5/17; 95% CI: 10–56%) and ORR was 18% (3/17; 95% CI: 4–43%). The best objective response as measured from percent change in tumor dimension from baseline are shown as a waterfall plot for CRC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) and PDAC (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Only measurable disease outside of the radiation field were evaluated and an example of out of field response in patient 57 is shown by CT scan images of 3 pulmonary metastases shrinking after radiation treatment of the target liver lesion (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). One CRC and one PDAC case had a complete response (CR) by imaging criteria. The patient with CRC presented with metastatic disease after adjuvant therapy for stage III disease and progressed after 4 cycles of FOLFIRI and bevacizumab. She initiated treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab with radiation to 1 lesion in the liver with a PR at 6 months and a CR 3 months later. However, during treatment she did have a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy given some question of growth in the ovaries, which did demonstrate metastatic disease. She remained on treatment with a CR and stayed on study for 10 months when she had evidence of new and progressing disease in the liver and peritoneum. The patient with PDAC had widely metastatic disease at presentation. He was started on FOLFIRINOX with approximately 1 year of disease control, and then he was started on trial with RT to the liver lesion with a CR by 5 months. However, he concurrently developed Grade 4 autoimmune liver toxicity requiring high dose immunosuppression and discontinuation of treatment. He unfortunately progressed seven months after treatment and passed away after a fall leading to an intracranial bleed after 9 months from starting on trial.</p>
                <p id="P23">The CRC cohort had a median PFS of 2.5 months (95% CI: 2.3–2.8) and median OS of 10.9 months (95% CI: 6.7–15.0) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Median PFS was 5.2 months (95% CI: 2.5–14.6) for the 10 patients with disease control as best overall response compared to 2.4 months (95% CI: 1.8–2.5) for the 17 without disease control. Median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI: 4.9-not reached) versus 7.7 months (95% CI: 4.0–11.3) for those with and without disease control. In the PDAC cohort, median PFS was 2.7 months (95% CI: 2.5–3.1) and median OS was 6.1 months (95% CI: 4.0–7.0) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Median PFS was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.5–7.9) for the 5 patients with disease control as best overall response compared to 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.8–2.8) for the 12 without disease control. Median OS of the per-protocol cohort was 11.7 months (95% CI: 5.4–14.6) versus 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.6–6.4) for those with and without disease control respectively as their best overall response.</p>

                <p id="P24">Patients underwent biopsies as able prior to trial initiation, immediately prior to radiation treatment, and after radiation completion. A total of 41 tumor samples with paired germline DNA from 17 patients from the per-protocol cohort were analyzed by whole exome sequencing (WES). All patients had low TMB with &lt; 10 mutations/Mb (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 8</xref>), and there was no difference between patient non-responders (progressive disease = PD) compared to responders (stable disease = SD, partial response = PR, complete response = CR) (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, there was no change in TMB before, during, or after treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Analysis of non-synonymous gene mutations identified expected genes that are frequently mutated including <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations in both CRC and PDAC, and common <italic toggle="yes">APC</italic> mutations in CRC (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 9</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">10</xref>). In addition, there was notable mutations in DNA damage and repair pathway genes with shared frequent mutations in <italic toggle="yes">DDX11</italic> (CRC 4/13; PDAC 4/10) and <italic toggle="yes">FANCD2</italic> (CRC 2/13; PDAC 2/10). There was no specific DNA damage and repair pathway gene mutation that was particularly enriched in patients with response or disease stability. Notably, patient 4 (CRC PR) and patient 41 (PDAC CR) had 6 mutations in DNA damage and repair genes, which suggests a potential importance of these genes in predicting response, but there were not enough samples in this trial to make any clear conclusions.</p>

                <title>Repeat RNA expression associated with disease control</title>
                <p id="P25">Analysis of pretreatment biopsies comparing patient responders (SD/PR/CR: n = 5) compared to progressive disease (PD: n = 7) revealed coding genes differentially expressed (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). Gene set overlap analysis showed significant enrichment of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes (FDR 2.36 x 10<sup>−6</sup>) in biopsies from patients with response compared to progressive disease, however, the EMT signature was not uniformly elevated in responders and primarily driven by patients 4, 50, and 51. Closer inspection of the EMT genes differentially expressed noted high <italic toggle="yes">FAP</italic> expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) indicating that the signature might be driven by cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) content. Recent single cell RNA-seq analysis of PDAC has revealed heterogeneity of CAF phenotypes with primarily myofibroblast CAF (myCAF) and inflammatory CAF (iCAF) subtypes reported in human tumors<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Expression heatmaps for myCAF and iCAF subtypes noted the EMT signature likely being enriched from the elevated presence of myCAFs in patients 4, 50, and 51 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). De-convolution of immune subsets in RNA-seq data using immune cell transcriptional signatures revealed resting NK cells as being statistically higher in responders compared to progressive disease (unpaired t-test p = 0.038; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">d</xref>).To evaluate for other potential biomarkers of response, non-coding repeat RNAs were evaluated given their linkage with activation of innate immune receptors and an interferon response in other cancers and model systems<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Differential expression analysis noted the majority of repeat RNAs were higher in responders compared to progressive disease (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). After multiple hypothesis correction, there were 5 repeats that were significantly higher (FDR &lt; 0.05) in responders including AluYb9, HERVK, HERV_LTRa, LTR35, and MER34C2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Of these repeats only the HERVK repeat is known to still have protein coding capacity. To evaluate for these markers changing in response to XRT, analysis of paired biopsies pre-XRT and post-XRT RNA-seq was performed and did not identify any significant changes in CAF subtypes, immune subsets, or repeat RNAs (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, the analysis of the identified pretreatment repeat RNAs noted increased expression post-XRT compared to pre-XRT in the two patients (patient 4 and 33) with objective response, while the patient with stable disease (patient 50) and the progressive disease patients did not see upregulation of repeat RNAs (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). However, the limited numbers of this paired analysis will need future validation. Altogether, the expression of specific repeat elements in pretreatment biopsies and associated elevated resting NK cells is associated with disease control and response in patients who received radiation with combined immune checkpoint blockade.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P26">This is a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the safety and modest efficacy of radiation therapy to enhance the effects of dual checkpoint inhibition in MSS metastatic CRC and PDAC. Responses were observed in the group of patients who were able to receive radiation therapy and this contributes to the growing prospective data suggesting radiation therapy may enhance the response rate of immunotherapy<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, what is most notable is the duration of disease control in the patients who had either responses or stable disease. This suggests that using overall response rate to determine efficacy for immunotherapy treatment may perhaps underappreciate the benefit in patients. However, though not directly comparable, the response rate with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and radiation combination still surpasses the single-digit response rates seen with regorafenib or trifluridine and tipiracil in CRC or gemcitabine after FOLFIRINOX in PDAC<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Toxicity rates in both cohorts were high, but only a small number of patients had clinically relevant toxicity and stopped treatment given toxicity, indicating that toxicity was not limiting and manageable. There was one CRC patient with grade 5 pneumonitis, but this patient also had a substantial degree of underlying lung disease which may have also been contributory and in the PDAC cohort there was one grade 5 hepatic encephalopathy in a patient with extensive liver disease with concomitant hepatotoxicity from immunotherapy. Despite the modest activity, any activity in this subset of MSS patients with CRC and PDAC warrants further evaluation.</p>
              <p id="P27">There was notable early dropout (progression, toxicity, declining PS) in this trial as a third of patients in both cohorts never had the opportunity to receive radiation and current ongoing trials are addressing this dropout whereby radiation is moved to the start of treatment. Alternative dosing schedules for the integration of radiation with immunotherapy might be more active as the extent of immune-modulation with varying dosing and fractionating radiation therapy is still not well understood and continues to be under investigation<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. For example, recent data suggests that PD-1 blockade prior to antigen priming leads to T-cell exhaustion given the induction of dysfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> cells by PD-1 blockade.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Therefore, concurrent priming may be optimal in preventing the induction of dysfunctional CD8 cells and the sequencing in this study (with anti-PD1 therapy given for 3 doses before radiation therapy was delivered) may have been suboptimal. In the future, it will be critical to consider modifications to the dosing schedule to accommodate radiation upfront as well as modifications that mitigate the toxicity seen.</p>
              <p id="P28">Although the exact mechanism for response from this approach is not fully understood, pre-clinical models have indicated that radiation enhances the diversity of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in intratumoral T-cells and increases dendritic cell infiltration and antigen presentation in the tumor<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Analysis of biopsies for potential genomic predictive biomarkers of response noted all tumors had low TMB and there were no clear mutations associated with response. Although a couple of patients with response had tumors with multiple mutations in DNA damage and repair pathway genes, there was no consistent pattern of response as has been recently demonstrated in a larger series of tumors treated by immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Analysis of the transcriptome demonstrated significant expression of multiple repeat RNAs with associated higher resting NK cells in pretreatment biopsies from patients with disease control or response. These findings are consistent with previous reports showing a relationship of repeat RNA expression and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, previous work has also observed a correlation of cytolytic activity and NK cells with the expression of HERV RNA species<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> consistent with our findings. Although there are a variety of repeat RNAs elevated in pancreatic and colorectal cancers that have been reported, there appears to be clear distinct expression pattern of this wide spectrum of repeat RNAs that are associated with different epigenetic and immunologic features of these cancers<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. For example, the specific elevation of the endogenous retrovirus HERVK in responders is consistent with our previously reported correlation of this particular repeat RNA with immune checkpoint response in urothelial carcinoma<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Others have also found HERV expression associated with immune checkpoint response in renal cell carcinoma, which is thought to be a combination of enhanced innate immune response from HERV RNA species and potential adaptive immune response to protein coding elements of these ancient retrovirsues<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Similarly, NK cells have become recognized as a potential effector cell for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. NK cell expression of PD-1 has been demonstrated in these studies and anti-PD-1 therapies can activate these innate immune cell effectors along with adaptive cytolytic T-cells for a full anti-tumoral immune response. Altogether, this indicates that specific repeats are associated with differences in NK cell infiltrates that can be used as potential biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitor trials. The functional relationship of these repeat RNAs on innate immune sensing pathways and associated immune cell response is an underdeveloped area of research that merits further investigation.</p>
              <p id="P29">The addition of radiation therapy to PD-1 and CTLA4 pathway inhibition has demonstrated some activity in otherwise refractory CRC and PDAC patients for whom dual PD-1 and CTLA4 pathway inhibition historically has had limited activity. Though modest, duration of disease control and clinical benefit was notable in this human proof of concept study, warranting further investigation in a confirmatory study. Furthermore, given the high level of early-drop out in this trial as well as new information on potential improved timing of the sequencing of radiation therapy with immunotherapy to enhance efficacy, follow up studies with a different treatment schedule, including moving the radiation treatment to earlier in the treatment course, are planned. Finally, repeatome gene expression profiling can serve as a source of potential predictive biomarkers of immunotherapy and provide new targets for mechanistic studies in understanding the role of these viral like sequences in cancer biology.</p>

Scans could also be obtained prior to every 12 weeks at the clinician’s request. Patients were followed for survival until death, withdrawal of consent for follow-up or up to 5 years. All AEs were monitored from registration until 30 days after treatment and were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03. Following disease progression, patients were followed-up within 30 days from the last dose +/− 7 days or coinciding with the date of discontinuation (+/− 7 days) if date of discontinuation was greater than 37 days after last dose with a second follow-up visit 8–10 weeks (+/− 7 days) from follow-up visit 1. After 2 in person follow-up visits, patients were followed with a phone call or in clinic visit every 10–12 weeks for survival.</p>

                <title>Study End Points</title>
                <p id="P52">The primary trial endpoint was disease control rate (response plus stable disease [DCR]) by RECIST 1.1. Responses and stable disease were defined as responses and stability outside of the irradiated field. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate (complete response and partial response [ORR]) in unirradiated lesions, treatment-related adverse event (AE) rates, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Exploratory objectives included biomarker analysis of serial tumor biopsies and peripheral blood samples.</p>

                  <title>Clinical Trial</title>
                  <p id="P53">A two-stage design was used to demonstrate a DCR of 20% under the alternative hypothesis as the minimum level of promising efficacy, while a 5% rate is specified under the null hypothesis to indicate minimal or no activity. In the MSS cohort if at least 2 of the first 20 patients achieved disease control, the cohort proceeded to enroll a total of 40 patients. The two-stage design provided 92% power to accept the protocol treatment is associated with a 20% rate of disease control if at least 4 of 40 patients achieved disease control, while the probability of a type 1 error is 10% if the underlying rate of disease control were truly only 5%. In the mPDAC cohort if at least 1 of the first 15 patients achieved disease control, the cohort proceeded to enroll a total of 25 patients. The two-stage design provided 89% power to accept the protocol treatment is associated with a DCR of 20% if at least 3 of 25 patients achieved disease control, while the probability of a type 1 error is 12% if the underlying DCR were truly only 5%. DCR and ORR were reported with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) based on the exact binomial distribution. PFS and OS were measured from the first dose of protocol treatment. PFS was defined as time until the earlier date of either progressive disease or death, or otherwise censored at the date of last follow-up. OS was defined as time to death from any cause or otherwise censored at the date of last follow-up for patients still alive at the time of analysis. OS and PFS curves were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with the 95% CI obtained by the log-log transformation. Primary analysis was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, while the per-protocol analysis was defined in patients who received radiation. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R version 3.3.1 (R Foundation).</p>
