                  <p id="P1">REPRIEVE, the Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV, is a multicenter, primary prevention trial evaluating whether a statin can prevent major cardiovascular events in people with HIV. REPRIEVE is conducted at &gt;100 clinical research sites (CRSs) globally. Detailed, comprehensive, and novel methods for evaluating and communicating CRS performance are required to ensure trial integrity and data quality. In this analysis we describe a comprehensive multidimensional methodology for evaluating CRS performance.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P6">Multicenter randomized controlled trials are complex undertakings. Developing and evaluating clinical research site (CRS) performance for the efficacy and quality of trial conduct is important to carry out during trial start-up, enrollment, and follow-up phases to ensure scientific integrity. Site performance evaluation is also important for key stakeholders. Excellent trial conduct is a key factor in the scientific success of multicenter trials and is a measure dependent on how well CRSs meet goals established for participant retention and collection of high-quality data in a timely manner. Developing operating procedures that generate easily accessible data relevant to the performance of CRSs and streamlined processes for review and dissemination of this data has the potential to improve the efficiency and success of trials. Ideally, such performance metrics should provide information that quickly identifies potential problems so they can be mitigated or avoided, hence minimizing their impact, and improving the efficiency and robustness of trial conduct. Herein we describe a system and process of CRS performance evaluation and quality improvement developed for a large-scale, longitudinal, multicenter international trial utilizing novel metrics, reports, and interventions to ensure trial integrity and data quality. To evaluate the utility of site performance metrics we analyzed site performance data from April 2019, when study enrollment was nearing completion, to April 2022, when the current analysis was performed. Specifically, we looked at three categories of performance: retention of participants, data management, and specimen management. These metrics capture performance relating to key trial outcomes as already described [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Notably, this trial was initiated prior to but extended into the period of COVID-19 pandemic. The methods we describe were helpful to maintain key trial metrics within expected thresholds despite these difficult circumstances.</p>

              <title>Study background</title>
              <p id="P7">The Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluating pitavastatin calcium as a prevention strategy for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among people with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with low-to-moderate traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The trial is supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), with additional support from Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., and ViiV Healthcare. Between March 2015 and July 2019, REPRIEVE enrolled 7769 participants at over 100 CRSs in 12 countries. Follow-up is to continue until the study reaches its target number of MACE endpoints with the duration of follow-up anticipated to be between 6 and 10 years depending on when participants enrolled in the trial. Additional details on trial design, recruitment methods, and detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described elsewhere [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>

                <title>Role of the clinical coordinating center in CRS performance evaluation</title>
                <p id="P8">The Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) for REPRIEVE, located at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), is responsible for the clinical conduct of the trial. Critical functional components of the CCC include trial execution, clinical operations, site management and performance, protocol training, and development of study materials and communications. The CCC liaises with various stakeholders to ensure operational control over protocol execution and coordination of sites and communication. The Site Selection, Performance, and Close Out Committee (SSPCC), the committee responsible for CRS performance evaluation, is under the oversight of the CCC.</p>

                <title>Role of the data coordinating center in CRS performance evaluation</title>
                <p id="P9">The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) provides methodological and logistical support for the collection, quality control, and analysis of data including rigorous, timely, and independent adjudication of potential MACE events. Furthermore, the DCC remains responsible for statistical design and analysis, assistance in protocol development, data management and is responsible for development and distribution of site performance summary reports internally, including Site Score Cards, Retention Summaries, Site Summary Reports, and Specimen Availability Reports. The DCC includes the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research (CBAR) at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the clinical data managers and laboratory data managers at Frontier Science (FSTRF), and the MGH Imaging Trials Center. The reports are organized by site and include summary statistics of overall performance. Importantly, the DCC has built programs to automate the process of data extraction and report creation. The CRS performance summary reports are distributed monthly to the SSPCC.</p>

                <title>The site selection, performance, and closeout committee</title>
                <p id="P10">The SSPCC is responsible for CRS performance evaluation and as such is the committee charged with communication with CRSs regarding any concerns related to participant retention, data management, or specimen management. This committee was constituted during the start-up phase of REPRIEVE and is under the oversight of the CCC. The committee was established to evaluate and initially select sites and assist with site activation. As recruitment began, the SSPCC developed processes to: (1) evaluate each CRS based on predetermined performance metrics; and (2) communicate performance evaluations with each CRS. To properly carry out site performance evaluation, the SSPCC critically depends on the DCC for accurate and timely data regarding performance and actionable reports. The SSPCC draws insight and expertise from a membership that encompasses REPRIEVE site investigators, study coordinators, as well as laboratory and pharmacy representatives (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Material 1</xref> for a description of roles and responsibilities of SSPCC members). A key principle of trial oversight is to engage and involve the site investigators and staff in the evaluation of CRS performance methods and communication about performance with CRSs.</p>

                <title>Site performance plan</title>
                <p id="P11">Evaluation of site performance is a collaborative effort between the DCC and CCC. A Site Performance Plan (SPP) was developed by trial leadership with input from stakeholders as a document to guide the evaluation and assessment of CRS performance. The SPP was developed through adaptation of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Performance and Evaluation Committee’s site performance plan to meet the needs of REPRIEVE CRS performance evaluation. The SPP explains each area of performance evaluated (i.e. retention, data management), the standard expected, and the outcome if not meeting the standard. All CRSs have access to the SPP on REPRIEVE’s protocol-specific webpage (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Material 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Formal site performance evaluation</title>
                <p id="P12">Because of the large number of CRSs (&gt;100) participating in REPRIEVE, CRSs are assigned to one of four “Teams” for the purposes of performance evaluation review. The Team assignment determines the cycle of CRS performance evaluation, conducted biannually (twice yearly) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, all CRSs in Team 1 receive their biannual performance evaluation in January and July each year and the SSPCC meeting is focused on performance review of Team 1 sites during these same months.</p>
                <p id="P13">During each biannual evaluation cycle, CRSs are evaluated on participant retention, data management, and laboratory management; accrual was evaluated during the enrollment phase of the trial. Additional metrics are evaluated as needed. The biannual evaluations include a summary table of a CRS’s performance based on standards set out by the SPP and then explains in detail the CRS’s site-specific performance and any follow-up required by the CRS if needed.</p>
                <p id="P14">Biannual evaluations are sent via email to the CRS principal investigator and study coordinator. As outlined in the SPP, a CRS deficient in a performance measure during a 6-month period is notified of the deficiency in the biannual evaluation and may be required to submit a corrective action plan (CAP) describing a plan to address the deficiency. <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Material 1</xref> includes standards and outcomes if a CRS is not meeting a standard. For CRSs that are flagged to be at risk of falling below certain performance measures, the SSPCC provides additional assistance and training. For sites that are not responsive, there are clear escalation procedures in place: first a site is contacted via email by the trial’s project manager or clinical research coordinator, next the site is contacted by a principal investigator or co-investigator and if deficiencies still persist, a site call is scheduled.</p>
                <p id="P15">Through use of these detailed assessments and procedures, REPRIEVE has created and maintained a vibrant, highly successful trial, meeting all the major prespecified metrics.</p>

                <title>Channels of communication</title>
                <p id="P16">In addition to Biannual Performance Evaluations, a variety of communication channels have been developed to facilitate the timely dissemination of information to CRSs, to frequently communicate CRS performance in a variety of formats (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and to support CRS performance. These channels include monthly site score cards, monthly site newsletters, site calls, personal outreach by SSPCC leadership, and Ambassador Visits which are in-person or remote visits with the CRS team. Through these various channels, the CCC via the SSPCC provides sufficient information and assistance to communicate CRS performance, support CRS performance, and support the efforts of the SSPCC without overwhelming CRSs with additional tasks.</p>
                <p id="P17"><italic toggle="yes">Site score card reports</italic> are sent via email monthly. The purpose of the site score cards is to provide an overview of overall trial and CRS performance relative to proposed benchmarks for enrollment and retention. The site score card reports are distributed monthly by email to all CRSs and are accompanied by a cover email that describes pertinent trial performance reminders and updates while the score cards themselves include tables of overall enrollment status, figures of the number of participants enrolled, rate of loss to follow up, rate of off-treatment for nonclinical reasons, and site summaries of participants off-study or at risk for loss to follow-up. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> provides an example of a novel figure developed by the DCC and is included in the score card describing participants at risk of loss to follow-up, defined as a participant without contact in &gt;9 months and thus at risk for dropping out of the trial.</p>
                <p id="P18"><italic toggle="yes">Site newsletters</italic> are sent via email and contain information relevant to CRS staff, for example, accrual, retention, data management, lab tips, and important trial updates. Site newsletters are distributed monthly and posted on the REPRIEVE website (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.reprievetrial.org/site-resources/reprieve-site-newsletters/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.reprievetrial.org/site-resources/reprieve-site-newsletters/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="P19"><italic toggle="yes">CRS team calls</italic> are conducted over a video-conferencing platform; information relevant to the trial is shared with CRSs and CRSs may pose questions directly to members of the REPRIEVE leadership team.</p>
                <p id="P20">Finally, the SSPCC has carried out <italic toggle="yes">one-on-one visits</italic> with each CRS team, known as the <italic toggle="yes">REPRIEVE Ambassador Initiative</italic>. These visits were initially in-person but reverted to video visits in March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During such visits, SSPCC team members orchestrate a friendly informal discussion about the status of the trial, highlight priorities in terms of site performance and engagement, discuss ways the SSPCC can support the CRS’s retention efforts, and address any questions or concerns raised by the CRS.</p>
                <p id="P21">Through a <italic toggle="yes">continuous cycle of monthly reviews and biannual evaluations</italic>, the SSPCC identifies potential issues and obstacles to performance, provides real-time technical support and assistance to CRSs when necessary, and makes recommendations to the REPRIEVE Executive Committee for process improvements to facilitate the efficient execution of the trial.</p>

                <title>The present analysis</title>
                <p id="P22">Of the 210 CRSs that expressed interest in participating in the trial, 146 were protocol activated and 126 are currently following participants (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). 126 CRSs are included in the current analysis. 20 CRSs closed after site activation, 1 CRS merged with another CRS, 15 closed because of CRS PI request and 4 closed due to site performance. Of the 20 CRSs, 15 CRSs had enrolled participants and SSPCC leadership worked with each CRS team and site PI to ensure that participants transferred to the closest REPRIEVE CRS, or to the CRS of their choosing.</p>
                <p id="P23">Although REPRIEVE is ongoing, here we describe site performance in the trial thus far. To determine how the above-described methods have supported the trial, we analyzed site performance data from April 2019, when study enrollment was nearing completion and site performance evaluation shifted from accrual to retention, to April 2022, when the current analysis was performed. Specifically, we looked at three categories of performance: retention of participants, data management, and specimen management. Data for these metrics were looked at overall and by country of enrollment. Data and specimen metric management were assessed by calculating the mean. Retention metrics were assessed by calculating the rate. These metrics capture CRS performance to support the achievement of key trial outcomes.</p>

                  <label>3.7.1.</label>
                  <title>Retention</title>
                  <p id="P24">Retention is determined by the rate of participants electing to withdraw from the trial for reasons other than death (study discontinuation) and by the rate of participants electing to stop study treatment for reasons other than clinical necessity (e.g., CVD event requiring statin use) but remain in the trial (treatment discontinuation). Both are reported as a rate per 100 person-years (100PY). The trial goal is to have rates below 5/100PY for each metric.</p>

                  <title>Data management</title>
                  <p id="P25">To quantify data management performance, we evaluate data entry timeliness, calculated as new data submitted in the electronic data capture system within 3 weeks/total data submitted*100 (reported as a percent), expected data submitted (cumulative), calculated as completed visits/expected visits*100, and expected endpoint data submitted, calculated as endpoint data entered in the electronic data capture system/expected data*100. The trial standard is to have scores 90% or greater for all data management metrics.</p>

                <sec id="S17">
                  <label>3.7.3.</label>
                  <title>Specimen management</title>
                  <p id="P26">To quantify specimen management performance, we calculate expected specimens shipped to the repository within 6 months of collection, calculated as the number of specimens shipped/total specimens*100 (reported as a percent). The trial standard is to have a score 90% or greater for all specimen management metrics.</p>
                  <p id="P27">To evaluate the impact of the above methods, we took a two-pronged approach. First, we looked at how results in the aforementioned categories of metrics changed over time, from April 2019 to April 2022. Data were examined overall and by country of enrollment. Second, in a sub-analysis, we looked at sites for whom performance along pre-specified metrics (data timeliness and study discontinuation) was not meeting anticipated performance standards during the Fall of 2021. For such sites, specific language was included in their formal biannual evaluation asking the CRS to pay close attention to their performance in the coming months. To better understand how this messaging may have impacted metrics, we looked at how these metrics changed over a period of six months following notification of poor performance, assessing the means and standard deviations of specific metrics.</p>

                <p id="P28">For active REPRIEVE CRSs, participant retention metrics remained stable over this analysis period. The average study discontinuation rate changed from 3.88/100PY in April 2019 to 2.74/100PY in April 2022, with highest (worst) discontinuation rates observed in April 2019 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This rate varied by country of enrollment; for example, in April 2022 sites in Thailand had the lowest (best) discontinuation rate (0.18/100PY) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P29">The average treatment discontinuation rate changed from 6.38/100PY in April 2019 to 5.05/100PY in April 2022, with the highest (worst) rate observed in April 2019 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This rate also varied by country of enrollment, with the lowest treatment discontinuation rate in Zimbabwe (0.24/100PY in April 2022) and the highest treatment discontinuation rate in the US/Canada (7.79/100PY in April 2022; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

                <title>Sub-analyses: impact of targeted messaging in biannual evaluations</title>
                <p id="P31">In the Fall 2021 biannual CRS evaluations, 40 of 126 CRSs had treatment discontinuation rates above the trial benchmark (indicating a deficiency) and thus targeted messaging was included in each biannual evaluation for these 40 CRSs. CRSs were notified that their treatment discontinuation rate was above the trial standard and asked to keep a close eye on these rates during the next 6-month evaluation period. The messaging also reminded CRSs of the importance of maintaining low discontinuation rates and of the option for participants to restart treatment if it was determined to be safe to do so. Of the 40 CRSs that received this targeted language in their Fall 2021 formal evaluation, 35 (88%) had rates that improved in the following evaluation period (6 months later). The mean change in treatment discontinuation rate was −1.28/100PY ± 1.70/100PY. In comparison, for the 86 CRSs that did not receive this targeted messaging, 59 (67%) had rates that either improved or stayed the same, and the mean change was +0.06/100PY ± 0.85/100PY (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P32">Additionally, targeted messaging pertaining to data timeliness was included in the biannual evaluations for Fall 2021 for 36 CRSs that had a deficiency in this metric. These CRSs were thus notified that their data timeliness score was below the standard and asked to consider ways to ensure all REPRIEVE data is entered within 3 weeks of a study visit. Of the 36 sites that received this targeted messaging in their Fall 2021 biannual evaluation, 28 (78%) had scores that improved in the following evaluation (6 months later). The mean change was +14.1% ± 25.3%. 83 sites did not receive this targeted language in their formal evaluation as they were meeting current trial standards. Of these, 44 (53%) had metrics that either improved or stayed the same over the six-month period. The mean change was −3.7% ± 12.8% (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>

              <p id="P33">One aspect of successful longitudinal multi-center clinical trials is dependent on meeting operational trial goals and pre-specified metrics, whilst ensuring data timeliness and quality, and participant retention and safety. Literature describing efficacious methods for tracking and monitoring site performance is available, however, to our knowledge, site performance evaluation methods from a trial of this size and duration have not yet been published [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. REPRIEVE’s methods for evaluating and assessing site performance are novel and robust and have enabled successful execution of the trial thus far, with a median duration of follow-up of 51 months. Sharing best practices developed and carried out by the SSPCC may help other multi-center trials successfully evaluate and improve the performance of clinical sites, ensuring successful completion of a trial.</p>
              <p id="P34">This analysis demonstrates that utilization of a multidimensional approach allows for thorough evaluation and ongoing improvement of site performance, facilitating site support, data and specimen management, and participant retention. Multiple forms of communication proved essential to this approach: namely, monthly site newsletters, monthly site score cards, quarterly site calls, biannual formal and personalized evaluations, annual community forums, and ad hoc site visits. This trial has also benefitted from a multidisciplinary team comprised of statisticians, clinicians, data managers, laboratory specialists, and regulatory experts. This allows for a synergistic evaluation system, utilizing the expertise of a collaborative trial team. Moreover, the adaptability of and attention to this performance evaluation system allows for modification and augmentation, as needed, to best suit the goals of an evolving trial. For example, this trial faced a major barrier starting in March 2020: the COVID-19 global pandemic, which impacted every single CRS following participants in REPRIEVE. In some geographic regions, site operations were suspended temporarily to allow for the re-allocation of resources for more pressing needs. Additionally, site performance was affected by participant hesitancy to return to health centers, shipment delays, and staff shortages. The stability of trial metrics during this difficult period demonstrates the robustness and functionality of this trial performance system. Finally, a critical aspect is the active involvement of a core leadership team continuously monitoring site performance, providing real-time feedback and support, and, where necessary, specific interventions to maintain high-quality site performance. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, sites were able to mobilize remote data collection and arrange for the shipment of study medication to participants (as opposed to participants having to pick up the study medication at an in-person visit).</p>
              <p id="P35">REPRIEVE is an international trial with representation from twelve countries and over 100 CRSs. As such, this analysis allowed for a comparison of performance across diverse geographic regions. In this analysis, we found that performance metrics were generally comparable by country of enrollment. Sites in the US/Canada tended to have the poorest data and specimen management, and retention metrics. This is likely due three reasons. The first is that the bar for being included in the trial as an international site was higher. The second may be due to cultural differences: Many international sites embed research within their clinical care paradigm, which may facilitate retention as participants undergo study procedures and receive medical care concurrently. Finally, personnel costs may differ by geographic region and thus variation in the number of site staff may impact site performance. More research is certainly needed to better elucidate how site performance varies on a global scale. The global nature of REPRIEVE highlights the importance of culturally appropriate and multilingual resources and support. Although proficiency with the English language was a requirement to enroll as a site in the trial, we also make every effort to provide resources and baseline study results available in multiple languages.</p>
              <p id="P36">One important aspect of this analysis was to better identify which resources are most helpful. Although this is difficult to estimate precisely due to the interconnectedness of our evaluation and communication methods, we looked at sites for whom metrics were not ideal in their Fall 2021 formal evaluation. For these sites, targeted language was included in their evaluation outlining that a metric was below the trial standard and suggesting ways to improve. We found that for sites that received this language, the metrics went up among approximately 80% of these sites in the following evaluation. In contrast, for sites that did not receive this targeted language, metrics improved in 45–60% of sites.</p>
              <p id="P37">This analysis has a number of strengths and also, limitations. Namely, the complex nature of our performance evaluation, communication, and remediation plan does not allow for specific elucidation of which resources are most and least beneficial, as these methods are not independent and there are many factors that may impact trial retention and data management. Importantly, we did not randomize sites to receive information. Further studies incorporating comparisons of methods may be useful for determining which are most beneficial and which are extraneous. Additionally, this study is ongoing and thus further evaluation will be needed to see how these metrics continue to change over time. However, at the time of publication, this study is now entering its eighth year of follow-up from first participant first visit, and metrics have been shown to be consistent over time thus far, even in the wake of a global crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis is further strengthened by a robust performance evaluation plan utilizing metrics and reports, established during the initiation phase of the trial, allowing for continuous monitoring of trial goals.</p>
              <p id="P38">In conclusion, this analysis describes methods for monitoring and improving site performance in an international, longitudinal, multi-site trial with thousands of participants. Site performance is vital to ensuring trial integrity, participant safety, and alliance with key trial goals, timelines, and budgets. Here we demonstrate the performance evaluation, communication and remediation methods for the REPRIEVE trial, with a presentation of important metrics over time and after interventions as a reflection of the efficacy of these methods for supporting the science of a clinical trial. We hope these principles may serve as a guidepost for future clinical trials to ensure successful trial completion.</p>
