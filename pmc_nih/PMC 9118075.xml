                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>What is the effect of regulation of cues (ROC), a weight loss treatment based on appetitive traits, and ROC plus behavioral weight loss (ROC+) compared with BWL alone and an active comparator (AC) among adults?</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this randomized clinical trial with 271 adults, patients randomized to ROC, ROC+, and BWL demonstrated similar weight loss during treatment and follow-up. Individuals who scored higher on food responsiveness lost more weight in the ROC and ROC+ groups than in the BWL or AC groups.</p>

                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>These findings suggest that ROC and ROC+ could be alternative weight loss programs for adults, particularly for individuals with high levels of food responsiveness.</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Behavioral weight loss (BWL) programs result in weight loss for some, but most individuals regain the weight. The behavioral susceptibility theory proposes that genetically determined appetitive traits, such as food responsiveness (FR) and satiety responsiveness (SR), interact with the environment and lead to overeating and weight gain; the regulation of cues (ROC) intervention was developed specifically to target FR and SR.</p>

                  <p>This randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 2015 to December 2019 in a university clinic. A total of 1488 volunteers from the community inquired about the study; 1217 were excluded or declined to participate. Eligibility criteria included body mass index (BMI) of 25 to 45, age 18 to 65 years, and lack of comorbidities or other exclusionary criteria that would interfere with participation. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to January 2022.</p>

Sixty-six participants were randomized to AC, 69 to ROC, 67 to ROC+, and 69 to BWL. Results showed that ROC, ROC+, and BWL interventions resulted in significantly lower BMI at the end of treatment (BMI ROC, â1.18; 95% CI, â2.10 to â0.35; BMI ROC+, â1.56; 95% CI, â2.43 to -0.67; BMI BWL, â1.58; 95% CI, â2.45 to â0.71). Compared with BWL, BMI at the end of treatment was not significantly different from ROC or ROC+ (BMI ROC, 0.40; 95% CI, â0.55 to 1.36; BMI ROC+, 0.03; 95% CI, â0.88 to 0.93); however, the BMI of the AC group was substantially higher (BMI AC, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.45). BMI reductions at 24 months after randomization were similar for ROC, ROC+, and BWL. Importantly, FR was a moderator of treatment effects with more weight loss for participants who scored higher in FR in the ROC and ROC+ groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 74% of US adults are living with either overweight or obesity.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Behavioral weight loss (BWL) programs, or lifestyle intervention programs, are the standard treatments for adults with overweight or obesity. However, trials repeatedly demonstrate moderate weight losses with substantial regain after the intervention ends.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In fact, maintenance of weight loss continues to be one of the biggest challenges in the field. An additional complicating factor is that individuals with overweight or obesity are a heterogeneous population, resulting in a wide variability in response to BWL.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> This heterogeneity suggests that underlying factors are impacting an individualâs ability to lose weight and maintain weight loss.</p>
              <p>The behavioral susceptibility theory (BST)<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> purports that genetically determined appetitive traits interact with the current food environment, leading to overeating and weight gain. The BST focuses on 2 important aspects of appetite, eating onset driven by food responsiveness (FR) and eating offset driven by satiety responsiveness (SR). Data suggest that both FR<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and SR<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> are highly heritable and that these durable appetitive traits are shaped by environmental and individual level factors, such as Pavlovian and operant learning, memory, and neural changes related to diet.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>We developed the regulation of cues (ROC) intervention, a novel treatment program based on the BST, that targets both FR and SR. ROC uses psychoeducation and experiential learning to promote proactive management of these appetitive traits. Our pilot data suggest that the ROC program is feasible, acceptable, and shows initial positive outcomes among adults who binge eat<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> as well as children with overweight or obesity.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>This randomized clinical trial evaluated whether ROC or ROC combined with BWL (ROC+) would improve weight loss across 12 months of treatment and 12 months of follow-up compared with an active comparator (AC) and BWL only. In exploratory analyses, we examined whether FR and SR moderated outcomes.</p>

Psychoeducation included how physiological responses to food cues develop and can be managed, how the environment encourages the body to overeat, and how to use physiological, behavioral, and cognitive coping skills for mastery and tolerance of FR.</p>
                  <p>ROC integrated experiential learning to improve responsiveness to hunger or satiety cues (SR) and to decrease sensitivity to food cues (FR). During sessions 2 through 8, participants were taught about hunger and satiety dysregulation. Participants were instructed to self-monitor their hunger on a 1 to 5 scale before, during, and after each meal, either in a self-monitoring booklet or a smartphone application (app). Participants brought dinner to groups and monitored their hunger while simulating different contexts (eg, boredom, sadness, when full, or when hungry).</p>
                  <p>During sessions 9 through 19, participants learned to self-monitor cravings or urges to eat on a 1 to 5 scale. Starting in session 10, when physically sated, they participated in cue-exposure treatment<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and completed 2 exposures with their highly craved foods. Participants self-monitored their cravings outside of the group treatment and tracked the strength, context, how much they ate, and whether they used coping skills.

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Model parameter estimates were tested using credible intervals (2.5%, 97.5%) and tail probability (2-sided) to asses how likely the value 0 was under the estimated posterior distribution. We used linear mixed-effects (LME) models to compare ROC and ROC+ with AC (aim 1) on changes to BMI, weight (kilograms), and loss of control eating at midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month and 12-month follow-up. These models also compared ROC and ROC+ with BWL (aim 2) on posttreatment BMI and rate of change in BMI both during and after treatment (BMI Ã time). Planned covariates included age, sex, loss of control eating, race or ethnicity, physical activity, and additional corresponding values for BMI or weight at the first session. To examine the robustness of treatment comparisons, we examined temporal patterns of missing BMI measures during and after treatment. Patterns of missed assessment (3 or more consecutive treatment or assessment weights) were classified as (1) no period of missed assessment, (2) missed assessments during the first 6-months of treatment, (3) missed assessments during the second 6-months of treatment, or (4) missed assessments after treatment. Models evaluated dummy-coded contrasts identifying assigned pattern group and whether effects of treatments were moderated by any missing data pattern.</p>

                <title>Changes in BMI After Treatment</title>
                <p>Mean changes in BMI at the posttreatment assessment indicated weight loss for all 4 groups, AC (mean [SD] â0.32 [2.06]), ROC (mean [SD] â1.29 [2.11]), BWL (mean [SD] â2.55 [2.53]), and ROC+ (mean [SD] â2.03 [2.42]). Likelihood ratio tests of models adding an index of missing pattern group (Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>â=â11.9; <italic>P</italic>â=â.01) and missing pattern group by treatment by time terms (Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>21</sub>â=â33.2; <italic>P</italic>â=â.04) were each significant. We included the missing pattern group and interactions with treatment in all subsequent intention to treat models.</p>
                <p>Joint imputation with 40 replicate combinations were formed using all predictors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, loss of control eating, and physical activity along with adjustment for corresponding baseline on BMI or weight) in the evaluative model. <xref rid="zoi220367f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the mean changes in BMI from baseline values for participants in each group across all assessments after allocation. Estimates from joint LME models showed that ROC, ROC+ and BWL interventions resulted in significantly lower BMI at the end of treatment (BMI ROC, â1.18; 95% CI, â2.10 to â0.35; BMI ROC+. â1.56; 95% CI, â2.43 to -0.67; BMI BWL, â1.58; 95% CI, â2.45 to â0.71; see <xref rid="zoi220367t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no significant differences in rates of change in BMI after treatment ended for ROC or ROC+ compared with AC. In planned comparisons with BWL, estimates from joint LME models showed that BMI at the end of treatment was not significantly different from ROC or ROC+ (BMI ROC, 0.40; 95% CI, â0.55 to 1.36; BMI ROC+, 0.03; 95% CI, â0.88 to 0.93); however, the BMI of the AC group was significantly higher (BMI AC, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.72 to 2.45). When compared with BWL, participants in AC and ROC+ had similar increases in BMI following the midtreatment assessment and throughout follow-up assessments. Participants in ROC had a significantly different rate of change in BMI through final assessments and did not experience the increase in BMI observed among those in BWL. Evaluation of weight (kilograms) was similar to BMI with significantly lower weight at the posttreatment for ROC, and ROC+ compared with AC and ROC had a significantly different rate of change in weight through final assessments when compared with BWL (<xref rid="zoi220367t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Results did not support the hypotheses of between-group differences in loss of control eating (<xref rid="zoi220367t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge, this study was the first randomized clinical trial of weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity participating in the novel ROC intervention. There were no significant differences between ROC, BWL, and ROC+ for weight loss at posttreatment or 12-month follow-up, which is notable given that the ROC group did not include any energy restriction recommendations. Although all treatments lasted 12 months, 3 groups had weight regain (BWL, ROC+, and AC) that started at midtreatment when the visit frequency reduced to monthly. Unlike the other 3 groups, ROC participants stabilized their weight after the midtreatment time point. Importantly, we found that individuals with high levels of FR were more successful in maintaining their weight loss in ROC and ROC+ than those in BWL.</p>
              <p>These results are important as ROC is a substantially different treatment than BWL. ROC teaches reliance on internal cues to decrease overeating, whereas BWL focuses on external management skills to decrease overeating. BWL prescribes a diet, restricts energy dense foods, reinforces avoidance of cues to overeat, and focuses on restricting energy intake. ROC does not prescribe a specific diet, trains the use of appetitive cues (instead of energy intake) to guide eating, reinforces tolerance of cravings, and focuses on inhibiting urges to eat palatable food when not physically hungry. Participants in ROC learn to tolerate food cues, not avoid them, and eating is used as a learning experience, which could promote translation of skills outside of the clinic. These skills may be more durable as evidenced by the lack of weight regain in the ROC group. It is important to note that although ROC targets these substantially different processes, there were no significant overall differences between ROC and the other 2 treatment groups that included energy restriction throughout treatment and follow-up.</p>
              <p>Dual process theories<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggest that both implicit and explicit processes exert control over behavior. ROC targets implicit processes and teaches internal control of overeating, whereas BWL targets explicit processes and promotes dietary restriction to control overeating. The top-down management of eating, such as in BWL, requires continued effort, which may be depleted over time. These top-down processes also contribute to cognitive load, which when treatment support is reduced or removed, may lead to the reduction of skill use. This may be 1 explanation for why participants in BWL and ROC+ experienced weight regain once visit frequency was reduced. Future studies are needed to further evaluate the impact of weight loss maintenance associated with the ROC treatment.</p>
              <p>ROC may confer additional benefits, as participants did not experience weight regain over the 24 months of the study. Weight cycling, including losing and regaining, is associated with depression and poorer mental health<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="zoi220367r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> as well as disproportionate weight regain.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Additionally, it is possible that participants in ROC could have experienced increased self-efficacy, as they may have been less likely to have experienced feelings of demoralization associated with weight regain.<sup><xref rid="zoi220367r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Further research is also needed to evaluate the effect of ROC on mental health.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, we also found that baseline level of FR was associated with improved outcomes in 2 of the 4 treatment groups. Our data suggest that individuals who had higher levels of FR at baseline had more sustained weight loss in ROC and ROC+ than in BWL or AC. This exploratory finding suggests that the appetitive mechanisms targeted in ROC may be especially critical for weight loss among individuals who have trouble resisting food. Thus, ROC could be used as part of a precision approach for weight-loss treatment for individuals with elevated levels of FR.</p>

                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths of the study include the evaluation of a novel intervention, ROC, which is, to our knowledge, the first weight-loss intervention targeting appetitive traits. This study compared ROC, as well as ROC+, with both BWL and an AC to determine the feasibility and initial efficacy. This study included a diverse sample of treatment-seeking adults. Strengths also include the targeting of and measuring specific mechanisms underlying overeating. Physical activity, FR, and SR were assessed using self-report, which may have been influenced by self-report bias. Additionally, we only assessed outcomes using BMI and it is possible that the treatments differentially affected other metabolic indicators. Because it was a treatment-seeking sample, these results cannot be generalized to the general population.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>ROC and ROC+ were successful in facilitating weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity, similar to lifestyle programs such as BWL. The ROC model targets appetitive traits, which is substantially different than BWL and may confer the additional benefit of weight loss stabilization rather than weight regain. This investigation supports the use of ROC and ROC+ as alternative models for treatment of overweight or obesity and could be used in personalized medicine for those individuals with high levels of FR.</p>
