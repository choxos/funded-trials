                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem among youth, contribute to reduced quality of daily life, and are associated with high rates of comorbidity. However, treatment rates for anxiety are very low, causing a sizeable treatment gap. There is an immediate need to identify treatment interventions that are effective, affordable, and can be delivered easily to the youth population. Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is one potentially effective intervention that could reach youth on a large scale, especially when self-administered at home. Thus, we aim to assess the benefit of CBM to treat youth anxiety. Further, we aim to test whether adding an adherence promotion (AP) component to the CBM intervention can improve outcomes, and whether CBM delivered both with and without the AP component is cost effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a 12-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted within an existing healthcare system. Potentially eligible youth (ages 12 to 17) will be identified by reviewing the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical anxiety diagnoses, which are then confirmed via research interview. We aim to enroll 498 participants and randomize them 1:1:1 to one of three arms: Arm 1 is a Low-Ratio version of the CBM program (nearly identical to the other CBM versions, but minimally effective); Arm 2 is a High-Ratio “active” CBM program; and Arm 3 is the High-Ratio CBM program with an added AP component. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. Youth in all three arms will self-administer the CBM program at home and will be asked to complete twelve intervention sessions over a four-week period. Arm 3 participants (High-Ratio CBM + AP) will also receive up to four telephone calls from phone coaches during the intervention period to provide technical assistance, encouragement, and motivational enhancement to increase adherence. The primary clinical outcome will be anxiety remission at 6-month follow-up.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par26">Approximately 1 in 3 adolescents meet criteria for an anxiety disorder by age 18, making anxiety disorders the most common mental health problem among youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These disorders interfere with daily life, have high rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], are associated with high health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and are comorbid with substance abuse, depression and functional impairment in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, anxiety has the lowest treatment rate of any mental disorder in childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; less than one-third of youth identified with anxiety received any intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This disparity between high prevalence and low treatment makes addressing this “care gap” a significant public health priority.</p>
              <p id="Par27">What treatments are known to be effective for youth anxiety disorder? While there is a large body of evidence supporting the efficacy of both cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety disorders, there are significant patient, intervention, and organizational barriers to youth receiving these evidence-based treatments (EBTs). Youth experiencing anxiety disorders typically have multiple psychosocial stressors and comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] that inhibit active engagement in CBT. CBT demands a substantial time commitment on the part of both patient and therapist, is expensive to deliver, and is not a widely available treatment option due to the lack of qualified therapists available (particularly in rural areas). Although antidepressant (AD) medications are accessible and easier to administer, significant barriers leading to treatment nonadherence have been well documented, such as concerns about adverse effects, fears of dependence, and the often weeks- or months-long delay before therapeutic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As a result, there is an immediate, unmet need to identify and disseminate effective treatment interventions that are accessible, affordable, have few or no negative side effects, and can be delivered easily to the youth population.</p>
              <p id="Par28">One potentially effective anxiety intervention that could reach affected youth on a large scale is computerized Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM). The role of cognitive bias in the development and maintenance of anxiety has been well established from basic cognitive research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Biased attention towards real or perceived threat is associated with anxiety due to hypervigilance, rumination, and inaccurate appraisal of risks. Past research has shown that this biased attention towards negative rather than positive or neutral stimuli increases anxiety, and is related to generalized anxiety, social phobia, and trait and state anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. CBM is one of several related treatments that aim to retrain individuals to focus attention on positive or neutral stimuli, rather than negative or threatening stimuli. CBM is designed to adjust attentional bias at this early stage of processing, when patients are engaged in hypervigilance and over-attention to threatening cues. At this early information processing stage, training to focus attention away from threat has been shown in early studies to reduce anxiety symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The effects of CBM delivered under optimal conditions have been shown to be similar in magnitude to CBT and SSRI treatment for anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and shows promising results in reducing anxiety in adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">In youth populations, prior studies of CBM have shown significant symptom improvement in both anxiety and depression when delivered in a lab-based or residential treatment facility setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, because CBM is a self-administered computerized program, one advantage is the ability to disseminate it to patients at home, as it has a lower cost and time burden to implement than in-person administration. However, few studies have examined the effect of CBM in a real-world setting. Therefore, it is critical to test this promising treatment in conditions similar to those in which it could be eventually disseminated, as it is sometime the case that intervention effects observed in highly controlled trials diminish when evaluated in real world circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">At least one study examined the efficacy of CBM delivered at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In that study, Carlbring and colleagues examined self-administered internet-based CBM in a home setting in 79 adults with social anxiety. These researchers did not find a significant difference between groups at post-treatment and 4-month follow-up. Neubauer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] also failed to find a benefit of Internet, home-delivered CBM versus the control condition at 4-month follow-up among their study of individuals with social phobia (<italic>n</italic> = 56).</p>
              <p id="Par31">One explanation for the weaker effects in self-administered CBM may be poor patient adherence when the intervention is delivered at home when compared to staff-facilitated lab settings. As a higher number of completed training sessions is associated with larger effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and in some studies, explicit staff-administered instructions for completing the CBM sessions may improve efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], another possible explanation for the lower efficacy of self-administered CBM may be reduced dose.</p>
              <p id="Par32">While most previous research of self-administered CBM has been conducted with adults, a number of studies have examined self-administered CBM among anxious youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the effectiveness of self-administered CBM among youth remains to be tested on a large-scale basis. Therefore, to address these gaps in the literature, we aim to conduct a large efficacy-effectiveness trial within an existing health-care system to assess the benefit of computerized CBM to treat youth (ages 12–17) with one or more clinical and research-confirmed anxiety diagnosis. We identify this trial as having an efficacy-effectiveness design because we implement rigorous research inclusion criteria and outcome assessment, and will examine CBM mediational mechanisms (efficacy features), but at the same time we enroll participants who are seeking routine clinical care for anxiety in a large active healthcare system, have clinical anxiety diagnoses, and the intervention is self-administered (effectiveness features). We aim to test whether a telephone-based adherence promotion (AP) program can improve adherence and CBM dose to the levels obtained when CBM is delivered in laboratories. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to test this added component. The AP protocol consists of 1 to 4 brief telephone calls to provide explicit instructions to complete the sessions, offering additional support and motivational enhancement techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] when warranted, and problem-solving barriers to completing the sessions.</p>
              <p id="Par33">We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of three arms, each corresponding to different versions of the CBM program: Low-Ratio CBM (Arm 1; a control/low dose version of CBM), High-Ratio “conventional” CBM (Arm 2), and High-Ratio CBM with AP (Arm 3). Ratio refers to the proportion of CBM trials in each session that are intended to retrain negative bias (details below). All versions of the intervention will be self-administered on participants’ home computers, as this would be the setting of eventual dissemination of this intervention. We hypothesize that the two High-Ratio CBM arms (Arms 2 and 3) will lead to greater rates of remission for anxiety diagnoses and greater improvement of symptoms and functioning, compared to the Low-Ratio CBM condition (Arm 1). Additionally, we hypothesize that the High-Ratio CBM with AP arm (Arm 3) will result in greater rates of anxiety remission and symptom improvement, compared to the High-Ratio CBM-only arm (Arm 2).</p>
              <p id="Par34">If we find that self-administered computerized CBM is an effective treatment option in real world settings, it will be important to consider whether broad dissemination and implementation is feasible. To evaluate this, we will compare the costs and outcomes of delivering High-Ratio CBM both with and without the adherence promotion component in an incremental cost effectiveness analysis. Specifically, we will examine whether High-Ratio CBM with AP will have benefits that warrant the additional cost of implementation (i.e., the additional labor costs associated with the AP portion of the intervention).</p>

                <p id="Par35">This study is approved by the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) Internal Review Board (IRB) in Portland, Oregon. This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), with participants blinded to the type of CBM they receive (low vs. high ratio) but not blinded regarding receipt of AP contacts. All evaluators are blinded to participant study condition.</p>
                <p id="Par36">Participants will be randomized via computer-programming to one of three arms in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by age at recruitment (&lt; age 15 vs. &gt; = age 15) and minority status (white non-Hispanic vs. all others). Assignment will be conducted with computer-generated random block sizes of 6 or 9, masked from study staff.</p>
                <p id="Par37">Arm 1 is a Low-Ratio version of the CBM intervention, nearly indistinguishable from the other CBM version but with a lower proportion of trials that shift attention to the neutral stimuli (details below). Arm 2 is a High-Ratio CBM program, with a higher proportion of trials shifting attention to the neutral stimuli. Arm 3 is the same High-Ratio CBM program but with a component consisting of adherence promoting (AP) telephone calls from a study phone coach, from 1 to 4 total as needed. All CBM programs are self-administered on participants’ home computers.</p>
                <p id="Par38">The primary clinical outcome will be diagnostic remission at 6-month follow-up from all anxiety diagnoses present at baseline, as confirmed by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) (see below). The secondary clinical outcomes will be the PARS, SCARED, attention bias, depression (PHQ-9), psychopathology severity (CGI-S), and psychosocial functioning (CGAS). We will also determine whether there are differences in treatment acceptability (PAQ) and satisfaction (CSQ-8). Another secondary outcome will be cost-effectiveness of the CBM intervention, as measured in incremental cost per anxiety-free-day (AFD) and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Additional analyses will test whether baseline CGI-S, PHQ-9 (depression), severity of cognitive bias (ADP), gender, socio-economic status, and race/ethnicity moderate the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome. Additionally, we will test whether attention bias mediates the effect of the intervention on the 6-month remission rate and anxiety outcomes (PARS and SCARED). Lastly, we will examine whether CBM process variables (i.e., number of trials [dose], acceptable error rates, reaction time) is associated with CBM outcomes.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Youth between the ages 12 to 17 years old will be enrolled from the KPNW healthcare organization, a large, non-profit health maintenance organization in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA. We aim to enroll a total of 498 participants in the study.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Potentially eligible youth will be identified by reviewing the healthcare organization electronic health record (EHR) for anxiety diagnoses (general anxiety disorder [GAD], anxiety disorder unspecified, or social phobia [SP], and/or separation anxiety). These are not qualifying criteria themselves, but a preliminary case-finding stage that identifies youth who are likely study eligible whom we will approach for recruitment. This initial EHR stage is meant to improve case-finding efficiency. Teen and parent participants will be recruited by mail, with a follow-up telephone call. Interested families will complete a brief, initial phone screening interview to determine if they meet preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria. If preliminary eligibility criteria are met, parents and youth will give consent to participate in the full baseline assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Inclusion criteria for this study include: age between 12 and 17 years old at enrollment; a research anxiety diagnosis confirmed by the ADIS at the baseline interview (see below); youth and parent able to complete assessments in English; youth access to a Windows home computer with Internet access. Exclusion criteria include: youth diagnosis of psychotic disorder; significantly impairing learning disorder or processing problem, such that completion of study procedures would be difficult; ADHD (except if symptoms are stable and controlled by medication for at least one month prior to enrollment); or youth primary complaint of condition other than anxiety. Comorbid diagnoses leading to study exclusion will be confirmed by reviewing the EHR.</p>
                <p id="Par42">We considered whether to require a minimum level of cognitive bias at baseline as an inclusion criterion. Based on the literature at the time of our proposal, higher pre-treatment levels of negative bias were associated with improved outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], although this question has been little tested in anxious youth. Ultimately, we elected to not require a minimum bias level, for several reasons. First, the literature on this issue is suggestive but not definitive, especially for youth. Second, the effectiveness nature of this trial argues for the broadest inclusion possible with the most representative sample. Third, including all youth regardless of baseline bias provided an opportunity to test this relationship in a very large sample.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par65">Youth in all three arms will download one of two versions of the CBM program, depending on their study condition, and install it on their home computers. Neither youth, parent or assessment staff will know what CBM version is installed; all versions appear indistinguishable to users. Youth are asked to ideally complete three intervention sessions per week over a four-week period (a goal of 12 sessions total). Youth in all three study arms may receive non-research Treatment as Usual (TAU) for anxiety and other conditions, as delivered by the HMO or other healthcare providers. TAU may include CBT, other psychotherapies, and/or medications. We will collect data on receipt of TAU from the HMO’s EHR at the study conclusion, augmented with information about any services the youth may have received outside of the HMO during the follow-up assessments.</p>
                <p id="Par66">CBM procedures. The Low-Ratio CBM condition (Arm 1), and the two High-Ratio CBM conditions (Arms 2 and 3) share a common protocol for the delivery of the intervention. After eligibility is determined from the baseline assessment and the participant is randomized, they will be given a link and unique code to install the internet-based CBM program on their home computer. After registering with the program, the youth will complete a practice session over the phone with a study staff member. The same set of stimuli will be used for all three conditions, making the downloaded program appear identical to all users. Each youth will be instructed to complete three 15-min sessions per week for four weeks (12 sessions total). In each session, youth view 160 trials of a computerized probe detection task (simulated screenshots in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In each trial, two faces are briefly displayed one above the other, from a standardized set of 8 individuals. For all three CBM conditions, 80% of trials consist of neutral and negative (disgusted) face pairs, while the remaining 20% of trials consist of two neutral faces. Following a 500 ms presentation, the images disappear and a letter probe (either “E” or “F”) is displayed in the location where either the top or bottom face had just been. Youth are instructed to decide whether the letter was an “E” or an “F” with a left or right click of a mouse button. Youth do not receive feedback indicating the accuracy of their responses. In the 80% of High Ratio CBM trials (Arms 2, 3) where a neutral and disgusted face are present, the probe (E or F) always replaces the neutral face. In this manner, youth are trained to disengage their attention from threat. In the Low-Ratio condition (Arm 1), the probe replaces the neutral and disgusted faces with equal frequency (50–50%) in the trials containing both types of faces, and thus only minimal threat retraining occurs. The same library of stimuli is used for all training sessions. Images of faces will be used, rather than emotional words, because facial stimuli have been used in previous CBM studies with youths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and may control for differences in youths’ reading ability. Moreover, faces are the most common stimuli in CBM, across disorder type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

                <p id="Par67">Phone Coach Adherence Promotion (AP) (Arm 3 Only). AP procedures are intended to mimic the effects of the nonspecific, yet likely important, support and instruction provided by research staff when CBM has been traditionally delivered in laboratories. This includes technical assistance with use of the program, support/encouragement, motivational enhancement, and brainstorming solutions to barriers to regular sessions. We hypothesize that the addition of AP will lead to greater participant adherence to the program and therefore better clinical outcomes. In the first 4 weeks of each youth’s enrollment, phone coaches will make between one and four brief, 10–30 min AP telephone calls to youth enrolled in the High-Ratio CBM + AP condition (Arm 3). Coaches may also involve parents as appropriate. Call frequency will be determined by need, primarily based on the participant’s level of adherence to the CBM program. Participants who complete at least 80% of required sessions with a accuracy rate of 80% or higher will be considered adherent to the program. Youth who are most adherent to the protocol may receive only one or two AP calls from their coach, whereas youth with inconsistent or suboptimal use of the CBM program will receive more calls, up to a total of four. Phone coaches will receive automated adherence reports by logging into the server that stores the session data (e.g., number of trials, accuracy, reaction time). Phone coaches will use these reports to determine the need for AP calls, and the type of coaching they will provide (e.g., low accuracy rate and short reaction time might suggest that youth should slow down slightly to be more accurate). Calls do not need to be once weekly, but may be concentrated (e.g., twice weekly for the first few weeks) in order to facilitate participant engagement and maximize exposure to the CBM program. Coaches will record the date, duration, and content addressed in each call.</p>
                <p id="Par68">The phone coaches will provide the explicit rationale and instructions for the CBM intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], as well as the “fear priming” instructions which encourage youth to activate anxiety fears prior to each CBM session to potentiate the effectiveness of CBM skills training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The remaining content of phone coach calls will be individualized to the needs/issues of each participant, but will typically address: technical assistance (difficulty downloading CBM program, registering, creating a user account); encouragement and reinforcement for appropriate use; problem solving to overcome barriers and obstacles to use; using brief motivational enhancement techniques to encourage participants to use the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; and/or coaching and advice to ensure high quality CBM sessions (e.g., conducting sessions at times/locations where participants will not be interrupted). If needed, phone coaches will also provide case-management and referrals for emergent clinical issues not addressed by CBM program (e.g., suicidality), although they will explicitly not themselves provide any psychosocial therapy for anxiety or any other issues.</p>
                <p id="Par69"><bold>CBM Session review</bold> questions will be asked of youth at 1-month follow-up. Questions ask about the number and length of sessions completed, which device was used, and interruptions during session completion.</p>

Number of sessions is calculated as the number of sessions completed from baseline to the 1-month follow-up. A session is defined as at least 160 completed trials. Quality of participation includes: missing data due to non-response, inaccurate responses (pressing random buttons), and probe response latencies outside of the task window (&lt; 200 ms, &gt; 3500 ms). As a check on the adequacy of our overall CBM implementation, we will benchmark the quality of participant performance against the CBM literature, for the total sample and by arm. Number of trainings and participation quality are also secondary outcomes, with the hypothesis that the Adherence Promotion arm (Arm 3) will show superior effects on anxiety due to an expected higher number of CBM sessions.</p>

                    <p id="Par74">For each continuous outcome (anxiety symptoms [PARS, SCARED], depression [PHQ-9], psychopathology severity [CGI-S], psychosocial functioning [CGAS]) we will test whether there are differences between arms in the trajectories across time by fitting growth curve models in a nested two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>];).We will test the primary outcome (anxiety remission based on ADIS-C) and the CGI-I with a generalized form of HLM, using a logit link and the binomial distribution. For all HLM models, the first level of the model represents within-person variation and will include time as a predictor (3–5 timepoints, depending on the measure). The second model level represents between-person variation and includes dummy indicators for arm as the predictor variables. A significant coefficient for arm on the slope of time indicates (i.e., the cross-level interaction of arm by time) that there are different trajectories across time for each arm and will be followed with a graph to interpret the interaction(s). Assuming that the trajectories are nonlinear as is common in clinical trials (e.g., initial intervention effect upon completing the intervention and maintenance period), we will use fractional polynomials to estimate the most appropriate function for time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. We will test our primary hypotheses using linear contrasts of the dummy vectors representing treatment arm to determine whether both High-Ratio CBM arms (2 and 3) have a different trajectory than the Low-Ratio arm, and whether High-Ratio CBM + AP (Arm 3) has a different trajectory than High-Ratio CBM Only (Arm 2). Differences at 1 month in acceptability (PAQ) and client satisfaction (CSQ-8) will be tested with a one-way ANOVA with treatment arm as the independent variable and the same a priori contrasts described above.</p>

Using the product coefficients approach to mediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], we will use the resulting regression coefficients and standard errors (SEs) to estimate the indirect effect.

                    <p id="Par78">Preliminary to calculations, we conducted a review of the adult and youth CBM anxiety literature to estimate plausible effect sizes. This included the five adult RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], two youth RCTs, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and one youth case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To increase comparability across studies, we calculated within-condition effect sizes (ESs) for anxiety reduction associated with the variants of CBM most relevant for this proposal. For Low-Ratio CBM, we found a mean ES of d = 0.52. For self-administered CBM (often Internet delivered), we found a mean ES of 0.82. Lab-administered CBM yielded a mean ES of 1.39. Finally, CBM with a mix of lab and self-administered sessions yielded a mean ES similar to lab-based studies (mean d = 1.56). From this review we (a) projected the within- and between-condition ES differences we might expect in our proposed design and (b) calculated the effective ES for each of our hypotheses of clinical outcomes. For the comparison of the two High-Ratio CBM conditions vs. Low-Ratio CBM, our review suggests an estimated difference (Δ) ES of d = 0.73. We conservatively powered this analysis for an ES Δ of 0.59, approximately equivalent to an odds ratio of 2.90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. To estimate the ES for the comparison of CBM + AP and High-Ratio CBM, we looked to the literature for estimates of the comparison of lab-administered vs. self-administered CBM. This review suggests an estimated ES Δ of d = 0.57. We chose to power the analysis for this hypothesis with a conservative ES Δ of d = 0.37, which is approximately equivalent to an odds ratio of 1.94 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p>

We based our target sample on the larger N needed to adequately test this latter hypothesis (Arm 2 vs. Arm 3).

Although other perspectives, such as the societal perspective, may be important to understand, the healthcare perspective is particularly relevant when the focus is on the healthcare system implementing the intervention.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par81">This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the benefit of computerized CBM to treat youth with anxiety. This RCT is considered a blended efficacy-effectiveness trial, in that it is highly controlled with detailed, blinded assessments and has a focus on possible treatment mechanisms, but is also conducted in a real-life setting with youth who have sought usual care services for anxiety and who have received a clinical anxiety diagnosis. The primary aim of this study is to assess whether self-administered CBM can be successfully delivered as a self-administered treatment at home, and whether High-Ratio CBM will demonstrate clinical effectiveness. Further, we aim to assess whether High-Ratio CBM with the AP component will result in greater rates of anxiety remission than High-Ratio CBM without AP. Finally, we aim to assess whether self-administered CBM is cost effective to deliver to youth seeking anxiety treatment in a real-world health-care setting.</p>
              <sec id="Sec18">
                <title>Strengths</title>
                <p id="Par82">The study uses a rigorous control condition with a Low-Ratio CBM design, which controls for the effects of time and attention. The youth in all three arms will be asked to complete the same number of sessions over the intervention period, and in each session the youth view the same number of trials. These features bring the rigor of a classic efficacy design and permit confident attributions of outcome effects.</p>
                <p id="Par83">This study will have “effectiveness” elements (such as recruitment via electronic medical records and self-administration of CBM), which will allow us to enroll a sample that is 10 times larger than other published CBM trials. This study will be large enough to have the statistical power to pursue a wide variety of substantive, mechanistic, and economic analyses that smaller lab-based studies could not address. However, the sample will not be so large that we are unable to pursue a detailed evaluation of clinical outcomes.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par84">Although self-administered CBM promises to be an easily disseminated treatment for anxiety, past results have been mixed when CBM has been delivered outside of the lab. It is possible that without any in-person staff support, participants will not adhere to the protocol as closely as if they were in the lab. However, the design of the current study has attempted to address this potential limitation by adding the telephone-based adherence promotion arm to address these potential issues, which will be the first to test the importance of this component. This added component will add additional support provided by research staff to give technical assistance with the use of the program, support/encouragement, motivational enhancement, and brainstorming solutions to barriers. The addition of AP in this trial will attempt to recreate some of the support of in-person lab-based interventions, which we hypothesize will lead to greater clinical effectiveness of the self-administered CBM program.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Another potential limitation is that the control condition is itself an active treatment, albeit of a lower “dose” of negative bias retraining opportunities. While this controls for expectation bias and treatment exposure, it also may prove to be a more a more difficult control condition for the High-Ratio CBM to overcome.</p>
                <p id="Par86">The study is a mixed-blind design, where participants are unaware whether they are being administered the High- or Low-Ratio version of the CBM program. However, with the addition of the AP component in Arm 3, it is impossible for the participants and phone coaches in this arm to be blind to their condition. To address this, we have taken measures to ensure that the research evaluation staff remain blinded to participant condition and complete assessments without knowledge of their assignment, including whether a given participant is receiving AP.</p>
                <p id="Par87">Our planned sample will have approximately 141 participants in each arm at 12-month follow-up, accounting for an expected attrition rate of 10%. A sample this size is sufficient to detect expected clinical differences, but will give us a less than optimal level of power to detect differences in the cost effectiveness analyses which ideally compare hundreds or thousands of cases per condition. Although this is a limitation, the economic evaluation will still provide useful information about the likely effect size related to cost effectiveness for the intervention and this information could help refine the intervention in order to increase its potential for implementation in other health-care settings.</p>
                <p id="Par88">This self-administered CBM intervention overcomes barriers to EBTs for anxiety such as cognitive behavioral therapy and SSRI medication, as well as limitations to previous studies that require participants to attend a centrally located clinic and complete sessions in a lab. The at-home format of this intervention makes it uniquely easy to disseminate, and this study will fill a gap in the literature by comparing the costs and outcomes of delivering CBM both with and without an adherence promotion component. This will provide the information needed to consider whether broad dissemination and implementation of this intervention is feasible.</p>
