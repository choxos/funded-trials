                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Following extubation from invasive mechanical ventilation, nearly one in seven critically ill adults requires reintubation. Reintubation is independently associated with increased mortality. Postextubation respiratory support (non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula applied at the time of extubation) has been reported in small-to-moderate-sized trials to reduce reintubation rates among hypercapnic patients, high-risk patients without hypercapnia and low-risk patients without hypercapnia. It is unknown whether protocolised provision of postextubation respiratory support to every patient undergoing extubation would reduce the overall reintubation rate, compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The Protocolized Post-Extubation Respiratory Support (PROPER) trial is a pragmatic, cluster cross-over trial being conducted between 1 October 2017 and 31 March 2019 in the medical intensive care unit of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. PROPER compares usual care versus protocolized post-extubation respiratory support (a respiratory therapist-driven protocol that advises the provision of non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula based on patient characteristics). For the duration of the trial, the unit is divided into two clusters. One cluster receives protocolised support and the other receives usual care. Each cluster crosses over between treatment group assignments every 3 months. All adults undergoing extubation from invasive mechanical ventilation are enrolled except those who received less than 12 hours of mechanical ventilation, have ‘Do Not Intubate’ orders, or have been previously reintubated during the hospitalisation. The anticipated enrolment is approximately 630 patients. The primary outcome is reintubation within 96 hours of extubation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Up to 40% of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) require invasive mechanical ventilation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Protocols for low tidal volume ventilation, daily spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) have considerably shortened the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and improved outcomes for these patients.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Despite these improvements, the period of time following extubation remains high risk, with rates of reintubation between 10% and 15% in the first 96 hours after extubation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–8</xref> Reintubation is associated with increased rates of nosocomial infection<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and is independently associated with an increased risk of death.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10 11</xref> Despite significant improvements in the management of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the rate of reintubation has not changed meaningfully over the last 20 years.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref> One of the few therapies suggested to reduce the rate of reintubation is postextubation respiratory support with either non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC).</p>
              <p>For patients with respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> NIV can prevent the need for the initial intubation, improve the safety for those progressing to intubation,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> allow earlier extubation<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> and decrease mortality. Among patients who experience respiratory failure after extubation, however, the data have been disappointing. ‘Rescue’ NIV applied when a patient develops respiratory failure hours or days after extubation, delays the time to reintubation and may be associated with an increase in ICU mortality.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Postextubation respiratory support with NIV, started at the time of extubation as prevention, not as treatment for recurrent respiratory failure after extubation, has had more promising initial results.</p>
              <p>In unselected ICU populations, several trials failed to demonstrate significant benefit of postextubation respiratory support with NIV,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> but success has been observed in targeted subpopulations, specifically those presumed to be at high risk. These trials have defined risk of reintubation using various criteria, including duration of ventilation, age greater than 65, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score exceeding 12 on the day of extubation, congestive heart failure, hypercapnia, weak cough, upper airway stridor and comorbidities. For these high-risk patients, postextubation support with NIV may decrease the rate of reintubation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 25</xref> For patients who are hypercapnic during an SBT, postextubation support with NIV appears to reduce reintubation and improve a 90-day mortality.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Recent national guidelines for management following extubation recommend postextubation respiratory support with NIV for patients at high risk of reintubation.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While ‘high risk’ was not defined in these guidelines, it was suggested that the criteria may include hypercapnia, COPD, congestive heart failure or other serious comorbidities.</p>
              <p>HFNC, a device capable of providing 100% oxygen at flow rates that exceed peak inspiratory flow rates, decreases work of breathing, provides a low level of continuous positive airway pressure, washes out dead space and improves patient comfort and secretion management.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–33</xref> HFNC may decrease mortality in non-intubated patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In non-hypercapnic patients undergoing extubation in a medical ICU, postextubation respiratory support with HFNC, started at the time of extubation and continued for 24–48 hours, has been reported to reduce the rate of reintubation in high-risk patients, low risk patients and a general population of ICU patients.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref>
</p>
              <p>In combination, these studies raise the hypothesis that all critically ill adults undergoing extubation from invasive mechanical ventilation might benefit from some form of postextubation respiratory support, either NIV or HFNC. Concerns remain, however, that results of recent studies may not generalise to the broader population of patients extubated in ICUs outside of the settings in which the studies were conducted. Rates of reintubation in reported trials range from 14.4% in ‘low-risk’ patients<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> to 19.1% for ‘high-risk’ patients,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> considerably higher than the 10% reintubation rate cited by large national registries.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Use of any form of postextubation respiratory support during routine clinical practice remains uncommon at many centres.</p>
              <p>Given the potential benefits for postextubation respiratory support for multiple patient populations, the low uptake in current usual care in many settings, and concerns about generalisability from prior explanatory trials, an effectiveness trial among critically ill adults undergoing extubation from mechanical ventilation is warranted. We designed the Protocolized Post-Extubation Respiratory Support (PROPER) Trial to determine the overall effect of a protocolised approach to postextubation support (protocolised support) on the primary outcome of reintubation within the 96 hours of extubation, among a broad population of critically ill adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.</p>

                <p>The PROPER trial is a prospective, unblinded, pragmatic, cluster cross-over trial being conducted between 1 October 2017 and 31 March 2019 in the medical ICU of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, USA. PROPER compares the rate of reintubation within 96 hours of extubation between patients provided protocolised support (a respiratory therapist-driven protocol that advises the provision of NIV or HFNC based on patient characteristics), to usual care (where postextubation management is at the discretion of treating clinicians). Consistent with the concept of a pragmatic clinical trial,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> the eligibility criteria are broad and the study procedures are embedded into routine care and executed by clinical personnel. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of protocolised support when applied to ‘real-world’ practice.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and treatment allocation</title>
                <p>The medical ICU is divided into two geographical clusters (the front hallway and the back hallway), each of which is staffed by a respiratory therapist. During each 3-month block of the study, patients extubated in one cluster receive protocolised support delivered by one respiratory therapist while patients extubated in the other cluster receive usual care delivered by another respiratory therapist. All beds in the study unit care for patients of the same acuity, and patients are assigned to bed location based on availability without selection by patient characteristics. Patients admitted to the ICU remain in the same bed until death or ICU discharge. Among patients in the study ICU in the year prior to the trial who would have met criteria for enrolment, there was no difference in the incidence of reintubation in patients admitted to the beds in each of the two clusters. The assigned treatment group alternates every 3 months over the course of the trial so that each cluster will experience an equal number of months of protocolised support and usual care. A single randomisation was performed which determined that the cluster associated with back hallway would receive protocolised support during the first block. The front hallway received usual care during the first block, and the blocks have alternated every 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>The rationale for dividing the study unit into two clusters by geographical location of the beds was so that all patients assigned to a given respiratory therapist’s cluster will receive the same treatment. A respiratory therapist caring for patients in the cluster assigned to protocolised support receives education on postextubation respiratory support and structured feedback on his or her performance at the practice level. Assigning some patients cared for by a respiratory therapist protocolised support and some patients to usual care was expected to introduce contamination because the respiratory therapist would be more likely to deliver postextubation respiratory support to patients in their care assigned to the usual care arm. Given the nature of the intervention, patients, treating clinicians and investigators are not blinded to group assignment.</p>

                  <p>Patients in the protocolised support group are assigned to receive postextubation respiratory support starting at the time of extubation.

                  </fig>
                  <p>Based on the results of previous trials, the protocol for postextubation respiratory support recommends NIV immediately on extubation via a full face mask for all patients in the protocolised support group who have suspected hypercapnia<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> or are intubated for an acute exacerbation of COPD.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Because arterial blood gases are not routinely performed during SBTs in the study unit, suspected hypercapnia is defined as known chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, known obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or an arterial blood gas with a PaO<sub>2</sub> of arterial carbon dioxide &gt;45 mm Hg on an SBT. Recommended initial settings for NIV include initiation with an initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 14 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, an expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 8 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and a backup respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Settings are titrated to maintain a minute ventilation between 5.0 and 10.0 L per minute and a respiratory rate below 30 breaths per minute, with a maximum IPAP of 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Inspired fraction of oxygen is titrated to maintain an oxygen saturation &gt;90% (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure S2</xref>). Removal of NIV for up to 1 hour at a time for patient comfort and to allow patients to eat or drink is encouraged and administration of sedatives to increase patient tolerance of NIV is discouraged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Device settings may be altered at the discretion of the respiratory therapist or the clinical team.</p>
                  <p>Given previous data suggesting that postextubation support with HFNC may be superior to conventional oxygen in low-risk patients<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and equivalent to NIV in non-hypercapnic high-risk patients,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> the protocol for postextubation respiratory support recommends HFNC for all patients in the protocolised support group who were not intubated for an acute exacerbation of COPD and who do not have suspected hypercapnia. Additionally, HFNC is recommended for patients who have a contraindication to NIV (facial or cranial trauma or surgery, recent gastric or oesophageal surgery, inability to protect the airway, active emesis or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, excessive amount of respiratory secretions or lack of cooperation). Patients who are extubated to NIV but are unable to tolerate it may be transitioned to HFNC.</p>
                  <p>For patients in the protocolised support group without suspected hypercapnia or a COPD exacerbation, HFNC is initiated immediately on extubation. Recommended initial settings for HFNC and titration and weaning parameters include initial flow rates of at least 40 L per minute, adjustment of flow rates in increments of 5 L per minute, titration to patient comfort and a respiratory rate less than 30, a maximum flow rate of 60 L per minute, and titration of the fraction of inspired oxygen to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation &gt;90% (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figure S3</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Postextubation respiratory support is provided from the time of extubation until 5:00 hours on the day following extubation. At 5:00 hours on the day following extubation, a respiratory therapist assesses for readiness for weaning from postextubation respiratory support. This timing was designed to allow patients to transfer out of the ICU on the day following extubation if clinically appropriate. Based on timing of extubation during the year preceding this trial, patients are expected to receive a median of 17 hours of respiratory support, and no less than 5 hours of respiratory support prior to being evaluated for weaning.</p>
                  <p>If the patient meets weaning criteria (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary figures S2 and S3</xref>) at the time of their assessment, the device is removed and the patient may be initiated on conventional oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula or face mask if needed. Postextubation respiratory support with NIV or HFNC may be continued at the discretion of the treating clinicians, in which case subsequent titration and weaning is determined by the treating clinicians. Postextubation respiratory support may be discontinued prior to 5:00 hours on the day following extubation if the patient is transferred out of the ICU, the patient declines further postextubation respiratory support, or the treating clinicians determine that discontinuation is needed for the optimal care of the patient.</p>
                  <p>The decision to use HFNC or NIV as rescue treatment for postextubation respiratory failure is made by treating clinicians and is prospectively recorded but is not encouraged. For patients in the protocolised support group, treating clinicians may decide to use invasive mechanical ventilation, NIV, HFNC or conventional oxygen therapy at any time, regardless of group assignment, if felt to be needed for the safe care of the patient.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>On completion, PROPER will provide the most comprehensive data to date on the effect of protocolized post-extubation respiratory support on reintubation on reintubation in an unselected medical ICU population. Previous trials have suggested that patients with hypercapnia,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> non-hypercapnic patients at high risk of reintubation<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5 24</xref> and non-hypercapnic patients at low risk of reintubation<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> could all potentially benefit from postextubation respiratory support. The protocolised provision of respiratory support to a broad population of ICU patients encompassing each of these previously examined subgroups in a randomised, controlled trial has yet to be reported.</p>
              <p>If our results demonstrate that protocolised respiratory support reduces the rate of reintubation, this would provide compelling evidence that nearly all patients undergoing extubation in a medical ICU should receive respiratory support in the form of either NIV or HFNC at the time of extubation. Conversely, if we demonstrate that protocolised respiratory support does not reduce the rate of reintubation overall, this would allow the providers to avoid unnecessarily expending the resources required to provide postextubation respiratory support to nearly all patients undergoing extubation. Instead, resources might be targeted to those patient subgroups for whom benefit has been previously noted, or for whom benefit is noted in our subgroup analyses. The results may also guide future research toward identifying patients at highest risk of reintubation and those most likely to benefit from respiratory support.</p>
              <p>Previous trials have provided 24–48 hours of support.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 25 26 36 37</xref> We elected a lower minimum duration because this support can only be provided in an ICU setting at many centres, and in a population with a low baseline reintubation rate the intervention could potentially lead to longer ICU lengths of stay than necessary. The design of the PROPER trial specifies the provision of postextubation respiratory support from extubation until at least 5:00 hours the following day, at which point the patient’s readiness to wean from postextubation respiratory support is assessed. This strategy involves a minimum of 5 hours of respiratory support, and our preliminary data suggest a median of 17 hours of support. While shorter than other studies, our approach allows removal of support and transfer from the ICU on the day following extubation, if clinically appropriate, or continuation of respiratory support when clinically indicated.</p>
              <p>The primary outcome is reintubation, defined as placement of an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube in the trachea for any reason, in the 96 hours following enrolment. Previous studies have evaluated reintubation over a broad range of time intervals, from 48 hours<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37 56</xref> to 7 days<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and longer.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Longer time intervals capture more events but increase the risk that the reintubation is unrelated to the original illness and respiratory function in the immediate postextubation period. Intubation within 96 hours of extubation was chosen as the primary outcome based on a large observational study assessing time to reintubation in 96 367 adults who received ventilation in an ICU in the USA. That study proposed 96 hours as the optimal time point at which to assess reintubation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While justifiable, selection of a binary endpoint occurring within a defined time window might miss evidence for benefit, and so we have prespecified a survival analysis that considers time to reintubation.</p>
              <p>In our design, we have made choices to bias towards the null. This means there are several threats to observing a difference between study groups. Foremost, the anticipated median duration of postextubation respiratory support of 17 hours is shorter than the 24–48 hours delivered in some prior trials. Some patients may be intolerant of postextubation respiratory support, which may further limit the average exposure to the study interventions. It is also possible that the use of postextubation respiratory support in the usual care group may be higher during the study period than prior to the trial due to increasing provider familiarity with postextubation respiratory support, contamination from the unblinded intervention being delivered in the same study location, or both. The provision of postextubation support provided in the usual care group of this single centre trial may not match the experience at other centres so we will provide data on the use of NIV and HFNC in the usual care arm of PROPER to assist in the interpretation of the results. Another potential possibility is that use of one therapy will be similar between the intervention and usual care groups (eg, use of NIV) with substantial separation between groups in the other therapy (eg, use of HFNC). This would require a more nuanced interpretation of the study findings. Treating clinicians are aware of study group assignment and so clinicians may alter the timing of extubation or management of postextubation respiratory failure based on group assignment. To assess for such bias, we will present characteristics of the two study groups at extubation, including duration of mechanical ventilation prior to extubation, and information about use of rescue respiratory support in the two groups. We will also perform analyses that adjust for these factors or conduct prespecified sensitivity analyses. Finally, group assignment at the level of the cluster with multiple cluster-level crossovers introduces the possibility for intracluster correlation, intraperiod correlation, and intracluster intraperiod correlation, which may confound the relationship between group assignment and outcome. In the PROPER trial, the two clusters are anticipated to be extremely similar, as they are two halves of a single ICU. The periods are relatively short and each cluster alternates between group assignment relatively frequently. Among patients in the study ICU in the year prior to the trial who would have met criteria for enrolment, we measured these correlations and found the effect of intracluster correlation, intraperiod correlation and intracluster intraperiod correlation to be negligible (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary methods</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>We describe, before the conclusion of enrolment or data unblinding, our trial design and our approach to analysing the data from a large, pragmatic, cluster cross-over trial comparing the rate of reintubation between patients receiving protocolized post-extubation respiratory support on reintubation and those patients receiving usual care. Disseminating this prespecified framework enhances the rigour and reproducibility of our final report, and will allow readers to better judge the impact of our findings.</p>
