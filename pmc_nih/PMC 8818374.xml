                <p>Given vulnerability to COVID-19 among smokers and vaccine hesitancy among populations disproportionately burdened with COVID-19, it’s important to understand concerns about vaccines and the impact of COVID-19 on these subgroups. Among our all African American (AA) sample of smokers (N = 172) enrolled in a larger smoking cessation clinical trial, results demonstrated an intensive burden from COVID-19; 42 (24.4%) lost employment, 56 (32.6%) lost household income, and 66 (38.4%) reported inability to pay bills and buy food due to COVID. Most, 103 (64.4%), were willing to get vaccinated. Among the vaccine-hesitant, 57 (35.6%), concerns about COVID-19 vaccine development and mistrust in vaccines were primary reasons for unwillingness to get vaccinated. Few identified doctor’s advice as most valued in deciding if the vaccine was the best option. Findings highlight high openness to the vaccine among smokers impacted by COVID but reiterate the need for community-engaged versus health system-driven approaches to improve vaccine hesitancy among racial/ethnic minorities.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0020">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disproportionately impacted racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States (US), with higher infection and mortality rates among Black Americans.<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Potential underlying reasons for racial disparities in impacts of the pandemic include social vulnerability, indicated by higher concentrations of minority groups in lower-wage employment, essential jobs where social distancing is difficult or impossible, and high-density housing.<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> Additionally, African Americans (AAs) have higher rates of comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension,<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and face inequalities in accessing healthcare.<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0025">The high prevalence of pre-existing comorbid health conditions makes AAs who smoke especially vulnerable to severe forms of COVID-19.<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Recent studies have established that smoking increases the risk for hospitalization by 80% and doubles the risk of mortality from COVID-19.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Others have found that AAs who smoke have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 as well as a poorer prognosis compared to Caucasian smokers.<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0030">The COVID-19 vaccine in the US could reduce the burden of the pandemic. This is especially true in racial/ethnic minority communities that have been disproportionately burdened, but vaccine hesitancy remains prevalent due to decades of mistreatment by the medical community which has fostered mistrust.<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> As of September 2021, 64% of AAs remain unvaccinated.<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> Stemming from historical and ongoing bias and mistreatment by the healthcare community,<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> Blacks are less likely than Whites to believe that the vaccine is effective and safe and more likely to believe that the vaccine is dangerous, more harmful than COVID-19, and that it has been rushed out too quickly.<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0035">Addressing vaccine hesitancy is an important public health priority. Widespread uptake of vaccines is critical to ending the pandemic and curtailing the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Several studies have identified attitudes and beliefs associated with vaccine hesitancy among AAs but none have explored reasons for hesitancy among AA smokers or AAs engaged with medical community research, which may provide a different and more nuanced viewpoint than those from prior studies.<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> This study aims to better understand concerns about vaccines and the impact of the pandemic on income and employment among AA smoker participants of a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Further, the current sample is comprised solely of smokers who, given increased vulnerability to COVID, offer a unique perspective which could help clinicians and researchers better customize health communication strategies, increase vaccine uptake, and reduce adverse outcomes within this highly vulnerable population.</p>

All participants were from Missouri or Kansas, non-Hispanic Black adults (≥18 years), daily smokers and interested in quitting smoking when enrolled in the trial. Study procedures were approved and monitored by the KUMC Institutional Review Board.</p>

Participants were asked if COVID-19 changed their employment status, household income or their ability to pay bills or buy basic necessities like food. We also asked participants if they or someone from their family has tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally, we inquired about their perceived risk of exposure and whether they were worried about getting COVID-19. Finally, we asked participants to select any of the following health concerns related to COVID-19: autoimmune disease, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, kidney or chronic lung diseases, or diabetes.</p>

Responses from 0 to 4 were categorized as “not likely to take the COVID vaccine,” 5 and 6 as “somewhat likely,” and 7 to 10 as “highly likely.” We used an open-ended question to explore reasons associated with participants being not likely, somewhat likely or extremely likely to get the vaccine. We also asked participants what sources of information would influence their decision to take the vaccine.</p>

                <p id="p0065">Quantitative data were summarized using means and frequencies in SPSS. To analyze the qualitative data, EC initially created a list with keywords and categories that grouped participants together. Then, two investigators (EC, NM) used this list to open-code/categorize a subset of responses to the open-ended questions. They compared their coding and arrived at categories and definitions for participant responses. They discussed responses that were difficult to categorize, and devised categories/definitions for those responses, with a third reviewer (KR, TS or NN). These categories and definitions constituted a master code list. They both categorized all the participants’ responses using the final master code list.</p>

                <p id="p0080">More than four out of ten participants 66 (41.3%) reported that they were highly likely to take the vaccine when it became available (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
). The most common reasons associated with this were the belief that the vaccine would protect them from getting the virus and worries about the consequences of COVID. More than a third 57 (35.6%), reported that they were not likely to get the vaccine. The most common reasons for not being willing to get vaccinated were uncertainty about its development, not taking vaccines in general (including flu shots), and lack of trust in the vaccine. A number of participants 37 (23.1%) were somewhat likely to take the vaccine. Those same participants also mentioned concerns about the development of the vaccine as well as its safety and efficacy as common reasons why they were not sure if they would like to take it.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine and associated reasons among African Americans (N = 172).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">If a COVID-19 vaccine were free and available to you, how likely would you be to get it?</td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="o0005"><label>1.</label><p id="p0005">Likely to take the vaccine if it was freely available, n (%)</p></list-item></list></td><td>66 (41.3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Reason for being likely to take the vaccine (70 comments)</td></tr><tr><td>To be protected against the virus</td><td>39 (55.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Worried about the consequences of the virus</td><td>8 (11.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Because it is effective</td><td>7 (10.0)</td></tr><tr><td>To avoid spreading the virus</td><td>5 (7.1)</td></tr><tr><td>To protect my health</td><td>4 (5.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Because it is free</td><td>3 (4.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Others (I already got it, being around others)</td><td>4 (5.7)</td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="l0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>2.</label><p id="p0010">Not likely to take the vaccine if it was freely available, n (%)</p></list-item></list></td><td>57 (35.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Reasons for being unlikely to take the vaccine (61 comments)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Uncertainty about the development of the vaccine</td><td>10 (16.4)</td></tr><tr><td>I don't take vaccines</td><td>9 (14.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of trust in the vaccine</td><td>8 (13.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Just don't want to/don't care for it</td><td>6 (9.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Concerned about safety (including side effects, getting COVID or being sick after getting the shots)</td><td>5 (8.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Worried about efficacy</td><td>5 (8.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Dislike needles/shots</td><td>5 (8.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of trust in government</td><td>4 (6.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Concerned about access</td><td>2 (3.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Not worried about the virus</td><td>2 (3.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Others (e.g., I put my health in God’s hands, I stay at home)</td><td>5 (8.2)</td></tr><tr><td><list list-type="simple" id="l0015"><list-item id="o0015"><label>3.</label><p id="p0015">Somewhat likely to take the vaccine if it was freely available</p></list-item></list></td><td>37 (23.1)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Reasons for being somewhat likely to take the vaccine (37 comments)</td></tr><tr><td>Worried about the development of the vaccine</td><td>8 (21.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Concerned about safety</td><td>7 (18.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Concerned about efficacy</td><td>7 (18.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Not sure about the vaccine yet</td><td>5 (13.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Dislike shots</td><td>4 (10.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Others (e.g., don’t mind wearing masks/I stay to myself)</td><td>6 (16.2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">What information would be most helpful in determining if the vaccine is the best decision for you?

Only a few participants mentioned that a doctor’s opinion would influence their decision in getting the vaccine. Rather, most participants mentioned that information about efficacy, initial outcomes in other people, safety and side effects would be the most helpful in determining if they would get the COVID vaccine.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0090">To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of COVID and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among AAs enrolled in an RCT and among AA smokers. Among this predominately low-income and already economically disadvantaged population, participants reported considerable economic burden from the effects of the pandemic including loss of employment, loss of household income, and food insecurity. Findings are consistent with data suggesting that racial and ethnic minorities have been unequally affected by the unintended economic and social consequences of COVID-19.<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0095">Over 60% of participants reported willingness to get the COVID vaccine. This is much higher than previous national estimates that found rates of vaccine acceptancy among AAs ranging from 30 to 40%,<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> but slightly lower than estimates in Southern states in the US (68%).<xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> However, measures of vaccine acceptancy differ across studies, which limits the precise comparison of findings. The higher percentage of reported willingness to get the vaccine may be due to participants having experienced a burden from COVID, having witnessed the impact of COVID on their friends, family or community, or due to their own concerns about getting sick. In our study, all participants were smokers, and one in three reported having comorbidities that are risk factors for worsening their COVID-19 prognoses. Additionally, this sample was part of an RCT and, thus, participants might have greater trust in medicine than AAs who would be unwilling to participate in clinical research.</p>
              <p id="p0100">Nonetheless, our data indicate that more than one-third of AA smokers were not likely to take the COVID vaccine if it was freely available, which is a public health concern.<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> Emerging data on the impact of COVID on population subgroups finds that smokers have increased infection, inflammation, reduced immune response, and lung damage, leading to more severe forms of COVID-19.<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Also, AAs with tobacco use disorder have an increased risk for COVID-19 and its adverse outcomes compared to white smokers.<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0105">The present study found that concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine such as its development, efficacy, and trustworthiness were primary factors underlying low vaccine intentions. Similar results were found in an online survey collected in January 2021 including 235 AAs.<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Results from a survey in the general population in the US showed that respondents who said they were not willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine expressed more concerns about side effects and also showed high levels of skepticism about vaccine effectiveness.<xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> A more recent national poll showed that these concerns persist among those who have not been vaccinated and that concerns about safety and efficacy are higher among AAs compared to whites.<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0110">When participants were asked what information would be most valuable to help them decide if the COVID-19 vaccine was the best option, only a few mentioned the doctor’s opinion or advice. This differs from the general population, for whom, “doctor’s opinion” is a top reason for getting the vaccine.<xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> The mistrust of the vaccine among AAs is possibly related to longstanding inequalities in the health system and to deceptive practices in clinical research faced by the AA community.<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0115">Concerted efforts are needed by the public health and medical systems to gain the trust of racial/ethnic minority communities as it relates to COVID vaccine hesitancy. Efforts must be firmly grounded in community-engaged approaches, involving individuals and organizations with solid reputations for trustworthiness in AA and other minority communities, including respected elected representatives, trusted local and national faith leaders, community advocates, and others.<xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> Encouragingly, a representative survey of US adults suggested that COVID-19 vaccine endorsements from same-race medical professionals would increase AAs’ willingness to receive the vaccine.<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Education and outreach efforts should include information about the disproportionately adverse impact of COVID-19 infection among AAs, among smokers, and the growing magnitude of data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for AAs.</p>
              <p id="p0120">This study is limited in that it is based on a sample of AA smokers in the US Midwest, which limits its generalizability. Also, data were only collected during a single period. Most participants answered the surveys before COVID-19 vaccines became available, and vaccination attitudes are changing rapidly over time.</p>
              <p id="p0125">This cross-sectional study demonstrates the high burden of COVID and the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine among AAs who are trying to quit smoking and involved with clinical research. Rates of intention to take the vaccine were higher than in previous studies among AAs but concerns about the vaccine were similar. Future results from the parent grant will shed light on COVID’s impact on quitting.</p>
