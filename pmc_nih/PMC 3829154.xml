                <p>Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, promotes lung cancer proliferation via the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) subtype. The present manuscript explores the effect of nicotine exposure on α7-nAChR levels in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC-L) <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nicotine (at concentrations present in the plasma of average smokers) increased α7-nAChR levels in human SCC-L cell lines. Nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR was confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by chicken chorioallantoic membrane models. We also observed that the levels of α7-nAChR in human SCC-L tumors (isolated from patients who are active smokers) correlated with their smoking history. Nicotine increased the levels of α7-nAChR mRNA and α7-nAChR transcription in human SCC-L cell lines and SCC-L tumors. Nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR required GATA4 and GATA6. ChIP assays showed that nicotine induced the binding of GATA4 or GATA6 to Sp1 on the α7-nAChR promoter, thereby inducing its transcription and increasing its levels in human SCC-L. Our data are clinically relevant because SCC-L patients smoked for decades before being diagnosed with cancer. It may be envisaged that continuous exposure to nicotine (in such SCC-L patients) causes up-regulation of α7-nAChRs, which facilitates tumor growth and progression. Our results will also be relevant to many SCC-L patients exposed to nicotine via second-hand smoke, electronic cigarettes, and patches or gums to quit smoking.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC-L)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5"><sup>4</sup></xref> is a form of non-small cell lung cancer that predominantly originates from the bronchial epithelial cell lining, centrally located in large airways. It is the second most prevalent form of lung cancer, accounting for 30% of all primary pulmonary malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Epidemiologic and laboratory-based studies have established a causal relationship between cigarette smoking and SCC-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although cigarette smoke is a mixture of thousands of compounds, nicotine is the addictive component of cigarettes. Data from cell culture and animal models have shown that nicotine stimulates the growth of squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In addition, nicotine promotes angiogenesis invasion and metastasis of human non-small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>The biological effects of nicotine are mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on human lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Non-neuronal nAChRs are pentameric proteins composed of a combination of two different types of subunits (α and β) or five copies of the same α subunit symmetrically arranged around a central ion pore. The homomeric α7-nAChR (composed of five α-subunits) mediates the proliferative, pro-angiogenic, and pro-metastatic effects of nicotine in human non-small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Several types of human lung cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, SCC-Ls, and small cell lung cancers, have been found to express α7-nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The expression of α7-nAChRs is regulated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli including glucocorticoids, growth factors, tobacco carcinogens (<italic>e.g.</italic> NNK), and nicotine itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>Several convergent studies have shown that nicotine exposure up-regulates the expression of nAChRs in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, these studies have explored the effects of nicotine exposure on α4/β2 nAChRs in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). There are relatively fewer research papers that have studied the effect of nicotine exposure on α7-nAChRs in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition, the mechanisms underlying the increased levels of α7-nAChRs (in response to nicotine) in non-neuronal cells remain to be fully understood.</p>
              <p>Studies by Lam <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) have shown that nicotine caused robust up-regulation of α7-nAChR mRNA in human bronchial epithelial cells. Nicotine increased the levels of α7-nAChR by transcriptional mechanisms involving the Sp1-GATA2 pathway in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that nicotine can increase the levels of α7-nAChR by transcriptional mechanisms in non-neuronal cells.</p>
              <p>The α7-nAChR promoter has several binding sites for Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Arredondo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) showed that long term exposure to nicotine increased α7-nAChR in human keratinocytes by the Sp1-GATA2 pathway. They performed siRNA experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays which showed that the GATA2 transcription factor was bound to the α7-nAChR promoter upon nicotine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). They inferred that nicotine-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation was mediated by the Sp1-GATA2 pathway in human keratinocytes. It is known that the Sp1 protein can directly associate with the GATA family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Based on these results we decided to investigate whether the Sp1-GATA pathway was responsible for nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls.</p>
              <p>Data from several laboratories have shown that α7-nAChRs do not undergo long term inactivation after chronic exposure to nicotine at levels that are present in the plasma of heavy and light smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Chernyavsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) have shown that the biological activity of nAChRs in non-neuronal cells can be attributed to both ion channel-dependent and ion channel-independent events. The ion channel-independent events include activation of protein kinases, second messengers, and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that a large fraction of α7-nAChRs are biologically functional during sustained nicotine exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the present manuscript we show that nicotine up-regulates α7-nAChR expression in human SCC-L cells and in chicken chorioallantoic membrane models. Similarly, the levels of α7-nAChR in human SCC-L tumors isolated from patients (who are active smokers) correlate with their smoking history and amount of cigarette consumption. Luciferase assays revealed that nicotine increased transcription of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls. RNAi experiments showed that nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR was mediated by GATA4 and GATA6. Finally, chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that nicotine induced the recruitment of Sp1-GATA4 or Sp1-GATA6 complexes on the α7-nAChR promoter, inducing its transcription and increasing its expression in human SCC-Ls.</p>
              <p>The reason we decided to study the mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR is that it may have considerable implications in the pathophysiology of human lung cancers. This is especially true of human SCC-L whose development is closely associated with smoking habits, more so than other non-small cell lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). People usually smoke for decades before being diagnosed with SCC-Ls. Previous studies show that ∼30% of smokers with lung cancer continue to smoke after their diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, many SCC-Ls patients are exposed to secondhand smoke, electronic cigarettes, or nicotine patches/gums. It can be envisaged that such long term exposure of human SCC-L tumors to nicotine increases the expression of α7-nAChR on the lung tumor, thereby facilitating its progression and eventual metastasis. Therefore, the study of molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChRs in SCC-L is clinically relevant and will increase our understanding of the role of nAChRs in human lung cancers.</p>

                    <title>Nicotine Induces the Expression of α7-nAChRs on Human SCC-Ls Cell Lines and in Vivo</title>
                    <p>Previous studies have shown that multiple nAChR subunits are expressed on human SCC-L cell lines. Of the nAChR subtypes, the α7-nAChR mediates the proliferative effects of nicotine in human lung cancers. Results from our ELISAs show that the treatment of H520 cells with 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine induced a robust increase of α7-nAChR expression in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>black bars</italic>) with the greatest expression of α7-nAChRs being observed from 100 n<sc>m</sc> to 10 μ<sc>m</sc> at 96 h. This concentration range was chosen because nicotine concentrations in the plasma of average smokers range from 1 n<sc>m</sc> to 10 μ<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In contrast, the level of the closely related α3-nAChR was minimally affected by nicotine treatment in H520 human SCC-L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>white bars</italic>).</p>

A nicotine concentration of 100 n<sc>m</sc> and the time point of 96 h were chosen for all subsequent experiments. Next we examined the effect of 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine on α7-nAChR expression in two additional human SCC-L cell lines, namely H226 and SK-MES (&gt;96 h). ELISA experiments showed that nicotine induced a 2.5–3.0-fold increase of α7-nAChR levels in H226 and SK-MES human SCC-Ls over 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). However, nicotine did not have an impact on the expression of α3-nAChRs in H226 and SK-MES cells (data not shown).</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, we compared nicotine-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation to nicotine-induced proliferation of H520 human SCC-L cells. BrdU assays showed that the treatment of H520, H226, and SK-MES human SCC-L cells with 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine induced robust proliferation in these cell lines. The mitogenic activity of nicotine was reversed by the α7-nAChR antagonists α-bungarotoxin and methyllycaconitine, indicating that α7-nAChRs mediated the proliferative effects of nicotine on human SCC-Ls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>). We also observed that the concentration dependence and time-kinetics of α7-nAChRs up-regulation closely correlated with the proliferative effects of nicotine in human SCC-Ls (data not shown).</p>
                    <p>The next series of experiments aimed to examine whether nicotine could increase the expression of α7-nAChRs <italic>in vivo</italic>. The chicken CAM model was selected for these experiments. Several convergent studies have shown that human cancer cells implanted on chicken CAM grow as solid tumors and constitute an established model to measure tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). H520 cells were implanted on chicken CAM and treated with 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine for 7 days. Nicotine potently accelerated the growth of H520 tumors in chicken CAM models (data not shown). Lysates were prepared from four untreated tumors (<italic>white bars</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>) and four nicotine-treated tumors (<italic>black bars</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). ELISAs revealed that the H520 tumors treated with nicotine showed significantly higher levels of α7-nAChRs (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than the untreated H520 tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>right panel</italic>). In contrast, the expression levels of α3-nAChRs were unaffected by nicotine exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>left panel</italic>). Therefore, nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChRs in human SCC-Ls was observed both in cell culture as well as in <italic>in vivo</italic> models.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the expression of α7-nAChRs was analyzed in human SCC-L tumors isolated from patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic> provides the smoking history of these patients. ELISAs show that the levels of α7-nAChR in tumors SCC-147, SCC-134, SCC-173, and SCC-104 (mean pack years smoked = 82) was significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that of SCC-103 and SCC-112 (mean pack years smoked = 45) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic>, <italic>black bars</italic>). The levels of α3-nAChRs did not vary significantly in the SCC-L samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>F</italic>, <italic>white bars</italic>).</p>

                    <title>Nicotine Increases the Levels of α7-nAChRs mRNA in Human SCC-Ls</title>
                    <p>Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the treatment of H520 and H226 human SCC-L cells with 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine caused a 5–6-fold increase of α7-nAChR mRNA in both human SCC-L cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Similarly, nicotine induced a 5-fold increase in α7-nAChR mRNA levels in H520 cells xenotransplanted on chicken CAM (data not shown). We performed a real-time PCR analysis of the human SCC-L tumors isolated from patients. We found that the α7-nAChR mRNA in tumors SCC-147, SCC-134, SCC-173, and SCC-104 (mean pack years smoked = 82; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>) was substantially higher than tumors SCC-103 and SCC-112 (mean pack years smoked = 45; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>). The levels of α7-nAChR mRNA correlated with the smoking history of these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>). These observations suggested that nicotine could be promoting α7-nAChRs levels by transcriptional mechanisms. This hypothesis was tested by transfection of bovine α7-nAChR-promoter-Luciferase into H520 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Studies in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells have shown that the bovine α7-nAChR closely resembles the human α7-nAChR (94.6% identity at the protein level and 88% identity at the gene level). Also the bovine α7-nAChR promoter is similar to the human α7-nAChR promoter in terms of high G/C content, nature of transcription factor binding sites, and the location of these binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Several studies have used the bovine α7-nAChR promoter as a model for human α7-nAChR function. We observed that nicotine significantly increased α7-nAChR promoter activity, as evidenced by a 4-fold increase in relative luciferase activity relative to untreated control H520 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>). Nicotine did not induce any relative luciferase activity in mock-transfected H520 human SCC-Ls. We repeated the experiment in H226 human SCC-L cells and obtained similar results (data not shown).</p>

With this background we decided to examine the role of GATA transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) in nicotine-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation. Western blotting analysis showed that GATA1, -2, -3, and -5 were not expressed in H520, H226, and SK-MES human SCC-L cell lines. However, GATA4 and GATA 6 were robustly expressed in human SCC-Ls (data not shown).</p>
                    <p>The role of GATA4 and GATA6 in nicotine-induced α7-nAChR expression was examined by siRNA methodology. We found that the transfection of GATA4 siRNA or GATA6 siRNA (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by themselves had only a marginal effect on nicotine-induced α7-nAChR expression.

This suggests that both GATA4 and GATA6 are important for nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls. Western blotting analysis showed that transfection of GATA4 siRNA and GATA6 siRNA efficiently decrease the expression of the GATA4 and GATA6, respectively, in H520 human SCC-L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>E</italic>). These siRNA transfection experiments were repeated in H226 cells, and analogous results were obtained.

                    <title>Nicotine Promotes the Binding of Sp1 and GATA4/GATA6 on the α7-nAChR Promoter in Human SCC-Ls</title>
                    <p>Previous literature has shown that Sp1 can directly bind to both GATA4 and GATA6 in response to extracellular stimuli and regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). We wanted to assess the effect of nicotine on the interaction between Sp1, GATA4, and GATA6. Because the molecular weight of GATA4 and GATA6 is close to the molecular weight of the IgG heavy chain (both 50 kDa), we decided to use the TrueBlot IP Western system (eBiosciences Inc., San Diego, CA) for the IP-Western blot experiments. The TrueBlot kit masks the IgG band; therefore, proteins near 50 kDa are easily visualized. An IP-Western blot revealed that serum-starved H520 cells contained very little binding between Sp1 and GATA4. The treatment of H520 cells with 100 n<sc>m</sc> nicotine led to a robust binding between Sp1 and GATA4 at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>left panel</italic>). We repeated the IP-Western experiments with a second cell line H226 and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>right panel</italic>). Nicotine also induced the binding of Sp1 to GATA6 in both H520 and H226 cells in 48 h (data not shown). We repeated the IP-Western blot the other way around. We immunoprecipitated H520 cell lysates with GATA4 (or GATA6 antibody) and probed the presence of Sp1 in the immunoprecipitates by Western blotting. We obtained comparable results as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic> (data not shown).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>The homomeric α7-nAChR subtype is responsible for the proliferative, pro-angiogenic and prometastatic activities of nicotine in lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Several research studies have examined the molecular mechanisms by which α7-nAChR promotes the progression of human lung cancers. The α7-nAChR has been shown to cause direct activation of inactivation of signaling kinases and phosphatases. In addition, nicotine induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of human lung cancers in a α7-nAChR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Therefore, it may be envisaged that lung tumors with high levels of α7-nAChR may be highly vascularized and prone to metastasis.</p>
              <p>The present study shows that exposure to nicotine increases the levels of α7-nAChRs in human SCC-Ls. The up-regulation of α7-nAChR was found to occur at concentrations of nicotine present in the plasma of an average smoker (1 n<sc>m</sc> to 10 μ<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Exposure to cigarette smoke and nicotine has been shown to increase the levels of α7-nAChRs in several types of non-neuronal cells like human monocytes, keratinocytes, normal lung epithelial cells, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Arredondo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) observed that the nicotine up-regulated α7-nAChR expression in human keratinocytes in a similar manner as environmental tobacco smoke. These findings suggest that the effect of nicotine on α7-nAChR expression closely resembles that of cigarette smoke. We also found that the levels of α3-nAChR did not change substantially upon nicotine treatment. This is in agreement with previous data that long term nicotine exposure has an diverse impact on the activity of different nAChR subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In particular, the levels of α3-nAChR have been found to remain relatively unchanged upon exposure to nicotine in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, it must be remembered that the nicotine may regulate the expression of nAChR subunits in a tissue-dependent manner.</p>
              <p>We also observed that nicotine increases the levels of α7-nAChR by transcriptional mechanisms. This is in contrast with data from neuronal cells where nicotine-induced up-regulation of nAChR subunits has been found to occur via posttranslational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These mechanisms include alteration in nAChR assembly, maturation, turnover, and inhibition of receptor degradation. However, a majority of these papers studied the effect of nicotine on α2, α3, α5, and α4/β2-nAChR subunit mRNA in mouse and rat brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that the effect of nicotine on α7-nAChR expression and function differs from those of heteromeric nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). It also may be probable that the mechanisms underlying nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR may be different in non-neuronal cells than in the brain.</p>
              <p>We also analyzed the mechanisms by which nicotine increases transcription of α7-nAChRs. Based on the results of Arredondo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) we analyzed the role of the GATA family of proteins in nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR. The α7-nAChR promoter has several binding sites for Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the Sp1 protein can directly associate with the GATA family of transcription factors to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Of the GATA family of transcription factors GATA1, GATA2 and GATA3 are predominantly hematopoietic and were not found in human SCC-Ls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Similarly, GATA5 was not detected in human SCC-L cell lines. Clinical studies have indicated that GATA4 and GATA6 are robustly expressed in SCC-L cell lines and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The transcription factor Sp1 can interact directly with GATA4 and GATA6 in a signal-dependent manner in several experimental systems to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Our results provide yet another example where nicotine induces the binding of GATA4 or GATA6 to Sp1 on the α7-nAChR promoter. This process increased α7-nAChR transcription and expression in SCC-Ls. A comparison of Sp1-GATA4 and Sp1-GATA6 complex levels between SCC-L patients who are smokers <italic>versus</italic> non-smokers would have been ideal. However, SCC-Ls are rare in non-smokers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6"><sup>5</sup></xref> Therefore, we were unable to perform this comparison in our study.</p>
              <p>Epidemiologic studies have suggested that cumulative cigarette smoking (measured in pack-years) or current cigarette smoking status is related directly to the clinical prognosis of lung cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Our findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for these clinical observations in human SCC-Ls. Our future studies aim to examine whether nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR is a single-step process or involves multiple steps. Data from Arredondo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) show that nicotine induced the sequential up-regulation of α5-nAChR and α7-nAChR in human keratinocytes. It may be possible that such a multistep process also exists in human SCC-Ls. Our manuscript has only studied the effect of nicotine on α7-nAChR levels. It is possible that nicotine regulates several nAChR subunits to promote the overall survival of lung tumors.</p>
              <p>One of our future research objectives is to identify the signaling kinases that mediate nicotine-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChR in human SCC-Ls. The α7-nAChR promoter has multiple Sp1 sites. We aim to analyze whether all these Sp1 sites are involved in nicotine-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation or perhaps some of the Sp1 sites are more important than the others. We believe such studies will uncover new knowledge about the role of nicotine-nAChR-signaling pathway in human SCC-Ls.</p>
