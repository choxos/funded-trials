                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Obesity remains a primary threat to the health of most Americans, with over 66% considered overweight or obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater. A common treatment option many believe to be effective, and therefore turn to, is exercise. However, the amount of weight loss from exercise training is often disappointingly less than expected with greater amounts of exercise not always promoting greater weight loss. Increases in energy intake have been prescribed as the primary reason for this lack of weight loss success with exercise. Research has mostly focused on alterations in hormonal mediators of appetite (e.g.: ghrelin, peptide YY, GLP-1, pancreatic polypeptide, and leptin) that may increase hunger and/or reduce satiety to promote greater energy intake with exercise training. A less understood mechanism that may be working to increase energy intake with exercise is reward-driven feeding, a strong predictor of energy intake and weight status but rarely analyzed in the context of exercise.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers, are still plaguing the nation today [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Exercise is a long-standing remedy for nearly all of obesity’s comorbidities and often recommended as an economical and health-promoting option for weight loss and weight loss maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unfortunately, as supported by the ever-escalating prevalence of obesity, exercise is often only marginally successfully at reducing body weight [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The lack of weight-loss success with exercise has been blamed on a coordinated set of compensatory mechanisms the human body uses to maintain energy balance, thereby resisting the sustained negative energy balance required for weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These compensatory responses may be physiological, and include reductions in resting energy expenditure and metabolic efficiency in attempts to return the body back to energy balance [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the most prevalent mechanism responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis during an exercise program is increases in energy intake, largely due to the fact that the rate of energy intake far exceeds the rate of energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For instance, it takes most people between 40 and 60 minutes to expend 500 kcal through exercise, which is about the energy content of a fast-food cheeseburger that can be consumed in 5–10 minutes.</p>
              <p>There has been a great deal of research on exercise’s effects on energy intake, specifically by assessing how hormonal mediators of appetite, lab-based food intake, and hunger/satiety scales change with exercise [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, many have demonstrated single bouts of exercise do not result in changes in appetite, food intake, or appetite-regulating hormones [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Some have actually demonstrated greater perceptions of hunger and fullness persist 24 hours after exercise [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and long-term exercise improves the satiety response to a meal [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results are at odds with the apparent compensatory response individuals display, therefore necessitating novel and innovative research to better understand the causes behind exercise-induced increases in energy intake. Empirical hypotheses postulate that individuals who exercise for weight loss have distorted portion control, seek rewards for exercising in the form of food, and derive greater pleasure from high-fat, high-sugar, energy-dense food [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], all of which may be independent of hunger. These behaviors may be explained by a neuro-behavioral cross-talk that is in play with exercise and eating, as both are products of the central dopamine system [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. There is evidence of such direct cross-talk between eating and exercise reward in rats, whereas a small dose of wheel running that produces a low-level dopaminergic response facilitates eating [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A similar neuro-behavioral cross-talk between the reinforcing effects of different drugs is also known, specifically involving endogenous opioid and cannabinoid systems, whereas administration of one increases the reinforcing value of the other [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rewarding aspects of food and eating are important volitional behavioral responses, assessed by defining one’s relative reinforcing value of food (RRV<sub>food</sub>) or food reinforcement [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Food reinforcement is a measure of how much an individual wants to engage in a particular eating behavior, as someone who finds food highly reinforcing “wants” food to a greater degree. RRV<sub>food</sub> is the reinforcing value of food relative to an alternative, which may be a non-eating activity or a different type of food (high vs. low energy density for example). Importantly, food reinforcement is a more robust predictor of food intake than the hedonic value (liking) of the food [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and is a strong predictor of body weight and energy intake [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It therefore seems plausible that the reinforcing value of food, is increased by exercise to promote food intake, although very little research has been done on this issue. Understanding these volitional behavioral responses could inform future weight loss and exercise recommendations by adding important considerations when exercising for weight control. The present study hypothesized that a 12-week aerobic exercise for weight loss intervention would increase food reinforcement, specifically for the high energy-dense foods provided (assessed by an operant responding task) among sedentary, overweight to obese humans. It was further hypothesized that a greater dose of exercise would evoke a greater effect on food reinforcement and that changes in body composition would be correlated with changes in food reinforcement.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>A total of 80 participants aged 18 to 40 years volunteered and were enrolled into the study. Of these, 52 completed all baseline tests and were randomized into one of three groups (six exercise sessions per week, two sessions per week, and sedentary control) during this longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial on a 1:1:1 ratio. Of these 52 randomized participants, 44 completed the study (32 female), with six (four female) withdrawing for personal reasons and two females being excluded for non-compliance (did not complete the required 85% of exercise sessions assigned per month). A consort diagram is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234692.g001">Fig 1</xref>. All participants had a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 25–35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and were inactive (not engaging in any form of exercise), determined during screening where participants were asked of their exercise behaviors. Participants were also free of medical issues that would be a contraindication to exercise, without metabolic or cardiovascular disease, not engaging in a weight loss diet, were weight stable (not lost or gained 5% of their current body weight in the previous 6 months), not taking medications that may influence appetite, and not pregnant or nursing. Recruitment began in the winter of 2018 and continued until recruitment goals were met (spring of 2019) in and around Lexington, Kentucky. Participants were a sample who responded to recruitment media including printed brochures and flyers and online advertisements placed on University of Kentucky’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) website. This study was approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. The present analysis is a secondary outcome of a trial aimed at assessing mechanisms of energy compensation at different doses of exercise, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03413826.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>During the initial screening and consenting visit, participants provided their written informed consent and were screened of eligibility criteria, completing a physical activity readiness questionnaire (PARQ), health history questionnaire, and screened on their dieting, weight loss history, and physical activity behaviors. Participants also completed a taste-test of the study foods and were scheduled for other assessments including rate of energy expenditure (resting and during exercise), body composition, and food reinforcement (all detailed below).</p>

                  <title>Study design</title>
                  <p>The study was a randomized, controlled trial that included a 12-week exercise intervention of either six sessions (days) per week, two sessions per week, or a sedentary control group (no exercise). Men and women were randomized separately, with separate allocation sequences generated and maintained by the study statistician. Participants were randomized upon completion of all baseline assessments with no blinding of intervention assignments. 13 of the 19 randomized participants to the six-session group, 17 of the 20 randomized to the two-session group, and 11 of the 14 randomized to the control group were female. Participants were assessed for outcome measures at baseline and after the intervention. Food reinforcement and body composition were assessed 24 to 48 hours after the participant completed their final exercise session of the 12-week intervention while resting energy expenditure was assessed 48 to 72 hours after completing the final exercise session.</p>

                  <title>Exercise intervention</title>
                  <p>Participants were provided a Polar A-300 heart rate monitor (watch and chest strap, Kempele, Finland) for the duration of the 12-week intervention and instructed to exercise either two or six times per week on their own and were provided access to a fitness center. Participants were instructed to engage in only aerobic exercise either indoors (treadmill, elliptical or cycle ergometer) or outdoors (walking, running, biking) as long as they attained a heart rate at least in heart rate reserve (HRR) zone 1. Participants in the control group were instructed to remain sedentary and return for post-testing 12 weeks later, receiving the exercise intervention after post-testing if they desired. Those in the exercise groups returned to the lab weekly to meet a researcher and download their exercise sessions using the PolarFlow software, which allowed research staff to monitor and track compliance. If a participant was not 85% compliant (completed 85% of expected exercise sessions per month) they were dropped from the study. The downloaded exercise session reports provided the amount of time spent in each heart rate zone, which allowed for the calculation of total energy expended during each exercise session based off individual rates of energy expenditure averaged across each heart rate zone calculated from the graded exercise test with indirect calorimetry performed at baseline and week six. Participants in the two-day per week group were instructed to perform two long exercise sessions per week and encouraged to try to expend 1,000 kcal per session. Participants in the six-day per week group were instructed to keep their sessions to 400 kcal per session. Although most participants in the two-day per week group were not able to attain the 1,000 kcal goal, they still expended significantly greater kcal per session compared to the six-day group. Participants received personalized heart-rate based exercise prescriptions that, if followed, would result in them expending the assigned energy per exercise session. Participants were also provided feedback each week on their energy expenditure of each session of the prior week so they could tailor future exercise sessions. All participants were instructed not to purposely change dietary habits during the intervention, i.e., not begin an energy-restricted diet.</p>

                  <title>Liking of foods and hunger (secondary outcome measure)</title>
                  <p>Participants’ liking (hedonic value) of the food options used in the food reinforcement test were assessed using a 10-point scale (1 = “do not like at all” and 10 = “like very much”). Participants sampled three “healthy” snack foods and three “unhealthy” snack foods (<xref rid="pone.0234692.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The most liked food of each category was used during the food reinforcement testing session, completed on a separate day. All participants rated at least a moderate liking (liking score of ≥5) for at least one of the healthy and unhealthy food options. This test was completed once, prior to the baseline food reinforcement test. Hunger and satiety scales were presented prior to each food reinforcement test and used as an additional variable in regression models when predicting changes in food reinforcement. A copy of the VAS scales are provided in the supplementary data.</p>

                  <title>Food reinforcement (primary outcome measure)</title>
                  <p>Reinforcing value of food was assessed by evaluating the amount of operant responding (mouse button presses) a participant performed to gain access to each alternative (healthy and unhealthy snack foods, <xref rid="pone.0234692.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The testing environment included two workstations with computers in the same room. One computer had a game that was set-up for participants to earn points towards their highest liked healthy food while the other computer had the same game that participants could use to earn points toward the highest liked unhealthy food. Participants could switch between stations as much as they chose. The computer programs presented a game that mimics a slot machine; a point is earned each time the shapes match. For every five points, a session is completed and the participant received an approximately 60-kcal portion of the reinforcer that was earned (either healthy or unhealthy food). The game was performed until the participant no longer wished to work for access to either food. At first, points were delivered after every four presses, but then the schedule of reinforcement doubled (4, 8, 16, 32, […] 1024) each time five points were earned. For instance, the participant initially had to click the mouse four times to earn each point for schedule one. After the first five points were earned, schedule one was complete and the participant earned a portion of food for the reinforcer earned (healthy or unhealthy food). Then eight clicks were required to earn each of the next five points for schedule two before another portion of the reinforcer was earned. Schedule three required 16 clicks to earn one point, schedule four required 32 clicks to earn one point, and so on [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Participants received the food earned after completing the game, which ended when the participant no longer wished to earn points for eating either type of food. This progressive ratio schedule task (Behavioral Choice Task) software was developed at the University of Buffalo, reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and used previously by the current investigative team [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Participants were not allowed to take food out of the lab with them, but were not required to consume all of the food they earned in the event a participant earned more food than they could eat in one sitting, although this occurred on only two occasions throughout the study. The food reinforcement tests were conducted two to four hours post-prandial between usual lunch and dinner times when snack foods are likely to be consumed. Similar button pressing tasks have been shown to be valid predictors the reinforcing value of eating behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The breakpoint, or P<sub>max</sub>, [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was the total number of schedules completed for the healthy or unhealthy food. The Relative Reinforcing Value of healthy foods (RRV<sub>healthy</sub>) was the proportion of P<sub>max</sub> for healthy food compared to the unhealthy food calculated as (P<sub>max</sub> healthy)/ (P<sub>max</sub> healthy + P<sub>max</sub> unhealthy). As constructed, an RRV<sub>healthy</sub> score over 0.5 indicates a greater reinforcing value for the healthy snack food option relative to unhealthy option, while a RRV<sub>unhealthy</sub> score of over 0.5 represents a greater reinforcing value of unhealthy food relative to healthy [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a measure of total food reinforcement, P<sub>max</sub> healthy and P<sub>max</sub> unhealthy were added together, reflecting the total number of schedules completed for food, or P<sub>max</sub>Total. Thus, P<sub>max</sub>Total reflects an overall score of total food reinforcement, irrespective of type (healthy or unhealthy). Changes in P<sub>max</sub> healthy and P<sub>max</sub> unhealthy were also assessed independently.</p>

                  <title>Rate of energy expenditure (secondary outcome measure)</title>
                  <p>A graded exercise treadmill test was used to determine each participant’s rate of energy expenditure at five different heart-rate zones. Oxygen consumed and CO<sub>2</sub> produced were analyzed by indirect calorimetry (VMAX Encore Metabolic Cart, Vyaire Medical, Mettawa, IL) which included an integrated 12 lead ECG for monitoring heart rate and used in conjunction with the Trackmaster TMX428 Metabolic cart interfaced treadmill. Upon completion of a five-minute warm-up walking at 0% grade, 3.0 mph, the treadmill grade increased to 2.5% for three minutes. The treadmill grade was then increased every three minutes to produce an approximately 10 beat per minute increase in heart rate from the previous stage with the speed fixed at 3.0 mph. The test continued until a heart rate of 85% HRR was attained or the participant felt they could no longer continue. Energy expenditure (kcal per minute) was determined from the amount of oxygen consumed and CO<sub>2</sub> expired using the Weir equation [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The average rate of energy expenditure during the last 30 seconds of each stage of the graded exercise test was regressed against the heart rate averaged over the last 30 seconds of the corresponding stage to calculate the rate of energy expenditure at different heart rates. Heart rate zones were calculated using the HRR formula as (220-age)-resting HR * zone % + resting HR [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Heart rate Zone 1 ranged from 0% to 25% HRR, Zone 2 corresponded to 26–40% HRR, Zone 3 was 41–58% HRR, Zone 4 was 59–75% HRR, and Zone 5 was 76–90%. Energy expenditure in kcal/min was then averaged across each heart rate zone for determination of energy expenditure per minute for each zone. This test was completed at baseline and week six to recalculate rates of energy expenditure to account for improvements in fitness.</p>

                  <p>Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) was measured using indirect calorimetry (Quark RMR; Cosmed USA, Chicago, IL) with a ventilated canopy. Before each test, calibrations were performed on the flow meter using a 3.0-L syringe and on the gas analyzers using verified gases of known concentrations. After 30 minutes of quiet rest in the supine position in a dimly lit, temperature-controlled room between 22 and 24 C, REE was measured for 30 minutes. The test was monitored to ensure participants remained awake and between 0.8 and 1.2% feCO<sub>2</sub>. Criteria for a valid REE was a minimum of 15 minutes of steady state, determined as a &lt;10% fluctuation in oxygen consumption and &lt;5% fluctuation in respiratory quotient. The Weir equation (36) was used to determine REE from the measured oxygen consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production. Participants completed the baseline REE assessment prior to the exercise test and 36–72 hours after their final exercise session of the intervention.</p>

                  <p>Body composition was measured using a GE Lunar iDXA machine prior to the exercise test. The iDXA technique allows the non-invasive assessment of soft tissue composition by region with a precision of 1–3% [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A total body scan was conducted with participants lying supine on the table and arms positioned to the side. Most scans were completed using the thick mode suggested by the software as participants were overweight to obese. All scans were analyzed using GE Lunar enCORE Software (13.60.033). Automatic edge detection was used for scan analyses. The machine was calibrated before each scanning session, using the GE Lunar calibration phantom. Outcome measures included kg of body fat mass (FM), kg of fat-free mass (FFM)- which included body water, bone mineral content, and dry lean mass, and percent FM.</p>

Change scores were also tested if significantly different from zero via T-tests for each group, separately. Shapiro-Wilk tests and inspection of histograms revealed a non-normal distribution for changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total, thus differences in P<sub>max</sub>Total between groups were also assessed via Kruskal Wallis Test. Spearmen correlation analysis was performed between changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total, hunger, FM, FFM, REE, and exercise variables including exercise frequency (group) and exercise energy expenditure per week. Significant correlations were further assessed with quantile regression, using change in P<sub>max</sub>Total as the dependent variable.

Change scores (post value minus baseline value) for outcome variables and exercise energy expenditure are presented in <xref rid="pone.0234692.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The six-day per week group expended more energy than the two-day per week group, which contributed to only the six-day group significantly decreasing percent body weight and FM. Change in FM was greater in both intervention groups compared to control with no differences in FFM change. There were no changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total, P<sub>max</sub> healthy, P<sub>max</sub> unhealthy, REE, or RRV of healthy or unhealthy food over time or between groups (<xref rid="pone.0234692.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All variables were of normal distribution with the exception of changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total (Shapiro-Wilk P&lt;0.05, Skewness: 1.24, SE = 0.37; Kurtosis: 9.26, SE = 0.72; histogram included in supplementary data). Thus, a Kruskal-Wallis Test was used to confirm no difference between groups for changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total (<xref rid="pone.0234692.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Spearmen correlation analysis indicated that P<sub>max</sub>Total negatively correlated with changes in FFM (P = 0.03), with no correlations between changes in FM, REE, hunger or exercise parameters (weekly energy expenditure, exercise group). Positive correlations (both when assessed via Pearson or Spearmen) were observed between FM change, exercise energy expenditure per week, and exercise group (all P&lt;0.1). Pearson correlations demonstrated a positive correlation between changes in REE and changes in hunger (P = 0.02). Quantile regression analysis predicting changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total is presented in <xref rid="pone.0234692.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, demonstrating changes in FFM to be the only significant predictor for changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total when controlling for weekly exercise energy expenditure, exercise frequency per week (group), and changes in FM, REE and hunger. A reduced model is also presented, removing independent variables that were correlated with each other to account for collinearity, thus leaving changes in FFM, FM and REE as the independent variables with only changes in FFM remaining a significant predictor. Mediation analysis did not reveal significant mediation effects for changes in REE on changes in FFM when predicting changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total (Sobel test statistic: &lt;0.01, SE = &lt;0.01, P = 0.99).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Most people have an enormous capacity to increase their energy expenditure to promote a negative energy balance. Depending on an individual's aerobic fitness, exercise intensities can be maintained for prolonged periods at two- to 16-fold above resting rates of energy expenditure. As such, 250 to 2500 kcal can be expended during a single exercise session resulting in an acute energy deficit that can be repeated across days, prompting many individuals to turn to exercise for obesity treatment [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This has led the American College of Sports Medicine to issue separate recommendations to either maintain health [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or support weight loss through exercise (5). For these reasons, exercise has become the most common weight loss approach amongst those attempting to lose weight, with a 65% prevalence rate [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As the obesity epidemic continues to escalate in America and other developed countries, the number of individuals seeking to lose weight is also expected to increase, thereby increasing the number of individuals using exercise as their weight loss method of choice. This is despite the lack of consistency in weight loss outcomes from exercise interventions and lack of long-term weight loss maintenance [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For this reason, additional research is needed to determine factors influencing weight loss from an exercise program and methods to improve exercise’s utility as a weight loss treatment.</p>
              <p>The current study is an initial investigation on how exercise may influence eating behaviors through a mechanism separate from hunger (reward-driven feeding), an alternative approach that has received much less attention, although still justifiable, as research on exercise’s effects on hunger are inconsistent with many concluding little to no effects [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Reward-driven feeding may therefore have a greater influence on the increased drive to eat while in an energy-deficit induced by exercise. However, very little research has focused on the effects exercise may have on food reinforcement and how this may alter eating behaviors, which is a plausible hypothesis in that food and exercise reinforcement are both driven by the meso-accumbal dopamine system. The central dopamine system is essential for experiencing reward and assimilating information about energy balance (i.e. the dopamine hypothesis of reward), originally proposed to explain drug addiction [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Indeed, genetic polymorphisms that control dopamine uptake and transport have been linked to both exercise and eating reinforcement [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], possibly explaining the cross-talk observed between eating and exercise reward in rats [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Research on this topic in humans, however, is sparse, with one study demonstrating no changes in food reward after an acute bout of exercise [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and another demonstrating decreases in the reinforcing value of high-energy dense foods with increases in the reinforcing value of low-energy dense foods after two weeks of aerobic exercise [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings may indicate longer duration exercise interventions are needed to increase food reinforcement and thus influence eating behavior. This would be in line with previous research demonstrating changes in exercise reinforcement occur only after large-dose exercise interventions [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It is also plausible that a large energy deficit needs to be created (larger than what can be created in one exercise bout or a two-week intervention) to increase reward-driven feeding. In this light, a yet to be determined metabolic signal that feeds back on the central dopamine system to instill greater food reinforcement when energy stores are low may exist. The notion that the reinforcing value of low energy dense foods increased after short-term exercise owe to the possibility that individuals may be more motivated to eat only certain (healthier) foods when partaking in exercise, which is in line with research pointing to one health behavior change having a spillover effect on other behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For this reason, the present study analyzed the reinforcing value of two different types of food independently and constructed a measure of total food reinforcement (total number of schedules completed for all food). In this scenario, one may decrease their reinforcing value of unhealthy foods and increase their reinforcing value of healthy foods to result in a gross increase in food reinforcement if the increase in healthy foods was greater than the decrease in unhealthy. This appeared to have occurred in the present study among the six-day per week group, although the increases in this group did not reach statistical significance due to large variability (minimum and maximum values for changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total ranged from -340 to 440). Being a secondary aim of the original trial (assessing mechanisms of energy compensation using different doses of exercise) this analysis may not have been adequately powered to detect changes in total responses for food and thus would be the logical next step for future interventions. This is also evident when focusing on the changes in P<sub>max</sub> healthy and P<sub>max</sub> unhealthy, where the six-day per week group completed over 12 schedules less for unhealthy foods and 33 schedules more for healthy food post-intervention, although none of these changes were deemed significant.</p>
              <p>Despite the lack of significant changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total after the exercise intervention, regression analysis revealed that changes in FFM were a significant independent predictor for changes in P<sub>max</sub>Total, whereas greater losses in FFM produced more responding for food. This held when controlling for exercise energy expenditure (kcal per week), exercise frequency (sessions per week), and changes in FM, REE and hunger. In this full model, several variables were correlated with each other, presenting the likelihood of collinearity causing an inflation of regression coefficients. Specifically, changes in FM, weekly exercise energy expenditure, and exercise group were all correlated. Thus, we removed both weekly exercise energy expenditure and exercise group while keeping changes in FM in the reduced model as FM change was likely the result of exercising at greater frequencies and expending more energy per week. Interestingly, changes in REE were positively correlated with changes in hunger, whereas those who had greater increases in hunger had greater increases in REE. Such correlations have been demonstrated before, with the notion that FFM determines REE to influence hunger and food intake [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Although others have concluded REE, and not FFM, influences hunger and food intake [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the present analysis indicate that FFM is the primary driver of food reinforcement, thus we included changes in REE in the final model due to the known link between FFM, REE, and food intake regulation [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, the reduced model included changes in FM, FFM, and REE as predictors of changes in total food reinforcement (P<sub>max</sub>Total), where changes in FFM remained the only significant predictor, indicating changes in FFM after a 12-week exercise for weight loss intervention influences food reinforcement to the greatest degree. This is supported by recent findings, indicating FFM is associated with several brain regions involved in the homeostatic control of food intake, suggesting a centrally mediated mechanism whereby FFM influences eating behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This has also been observed in the classic Minnesota Starvation Experiments, where the FFM deficit, independently of FM deficit, predicted the degree of hyperphagia that occurred during post-starvation <italic>ad libitum</italic> refeeding, which continued until FFM was repleted, often well after FM was restored [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p>
              <p>The present findings, demonstrating FFM deficits were the root cause in the increase in operant responding for food after 12-weeks of exercise, extend previous research by suggesting a direct mechanism that may be prompting increases in energy intake when FFM is depleted. This is an important consideration for present weight-loss recommendations, as many individuals are utilizing aerobic exercise to induce the energy deficit required for weight loss. This aerobic exercise-induced weight loss, especially when coupled with energy restriction, almost always produces concurrent losses in FFM [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Although decreases in FFM, if accompanied by a larger decrease in FM, is often overlooked as many markers of cardiometabolic health are often improved. However, as indicated by the present study and supported by others, declines in FFM may have the unintended consequence of increasing food reinforcement, causing overeating to promote the return to baseline FFM. Unfortunately, when returning to baseline FFM levels, “fat overshooting” often occurs, where FM is increased beyond baseline levels [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0234692.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, one can argue that exercise-for weight loss interventions should include resistance exercise to promote, or at least maintain, FFM when attempting weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Maintaining FFM, in this light, would theoretically attenuate the increase in food reinforcement and improve long-term weight-loss success with exercise. Future interventions assessing the effects of resistance exercise and food reinforcement following weight loss may add to current exercise recommendations to increase the effectiveness of exercise as a weight loss strategy. It may also be interesting to investigate how the reinforcing value of food changes during an exercise intervention to determine how may exercise sessions, how large of an energy deficit, or how much FFM needs to be lost to render food more rewarding. It may also be interesting to investigate how long it may take for food reinforcement to return to baseline levels, or if it remains elevated long after ceasing exercise and returning to energy balance.</p>
              <p>This study is not without limitations. Liking of the test foods was not assessed as baseline liking scores did not influence food reinforcement, but if may have been interesting to see how or if liking of these tests foods changed as a result of the exercise intervention. Ab libitum energy intake would be best assessed in an inpatient feeding design where all of participants’ meals and snacks are consumed in a controlled environment and recorded by research staff to prevent the known under-reporting that often occurs with self-reported dietary intake [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Without this, the present study does not have the exact amount of energy consumed, how dietary intake changed during the exercise program, and how these changes aligned with the changes in food reinforcement. Due to the known influence restrictive diets play on food reinforcement [<xref rid="pone.0234692.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], participants were inscructed not to purposely change their habitual diets (i.e. start a weight loss diet). Due to the modest decrease in weight loss, we do not believe participants purposely restricted their energy intake. Contrary to that, it is likely that participants consumed more food to compensate for the energy expended, although we do not know this for sure without rigorous dietary intake assessment methods. As previously noted, the analysis, being a secondary aim of a larger study, was likely underpowered to detect significant differences in change scores (post value minus baseline value) in food reinforcement and likely affected our mediation analysis, an issue future studies must address. The duration of the intervention (12 weeks) is similar to most exercise interventions in this area of research, although a longer period may have been required to detect significant changes in food reinforcement and changes in percent weight loss among the two-day per week group. We also did not monitor adherence of the control group, although we believe each remained sedentary as they did not significantly change body weight after 12 weeks. Although without accelerometry data, we cannot be sure those in the control group did not begin exercising on their own. Participants were also only provided their most liked food out of five choices for each the healthy and unhealthy options for the RRV assessment. If participants were provided with their favorite food choice they may have responded differently. Additionally, out of the 44 participants who completed the current study, 40 were white, thus limiting the generalizability to other race/ethnic groups. This study also was not designed to detect sex differences and included an unbalanced sample of females; thus, sex effects cannot be drawn.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The present analysis offers an initial look into an alternative explanation as to why exercise programs are often only marginally effective for weight loss. Our findings indicate that there is great variability in individuals’ change in food reinforcement after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, and those who did increase their food reinforcement were also those who lose the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention, even when controlling for other variables such as the energy expended during the intervention or the frequency of exercise (sessions per week). From these findings we can draw two primary conclusions. First, it appears a large sample size is required to better elucidate food reinforcement changes after exercise, potentially taking sex effects into account. Second, it appears preventing the loss in FFM would be a valuable piece to a weight loss program, hinting at the potential for resistance training or increasing dietary protein intake as important adjunct therapy that may be the topic of future research.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Flack,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>The Reviewers have several minor comments especially pertinent to Methods and Discussion of the manuscript that need detailed responses and clarifications.</p>
              <p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by May 16 2020 11:59PM. When you are ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p>

              </p>
              <p>1. Please explain any discrepancy between the trial protocol and the manuscript; for example, we note that, while the manuscript states that participants aged 18- 49  were included, in the registry and in the protocol the age limit is set at 40 years old .</p>
              <p>2. Please include additional information regarding the survey or questionnaire used in the study and ensure that you have provided sufficient details that others could replicate the analyses. For instance, if you developed a questionnaire as part of this study and it is not under a copyright more restrictive than CC-BY, please include a copy, in both the original language and English, as Supporting Information. Moreover, please include more details on how the questionnaire was pre-tested, and whether it was validated.</p>
              <p>3. Please note that according to our submission guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines</ext-link>), outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. For example: “Caucasian” should be changed to “white” or “of [Western] European descent” (as appropriate).</p>
              <p>4. Our internal editors have looked over your manuscript and determined that it is within the scope of our Determinants, Consequences and Management of Obesity  Call for Papers. This collection of papers is headed by a team of Guest Editors for PLOS ONE:Rachel Nugent and Pratibha V. Nerurkar. Additional information can be found on our announcement page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://collections.plos.org/s/obesity-one">https://collections.plos.org/s/obesity-one</ext-link>.  </p>
              <p>If you would like your manuscript to be considered for this collection, please let us know in your cover letter and we will ensure that your paper is treated as if you were responding to this call. If you would prefer to remove your manuscript from collection consideration, please specify this in the cover letter.</p>
              <p>5.  Thank you for including the following funding information within your acknowledgements section; "The project described was supported by the NIH National Center for Advancing 410 Translational Sciences through grant number UL1TR001998"</p>
              <p>We note that you have provided funding information that is not currently declared in your Funding Statement. However, funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form.</p>
              <p>Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement. Currently, your Funding Statement reads as follows:</p>
              <p>"The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."</p>
              <p>6.  We note that you have indicated that data from this study are available upon request.

              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Overall</p>
              <p>This paper builds upon both theoretical considerations, the impact of physical activity upon dietary reinforcement, while also offering practical advice for those interested in losing weight via physical activity, maintain lean mass via resistance training. The overall paper is well written and adds to the literature. The additions I would suggest are as follows:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Line 40: add that exercise also essential to maintaining healthy weight after loss. Considerable research evidence supports this.</p>
              <p>Line 62: “seek rewards FOR exercising …”</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Line 84: Can you say “increase food reinforcement” if measuring 2 food types?</p>
              <p>Line 146: Did any participants report an atypical diet (keto, Atkins etc.) diet or that they were currently dieting to lose weight at baseline?</p>
              <p>Line: 191 spell-check of “unhealthy”</p>
              <p>Line 186-191: Pmax can be calculated for healthy and unhealthy separately. Specify that Pmax_total is for both added together. Also, why did you only examine Pmax total and not the separate Pmaxs for each food group?</p>
              <p>Mention that participants’ favorite food (healthy or unhealthy) may not have been offered and they would respond differently to different options</p>
              <p>Did you examine proportion of food earned during the RRV task to food consumed afterwards? Those results may be interesting.</p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Line 237-238: Because changes in body composition are so important for study results, please include body fat percentage, and kg of fat mass and lean mass in Tables 2.</p>
              <p>Line 264: Unhealthy food, to keep terminology consistent</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>RRV task and DXA took place very shortly after end of a very intense training regime. How might results change if participants were given opportunity to taper and/or rest before post-intervention results?</p>
              <p>Any indication whether or not participants change their diets, either intentionally or unintentionally?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a well-crafted study that examines a novel and important topic. I enjoyed reading it. I have listed some suggestions, by section, below. While I believe you can handle these issues relatively easily, I do think they will strengthen the manuscript and should be addressed. If these issues are addressed, I believe the manuscript warrants publication. Well done!</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>“The most prevalent mechanism responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis during an exercise program is increases in energy intake, largely due to the fact that the rate of energy intake far exceeds the rate of energy expenditure” while I agree with this point, it may be worthwhile to discuss metabolic changes that can occur with weight loss. At least mention adaptive thermogenesis as a possible mechanism complicating weight loss from exercise. It’s possible that alterations in food reinforcement may be part of the adaptive thermogenesis response.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>“… 52 completed all baseline tests and were randomized into one of three groups…” I think it’s a good idea to list the three groups parenthetically here. Revie to “… 52 completed all baseline tests and were randomized into one of three groups (six exercise sessions per week, two weekly sessions, sedentary control)…”</p>
              <p>“The study was a randomized, controlled trial that included a 12-week exercise intervention of either six sessions (days) per week, two sessions per week, or a sedentary control group (no exercise) blocked on gender” list the number of males and females in each group.</p>
              <p>How was compliance of the sedentary group assessed?</p>
              <p>What were some of the exercise options available top your exercise groups? Did they only do cardio (e.g., treadmill, bike) or were they able to do resistance training?</p>
              <p>Why was liking only assessed at baseline? Changes in hedonics as a result of the intervention would have been interesting to look at as well as RRV.</p>
              <p>Interesting uses of Pmax for the RRV task. I like how you quantified RRV but, out of curiosity, why not just use raw Pmax scores for healthy versus unhealthy foods as your measure of RRV?</p>
              <p>“Change scores were also tested if significantly different from zero via T-tests.” Were these done for each group separately?</p>
              <p>“Differences in changes in…” revise to “Differences in change scores (post value minus baseline value) in…”</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>“The present findings, demonstrating FFM deficits are the root cause in the increase…” this language is too definitive for my liking. Revise to “The present findings, demonstrating FFM deficits were the root cause in the increase…” or something similar.</p>
              <p>“Our findings indicate that there is great variability in individuals’ change in food reinforcement after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, and those who do increase their food reinforcement are those who lose the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention…” Again this reads as too definitive. I think it’s important to describe the results only within the context of the present study. Stating “those who do increase their food reinforcement are those who lose the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention” sounds like you are concluding this is what happens with weight loss for everyone. While that may be true, you cannot conclude that from this single study. I know this seems like a small detail, but it is important to remain tentative. Revise to “Our findings indicate that there was great variability in individuals’ change in food reinforcement after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, and those who did increase their food reinforcement were also those who lost the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention…” This way you are only talking about your results.</p>

              <p>Response to Reviewers</p>
              <p>We would like to thank the reviewers and Dr. Buchowski for their time and effort into providing their important feedback. We have carefully addressed each comment and feel that this manuscript has improved significantly. Specific comments are addressed below:</p>
              <p>1. Please explain any discrepancy between the trial protocol and the manuscript; for example, we note that, while the manuscript states that participants aged 18- 49 were included, in the registry and in the protocol the age limit is set at 40 years old. </p>
              <p> This was incorrectly stated in the manuscript; we have now corrected this on line 91.</p>
              <p>2. Please include additional information regarding the survey or questionnaire used in the study and ensure that you have provided sufficient details that others could replicate the analyses. For instance, if you developed a questionnaire as part of this study and it is not under a copyright more restrictive than CC-BY, please include a copy, in both the original language and English, as Supporting Information. Moreover, please include more details on how the questionnaire was pre-tested, and whether it was validated.</p>
              <p> There were no survey/questionnaires used to gather data on primary or secondary outcomes. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline to demonstrate they were healthy enough to participate in the exercise intervention. Participants also rated their liking of the study foods at baseline and rated their hunger and desire to eat on visual analog scales prior to each RRV test. A copy of each is included as supporting information as requested. </p>
              <p>3. Please note that according to our submission guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines</ext-link>), outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. For example: “Caucasian” should be changed to “white” or “of [Western] European descent” (as appropriate).</p>
              <p> We changed “Caucasian” to “white” on line 487 and removed other potentially stigmatizing labels in this section.</p>
              <p>4. Our internal editors have looked over your manuscript and determined that it is within the scope of our Determinants, Consequences and Management of Obesity Call for Papers.

              <p>Reviewer #1: Overall</p>
              <p>This paper builds upon both theoretical considerations, the impact of physical activity upon dietary reinforcement, while also offering practical advice for those interested in losing weight via physical activity, maintain lean mass via resistance training. The overall paper is well written and adds to the literature. The additions I would suggest are as follows:</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Line 40: add that exercise also essential to maintaining healthy weight after loss. Considerable research evidence supports this.</p>
              <p> We certainly agree with this statement and included “and weight loss maintenance” in this statement as our reference (#5) also backs this (line 42).</p>
              <p>Line 62: “seek rewards FOR exercising …”</p>
              <p> This has been edited as suggested, now line 63.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Line 84: Can you say “increase food reinforcement” if measuring 2 food types?</p>
              <p> This is a fine point and we further clarified that we hypothesized food reinforcement for specifically high energy dense foods available would increase (line 85-86).</p>
              <p>Line 146: Did any participants report an atypical diet (keto, Atkins etc.) diet or that they were currently dieting to lose weight at baseline?</p>
              <p> Participants were not dieting to lose weight at baseline. This was an inclusion criterion, along with being weight stable. We realize this was not included in the participant characteristics section and now include both of these criteria (line 101-102)</p>
              <p>Line: 191 spell-check of “unhealthy” </p>
              <p> This has been corrected, now line 210.</p>
              <p>Line 186-191: Pmax can be calculated for healthy and unhealthy separately. Specify that Pmax_total is for both added together. Also, why did you only examine Pmax total and not the separate Pmaxs for each food group?</p>
              <p>The last two sentences of this section state “Pmax healthy and Pmax unhealthy were added together, reflecting the total number of schedules completed for food, or PmaxTotal. Thus, PmaxTotal reflects an overall score of total food reinforcement, irrespective of type (healthy or unhealthy)” There were no differences in changes in Pmax healthy or Pmax unhealthy, we specified this in Table 3, results (line 284), and touched on it in the discussion (lines 409-412). </p>
              <p>Mention that participants’ favorite food (healthy or unhealthy) may not have been offered and they would respond differently to different options</p>
              <p> We have included this point when addressing limitations of the present study, lines 484-486..</p>
              <p>Did you examine proportion of food earned during the RRV task to food consumed afterwards? Those results may be interesting.</p>
              <p> There were only two occasions where participants did not consume all the food they earned in the RRV task, thus these analyses were not preformed. We have stated this more specifically on line 202. </p>
              <p>Results</p>
              <p>Line 237-238: Because changes in body composition are so important for study results, please include body fat percentage, and kg of fat mass and lean mass in Tables 2.</p>
              <p> We have now included baseline values for body fat %, FM and FFM in table 2.</p>
              <p>Line 264: Unhealthy food, to keep terminology consistent</p>
              <p> This change has been made, now line 285.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>RRV task and DXA took place very shortly after end of a very intense training regime. How might results change if participants were given opportunity to taper and/or rest before post-intervention results? </p>
              <p> This is an interesting question and we have expanded on this regarding when RRV testing is done in relation to the exercise intervention, lines 456-461</p>
              <p>Any indication whether or not participants change their diets, either intentionally or unintentionally? </p>
              <p>We have included, lines 470-475, a couple sentences about how we believe they did not intentionally engage in restrictive eating behaviors but likely increased their food intake in response to the exercise intervention.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This is a well-crafted study that examines a novel and important topic. I enjoyed reading it. I have listed some suggestions, by section, below. While I believe you can handle these issues relatively easily, I do think they will strengthen the manuscript and should be addressed. If these issues are addressed, I believe the manuscript warrants publication. Well done!</p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>“The most prevalent mechanism responsible for maintaining energy homeostasis during an exercise program is increases in energy intake, largely due to the fact that the rate of energy intake far exceeds the rate of energy expenditure” while I agree with this point, it may be worthwhile to discuss metabolic changes that can occur with weight loss. At least mention adaptive thermogenesis as a possible mechanism complicating weight loss from exercise. It’s possible that alterations in food reinforcement may be part of the adaptive thermogenesis response.</p>
              <p> We certainly agree with this point and have mentioned physiologic adaptations to an exercise-induced energy deficit that also work to return the body back to energy balance, lines 46-48)</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>“… 52 completed all baseline tests and were randomized into one of three groups…” I think it’s a good idea to list the three groups parenthetically here. Revie to “… 52 completed all baseline tests and were randomized into one of three groups (six exercise sessions per week, two weekly sessions, sedentary control)…”</p>
              <p> We have made this addition as suggested, line 93.</p>
              <p>“The study was a randomized, controlled trial that included a 12-week exercise intervention of either six sessions (days) per week, two sessions per week, or a sedentary control group (no exercise) blocked on gender” list the number of males and females in each group.</p>
              <p> We have included this as suggested on lines 126-127</p>
              <p>How was compliance of the sedentary group assessed?</p>
              <p> We have included in our 481-484 that we did not assess the physical activity of the control group during the intervention but believe they remained sedentary as their body weight did not change. We included this in the section on the weaknesses of the study.</p>
              <p>What were some of the exercise options available to your exercise groups? Did they only do cardio (e.g., treadmill, bike) or were they able to do resistance training?</p>
              <p> Participants only engaged in aerobic exercise, this is now detailed on lines 135-138</p>
              <p>Why was liking only assessed at baseline? Changes in hedonics as a result of the intervention would have been interesting to look at as well as RRV.</p>
              <p> We agree this would have been interesting to include and noted this in the limitations section, lines 462-464.</p>
              <p>Interesting uses of Pmax for the RRV task. I like how you quantified RRV but, out of curiosity, why not just use raw Pmax scores for healthy versus unhealthy foods as your measure of RRV?</p>
              <p> We combined the Pmax scores to get an overall food reinforcement score, not relative to anything. But we were also interested if they may increase their reinforcing value of one type of food relative to the other, so maybe they wouldn’t change Pmax of healthy or unhealthy independently, but when put against each other, we may see a significant change in the proportion (maybe people find candy bars more reinforcing than dried banana after exercising). We were worried that assessing the reinforcing value of food relative to a non-food activity (reading or watching TV for example) may have been skewed as people may prefer doing a sedentary activity opposed to exercise if they were burnt out from the intervention. Thus, this would have been more of a test for the reinforcing value of sedentary activities than food and confounded our results. In response to reviewer 1, we provided the results on changes in Pmax for healthy and unhealthy foods in Table 3, the results section, and provided a bit on the discussion on this (lines 409-412)</p>
              <p>“Change scores were also tested if significantly different from zero via T-tests.” Were these done for each group separately?</p>
              <p> These were done for each group separately, now indicated on line 263-264..</p>
              <p>“Differences in changes in…” revise to “Differences in change scores (post value minus baseline value) in…”</p>
              <p> This has been revised as suggested, lines 476-477</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>“The present findings, demonstrating FFM deficits are the root cause in the increase…” this language is too definitive for my liking. Revise to “The present findings, demonstrating FFM deficits were the root cause in the increase…” or something similar.</p>
              <p> We have revised as suggested, line 439.</p>
              <p>“Our findings indicate that there is great variability in individuals’ change in food reinforcement after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, and those who do increase their food reinforcement are those who lose the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention…” Again this reads as too definitive. I think it’s important to describe the results only within the context of the present study. Stating “those who do increase their food reinforcement are those who lose the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention” sounds like you are concluding this is what happens with weight loss for everyone. While that may be true, you cannot conclude that from this single study. I know this seems like a small detail, but it is important to remain tentative. Revise to “Our findings indicate that there was great variability in individuals’ change in food reinforcement after a 12-week aerobic exercise intervention, and those who did increase their food reinforcement were also those who lost the greatest amount of FFM post-intervention…” This way you are only talking about your results.</p>
              <p> We agree with this statement and have made the changes to the conclusion as suggested, line 495.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: My previous revision requests have been addressed. One typo on line 471. Other than that, it is ready for publication.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Important note: This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently.</p>
              <p>My first question is when title says “A randomized controlled trial” then why this study is classified as [Article Type:] ‘Research Article’? If it is really ‘A randomized controlled trial’ then it is expected to estimate ‘required sample size’. For the study on this topic a small effect size is generally assumed. Even for medium effect size [type I error 5%, Power=80%] according to ‘table-2 on page 158 of an old but classical paper “A power primer” in Psychological Bulletin, 1992, vol.:112, pp 155-159 the required sample size is 52 per group. However, in this study total sample size is only 52. [For small effect size (type I error 5%, Power=80%) it is as large as 322]. Note that in lines 498-500 it is said that “it appears a large sample size is required to better elucidate food reinforcement changes after exercise, potentially taking sex effects into account”. But a priori estimation of the required sample size is not found.</p>
              <p>What exactly you want to convey by ‘blocked on gender’ [a sedentary control group (no exercise) blocked on gender], the phrase used (in line 123) while describing group-III? {If that means ‘matched’ why the wide differences (68.4%, 85%, 78.8%, in Gr.I,II,III respectively)? It cannot be usual meaning of ‘block’ because group sizes are so different (19, 20, 14 in Gr.I,II,III respectively)}. Please explain.</p>
              <p>According to line 260 “Group differences in baseline study characteristics where tested via 1-way ANOVA” but P-values are not reported in table-2 displayed in lines 505- {which is in fact very good as it is often said that</p>
              <p>To provide a description of baseline characteristics is entirely reasonable (since it is clearly important in assessing to whom the results of the trial can be applied), however, it does not require the division of baseline characteristics by treatment groups. Statistical comparison of baseline characteristics is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you then are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics because ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme}.</p>
              <p>If the study was to observe effect of ‘progressive ratio’, then why [as said in lines 148-9] ‘Participants in the two-day per week group were instructed to perform two long exercise sessions per week and encouraged to try to expend 1,000 kcal per session’ is not understood. Will you please thro light on purpose [of that action]. ‘Power Analysis’ account given in lines 271 onwards is not very convincing though ‘was based on our previous study’.</p>
              <p>In Table 3 [Resulting data from the 12-week exercise intervention between groups that exercised either six or two days per week and a sedentary control group] data are mean ± SE whereas “It may please be noted that ‘data always should be presented as means ± standard deviation’ [and never as means ± standard errors]. The standard deviation (SD) and standard error (SE) of the mean measures two very different things. The standard error depends heavily upon the sample size. [Note: standard error of the mean tells not about variability in the original population, as the standard deviation does, but about the certainty with which a sample mean estimates the true population mean. Since the certainty with which we can estimate the mean increases as the sample size increases, the standard error of the mean decreases as the sample size increases.] People are interested in knowing variability in ‘study population’ and not precision in estimate.</p>
              <p>It is definitely appreciable that [line 294-297] ‘Quantile regression analysis’ [predicting changes in PmaxTotal is presented in Table 5: controlling for weekly exercise energy expenditure, exercise frequency per week (group), and changes in FM, REE and hunger] is used, however, a brief note (at least its non-parametric nature) on this ‘not so popular’ technique was desirable (my opinion may be little bias as a biostatistician). Surprisingly, median or other quartiles are not reported {though this non-parametric technique is used}. As you may be aware, there are disadvantages as well as limitations [like ‘monotonicity constraints’ as pointed out in ‘Journal of Machine Learning Research Non-parametric Quantile Estimation (2005)’ or computations are quite tedious compared to the least squares method] which is why technique, though very old, is seldom used. I believe [not sure] that “quantile regression” (because said in lines 270 that “All analyses were performed) is available in IBM SPSS Version 26.</p>
              <p>Limitation mentioned in lines 462-64 [Liking of the test foods was not assessed as baseline liking scores did not influence food reinforcement, but if may have been interesting to see how or if liking of these tests foods changed as a result of the exercise intervention] is questionable. In the backdrop of the clear mention in lines 475-6 that this study is secondary of a larger study, [“the analysis, being a secondary aim of a larger study, was likely underpowered to detect significant differences in change scores”], editors may think about publication of such an article {though other things presented are alright}.</p>

              <p>Response to Reviewers</p>
              <p>We would like to thank the reviewers and Dr. Buchowski for their time and effort into providing their important feedback. We have carefully addressed each comment and feel that this manuscript has improved significantly. Since we satisfied the previous reviewers’ comments, we are responding below only to Reviewer #3’s comments, with our response in italics below each comment.</p>

              <p>Title: “The consequences of exercise-induced weight loss on food reinforcement. A randomized controlled trial”</p>
              <p>Important note: This review pertains only to ‘statistical aspects’ of the study and so ‘clinical aspects’ [like medical importance, relevance of the study, ‘clinical significance and implication(s)’ of the whole study, etc.] are to be evaluated [should be assessed] separately/independently.</p>
              <p>My first question is when title says “A randomized controlled trial” then why this study is classified as [Article Type:] ‘Research Article’? If it is really ‘A randomized controlled trial’ then it is expected to estimate ‘required sample size’. For the study on this topic a small effect size is generally assumed. Even for medium effect size [type I error 5%, Power=80%] according to ‘table-2 on page 158 of an old but classical paper “A power primer” in Psychological Bulletin, 1992, vol.:112, pp 155-159 the required sample size is 52 per group.

Note that in lines 498-500 it is said that “it appears a large sample size is required to better elucidate food reinforcement changes after exercise, potentially taking sex effects into account”. But a priori estimation of the required sample size is not found. </p>
              <p>Thank you for pointing this out, I initially selected ‘Research Article’ as this is what I believed a manuscript of this nature to fall under, although this study does fit NIH’s description of a clinical trial, so this may need to be updated. I have contacted the journal for advice in changing this designation.</p>
              <p>As for the second part of this question, I’m not certain I am understanding this fully. I have provided a power analysis, starting on line 270, and have added detail regarding how and why the study is powered this way. In short, this study is powered to detect a significant difference in body fat loss between groups. Although not specific to the outcome measures of the present investigation, powering the study in this manner allows us the ability to assess the present outcomes in groups that differ in body fat loss, an important, clinically relevant, variable to consider. </p>
              <p>What exactly you want to convey by ‘blocked on gender’ [a sedentary control group (no exercise) blocked on gender], the phrase used (in line 123) while describing group-III? {If that means ‘matched’ why the wide differences (68.4%, 85%, 78.8%, in Gr.I,II,III respectively)? It cannot be usual meaning of ‘block’ because group sizes are so different (19, 20, 14 in Gr.I,II,III respectively)}. Please explain.</p>
              <p>You are correct, this wasn’t “blocked” in the traditional sense. Rather, men and women were randomized separately. This has been updated and explained on lines 124/125.</p>
              <p>According to line 260 “Group differences in baseline study characteristics where tested via 1-way ANOVA” but P-values are not reported in table-2 displayed in lines 505- {which is in fact very good as it is often said that </p>
              <p>To provide a description of baseline characteristics is entirely reasonable (since it is clearly important in assessing to whom the results of the trial can be applied), however, it does not require the division of baseline characteristics by treatment groups. Statistical comparison of baseline characteristics is not desirable at all [because even if P-value turns out to be significant (while comparing baseline characteristics despite random allocation), it is, by definition, a false positive] as you then are supposed to be testing ‘randomization’ then, which in any single trial may not balance all baseline characteristics because ‘randomization’ is a sort of ‘insurance’ and not a guarantee scheme}.</p>
              <p>I do know many statisticians who scoff at the notion of testing for bassline group differences in a randomized trial. Although I’ve also received comments on papers I have submitted where reviewers ask me to test for baseline group differences despite a randomized design. I’m not a statistician, I have no preference, and have therefore removed the mention of testing for group differences (line 260) and simply state that baseline data is presented in table 2 (line 282).</p>
              <p>If the study was to observe effect of ‘progressive ratio’, then why [as said in lines 148-9] ‘Participants in the two-day per week group were instructed to perform two long exercise sessions per week and encouraged to try to expend 1,000 kcal per session’ is not understood. Will you please thro light on purpose [of that action]. ‘Power Analysis’ account given in lines 271 onwards is not very convincing though ‘was based on our previous study’. </p>
              <p>The progressive ration (or PR schedules) refers to the food reinforcement assessment. The two and six days of exercise per week were the exercise intervention. We were testing to see if the intervention exerted an effect on the food reinforcement measure (PR schedules). To make this clearer, we have added a couple lines at the end of the I intro, lines 87-89. As noted in the prior comment, we have added detail to the power analysis. </p>
              <p>In Table 3 [Resulting data from the 12-week exercise intervention between groups that exercised either six or two days per week and a sedentary control group] data are mean ± SE whereas “It may please be noted that ‘data always should be presented as means ± standard deviation’ [and never as means ± standard errors]. The standard deviation (SD) and standard error (SE) of the mean measures two very different things. The standard error depends heavily upon the sample size. [Note: standard error of the mean tells not about variability in the original population, as the standard deviation does, but about the certainty with which a sample mean estimates the true population mean. Since the certainty with which we can estimate the mean increases as the sample size increases, the standard error of the mean decreases as the sample size increases.] People are interested in knowing variability in ‘study population’ and not precision in estimate.</p>
              <p>We understand this notion of this perspective and the difference in SD and SE, which is why Table 1 included SD, as we are reporting strictly on our sample in this table. I have always been advised to report SE when presenting results from a clinical trial as we are trying to present our data not just specific to our data set but to convey it to the larger population. Although again, if SD is preferred in this scenario we are fine with making these changes. Table 3 has been updated to reflect SD. </p>
              <p>It is definitely appreciable that [line 294-297] ‘Quantile regression analysis’ [predicting changes in PmaxTotal is presented in Table 5: controlling for weekly exercise energy expenditure, exercise frequency per week (group), and changes in FM, REE and hunger] is used, however, a brief note (at least its non-parametric nature) on this ‘not so popular’ technique was desirable (my opinion may be little bias as a biostatistician). Surprisingly, median or other quartiles are not reported {though this non-parametric technique is used}. As you may be aware, there are disadvantages as well as limitations [like ‘monotonicity constraints’ as pointed out in ‘Journal of Machine Learning Research Non-parametric Quantile Estimation (2005)’ or computations are quite tedious compared to the least squares method] which is why technique, though very old, is seldom used. I believe [not sure] that “quantile regression” (because said in lines 270 that “All analyses were performed) is available in IBM SPSS Version 26.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the insight, and to better report all quartiles, we have included a histogram for delta PmaxTotal and have included this in the supplemental files and referenced it on line 292.</p>
              <p>Limitation mentioned in lines 462-64 [Liking of the test foods was not assessed as baseline liking scores did not influence food reinforcement, but if may have been interesting to see how or if liking of these tests foods changed as a result of the exercise intervention] is questionable. In the backdrop of the clear mention in lines 475-6 that this study is secondary of a larger study, [“the analysis, being a secondary aim of a larger study, was likely underpowered to detect significant differences in change scores”], editors may think about publication of such an article {though other things presented are alright}. </p>
              <p>It is true that this was a secondary aim of a larger study, but the analysis was centered on the regression analysis, identifying predictors in food reinforcement. Just because there were no statistically significant changes in Pmax, the regression analysis was still able to demonstrate significant findings. With changes in PmaxTotal over +20 in the 6-d group and -39 and -14 in the 2-d and control groups, respectively, this seems like a fair speculation and worthy of publication, albeit probably not in Nature or N Engl J Med. This notion that liking may have changed during the intervention to influence food reinforcement at post-testing was brought up by another reviewer before, questioning if liking was assessed at 12-weeks and if there were changes in this measure. Since we did not assess liking at 12 weeks, we considered this a limitation.</p>
