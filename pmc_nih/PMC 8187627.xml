                <p id="Par1">Progressive apraxia of speech is a neurodegenerative syndrome affecting spoken communication. Molecular pathology, biochemistry, genetics, and longitudinal imaging were investigated in 32 autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive apraxia of speech who were followed over 10 years. Corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy (4R-tauopathies) were the most common underlying pathologies. Perceptually distinct speech characteristics, combined with age-at-onset, predicted specific 4R-tauopathy; phonetic subtype and younger age predicted corticobasal degeneration, and prosodic subtype and older age predicted progressive supranuclear palsy. Phonetic and prosodic subtypes showed differing relationships within the cortico-striato-pallido-nigro-luysial network. Biochemical analysis revealed no distinct differences in aggregated 4R-tau while tau H1 haplotype frequency (69%) was lower compared to 1000+ autopsy-confirmed 4R-tauopathies. Corticobasal degeneration patients had faster rates of decline, greater cortical degeneration, and shorter illness duration than progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings help define the pathobiology of progressive apraxia of speech and may have consequences for development of 4R-tau targeting treatment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">In 1967, Fred Darley described a motor speech disorder characterized by varying combinations of slow speaking rate; abnormal prosody; speech sound simplifications; distorted sound substitutions, additions, repetitions, and prolongations; segmentations between syllables and words; and groping and trial-and-error articulatory movements and coined the term apraxia of speech (AOS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. AOS was designated as a unique entity distinct from dysarthria (another type of motor speech disorder) and aphasia, presumably due to abnormal planning and/or programming of speech movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Patients typically exhibit frustration with their inability to correct errors and often resort to more carefully articulated speech and/or slowing of their speech rate.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Stroke-related AOS, which typically improves over time, is well recognized in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, in the past two decades, a subtype of AOS has been described that is insidious in onset and progressive in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This progressive AOS (PAOS) often accompanies progressive agrammatic aphasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (AOS-PAA) or occurs as an embedded feature of a more widespread neurodegenerative syndrome, such as corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (referred to here as +AOS). In 2005, the term primary progressive apraxia of speech (PPAOS) was coined by Duffy et al. to describe PAOS occurring in its relatively pure form, i.e., in the absence of aphasia and not embedded as a feature of a larger neurodegenerative syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The syndrome of PPAOS was later more fully characterized and shown to relate to degeneration of a network of regions that include the lateral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The prevalence of PAOS, which encompasses PPAOS, has been estimated to be about 4.4 per 100,000 individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">In 2013, Josephs et al. described two data-supported subtypes of PAOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The first, type 1, was characterized by the relative predominance of articulatory distortions, distorted sound substitutions or additions, and articulatory groping. This subtype is similar to what has been reported in patients with stroke. The second, type 2, was characterized by a predominance of slow speech rate and segmentation within multi-syllabic words or across words. Type 2 has not been described in stroke patients and was not previously formally recognized. In subsequent studies, type 1 has been referred to as the phonetic subtype, and type 2 as the prosodic subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Features supporting the validity of PAOS subtypes include the phonetic subtype being associated with a significantly younger age at onset and more likely accompanied by moderate-severe aphasia than the prosodic subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In fact, the literature describing PAOS accompanying aphasia, or AOS embedded in the context of a neurodegenerative syndrome, almost always reveals characteristics consistent with phonetic AOS. Both PAOS subtypes involve degeneration of the lateral premotor and SMA, although the phonetic subtype appears to be more strongly linked to neocortex while the prosodic subtype has been linked to noncortical regions, such as the superior cerebellar peduncle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The motor speech impairment in PAOS progressively worsens over time, eventually resulting in mutism. In addition, patients with PAOS, including those with PPAOS, typically evolve into a Parkinson-plus syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Parkinsonian features tend to become prominent around 5 years after onset and include bradykinesia, postural instability, and rigidity, but not tremor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Patients with PAOS may also develop ideomotor limb apraxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and nonverbal oral apraxia (orobuccal apraxia)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; a subgroup develops ocular motor abnormalities including oculomotor impersistence and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the development of parkinsonism has been particularly linked to the prosodic subtype of PAOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In keeping with the clinical progression is the presence of neuroanatomic progression where progressive degeneration is evident in premotor and motor cortices as well as striatum, globus pallidus, and midbrain, particularly in those patients who develop a Parkinson-plus syndrome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In a handful of retrospective case reports and small case series, the underlying pathology associated with PAOS was a tauopathy, particularly a 4-repeat (4R) tauopathy, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. It is unknown, however, whether molecular pathology differs when AOS: (1) presents as a pure entity (PPAOS); (2) is associated with aphasia; or (3) is embedded within another neurodegenerative syndrome. It is also unknown whether there is any relationship between molecular pathology and AOS subtype or whether other clinical or neuroimaging features help predict underlying pathology. Furthermore, there is a knowledge gap concerning whether genetic associations, such as the H1/H2 haplotype of the microtubule associated tau (<italic>MAPT</italic>) gene<sup>20,21</sup>or the transmembrane protein 106B (<italic>TMEM106B</italic>), and biochemical features of aggregated tau associated with PSP and CBD pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> are associated with 4R tauopathies underlying PAOS, or whether genetic mutations or polymorphisms in <italic>TMEM106B</italic> associated with degenerative diseases such as PSP, CBD, Picks disease (PiD) and  the protein TDP-43, play any role in PAOS.</p>
              <p id="Par8">In this study, we report the molecular pathology of a relatively large cohort of 32 prospectively recruited and longitudinally followed patients with PAOS. We aimed to investigate clinical, neuroimaging, genetic, and biochemical associations with molecular pathology in PAOS. We hypothesized that PSP and CBD would be the most common underlying pathology of PPAOS and PAOS with aphasia. Given that we found an association between phonetic PAOS and anatomical involvement of the premotor cortex and involvement of the superior cerebellar peduncle in prosodic AOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that phonetic AOS would be associated with CBD while prosodic AOS would be associated with PSP and that neuroimaging features will differ between CBD and PSP, especially closer to death. We hypothesize that genetic and biochemical characteristics of PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP will be similar to those previously reported in CBD and PSP when associated with their more classic presentations of corticobasal syndrome  (CBS) and Richardson’s syndrome, respectively.</p>

                <p id="Par10">Of the 32 PAOS patients, the most common underlying pathology was CBD, which was found in 17 cases (53%), followed by PSP, which was observed in 10 cases (31%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All CBD and PSP patients met research criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Less frequent pathologies were frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) type A in two cases (6%), PiD in two cases (6%), and combined FTLD-TDP type B with argyrophilic grains disease (AGD) in one case (3%).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart illustrating the relationship between baseline clinical diagnoses and underlying pathology in all 32 progressive apraxia of speech patients.</title><p>Thirty-two patients with progressive apraxia of speech were included in the study.

Twelve of the 32 patients were diagnosed with both apraxia of speech and agrammatism (AOS-PAA), of which 8 had CBD and 4 had PSP pathology. The last five patients were diagnosed with apraxia of speech that was embedded in other symptoms and signs (+AOS). These five patients had frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathology with TAR DNA binding of 43Kda (FTLD-TDP) (either type A or B) and Pick disease (PiD) pathologies, with one patient also having argyrophilic grains disease (AGD).

                <p id="Par11">Of the ten patients with PSP, three met pathologic criteria for atypical PSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. All three showed cortical predominant pathology with relatively mild neuronal loss in cardinal subcortical nuclei (i.e., globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra). Two of the three atypical PSP patients additionally had a loss of Betz cells in the motor cortex, with one additionally having globose neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within residual Betz cells that were apparent on H&amp;E and with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition, this patient showed many tau-positive threads in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, mid-third of the cerebral peduncle, and the longitudinal fibers in the pontine base but less in the medullary pyramid, consistent with atypical PSP with corticospinal tract degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. None of the PSP patients had globular inclusions consistent with a globular glial tauopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Of the 17 patients with CBD, the pathology was typical in all but two patients, who had additional features. One had striking neuronal loss and gliosis in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus, accompanied by iron-type pigment deposits in the globus pallidus, consistent with pallidonigraluysian degeneration (PNLD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The second patient showed striking neuronal loss, gliosis, iron-type pigment, and axonal spheroids in the globus pallidus, plus marked neuronal loss in the substantia nigra but less pathology in the subthalamic nucleus.</p>

                <title>Demographic and clinical features of PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP at baseline</title>
                <p id="Par13">The PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP cases all had a clinical diagnosis of either PPAOS or AOS-PAA at their baseline visit, while the FTLD-TDP type A, FTLD-TDP type B + AGD, and PiD cases all had a diagnosis of +AOS at baseline (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Patients diagnosed with PPAOS and AOS-PAA at baseline showed a similar proportion of CBD and PSP pathologies at autopsy (60% CBD and 40% PSP in PPAOS; 67% CBD and 33% PSP in AOS-PAA).</p>
                <p id="Par14">The PAOS-PSP cases were older at onset, baseline evaluation, and death, and they had a longer time from onset to death compared to PAOS-CBD cases (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The AOS subtype differed across PAOS-PSP and PAOS-CBD; the phonetic subtype was more common in PAOS-CBD, and the prosodic subtype was more common in PAOS-PSP. In fact, of the 17 PAOS-CBD cases, 15 (88%) had phonetic AOS, while of the 10 PSP cases only 3 (30%) had phonetic AOS. The three PAOS-PSP patients with phonetic AOS were all diagnosed with atypical PSP at autopsy (with severe cortical pathology and less severe subcortical pathology, as described above). The other seven had typical PSP pathology. The two PAOS-CBD patients with prosodic AOS showed additional features (including striking involvement of the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus, as described above). The PAOS-CBD group also performed worse on the phonetic subscore of the AOS rating scale (ASRS) compared to PAOS-PSP cases. A logistic regression model using elastic-net regularization predicting pathology using age at onset and AOS subtype gave an AUROC of 0.89 (0.68, 0.97). Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> provides the probabilities that a PAOS patient has either CBD or PSP pathology given their age at onset and AOS subtype. For example, a patient with an age of onset of 60 years and phonetic AOS has an 84% probability of having CBD pathology. Conversely, a patient with an age at onset of 80 years and prosodic AOS has a 93% probability of having PSP pathology. The only clinical tests that differed across PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP were the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI), Boston Naming Test (BNT), and Delis–Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting Test, on which the PAOS-CBD cases performed worse.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic and clinical features for the PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP

Over time, of the 17 PAOS-CBD patients, 13 evolved into a CBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, two into behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, one into frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (i.e., in addition to features of behavioral variant FTD, he also developed early in his course levodopa-unresponsive parkinsonism of moderate severity), and one into Richardson’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Of the 10 PAOS-PSP patients, five evolved into Richardson’s syndrome and three into a CBS; the final two patients did not have longitudinal follow-up. The AOS subtype progressed to become mixed (i.e. ~equal prosodic and phonetic features) in 15 of 23 patients (65%) with follow-up clinical assessments, without discernable differences in conversion between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP or between phonetic and prosodic patients. Of the remaining eight patients, none had converted to a mixed phenotype by the last clinical follow-up, although all patients, except one with CBS, became mute before death.</p>

When we assessed the corticostriatal to pallido-nigro-luysial (PNL) ratio for neuronal loss, there was separation by AOS subtype independent of pathology, with the phonetic subtype having higher corticostriatal-to-PNL ratio, while the prosodic subtype had a higher PNL-to-corticostriatal ratio (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par28">The results of this study offer unique insights into the neurobiology of PAOS that have important implications for patient prognosis and future development of experimental therapeutic paradigms. We found that PAOS is most often associated with a 4R tauopathy when it exists in isolation or when it co-exists with aphasia. On the contrary, when AOS accompanies behavioral dyscontrol, executive dysfunction, or features of motor neuron disease, the underlying pathology is heterogeneous, less commonly 4R tau, and may be related to a mutation in the <italic>GRN</italic> gene. We also found that AOS subtype is an important consideration in PAOS; subtype is strongly associated with age at onset, and AOS subtype and age together are highly predictive of pathology. It appears that the different AOS subtypes are linked to different relative degrees of neuronal loss and gliosis in frontal neocortex versus the PNL network. Furthermore, tau haplotypes differed between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP, suggesting that PAOS-PSP, in particular, may have a unique genetic risk profile, albeit with similar tau biochemistry. Finally, neuroanatomical differences were observed between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP on neuroimaging, many of which became more striking with disease progression.</p>
              <p id="Par29">In this prospectively recruited cohort, we found that the most frequent pathology was CBD, occurring in approximately half of the patients. PSP, another 4R tauopathy, was also relatively common, occurring in about one-third. In fact, 100% of our PPAOS and AOS-PAA cohorts had an underlying 4R tauopathy. Indeed, PSP and CBD have been associated with PAOS in case studies and small retrospective series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We also identified other pathologies in our cohort, including PiD, FTLD-TDP type A associated with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations, and FTLD-TDP type B with AGD (a 4R tauopathy), which were all associated with +AOS. The findings of behavioral dyscontrol and executive dysfunction, in addition to AOS, were particularly associated with PiD and FTLD-TDP type A. Indeed, the behavioral variant of FTD is the most common presentation of PiD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and FTLD-TDP type A secondary to a <italic>GRN</italic> mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These results suggest that if AOS is accompanied by behavioral dyscontrol and executive dysfunction, FTLD-TDP type A and PiD are more likely to be the underlying cause than a 4R tauopathy. Furthermore, given that 50% of these patients had a mutation in <italic>GRN</italic>, such patients should be screened for a mutation in the <italic>GRN</italic> gene. Other likely cases of +AOS reported in the literature similarly lacked 4R tauopathy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">All patients presenting with PPAOS or AOS-PAA had an underlying 4R tauopathy, with no suggestion that the frequency of these two clinical syndromes differed by the specific 4R tauopathy. On the other hand, AOS subtype and age differed between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP. PAOS-CBD was associated with phonetic AOS and a younger age at onset, while PAOS-PSP was associated with prosodic AOS and older age at onset. This finding provides support for the predictive value of AOS subtype, the importance of which was stressed by Mailend and Maas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Despite the strong relationship between AOS subtype and pathology, there were exceptional cases of PSP presenting with phonetic AOS (3/10) and CBD presenting with prosodic AOS (2/17). On further investigation, there appears to be a histologic explanation for these departures, which may, in fact, shed light on the pathological underpinnings of AOS subtype. We found that the relative amount of neuronal loss affecting the corticostriatal network (SMA/motor cortex and striatum), compared to the amount of neuronal loss affecting the PNL network (globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus), differed by AOS subtype. The phonetic CBD and PSP patients showed relatively greater involvement of the corticostriatal network compared to the PNL network, while the prosodic PSP and CBD patients showed the opposite pattern. This finding supports regions in the corticostriatal network being involved with programing and planning of motor speech and, hence, linked to dysfunction of motor speech output such as distorted sound substitutions, additions, and prolongations. The phonetic features of AOS also occur in the context of stroke, and in such cases, lesion analysis has implicated the premotor and motor cortices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; resting-state fMRI studies have also implicated the left premotor cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In the context of PPAOS, we have also found more widespread involvement of premotor and motor cortices on neuroimaging in phonetic AOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The five +AOS cases all had a phonetic AOS associated with pathologies that targeted the cortex over the PNL network. The PNL network has not previously been implicated in AOS. These regions are commonly associated with motor parkinsonism, progressive akinesia in which slowing is a pathognomonic feature, as well as freezing of gait<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. On the other hand, there is literature linking the PNL network to speech. In a study of PSP patients with prominent involvement of the PNL network, motor speech problems occurred as an early feature in 100% of the patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Although it is not proven that PNL network-related speech problems are equivalent to prosodic AOS, they are commonly described as an akinesia of speech (lack of, or slowing); this could represent a variant of prosodic AOS, given that slow rate is one of its defining features. Severe degeneration of the substantia nigra (without pathological description of globus pallidus and subthalamic nuclei) at autopsy has also been reported in a PAOS patient who subsequently developed parkinsonism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In support of the pathological associations, we also found neuroimaging  evidence for differences in the corticostriatal and PNL networks with phonetic and prosodic AOS. We acknowledge that our neuroimaging findings were not as robust as the pathological findings, possibly due to lack of precision in the large cortical ROIs and difficulty measuring small subcortical structures. Nevertheless, this finding suggests potential value of future interrogation of these networks using connectivity-based analyses and imaging techniques that allow more precise measurement of these regions.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Beyond age and AOS subtype, there were few differences in clinical features between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP at baseline that would help to differentiate between them. Longitudinally, PAOS-CBD showed an overall faster rate of decline in cognitive and language function yet showed a similar rate of worsening in AOS severity compared to PAOS-PSP. We found that aphasia severity showed the expected correlations with metabolism in language areas and these correlations were stronger in PAOS-CBD, which fits with the fact that PAOS-CBD patients more often developed aphasia.</p>
              <p id="Par32">On neuroimaging, baseline differences between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP were apparent on MRI. Specifically, PAOS-CBD showed smaller volumes of the striatum, and PAOS-PSP showed smaller volume of the cerebellar dentate and midbrain. These differences persisted 4 years after onset, with additional involvement of thalamus in PAOS-CBD. Involvement of the cerebellar dentate and midbrain are characteristic features of Richardson’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, and we have previously shown that midbrain atrophy can develop in PAOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, especially in those patients who develop Richardson’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It is difficult to know whether the presence of cerebellar dentate and midbrain atrophy in our PAOS cohort represents a marker of PSP pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> or simply reflects the fact that the PAOS-PSP patients commonly developed Richardson’s syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The finding of greater striatal and thalamic atrophy in PAOS-CBD compared to PAOS-PSP is consistent with one previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and with the association of CBS and CBD with atrophy of the basal ganglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. No differences were observed in the neocortex between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP at baseline with FDG-PET; patterns of hypometabolism were consistent with our previous work on PAOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Differences between pathologies became apparent, however, as the disease progressed, with PAOS-CBD showing faster rates of decline across most neocortical regions compared to PAOS-PSP. The presence of widespread cortical neurodegeneration in PAOS could, therefore, be an indicator of underlying CBD pathology.</p>
              <p id="Par33">A large degree of overlap was observed across PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP in patterns of white-matter degeneration, predominantly involving frontal and motor cortex white matter, body of the corpus callosum, cingulum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. This network of regions has previously been shown to be abnormal in PAOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. We observed no significant differences between pathologies at baseline, and little difference was observed across pathologies in the rate of decline in white matter integrity; however, as the disease progressed, PAOS-CBD had greater degeneration of the corona radiata compared to PAOS-PSP. This is consistent with the fact that the corona radiata receives and sends projections to the cortex, which is particularly affected in PAOS-CBD. The corona radiata is frequently affected in CBS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Homozygosity of the <italic>MAPT</italic> H1 allele (i.e., H1H1) increases the risk of PSP and CBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, while a genome-wide study suggested that the presence of the H2 allele is protective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Our study found the expected high frequency of the H1 allele in our PAOS-CBD patients. Surprisingly, however, we found that PAOS-PSP had a lower frequency of the H1 allele compared to PAOS-CBD and also compared to our large pathologically-confirmed cohort with typical Richardson’s syndrome, suggesting the <italic>MAPT</italic> H1 allele may not be a risk for PAOS-PSP. Another possibility is that the higher frequency of the H2 haplotype within PAOS-PSP cases could be conferring a predisposition of the PAOS-PSP phenotype on carriers as opposed to Richardson’s syndrome.</p>
              <p id="Par35">We did not find any differences in the insoluble tau subunits forming the filamentous aggregates in our PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP cases. Indeed, the tau isoform composition was consistent with CBD and PSP, and most importantly, the degradation products resulting from endogenous proteolysis for these cases were similar, indicating the underlying pathobiology of tau, in contrast to neuroanatomy of degenerative changes, is not different in patients with AOS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Hence, there is no biochemical evidence to suggest that PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP represent distinct tauopathies.</p>
              <p id="Par36">There was no enrichment for the <italic>TMEM106B</italic> CC genotype in our PAOS cohort as was recently described in cases with an atypical tauopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The frequency of the C and G allele in our PAOS cohort was similar to what we previously reported in neurologically healthy controls, although there was a slightly lower frequency of the GG genotype, which is thought to be protective against FTLD-TDP type A and <italic>GRN</italic> mutations when compared to controls (PAOS = 31.2% CC, 59.4% CG, 9.4% GG; healthy controls = 32.7% CC, 48.1% CG, 19.1% GG controls) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Strengths of our study include the fact that it is a longitudinal (10-year) NIH-funded prospective study, all patients underwent detailed and standardized clinical batteries at each visit, and multiple different analytic techniques complimented and supported one another. Limitations include the relatively small size of our +AOS group and the lack of racial diversity in our patient cohort.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The findings from this study have important implications for prognosis, management, and counseling patients and families about the disease course. For example, phonetic patients will more likely lose the use of their limbs, while prosodic patients will more likely develop poor balance, fall, lose the ability to walk, and be wheelchair bound. Targeted physical therapy will therefore differ somewhat in the phonetic versus prosodic patients. There are also implications for speech-language therapy and management strategies including aiding with long-term planning regarding employment, travel, and the form of alternative means of communication that may eventually be required. Specifically, PAOS patients without aphasia have a slower course, longer survival, and better prospects for maintaining sufficient language skills for day-to-day communication and handling work demands than patients who are also aphasic; phonetic patients have faster rates of decline in language ability and may be at greater risk for the emergence of behavioral and other cognitive problems. Alternative communication strategies may be more effective and easier to implement in the absence of aphasia. Last but not least, our findings also have implications on the design of clinical trials of therapies targeting 4R tauopathies, influencing mechanisms for targeting individuals for enrollment, selecting appropriate imaging biomarkers, and developing therapeutic paradigms to target specific brain networks. This could pertain to differences in regional targeting or neurochemical targeting, since neurotransmitters in cortical network differ from those in the PNLA network.</p>

All patients underwent detailed neurological evaluation, speech and language examination, neuropsychological testing, blood sampling for DNA extraction, and multimodal neuroimaging that included a 3.0 Tesla volumetric head MRI scan, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and [<sup>18</sup>F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan, over a span of 48–72 h. Family history was abstracted, and positive family history was defined as history of any neurodegenerative disease (primary progressive aphasia, frontotemporal dementia, progressive apraxia of speech, PSP, CBS, Alzheimer’s disease &lt;age 65, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies) in a first- or second-degree relative. All patients were followed longitudinally with yearly evaluations with identical clinical and multi modal neuroimaging.

Letter fluency (FAS) and semantic (animal) fluency scores were also obtained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The ASRS version 3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> was utilized to assess AOS characteristics and severity, which included sub-scores that measured phonetic and prosodic characteristics. Judgments about motor speech abilities were based on all spoken language tasks of the WAB plus additional speech tasks that included vowel prolongation, speech-like alternating motion rates, speech-like sequential motion rates, word and sentence repetition tasks, and a conversational speech sample. The same speech tasks were also judged for the presence or absence of dysarthria, which was rated on a 0–4 severity scale. Judgments about the presence of aphasia were based on performance on all measures of spoken and written language. Aphasia severity was graded on a 0–4 scale based on clinical judgment. To meet the criteria for having agrammatism, function word omissions or syntactic errors had to be present on at least two tasks including but not limited to spontaneous speech in general conversation or during verbal or written examination tasks. Nonverbal Oral Apraxia was assessed using an eight-item scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The patient diagnosis was made after review of video and audio recordings of speech and language test scores by consensus between two or three speech-language pathologists (J.R.D., R.L.U., H.M.C., and E.A.S.) blinded to all neurological, neuropsychological, and imaging findings. Patients with PAOS in its relatively pure manifestation, i.e., in the absence of aphasia or any neurological/neuropsychological signs or symptoms determined by history or formal testing (see below), were designated as PPAOS. Patients with PAOS and evidence of progressive agrammatic aphasia were designated as AOS-PAA. Patients with PAOS co-existing with one or two other neurological signs and symptoms, such as behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, parkinsonism, or face/limb weakness, yet not meeting criteria for another neurodegenerative syndrome/disease (such as PSP, CBS, ALS, etc.), were designated as +AOS.

                <p id="Par45">Our analysis utilized three different imaging modalities: (1) FDG-PET to assess dysfunction in cortical regions; (2) volumetric head MRI to assess volume of subcortical structures; and (3) DTI to assess integrity of the white matter. All patients underwent FDG-PET using a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode. Patients were injected with average 459 MBq (range, 367-576 MBq) of [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG, and after a 30-min uptake period, an 8-min FDG scan was performed consisting of four 2-min dynamic frames following a low-dose CT transmission scan. All patients also underwent a standardized MRI imaging protocol at 3.0 Tesla on a GE scanner, which included a 3D MPRAGE sequence and a single-shot echo-planar DTI pulse sequence with 41 diffusion encoding steps and five nondiffusion weighted T2 images. All MPRAGE images underwent pre-processing correction for intensity nonuniformity using SPM12 (revision 8369) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="Par46">Group-level analyses focused on assessing neuroimaging in patients with either CBD or PSP pathology, given that these were the most common pathologies underlying PAOS. For FDG-PET, we performed voxel-level and region-of-interest (ROI) level analyses. All FDG-PET scans were registered to the concurrent MPRAGE using 6 degrees-of-freedom registration in SPM12 (revision 8369) with default settings. All voxels in the FDG-PET images were divided by median uptake in the pons to create standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images, and these SUVR images were normalized to the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/</ext-link>) version 1.4 using the normalization parameters from the MPRAGE normalization to MCALT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and smoothed at 6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum. Voxel-wise t-tests in SPM12 were used for statistical comparisons of baseline FDG-PET for patients and healthy controls including age and gender as covariates. The control individuals (<italic>N</italic> = 25, median [inter-quartile range] age = 69 [62–75] years, 44% females; MMSE range 26–30) were recruited into NRG and age- and gender-matched to the 32 PAOS patients. Results were assessed in SPM12 after family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 or uncorrected at a threshold of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The MCALT atlas was also used to output ROI-level SUVR values for cortical regions across the frontal, temporal (lateral only), parietal and occipital lobes, using Advanced Normalization  Tools (ANTs) version 1.9.x<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> with MCALT default settings. ROI-level SUVRs were calculated separately for all serial FDG-PET for each patient. Individual patterns of hypometabolism were assessed using the clinical tool of 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (SSP) with the software package CortexID (Suite 2.1; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin). The activity in each patient’s PET data set was normalized to the pons and compared with an age-segmented normative database, yielding a 3-dimensional SSP <italic>z</italic> score image. The image produced by this analysis produces a metabolic map using the <italic>z</italic> scores as calculated for each surface pixel.</p>
                <p id="Par47">For MRI, SPM12 with the MCALT atlas was used to output volumes of the following, mainly subcortical, structures: amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform, hippocampus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and cerebellum. In-house developed atlases were used to output volume of the midbrain and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. These atlases were created by manually drawing these structures onto MCALT. The Deep Brain Stimulation Intrinsic Template Atlas (DISTAL) atlas was used to output volumes of the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra. ROI-level volumes were calculated separately for all serial MRI for each patient.</p>
                <p id="Par48">For DTI, we performed voxel-level and ROI-level analyses. The DTI scans were denoised, corrected for head motion, eddy current distortion, Gibbs-ringing, Rician bias, and skull stripped.

Each DTI image was nonlinearly co-registered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and normalized to a 1-mm isotropic Montreal Neurological Institute 152 standard space via the FMRIB58_FA template using ANTs version 1.9.x with default settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Regions of cerebrospinal fluid and gray matter were removed from consideration by masking out regions where mean FA across co-registered patient images were below 0.2.

                <p id="Par57">The main goal of our analyses were to assess differences between PSP and CBD, since these are the most common pathologies underlying PAOS. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables to assess for differences in clinical and demographic measures at baseline. For each variable, we also calculated the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and 95% CI from a univariate logistic regression to show the marginal discriminatory power of each metric, i.e., effect size, since classification was the overarching goal of these analyses. We repeated these univariate analyses after calculating annualized change scores in each continuous clinical measure using all available longitudinal data in each measure. These annualized change metrics were calculated by fitting within-person ordinary least squares models with predictors for intercept (baseline score) and annualized change, then reporting the coefficient for the annualized change term as the annualized change for that individual. This allowed us to use as much data as possible when more than two visits were available. A total of 88 data points (clinical visits) were utilized in the analysis. In addition, we modeled the trajectory of change over time in the four main clinical domains of cognition, parkinsonism, aphasia, and AOS using mixed-effects models (Supplementary Text).</p>
                <p id="Par58">To test our hypothesis that AOS subtype and age at onset help predict the specific 4R tauopathy, logistic regression was used to build a classification model that separates PSP from CBD. To report the overall classification ability of this model, we used the predicted values to calculate an AUROC and 95% CI using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
                <p id="Par59">We fit modality-specific, whole-brain Bayesian hierarchical models to assess whether there are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in PSP and CBD in gray-matter volumes, FDG SUVR, and DTI FA. The models were anchored at baseline as time zero, which allowed us to assess for similarities and differences when the patient first presents as well as similarities and differences in how these diseases progress through their clinical course. Hierarchical models use the idea of partial pooling of variance parameters to increase statistical power and stabilize estimates across regions while allowing us to use multiple regions-per-scan and scans-per-person, i.e., to maximize the amount of data included in these comprehensive models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. Each model used a neuroimaging measure as the outcome predicted by region and diagnosis, using years-from-baseline assessment as the timescale. More details of these Bayesian hierarchical models can be found in the Supplementary Text including an algebraic representation of the model as well as technical details about prior distributions and model fits.</p>
                <p id="Par60">In addition, the following secondary neuroimaging analyses were performed (see Supplementary Text for more details): (1) we assessed whether previously published relationships between AOS and aphasia and specific brain regions differed between PAOS-CBD and PAOS-PSP.
