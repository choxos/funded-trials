                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">An important cervical cancer prevention strategy in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been single-visit screen-and-treat (SV-SAT) approach, using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and ablative treatment with cryotherapy to manage precancerous lesions. While SV-SAT with VIA and cryotherapy have established efficacy, its population level coverage and impact on reducing cervical cancer burden remains low. In Kenya, the estimated cervical cancer screening uptake among women aged 30–49 is 16% and up to 70% of screen-positive women do not receive treatment. Thermal ablation for treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix is recommended by the World Health Organization and has the potential to overcome logistical challenges associated with cryotherapy and facilitate implementation of SV-SAT approach and increase treatment rates of screen-positive women. In this 5-year prospective, stepped-wedge randomized trial, we plan to implement and evaluate the SV-SAT approach using VIA and thermal ablation in ten reproductive health clinics in central Kenya.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The study aims to develop and evaluate implementation strategies to inform the national scale-up of SV-SAT approach with VIA and thermal ablation through three aims: (1) develop locally tailored implementation strategies using multi-level participatory method with key stakeholders (patient, provider, system-level), (2) implement SV-SAT approach with VIA and thermal ablation and evaluate clinical and implementation outcomes, and (3) assess the budget impact of SV-SAT approach with VIA and thermal ablation compared to single-visit, screen-and-treat method using cryotherapy.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Our findings will inform national scale-up of the SV-SAT approach with VIA and thermal ablation. We anticipate that this intervention, along with tailored implementation strategies will enhance the adoption and sustainability of cervical cancer screening and treatment compared to the standard of care using cryotherapy.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par46">Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable with current technologies, yet it remains the fourth most common cause of cancer incidence and mortality among women globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Ninety percent of cervical cancer cases and deaths occur in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In response to this public health problem, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a call in 2018 to eliminate cervical cancer globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In Kenya, cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and the most common cause of cancer death in women, with an age standardized incidence of 33.8/100,000, resulting in 5236 cases and 3211 deaths in 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Despite the well-documented need for cervical cancer prevention, just 16% of Kenyan women (age 30–49) were screened in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], far below the WHO’s target of 70% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For this reason, the Kenya National Cancer Control Strategy 2017–2022 prioritizes early detection strategies for cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">The current WHO guideline recommends women over 30 years old be screened for cervical cancer every 3 years via visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Lugol’s iodine, or cytology when human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is not available as a primary screening modality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The single-visit, screen-and-treat approach (SV-SAT) with VIA to detect and manage precancerous or cancerous lesions has been recommended for cervical cancer prevention in LMICs like Kenya because of its low cost and facilitation of treatment uptake among screen-positive women compared to cytology or HPV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. VIA has demonstrated effectiveness in detecting cervical cancer at the population level in LMICs such as Zimbabwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, implementation and maintenance cervical cancer screening programs in Kenya has been suboptimal due to multi-level barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. At the individual/patient level, low population-level awareness of screening services has impeded the uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other studies have also reported structural barriers such as attrition of trained personnel and supply and equipment stockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">In the SV-SAT approach, women who screen positive for precancerous lesions are immediately treated with ablative therapy such as cryotherapy or thermal ablation, which minimizes loss to follow-up or attrition of screen-positive women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. According to the 2015 Kenya STEPwise survey report on non-communicable diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], up to 70% of screen-positive women do not receive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Low fidelity of the SV-SAT approach and treatment with cryotherapy in Kenya has been attributed to programmatic and logistical challenges of implementing cryotherapy in low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, large tanks of compressed refrigerant gas are difficult to supply and transport consistently to remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The equipment (cryotherapy probe and gas) is costly, and clinics that maintain cryotherapy equipment in Kenya have reported challenges with equipment failure and high turnover of trained personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The 2019 WHO recommendations have added thermal ablation as another ablative treatment method for precancerous lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The portable thermal ablation device can be charged with electricity, batteries, or solar panels, which is ideal for low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While the safety, efficacy, and acceptability of thermal ablation to women has been demonstrated in limited settings in parts of Zambia and Kenya [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], the drivers of its implementation and scale-up have not been determined.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Implementation strategies of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) such as SV-SAT with VIA and thermal ablation can facilitate identification of multi-level determinants of cervical cancer screening and treatment uptake and tailor EBIs to the local contexts to enhance their adoption and sustainment. We hypothesize that this intervention, along with tailored implementation strategies, will enhance the adoption and sustainability of cervical cancer screening and treatment compared to the standard of care using cryotherapy.

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="Par55">This 5-year prospective, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial (hereafter referred to as “TIBA,” and translating to <italic>cure/treatment</italic> in Kiswahili, the Kenyan national language) aims to develop and evaluate implementation strategies to inform the national scale-up of SV-SAT approach with VIA and thermal ablation. We will initially use qualitative research with a participatory approach to develop an implementation strategy to introduce the intervention (SV-SAT with VIA and thermal ablation) in ten reproductive health clinics in central Kenya. Subsequently, we will evaluate the implementation of the intervention following the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design. The conceptual framework for this trial was informed by the implementation research logic model (IRLM, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The IRLM has been described extensively in the literature, but briefly, involves identifying and specifying the relationship between the determinants, implementation strategies, mechanism of action, and outcomes of evidence-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A mixed-methods evaluation will assess implementation success. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework will be used to assess the impact, which has demonstrated capacity to guide assessments of the public health impacts of complex intervention by capturing formative, process and outcome dimensions on the individual, organizational, and policy levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We will also use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide the data collection and interpretation of the implementation outcomes and determine necessary adaptations in delivery as well as organizational determinants of successful implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The CFIR is a meta-framework that incorporates components from evidence-based implementation process theories, guides intervention planning and implementation, and identifies contextual influences that explain the heterogeneity of implementation success across settings. This meta-framework is organized into five domains, comprised of 39 constructs and serves as a guide to identify core and adaptable components, an essential requirement to support scaling of interventions and has been applied successfully in LMICs settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The use of these established implementation science frameworks will help ensure our evaluation provides actionable, appropriate, and holistic implementation guidance to scale SV-SAT with VIA and thermal ablation across heterogeneous health facilities. As part of this comprehensive evaluation, we will also assess the cost and budget impact of the intervention, which is critical for policymakers in LMICs to define priorities and actualize realistic and effective planning. Our project will produce a comprehensive delivery guide in collaboration with the Kenya National Cancer Control Program (NCCP) along with implementation guidelines for scaling nationwide.

                <p id="Par56">We will implement this work in ten health facilities in Embu, Kiambu, Nairobi, and Murang’a counties in central Kenya, including urban faith-based, rural, and urban health facilities. The sample is purposively selected to be nationally representative and heterogeneous in order to provide contextually relevant guidance applicable for national scaling of the intervention. The eligibility to participate will include the following: (1) Hospital levels 3–5 according to the Kenyan level system, public or private medical facilities; (2) current use of VIA as the primary screening method; and (3) cervical cancer screening volume over a 4-month period (greater than 1000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additional factors such as geographical setting (urban vs. rural), leadership/management structure, funding mechanism (public vs. private/charity), number of providers trained in cervical cancer screening and their scope of practice, and patient fee structure for screening as well as screening volume will be considered. Site level variation is critical to scale the intervention in heterogeneous clinics with different management and staffing systems.</p>

                <p id="Par58">The intervention will include cervical cancer screening and treatment using SV-SAT with VIA and thermal ablation. To build on existing data from the region and the investigative team, we will use participatory methods to conduct qualitative interviews with clients, front-line health providers, facility managers, and policy makers in the Ministry of Health to assess and address barriers and facilitators to uptake and provide information on the introduction of the intervention through stakeholder engagement. Based on informal engagement with frontline health care workers and managers in the study area, we anticipate openness to the intervention. Existing barriers will be identified early in project implementation to address any unforeseen challenges to implementation. At the end of year 1, we will hold a stakeholder workshop to map out context-specific strategies that address potential barriers to intervention uptake and account for heterogeneity in provider and system inputs across facilities. Information gathered during these research activities will help investigators refine the essential components of the implementation strategy to be evaluated in Aim 2.</p>

We anticipate the meeting size will be approximately 40–50 people. Invitees will include representation from the National Cancer Institute, Ministry of Health leadership, county-level reproductive health coordinators, and health facility managers and select front line health providers from participating reproductive health facilities that provide VIA or are interested in doing so. At this workshop, we will engage stakeholders in mapping exercises to identify how services for cervical cancer screening and treatment are currently provided across each site. The results of the mapping and the qualitative findings will be reviewed to identify categories of determinants driving implementation at the facility level. Baseline conceptual framing of the implementation process will be introduced using IRLM so facility level teams can conceptually link determinants, their implementation strategies, and the hypothesized mechanisms of action to implementation and clinical outcomes. Throughout the stakeholder meeting process, we will invite stakeholders to suggest preconditions and/or adaptations to the planned implementation of the intervention that may be necessary in specific local contexts and settings, and we will attempt to incorporate ways to include these implementation guidelines for the sustainable introduction of the intervention. Specifically, we will use this feedback to refine our design to be compatible with facility workflow and systems, aligns with organizational culture, and is agreeable to our stakeholders. Finally, at this workshop, we will collectively randomize clinics into one of three phases to begin implementation. The randomization will be performed in a public manner in order to ensure organizational receptivity and to build ownership of the implementation process.</p>

According to data on cervical cancer screening and preventive treatment for Kiambu county from 2017 to 2019, 20% of cervical cancer screening clients who screened positive received cryotherapy or LEEP. Routine data from our proposed study facilities show an average of 30 clients per month screened at each facility in the first 3 months of 2020. Assuming 6-month waves, 30 clients screened per month and a 5% screen positive rate, we expect an average of 9 screen-positive women per facility per wave. Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.2, alpha = 0.05, and 20% treatment coverage pre-intervention, we will have 80% power to detect a three-fold increase to 60% treatment coverage with the intervention (R [v 3.6.3] package swCRTDesign [v 3.1]).

The training curriculum will be adapted to address gaps identified in year 1. On-site hands-on training will be done at each facility with support of research training team for a duration of 4 days. Outreach community activities will be done prior to scheduled on-site training to provide an adequate number of clients for screening and demonstration of thermal ablation. Each trained provider will be required to complete a set number of procedures before they receive a proficiency certificate. The selected reproductive health clinics have some of their providers trained on VIA and cryotherapy. Our team of investigators has three reproductive health experts with thermal ablation training skills who will develop and train a team of trainer of trainers at each reproductive health clinic. Regular training at each clinic will be provided with engagement of a Kenyan consultant gynecologist to provide consultant training services for the trainer of trainers for the initial 2 clinics. Thereafter, the research team and the county trainer of trainers will provide on-site hands-on training. Training will be led by specialists skilled in colposcopy, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), cryotherapy, and thermal ablation. Quarterly CME and refresher training during implementation will be done. In addition to thermal ablation training, CME-type training on cervical cancer prevention interventions and refresher didactic training on VIA will be performed.</p>

In Aim 2, reproductive health clinics will implement the intervention with the implementation strategy developed and refined at the year 1 stakeholder meeting. We expect that implementation strategies across the 10 sites will include some common and some site-specific components. During the 6-month intervention period, facilities will be supported by the study team to iteratively tailor their implementation strategy using their IRLM conceptual map and identified and prioritized strategy components.

                  <p id="Par72">To assess readiness for intervention adoption, we will apply the validated ORIC assessment scale translated into Kiswahili and adapted to the implementation context after each wave begins. ORIC is a 12-item Likert-type scale, broken into domains of change commitment (4 items) and change efficacy (8 items), and has demonstrated reliability, content validity, structural validity, structural invariance, and known-groups validity in field application. We will apply the ORIC to 3 management team members of each intervention facility (<italic>n</italic> = 30) and 6 frontline health workers per intervention facility (<italic>n</italic> = 60). Analysis will test whether sufficient inter-rater reliability and inter-rater agreement exist to aggregate individual responses to the facility level. If tests do not justify aggregation, we will use a measure of intra-facility variability in readiness rather than a facility-level mean in our analysis. The resulting analysis will provide readiness profiles for each facility as they initiate implementation, which will complement adoption, implementation, and effectiveness data in understanding the broader impact of the intervention.</p>

Over this time, research staff will continue to abstract individual level programmatic data. We will continue to monitor the proportion of screen-positive women who complete treatment. In addition, we will monitor the frequency of facility committee meetings.

Cost and impact data will be used to estimate the budget impact of SV-SAT with each treatment strategy. Our primary analyses will take the programmatic perspective, and secondary analyses will include costs incurred by patients to access services and duration of time used by providers to provide services.
