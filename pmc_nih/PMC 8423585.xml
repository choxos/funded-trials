                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Reducing red meat is a strategy to improve public health and mitigate climate change in the United States and other high-income countries. Policies requiring warnings on the front of red meat packages are a promising intervention to shift consumers towards healthier and more sustainable food choices. We aimed to explore participantsâ reactions to health and environmental warning messages about red meat.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Between June and July 2020, we recruited a national convenience sample of US red meat consumers (<italic>n</italic>â=â1,235; mean age 44 years) for an online survey. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four label conditions: no-label control, health warning, environment warning, and combined health and environment warning (both warnings shown side-by-side). Participants viewed three types of burritos (red meat [steak], chicken, and vegetarian) and selected their preferred item (primary outcome), the item they perceived to be most damaging to health, and the item they perceived to be most damaging to the environment (secondary outcomes). Participants then viewed their assigned warning on a series of other red meat products (no-label control participants were randomly re-assigned to one of the warning conditions) and rated the warnings on perceived message effectiveness, believability, negative emotions, perceived risk, attention, and learning something new. Finally, participants reported their intentions to reduce red meat consumption.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">There were no significant differences in selection of the steak burrito between label conditions or in selection of the item most damaging to the environment. Those exposed to the health warning were more likely to select the steak burrito as most damaging to health compared to those exposed to other label conditions (health 73â%, combined 64â%, environment 60â%, no-label control 63â%, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). The combined and health warnings elicited higher perceived message effectiveness ratings than the environment warning (combined mean 2.91, health 2.84, environment 2.61, <italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Warnings did not have a significant effect on item preference in the choice experiment. However, combined and health warnings performed better than the environment warning across a variety of warning label reaction measures. More research will be needed to understand whether warnings elicit behavioral change in real-world environments.</p>

This relationship is strongest for colon and rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Red meat production also contributes to climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Greenhouse gas emissions from beef production are more than 50 times that of fruit, vegetable, and grain production and more than 7 times than that of chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">On average, US adults consume 284Â g of unprocessed red meat per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], nearly three times the level recommended by experts to promote human and planetary health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Public policies offer potential to reduce red meat consumption at the population level because they impact millions of people at once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One such policy is the requirement of warnings on the front of red meat packages, a policy that has been used to reduce consumption of other harmful products. For example, the United States has long had health warnings on tobacco products, which have been effective at reducing sales and use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Canada recently required health warnings on cannabis products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Health warnings have been required for sugar-sweetened beverage advertisements in San Francisco and seven states have proposed legislation requiring health warnings on sugar-sweetened beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Internationally, since 2016, seven countries (most in Latin America) have implementedÂ or are implementing front-of-package nutrient warnings on foods and beverages high in sugar, sodium, saturated fat, or other nutrients of concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, a policy that requires warnings on the front of red meat packages is a potential option to reduce red meat consumption.</p>
              <p id="Par8">However, little is known about the effect of warnings on red meat or consumer perceptions and choices. This is particularly relevant, considering that most previous labeling efforts have focused on warning about the health effects of a product, whereas for meat, labels are motivated by concerns about both health and environmental harms. In the environmental context, most research on labeling red meat has focused on carbon labels, and several countries and private companies have voluntary carbon labeling on food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the health context, most research on health warnings has focused on sugar-sweetened beverages, with a recent meta-analysis finding that health-based warnings (e.g., âThis product contributes to obesityâ) were perceived as effective by consumers and that such warnings lowered perceptions of healthfulness, increased perceptions of disease likelihood, and decreased intentions to purchase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Other studies have shown that health warnings on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumersâ purchases of these products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Tobacco research suggests that health warnings help people quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as well as change consumer perceptions and emotions predictive of longer-term behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, there is a dearth of evidence on similar warnings on red meat. It is currently unclear whether environmental or health warnings on red meat products would be perceived as effective, alter consumersâ perceptions about the health risks of consuming red meat, or change their intentions to reduce red meat consumption, key steps on the pathway to behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">The objective of this study was to experimentally test health and environmental warnings about red meat among US red meat consumers as a first step to informing potential labeling or other communications policies related to red meat. Specifically, we compared the message effectiveness of health, environment, or combined health and environment warnings. Our primary outcome was selection of a red meat item in a choice experiment. Secondary outcomes included perceived message effectiveness, risk perception, and intentions to reduce red meat consumption.</p>

                <title>Warning development</title>
                <p id="Par12">The text of the warnings was developed based on a thorough review of the literature on health and environmental harms of red meat consumption. Warning messages were vetted for scientific accuracy and legal viability with an Expert Advisory Committee comprised of experts in nutrition, sustainability, food policy, agricultural policy, and law. A subset of health and environmental warning messages was then tested for perceived message effectiveness in an online pre-test experiment (paper under review) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We selected warnings for this study based on the results of that pre-test experiment. First, we identified warnings with the highest perceived message effectiveness ratings. Next, because not all warnings differed significantly from one another on perceived effectiveness, we also assessed the level of evidence regarding the relationship between red meat consumption and the harm, simplicity (e.g., âcarbon footprintâ is simpler than âgreenhouse gas emissionsâ), and potential political feasibility. Based on these criteria, we selected two health warnings and two environmental warnings for this study. The health warnings were: âWARNING: Eating red meat contributes to colon and rectal cancerâ and âWARNING: Eating red meat increases your risk of early death.â The environmental warnings included were: âWARNING: Eating red meat increases your carbon footprintâ and âWARNING: Eating red meat harms the environment.â We included the marker word, âWARNING,â based on a prior study suggesting this word may increase message effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par13">The design of the warnings was based on a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] that found that warnings with octagonal shape are perceived to be more effective than rectangular labels. The black octagon with white text is a commonly tested shape and color scheme in the literature on warnings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and this design is currently being used in countries that have government-mandated nutrient warnings on food products, including Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Uruguay.</p>

                <title>Product stimuli</title>
                <p id="Par14">To provide a realistic context for viewing warnings, we identified commonly consumed red meat products in the United States, using analyses of top red meat items consumed in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We also wanted to ensure there was a mix of processed and unprocessed meat products. The products included were all among the top five processed or unprocessed (respectively) red meat items in the United States: bacon, sausage, five meat pizza, cheeseburgers, ground beef, deli ham, and a beef burrito (paper under review) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The beef burrito was chosen for the choice experiment because it allowed us to include similar variations (e.g., chicken and vegetarian burritos). We identified images of these products from a US online supermarket. We removed the US branding from the products and replaced it with a UK brand label (Tesco). We used an unfamiliar brand from the United Kingdom to give products a realistic appearance while minimizing the influence of brand loyalty on reactions to the warnings. Images of all products are shown in Appendix A, Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>

Within the health condition, participants were randomized to view one of the two warnings (colon and rectal cancer or early death).

Within the combined condition, participants were randomized to one of four warning combinations, each with one health warning and one environment warning.

After selecting the product they would most like to buy, participants indicated which product was the âmost damaging to your healthâ and âthe most damaging to the environment.â</p>
                <p id="Par22">We evaluated a variety of secondary outcomes about the warning labels in the second task (viewing warnings on a series of products). For those who saw both health and environment warnings, these warnings were treated as a single label rather than two separate labels, to reflect a potential policy requiring both labels. All measures used the same 5-point response scale, ranging from âNot at allâ (coded as 1) to âA great dealâ (coded as 5).</p>
                <p id="Par23">We assessed perceived message effectiveness using four items adapted from the University of North Carolina Perceived Message Effectiveness scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which has been used effectively in previous message development studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The questions were as follows: âHow much does this label discourage you from wanting to eat red meat?â, âHow much does this label make eating red meat seem unpleasant to you?â, âHow much does this label make you concerned about the health effects of eating red meat?â, and âHow much does this label make you concerned about the environmental effects of eating red meat?â</p>
                <p id="Par24">We additionally assessed warning believability (âHow much do you believe these labels?â), negative emotions (three items, âHow much does this label make you feelâ¦ [1] anxious, [2] scared, [3] guilty?â), and attention to the label (âHow much do these labels grab your attention?â). We assessed perceptions of the health and environmental harms of red meat consumption by asking how much eating red meat every day would âincrease your risk of early death,â âcontribute to colon and rectal cancer,â âincrease your carbon footprint,â and âharm the environment.â</p>
                <p id="Par25">Next, participants were asked if they learned anything new from the warning (âDid you learn anything new from this label?â), with response options of âYesâ or âNo.â Finally, we assessed intention to reduce red meat consumption in the next 30 days (âDo you intend to reduce your red meat consumption in the next 30 days?â), on a scale of âDefinitely notâ (coded as 1) to âDefinitelyâ (coded as 5).</p>
                <p id="Par26">Within each arm (health or environment), participants were asked to select which of the two health or environment warnings was most discouraging (âWhich one of these labels most discourages you from wanting to consume red meat?â); participants in the combined condition saw in randomized order both health warnings and both environment warnings.</p>
                <p id="Par27">We collected data on participant demographics, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, education level, household income, and political affiliation.

Then, the interaction terms were included, and a likelihood ratio test was conducted to evaluate statistical significance of the interaction. We then probed for moderation between levels using chi-square tests to examine the contrasts in the difference between any warning and no warning by level of meat consum or by level of belief in human-causedÂ climate change.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par40">In this online experiment of US adults, we found that health, environment, and combined warnings about red meat did not reduce participantsâ selection of red meat as their preferred item of choice. The health warning, but not the other warnings, increased participantsâ likelihood of identifying the red meat item as the most damaging to health. Health warnings and combined health and environment warnings outperformed environment-only warnings on several consumer reactions, including perceived message effectiveness, believability, negative emotions, and perceived health harms.</p>
              <p id="Par41">It is unclear why warnings did not reduce consumersâ selection of the red meat item (steak burrito). Literature from sugar-sweetened beverages shows that both simple nutrient warnings (e.g., âhigh in sugarâ) and health warnings reduce consumersâ selection of high-sugar food and drink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. One possibility is that underlying preferences for red meat are stronger than they are for sugar-sweetened beverages. For example, in the 2015â2016 NHANES survey, 47.8â% of US adults were sugar-sweetened beverage consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], while in 2013â2016 NHANES, 73.6â% of US adults were red meat consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">In addition, it is important to consider the role of substitutes: making a choice to decline a particular product necessitates a decision to purchase an alternate product and may depend on how much consumers prefer or value the alternate option. It is possible that the substitutions for the steak burrito were less likely to be accepted by consumers than are substitutions for sugar-sweetened beverages. Substitutions for sugar-sweetened beverages are similar: substitutions are often other sweet drinks that are sweetened with something other than sugar (for example, consumers might choose between a fruit drink sweetened with sugar versus a fruit drink sweetened with non-caloric sweetener). In contrast, substitutions for the steak burrito in the current experiment were more dissimilar in taste profiles (e.g., a steakÂ burrito versus one that contains chicken or beans). Plant-based biomimicry products (e.g., Beyond Meat) may be a more acceptable substitution than an alternate animal protein or vegetarian option for consumers with high red meat preferences. In addition, the effect of warnings on red meat selection could vary across product categories (e.g., the effect of a warning could be stronger for products containing more red meat, such as a burger patty, than for products that contain less red meat as part of a mixed dish, such as a burrito). More research is needed to understand whether warnings shift consumersâ selections across product categories, and how this varies by what alternate options are available.</p>
              <p id="Par43">While the warnings did not reduce selection of the red meat item in the sample overall, we found a pattern of results that suggested that warningsâ impact on product selection was stronger among those who consumed more meat. In general, there is a dearth of evidence on whether those who consume more of a product are more or less responsive to warning labels; more research is specifically needed to understand whether more frequent meat-consumers would actually change their behavior in response to warnings. If this was the case, these results would be in line with other point-of-purchase policies, primarily sugar-sweetened beverages and nonessential food taxes, which have found that those who consume more taxed products reduce their purchases more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. If policies such as warnings have a greater impact among more frequent meat-consumers, this could yield large health and environmental benefits, given these individuals have the largest room for improvement in their dietary behaviors.</p>
              <p id="Par44">When considering consumer reactions to specific types of warnings, including perceived message effectiveness, perceived risk, and learning something new from the warning, the combined warning generally performed the best, followed by the health warning, then the environment warning, though not all differences between warnings were statistically significant. Previous nationally representative surveys have found that among meat-reducers and vegetarians, health is a more important factor than environment in reducing meat consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The findings from this study show a similar pattern among red meat consumers in which health harms may be more motivating than environmental harms. It is also possible that awareness of the environmental harms of red meat is not as widespread as awareness of the health harms of red meat. As public awareness of these harms increases, it is possible that warning messages will elicit stronger responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Combined warning messages may be a win-win in that they elicit stronger responses from the health warning while simultaneously raising awareness of red meatâs environmental harms.</p>
              <p id="Par45">On the other hand, the impact of the warnings did not vary by belief in climate change. This finding was unexpected, as we predicted that the environment warning in particular would have a larger effect among those with pre-existing beliefs in climate change, as previous surveys have found those with stronger climate change beliefs are more willing to reduce their meat consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, prior surveys have asked about willingness to reduce meat consumption generally, rather than assessing preferences in a choice experiment. It may be that people who believe in climate change are generally open to the idea of changing their meat consumption but are not yet ready to implement those behaviors. Future research integrating the Stages of Change model would be useful to understand the most effective strategies for moving meat consumers from contemplation to behavioral change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">The finding that environment warnings did not reduce selection of red meat was somewhat surprising given previous literature showing that other environment-related labels in real-world food environments reduced purchases of less sustainable products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and decreased purchases of meat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These differences could be due to differences in label type (e.g., warnings vs. a carbon-label footprint) or in population, as most previous studies have been conducted in Europe, where populations may be more receptive to environmental messaging. Interestingly, the Vanclay et al. study, which tested carbon footprint labels that were color-coded to signal low (green), medium (yellow), and high (black) carbon emissions found a bigger reduction in black-to-green purchases when green-labeled products were the cheapest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], suggesting that combing labeling with pricing strategies may increase labelsâ impact. Future research on reducing meat consumption should consider combining pricing policies (taxes or subsidies) to understand how these policies might interact in the US context.</p>
              <p id="Par47">It is also worth noting that, within environment warnings, the majority of participants selected the warning about harming the environment as more discouraging than the carbon footprint warning. If the carbon footprint warning was indeed less effective, this could have dampened the overall effect of environment-related warnings on product selection. Similarly, of those who viewed the health warning, the majority selected the warning about colon and rectal cancer as more discouraging than the warning about death. This suggests that the specific warning topic could influence warningsâ impact on behavior, and merits more research into understanding which topics will resonate most with consumers.</p>
              <p id="Par48">The most important limitation of this study was that it was a one-time online experiment with a limited number of products. Our findings may not translate directly to real-world settings where individuals are exposed to warning labels on many different products, can pick products up to examine them, and see warnings repeatedly over time. Although we assessed whether the labels grabbed participantsâ attention, we did not explicitly assess whether participants noticed the warning or the length of time spent viewing each image. These data should be collected in future studies. While this study is best suited to provide future researchers with data on how to design effective warnings, it does provide some insights into what might be expected in the real-world, especially considering that online grocery purchases have more than doubled in the past year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">An additional limitation is that the lack of differences between study conditions may have been due to insufficient power to detect small reductions in selection likelihood, rather than a true lack of effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par50">Strengths of the study include the large sample that approximated the US population in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, income, and age. Another major strength was the experimental design; by randomizing participants, we minimized the effect of potential confounders. We also assessed a range of outcomes using measures with strong psychometric properties to capture different aspects of consumer reactions to warnings.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par51">A growing body of work is focused on policies and interventions to reduce red meat intake as a strategy to reduce chronic disease and mitigate climate change. This study did not find a significant effect of health or environment warnings on consumer preference for a red meat item (steak burrito) in a choice experiment, though effects were in the expected direction. When comparing warning types, the combined health and environment warnings and health-only warnings performed better than the environment-only warning across most consumer reactions, including perceived message effectiveness. Future research should evaluate the impact of warnings in realistic settings and on actual consumer behaviors, as well as evaluate a broader range of potential health and environmental harms to highlight in communication campaigns.</p>
