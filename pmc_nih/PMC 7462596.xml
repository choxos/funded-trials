                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) can decrease the risk of opioid overdose (OOD) in individuals with opioid use disorder. Peer recovery support services (PRSS) are increasingly used to promote MOUD engagement but evidence of their efficacy is limited. This study’s objective was to evaluate a single 20-minute telephone-delivered PRSS intervention for increasing MOUD enrollment and decreasing recurring OODs.</p>

                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>This single-site, randomized controlled pilot trial enrolled adults, primarily recruited from a syringe service program, with an opioid-positive urine drug screen (UDS) reporting having been treated for an OOD within the past 6 months. Participants (N = 80) were randomized to PRSS (n = 40) or Control (n = 40) condition with all participants receiving personally-tailored OOD education and naloxone. Outcome measures obtained at 3 (n = 66), 6 (n = 58), and 12 (n = 44) months post-randomization included verified MOUD enrollment (primary), self-reported OOD, and opioid use assessed by self-report and UDS.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Through 12-month follow-up, 32.5 % of PRSS, compared to 17.5 % of Control participants enrolled in MOUD (X<sup>2</sup> = 2.4, p = 0.12; odds ratio = 2.27 (0.79–6.49)). PRSS participants were significantly less likely to have experienced an OOD through 12-month follow-up (12.5 % of PRSS participants, 32.5 % of Control, p = 0.03). No significant treatment effect was found for opioid use through 12-month follow-up as measured by either opioid-positive UDSs or self-reported past month opioid use days. Based on self-report, PRSS had good acceptability for both the interventionists and participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0030">In recent years, the U.S. has experienced a growing opioid-use epidemic accompanied by a dramatic rise in opioid overdoses (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Scholl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Straus et al., 2013</xref>). Research suggests that opioid overdose prevention education and naloxone distribution can reduce the rate of opioid overdose fatalities (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Naumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Walley et al., 2013</xref>). However, the only effective method for preventing opioid overdose is successful treatment of the underlying opioid use disorder (OUD). Receiving medication for OUD (MOUD; e.g., methadone- or buprenorphine-maintenance) significantly reduces the likelihood of opioid overdose (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Larochelle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Sordo et al., 2017</xref>). MOUD enrollment is particularly important for individuals at heightened risk for opioid overdose, including those who have survived an overdose (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Weiner et al., 2020</xref>) but MOUD is widely underutilized (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Volkow and Wargo, 2018</xref>). In addition to the barriers of waiting lists and the costs of MOUD, inaccurate perceptions of MOUD – including myths about its side effects and lack of efficacy – also prevent some individuals with OUD from entering treatment (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Uebelacker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Zaller et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
              <p id="par0035">To help address the opioid overdose crisis while also combatting negative perceptions of MOUD, our team created a personally-tailored opioid overdose prevention education and naloxone distribution (PTOEND) intervention. The PTOEND intervention provides information about the individual’s personal risk factors for opioid overdose as well as education about overdose and MOUD. Our team also created a single-session Peer Recovery Support Service (PRSS) telephone intervention to encourage MOUD enrollment. The use of PRSSs to engage individuals in MOUD and other recovery services has increased dramatically in recent years but the evidence that these services are effective is limited (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Eddie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">McGuire et al., 2020</xref>). The present study evaluated the PRSS intervention, relative to the control condition of PTOEND without PRSS. We hypothesized that, over the 12-month follow-up period, the PRSS would increase MOUD enrollment (primary outcome measure) and decrease recurring opioid overdose and illicit opioid use (secondary outcome measures) in individuals with a prior overdose receiving PTOEND.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p id="par0040">This pilot study was a randomized controlled intent-to-treat (ITT) clinical trial. Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the PRSS or Control condition. The randomization sequence was created by the project statistician (D.L.), using a randomized block design (blocks of size 2 or 4); the randomization sequence was unknown to the research staff performing the study procedures. All participants were scheduled to complete a follow-up phone call approximately 3-weeks post-randomization, and in-person visits at approximately 3, 6, and 12months following enrollment. Study assessments were administered by an RA who was not blinded to the participant’s study arm.</p>
                <p id="par0045">A pilot study necessitates a limited sample size, and is more useful for showing feasibility than providing an effect size estimate. The proportion of patients who would enroll in MOUD (primary outcome) was unknown for both the PRSS and control group. We based the estimated proportions for the a-priori power analysis on a randomized trial comparing buprenorphine administration during medical hospitalization and linkage to office-based buprenorphine post-discharge to buprenorphine detoxification (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Liebschutz et al., 2014</xref>). In that study, the linkage patients were more likely to enter office-based buprenorphine treatment (72.2 %) compared to the detox group (11.9 %). The linkage condition was much more intensive than PRSS and, thus, it was expected that the PRSS enrollment rate would be considerably less than that observed for the linkage group. Assuming that 12 % of the Control group enrolled in MOUD, and a total sample size of 80 yielded 80 % power using a two-tailed test and α = .05 to detect a PRSS effect for a MOUD enrollment rate of ≥ 39 % with no missing data. Power to detect a significant effect would diminish accordingly with the level of missing data.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="par0050">Potential participants were recruited through various methods including advertisements, flyers, and word-of-mouth in Cincinnati, Ohio. All participants were given a thorough explanation of the study and signed an informed consent form that was approved by the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board. Eligible participants were at least 18 years of age and reported being treated for an opioid overdose within the past 6 months. To be eligible, participants were required to have an opioid-positive urine drug screen (UDS), score as “high risk” for heroin and/or non-medical use of prescription opioids on the NIDA modified ASSIST (i.e., ≥ 27), be willing to have their intervention audio recorded and rated if randomized to the PRSS arm, and have access to a phone. Participants were excluded from the study if they self-reported being currently engaged in substance use disorder treatment or unlikely to complete the study (e.g., probable incarceration, residence &gt; 40 miles from site, unable to provide reliable locators). Study data were collected from January 2018 through July 2019.</p>

                <title>PRSS interventionists</title>
                <p id="par0055">Eligible PRSS Interventionists were at least 18 years of age, able to provide informed consent in English, enrolled in a MOUD program for at least one year, currently enrolled in treatment at a University of Cincinnati (UC)-affiliated MOUD program, reported being abstinent from illicit opioids for at least one year, and had experienced, witnessed, and/or lost a family member or friend to an overdose. Potential PRSS Interventionists were excluded if: 1) they were unwilling to sign a release of information to allow research staff to confirm pertinent eligibility criteria and to monitor clinical status with UC-MOUD staff; 2) treatment program staff had significant clinical concerns about their participation; 3) they were unwilling to have their sessions audio recorded and assessed by an intervention trainer; or 4) they had specific plans to leave the UC-MOUD program within the next 6 months. All PRSS Interventionists successfully completed intervention training. At the end of their participation, the PRSS Interventionists were asked to rate their satisfaction with being an Interventionist on a 5-point Likert scale (1=Very Dissatisfied to 5=Very Satisfied).</p>

                  <p id="par0060">All randomized participants received a Narcan® Nasal Spray kit and PTOEND which included an information packet with three reports that a research assistant (RA) reviewed with the participant. The reports were generated from the participant’s responses to two surveys: the Personal Opioid-Overdose Risk Survey (PORS) and the Opioid Overdose and Treatment Awareness Survey (OOTAS); detailed information about the reports and surveys are published elsewhere (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Winhusen et al., 2016</xref>). The “Personal Overdose Risk Factors Report” was generated from the participant’s responses to the PORS, which assesses an individual’s opioid overdose risk factors. The PORS only includes risk factors for which there is documented evidence and scoring for each item is based on the strength of the evidence that the factor increases risk (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Winhusen et al., 2016</xref>). The “Opioid Overdose Information Report” and the “Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) Report” were generated from the OOTAS, which assesses knowledge about opioid overdose and MOUD. The OOTAS is comprised of four sections: 1) opioid overdose risk factors; 2) signs of an opioid overdose; 3) how to respond to an opioid overdose; and 4) myths about MOUD (<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Winhusen et al., 2016</xref>). The first three sections include only evidence-based items supported by a literature review, while items for the fourth section were based on both a literature review and on input from the medical staff of the UC-affiliated methadone program. The reports generated from the OOTAS provide feedback on the questions answered incorrectly by the participant to provide targeted knowledge enhancement, including the correction of myths about MOUD. All participants also received information about local MOUD providers and standard information about overdose and MOUD including 1) SAMHSA’s “Opioid Overdose Prevention Toolkit: Safety Advice for Patients and Family Members”(<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016b</xref>) and “Recovering from Opioid Overdose” (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016a</xref>) (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2011</xref>); and 2) SAMHSA’s “Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction: Facts for Families and Friends”.</p>

                    <p id="par0065">The participants randomized to the PRSS arm received the 20-minute telephone intervention in addition to PTOEND. The PRSS Interventionist was provided with the results of the participant’s three PTOEND reports so that the Interventionist could answer participant questions during the call. The primary goal of the call was to encourage the participant to enroll in MOUD; however, PRSS Interventionists were reminded that it was important to be accepting and supportive if the participant was not currently interested in MOUD. The call was unscripted but the PRSS Interventionists were provided with guidelines during the initial training and certification process as well as through ongoing monitoring of the recorded phone conversations. PRSS Interventionists were provided with study cell phones for use in delivering the intervention and for staying in contact with research staff regarding scheduled and completed interventions.</p>

                    <p id="par0075">During the study, PRSS Interventionist adherence and competence were rated on 6 dimensions: 1) Ability to provide information while maintaining a conversational tone; 2) Ability to successfully complete the intervention within 20 min; 3) Ability to listen; 4) Sufficient familiarity with correct information about opioid overdose and MOUD to answer the participant’s questions; 5) Ability to remain non-judgmental and encouraging; and 6) Ability to avoid confrontation. Each dimension was rated as 1 – Meets Expectation, 2 – Needs Improvement, or 3 – Expectations Not Met/Additional Training Required. If PRSS Interventionists scored below 1 on more than 1 dimension for a given intervention, they were required to receive additional individualized training. Prior to the start of the randomized trial, two trainers rated training tapes to determine their inter-rater reliability via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Hallgren, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Shrout and Fleiss, 1979</xref>). The ICC of the two raters was 0.89, with an ICC of 0.75–1.0 reflecting excellent agreement (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Hallgren, 2012</xref>). With the exception of 4 sessions that were not audiotaped due to difficulties with the recording equipment, all PRSS calls were rated by one of the trainers for which inter-rater reliability was established. There were no instances in which a PRSS Interventionist scored less than 1 on more than 1 dimension and, thus, no additional training was required during the study.</p>

PRSS interventionists were provided a basic flip-style phone with a pre-paid year’s supply of activation and minutes, costing approximately $130 each. An external digital voice recorder with telephone pickup microphone cost an additional $82 each. Printed materials, including the 34-page training manual and additional administrative forms, cost less than $1 per PRSS interventionist. PRSS Interventionists were compensated $40 for completing training/certification and $20 for each participant for whom they provided the intervention.</p>

                <title>Participant measures</title>
                <p id="par0095">The a-priori primary outcome measure was enrollment in MOUD (Yes/No) within the 12-month follow-up period. A release of information was obtained for participants reporting entry into MOUD to allow verification of treatment entry. The a-priori secondary outcome measures were experiencing an opioid overdose (Yes/No) within the 12-month follow-up and change in opioid use, as measured by the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) procedure and urine drug screens (UDS), between baseline and 12-month follow-up. Consistent with other research (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Connery et al., 2019</xref>), an opioid overdose was defined as a self-report of an overdose in which the participant was not able to respond to others or breathe adequately, resulting in Narcan/naloxone rescue and/or emergency medical care. Urine samples were collected using temperature monitoring and the validity of urine samples was checked with the use of a commercially available adulterant test. Urine samples were tested for the following opioids: buprenorphine, fentanyl, opiates, methadone, and oxycodone; a positive buprenorphine/ methadone result was not scored as illicit opioid use for individuals with verified MOUD enrollment. Self-report of past month opioid use was assessed using the Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) method (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Fals-Stewart et al., 2000</xref>), which is a widely employed and well-validated method. The MOUD enrollment, opioid overdose, and opioid use outcome measures were collected at each research visit.</p>
                <p id="par0100">The acceptability of the intervention was assessed during the telephone visit 3 weeks post-randomization. The assessment used, the Helpfulness of Peer Intervention (HOPI), was created by the authors to assess the degree to which the intervention was seen as personally relevant and credible. The HOPI was created after a review of the literature revealed no existing measure; given that peers have similar life experiences to the participants and are generally viewed to be credible (<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Solomon, 2004</xref>) it was predicted that the PRSS participants would rate the intervention highly on both relevance and credibility. The HOPI is a 12-item assessment in which each statement is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree). The HOPI has “face validity” but has not otherwise undergone validity or reliability testing.</p>

                <p id="par0105">All analyses were completed on the intention-to-treat sample using SAS (SAS Institute, Inc.). For MOUD enrollment and opioid overdose, status at a missed visit was assumed to be no MOUD entry / no overdose. However, MOUD enrollment and opioid overdose measures were cumulative over the entire time period and, thus, participants were scored as enrolled in MOUD / having had an opioid overdose within the 12-month follow-up period if they met criteria at any of the completed visits (i.e., the 12-month values also included any MOUD enrollment or overdose previously reported at Month 3 or 6). Statistical tests were conducted at a 5 % Type I error rate (two-sided) for all measures. Odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were computed where appropriate. Pearson's chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and Cochran-Armitage tests were used for categorical data, depending on the nature of the data. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Student's t-tests were used for numeric data, depending on which test's assumptions were more appropriate.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0145">There has been a dramatic increase in the use of PRSS to provide opioid overdose education and promote MOUD engagement, due in part to the increasing availability of reimbursement for these services (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">McGuire et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, 2019</xref>) but their efficacy has not been established in the research literature. The present randomized pilot trial found that a significantly lower proportion of participants with a prior opioid overdose who received a single 20-min telephone-delivered PRSS, relative to Control, experienced another overdose by 12-month follow-up. Participants receiving the PRSS intervention also doubled their rate of verified MOUD entry by 12-month follow-up, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant treatment effect observed for illicit opioid use, which is perhaps not surprising since the goal of the present PRSS was to encourage enrollment in MOUD and illicit opioid use was not directly addressed. Peer interventionist and PRSS participant ratings suggest that the intervention had good acceptability.</p>
              <p id="par0150">The results from the present study suggest that brief PRSS interventions may be efficacious for reducing recurring opioid overdoses and may also have promise for encouraging MOUD enrollment. The PRSS evaluated in the present trial was a single 20-minute telephone-delivered intervention, which is much less intensive than many of the PRSS interventions being developed and evaluated (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Eddie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">McGuire et al., 2020</xref>). When the present PRSS intervention was initially being developed in 2014, PRSSs were not being utilized as widely and were not as well reimbursed and, hence the goal was to develop an intervention that was of sufficiently low cost to be sustainable regardless of insurance reimbursement. The present study found that the Peer Interventionists were able to be trained and certified within 4 h, were satisfied with their roles as Interventionists, and the intervention was successfully implemented with relatively low cost. In the current era of COVID-19, it is notable that this intervention was designed to be implemented by phone, thus eliminating the need for in-person contact.</p>
              <p id="par0155">The finding of a significant reduction in opioid overdose and a clinically meaningful, albeit not statistically significant, impact on MOUD enrollment suggests that this low cost, easy to train and deliver intervention is promising and may be worthy of further development to strengthen the treatment effect. For both MOUD entry and overdose, the PRSS intervention reached its maximum impact by 6-month follow-up and retention was still adequate at 6 months, with 72 % of the sample completing the 6-month visit. Therefore, the impact of the intervention might be amplified, for example, by including a booster call at the 6-month follow-up. The booster phone call could be designed to encourage those who have not entered treatment to do so and to provide encouragement for those enrolled in MOUD to stay in treatment.</p>
              <p id="par0160">The results from the present pilot trial should be considered in light of several limitations. First, the sample sizes were relatively small, with 40 per group, and the study was conducted at a single site, thus the degree to which the findings are generalizable is unclear. Second, while our definition of opioid overdose is consistent with the definition used in other research (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Connery et al., 2019</xref>), it is still a self-report measure and, thus open to response biases. Third, because all participants in the present trial received PTOEND we do not know whether the PRSS intervention would have a similar impact in the absence of PTOEND. Finally, it is important to note the relatively low level of study visit attendance at Month 12 (55 %). This level of missing data likely leads to underestimation of both MOUD enrollment and opioid overdose for the full 12-month study period, but attendance rates were not substantially different between the two randomized treatment arms. The a-priori power analysis suggested sufficient power (i.e., 80 %) to detect a significant difference in MOUD enrollment with 80 participants assuming 12 % of Control and ≥39 % of PRSS participants enrolled in MOUD with power decreasing as missing data increased; thus, the failure to detect a significant treatment effect for MOUD enrollment was likely due to MOUD entry being higher in the Control (17.5 %) and lower in PRSS (32.5 %) groups than anticipated exacerbated by the 45 % missing data at Month 12. A sensitivity analysis using varying assumptions about missing data would be under-powered in this small pilot trial, which was designed only to assess whether the treatment has sufficient promise to warrant further investigation. Future trials of the intervention will be powered to more definitively demonstrate a treatment effect, and the inferences from such a trial will be subject to greater examination of sensitivity to missing data assumptions. Given that 23 % of missing data were due to participants being incarcerated, future research might mitigate missing data by securing data collection from incarcerated participants.</p>
              <p id="par0165">The present trial also had several strengths. In a recent review of the PRSS research literature, Eddie and colleagues (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Eddie et al., 2019</xref>) outlined a number of methodological limitations of the existing PRSS research including: 1) limited use of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) design; 2) lack of information about peer training protocols; and 3) inability to isolate the effect of PRSS due to studies which combined PRSS with clinician-administered interventions. The present study addressed these limitations by utilizing a RCT design, utilizing a comprehensive training package, and evaluating the PRSS intervention without an additional clinician-delivered intervention. The independent verification of MOUD entry is another study strength.</p>
              <p id="par0170">In conclusion, the results from this randomized pilot trial suggest that a brief, telephone-delivered PRSS intervention has promise for increasing MOUD enrollment and decreasing recurring opioid overdoses in individuals surviving an opioid overdose. Further development and testing of this PRSS intervention, particularly in light of the current U.S. opioid epidemic, seems warranted.</p>
