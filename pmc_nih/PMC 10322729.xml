                  <p>The drug–drug interaction between rifampicin and dolutegravir can be overcome by supplemental dolutegravir dosing, which is difficult to implement in high-burden settings.

                  <p>RADIANT-TB was a phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, non-comparative, placebo-controlled trial at a single site in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa. Participants were older than 18 years of age, with plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 1000 copies per mL, CD4 count greater than 100 cells per μL, ART-naive or first-line ART interrupted, and on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy for less than 3 months. By use of permuted block (block size of 6) randomisation, participants were assigned (1:1) to receive either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir plus supplemental 50 mg dolutegravir 12 h later or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine, and dolutegravir plus matched placebo 12 h later. Participants received standard antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per mL) at week 24 analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population.

                  <p>Between Nov 28, 2019, and July 23, 2021, 108 participants (38 female, median age 35 years [IQR 31–40]) were randomly assigned to supplemental dolutegravir (n=53) or placebo (n=55). Median baseline CD4 count was 188 cells per μL (IQR 145–316) and median HIV-1 RNA was 5·2 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL (4·6–5·7). At week 24, 43 (83%, 95% CI 70–92) of 52 participants in the supplemental dolutegravir arm and 44 (83%, 95% CI 70–92) of 53 participants in the placebo arm had virological suppression. No treatment-emergent dolutegravir resistance mutations were detected up to week 48 in the 19 participants with study-defined virological failure. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were similarly distributed between the study arms. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 adverse events were weight loss (4/108 [4%]), insomnia (3/108 [3%]), and pneumonia (3/108 [3%]).</p>

              <p id="para10">WHO's preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen for adults and adolescents with HIV is the second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor dolutegravir, combined with tenofovir and lamivudine or emtricitabine.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> A disadvantage of dolutegravir is substantial drug–drug interaction with rifampicin,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> which is important as tuberculosis is the most common cause of hospitalisation and mortality among people living with HIV.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A previous study of healthy volunteers showed that increasing the dose of dolutegravir from 50 mg daily to 50 mg every 12 h can overcome the effect of rifampicin induction of genes important in the metabolism and transport of dolutegravir.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Twice-daily dolutegravir was effective and well tolerated in a non-comparative, active control, randomised trial in people with HIV with tuberculosis.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Implementing an additional dose of dolutegravir with antituberculosis therapy is challenging in high-burden settings, illustrated by the finding of a Botswanan study in which standard-dose dolutegravir was used in almost half of patients on dolutegravir-based ART during antituberculosis therapy, despite national guidelines recommending double-dose dolutegravir.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In high-burden settings, HIV and tuberculosis are often managed in separate clinics and clinic staff might not be aware that patients are being treated for both diseases. Furthermore, dolutegravir-based combination ART is dispensed as fixed-dose combination tablets, which increases the risk of dolutegravir single-tablet stockouts. There is some evidence that standard-dose dolutegravir with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy might be effective. A phase 2b dose-ranging study among treatment-naive people living with HIV reported similar high rates of virological suppression with all the tested doses of dolutegravir (10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Additionally, dolutegravir shows avidity to the integrase receptor with a dissociative half-life of 71 h,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> which might mitigate against the emergence of resistance with transient low dolutegravir trough concentrations. Furthermore, the median dolutegravir trough concentration when dosed at 50 mg daily with rifampicin was reduced by 85% but was still 2·4 times above the protein-adjusted inhibitory concentration (PA-IC<sub>90</sub>) in a study of healthy volunteers.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Finally, standard-dose dolutegravir treatment resulted in similar rates of virological suppression as twice-daily dolutegravir treatment in a large retrospective cohort study.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>

                  <p id="para50">We searched PubMed for clinical studies on the dosing of dolutegravir with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy published between Jan 1, 2010, and Oct 10, 2022, using the search terms (“tuberculosis” AND “dolutegravir” AND “HIV”) with no language restrictions. Our search yielded one non-comparative randomised trial and one retrospective observational cohort study. INSPIRING was a non-comparative, active control, randomised, open-label study among people living with HIV who were naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 counts of at least 50 cells per μL. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either dolutegravir-based or efavirenz-based ART. Dolutegravir was dosed at 50 mg twice daily during and for 2 weeks after antituberculosis therapy. Week 48 virological suppression (HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per mL) in INSPIRING was reported in 75% (52/69) of participants in the supplemental dolutegravir group and 82% (36/44) of participants in the efavirenz group. These results support the hypothesis that twice-daily dolutegravir is effective for people with HIV who are on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy. Twice-daily dolutegravir was well tolerated. Although INSPIRING generated high-quality evidence, the study was not powered for between-arm comparisons. A retrospective observational cohort study in Botswana reported on the viral load suppression rates achieved with dolutegravir-based ART in people with HIV who were co-infected with tuberculosis under programmatic conditions. A high proportion of patients (322 [44%] of 739) received once-daily dolutegravir instead of the twice-daily dosing recommended in their national guidelines, which indicates the difficulty of implementing supplemental dolutegravir dosing in a high-burden setting. Virological suppression, which was determined while participants were on antituberculosis therapy, was reported in 204 (95%) of 214 individuals in the once-daily dosing group and in 241 (95%) of 254 individuals in the twice-daily dosing group. The risk of bias is high in retrospective cohort studies but the relatively large sample size and the almost identical viral suppression rates in the two dolutegravir dosing groups suggest that supplemental dolutegravir dosing might be unnecessary for people with HIV on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy.</p>

                  <p id="para70">To our knowledge, RADIANT-TB is the first randomised trial to assess the need for twice-daily dosing with dolutegravir when co-administered with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy. We found similar rates of virological suppression in both dolutegravir dosing arms. None of the participants who had study-defined virological failure developed treatment-emergent integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance and no major safety issues were reported in either arm. Our findings suggest that twice-daily dolutegravir dosing with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy might be unnecessary, but we did not have the power to compare outcomes by study arm.</p>

National regulatory and ethical approval (Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cape Town) were obtained before commencing the study. The detailed study protocol plan has been published online.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para120">Patients were referred to the study from three primary care clinics in Khayelitsha. Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, seropositivity for HIV-1, plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 1000 copies per mL, CD4 count greater than 200 cells per μL (subsequently changed to more than 100 cells per μL), ART naivety or first-line ART interruption (with ART duration &lt;6 months or HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per mL &lt;6 months before interruption), and being on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy for less than 3 months. Women of childbearing potential were placed on appropriate contraceptives for the duration of the study. Among the exclusion criteria were alanine aminotransferase more than three times the upper limit of normal, allergy or intolerance to one of the drugs in the regimen, and an active psychiatric condition or substance abuse judged likely to affect adherence. All participants gave written informed consent (in English or isiXhosa) before enrolment. Sex was self-reported, selecting either a male or female option.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">Participants received standard antituberculosis therapy (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol [oral daily weight-based method] for the first 2 months followed by rifampicin and isoniazid [oral daily weight-based method] for the subsequent 4 months) provided by the local tuberculosis programme. The duration of maintenance therapy was extended if necessary (skeletal or CNS tuberculosis, poor resolution of tuberculosis symptoms, poor adherence, or delayed sputum smear conversion) by local tuberculosis clinics. ART was initiated 8–12 weeks after initiation of antituberculosis therapy, except for a 5-month period during the early COVID-19 pandemic, when national treatment guidelines recommended ART initiation within 2 weeks of starting antituberculosis therapy, regardless of CD4 count. Participants were instructed to take the single oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg daily, oral lamivudine 300 mg daily, and oral dolutegravir 50 mg daily tablets with food in the morning and the 50 mg dolutegravir or matching placebo orally with food 12 h later. The supplemental dolutegravir or placebo was continued for 2 weeks after antituberculosis therapy was stopped. Dolutegravir 50 mg (Myltega) and matching placebo were donated by Mylan Pharmaceuticals (Canonsburg, PA, USA). Participants were asked to return all unused study medication for collection and counting by study staff. Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy was supplied by the local tuberculosis programme (trimethoprim [160 mg] and sulfamethoxazole [800 mg] daily, taken orally).</p>
                <p id="para160">Tuberculosis diagnoses were made by local tuberculosis clinics and classified as microbiological or histological (acid-fast bacilli on sputum, Xpert MTB/RIF [Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA] or positive culture from any site, or histological diagnosis) or clinical or radiological (or both). Tuberculosis was classified as either pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or disseminated.</p>
                <p id="para170">Screening procedures were HIV-1 RNA testing, CD4 cell count (if no result &lt;3 months old available), safety laboratory testing, and clinical assessment. Plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was determined with the Abbott Alinity M HIV-1 test (Abbott, Abbott Park, Green Oaks, IL, USA; lower limit of detection 20 copies per mL). If the screening CD4 count was between 50 cells per μL and 99 cells per μL the test was repeated when ART was planned to start to reassess eligibility. Woman of childbearing potential had a urinary pregnancy test.</p>
                <p id="para180">Participants were enrolled within 8 weeks of the screening visit. Follow-up visits occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48. Safety laboratory tests and plasma HIV-1 RNA were done at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48. CD4 counts were repeated at weeks 24 and 48. Plasma for dolutegravir trough concentrations and dried blood spots for tenofovir diphosphate were taken at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48.

                <p id="para190">Participants with unsuppressed HIV-1 RNA (≥50 copies per mL) received adherence counselling and repeat HIV-1 RNA sampling every 4 weeks until suppression or study-defined virological failure (defined as HIV-1 RNA &gt;1000 copies per mL at week 24 or if HIV-1 RNA was &lt;50 copies per mL and then rebounded to &gt;1000 copies per mL at any timepoint). Genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing was done on participants with study-defined virological failure (Applied Biosystems HIV-1 Genotyping kit; ThermoFisher Scientific, Applied Biosystems; Waltham, MA, USA). Resistance was defined as potential low-level, intermediate-level, or high-level resistance according to the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. We also did genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing on stored baseline samples if integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance was detected.</p>

We removed two PTSD-related questions from the MMS for analysis purposes, as these events could have been present before enrolment. The MMS questionnaire was done at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, and 48. The ISI is a cumulative score of 28 insomnia-related questions. A score of 0−7 is classified as no clinically significant insomnia, 8−14 as subthreshold insomnia, 15−21 as moderate clinical insomnia, and 22−28 as severe clinical insomnia. The ISI questionnaire was done at baseline, at 4-weekly intervals until week 24, and at week 48.</p>

The per-protocol analysis included the same exclusions as modified intention to treat, but also excluded any participants lost to follow-up, missing an HIV-1 RNA measurement in the study visit window (±16 days around a visit date), and participants switched from dolutegravir for reasons other than failure of the regimen. The proportions of participants with virological suppression were determined with 95% CI. Between-group differences for secondary endpoints, where relevant, were analysed by use of χ<sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher's exact test if the number in any cell was ≤5 or McNemar's test for paired observations) for categorical data and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous data.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para390">In participants receiving treatment for both tuberculosis and HIV, we found acceptable virological suppression in the placebo arm and the supplemental dolutegravir arm at week 24. No participants developed treatment-emergent resistance mutations to integrase strand transfer inhibitors by week 48. Dolutegravir was generally well tolerated in both arms. Our findings suggest that supplemental dolutegravir dosing might not be necessary in patients on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy.</p>
              <p id="para400">Virological suppression decreased from week 24 to week 48, which was probably a result of reduced adherence (supported by a higher proportion of participants with low tenofovir diphosphate). At week 24 participants were issued a 6-month supply of ART without follow-up visits between weeks 24 and 48 as per local guidelines, to reduce clinic burden during the COVID-19 epidemic, which could have accounted for reduced adherence.</p>
              <p id="para410">Our finding that standard-dose dolutegravir is as effective as double-dose dolutegravir in people living with HIV on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy is consistent with findings of two other studies. A small trial in Thailand, which randomly assigned people with HIV with tuberculosis to dolutegravir once daily or twice daily, reported virological suppression in 18 of 20 patients in both groups.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> A retrospective cohort study in Botswana reported virological suppression during tuberculosis therapy in 204 (95%) of 214 patients on standard dolutegravir dosing and 241 (95%) of 254 patients who received supplemental dolutegravir dosing.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para420">A key question is whether a phase 3 trial is necessary to confirm our findings. The probable delay in policy change that running a phase 3 trial would entail is illustrated by the experience of researchers exploring different dosing strategies for the first-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir in people with HIV on rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy. Plasma concentrations of raltegravir are substantially reduced by rifampicin and double dosing is recommended.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In a phase 2 non-comparative randomised trial (ANRS 12 180 Reflate TB) at week 24, virological suppression was achieved in 39 patients (76% [95% CI 65–88]) of 51 in the raltegravir 400 mg group, 40 patients (78% [67–90]) in the raltegravir 800 mg group, and 32 patients (63% [49–76]) in the efavirenz group.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The same investigator group did a phase 3 non-inferiority, randomised trial (ANRS 12300 Reflate TB 2) comparing raltegravir standard dose with efavirenz in participants with tuberculosis.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Virological suppression was similar in both arms at week 24 but at week 48, the primary endpoint was reached in 140 (61%) of 230 participants in the raltegravir group and 150 (66%) of 227 patients in the efavirenz arm; raltegravir did not meet the non-inferiority criterion.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> The phase 3 raltegravir study was published 7 years after the phase 2 study.</p>
              <p id="para430">None of our participants with study-defined virological failure developed treatment-emergent resistance mutations to dolutegravir. Our findings are in keeping with the INSPIRING study, in which no acquired resistance mutations occurred in the dolutegravir arm.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> By contrast, 12 (38%) of 32 participants with protocol-defined virological failure in ANRS 12300 Reflate TB 2 developed resistance to raltegravir.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> These findings reflect that dolutegravir has a higher genetic barrier to resistance than does raltegravir.</p>
              <p id="para440">In our study, solicited and self-reported insomnia events occurred earlier and more frequently in the supplemental dolutegravir arm than in the placebo arm, but these differences were not statistically significant. Dolutegravir treatment is associated with an increased risk of insomnia<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and the higher early incidence of insomnia we observed in the supplemental dolutegravir arm could result from higher dolutegravir exposure. However, findings of an association between increasing dolutegravir exposure and worsening sleep quality have been contradictory.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
              <p id="para450">Our study has limitations. First, the study was not powered to make efficacy comparisons between arms. Second, our findings might not be generalisable to people on dolutegravir-based second-line ART or to people with CD4 counts below 100 cells per μL. Third, we only enrolled participants who were ART-naive or had interrupted first-line ART without virological failure. Our findings might not be generalisable to people with dolutegravir in second-line ART. Fourth, we did not detect treatment-emergent dolutegravir resistance in the placebo arm, but larger sample sizes will be needed to determine the risk of resistance. Fifth, more participants in the placebo arm had dolutegravir trough concentrations below the lower limit of quantitation at weeks 4 and 24. However, as we did not observe the previous dose, we cannot be sure that the plasma sample was taken in the specified time window. Sixth, our study was done at a clinical research trial site; virological outcomes might be worse in real-world settings.</p>
              <p id="para460">In conclusion, we found similar rates of virological suppression in the supplemental dolutegravir and placebo arms when prescribed with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy, and there were no treatment-emergent integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance mutations among participants with study-defined virological failure. Our findings suggest that twice-daily dolutegravir dosing might be unnecessary in people with HIV-associated tuberculosis. More evidence, from cohort studies or possibly a phase 3 trial, might be necessary to change policy on the need for a supplemental dolutegravir dose with rifampicin-based antituberculosis therapy.</p>
