                <p id="Par1">Mesothelioma is a rare and fatal cancer with limited therapeutic options until the recent approval of combination immune checkpoint blockade. Here we report the results of the phase 2 PrE0505 trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02899195">NCT02899195</ext-link>) of the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy for 55 patients with previously untreated, unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The primary endpoint was overall survival compared to historical control with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy; secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety, progression-free survival and biomarkers of response. The combination of durvalumab with chemotherapy met the pre-specified primary endpoint, reaching a median survival of 20.4 months versus 12.1 months with historical control. Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent with known side effects of chemotherapy, and all adverse events due to immunotherapy were grade 2 or lower. Integrated genomic and immune cell repertoire analyses revealed that a higher immunogenic mutation burden coupled with a more diverse T cell repertoire was linked to favorable clinical outcome. Structural genome-wide analyses showed a higher degree of genomic instability in responding tumors of epithelioid histology. Patients with germline alterations in cancer predisposing genes, especially those involved in DNA repair, were more likely to achieve long-term survival. Our findings indicate that concurrent durvalumab with platinum-based chemotherapy has promising clinical activity and that responses are driven by the complex genomic background of malignant pleural mesothelioma.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) affects more than 30,000 people worldwide each year and is fatal in nearly all cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Exposure to asbestos and consequent chronic inflammation in the pleural cavity is responsible for most cases, with a typical disease latency of 30–40 years, especially in the context of co-occurring defects in DNA damage repair and germline cancer predisposition syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. For over 15 years, cisplatin and pemetrexed combination chemotherapy was the only approved systemic therapy; this approval was based on a phase 3 study that showed an improvement in survival from 9.3 months with cisplatin alone to 12.1 months with the combination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. With the exception of bevacizumab (which has not received regulatory approval in the United States), adding novel agents to platinum doublet chemotherapy has not improved survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, several phase 2 studies reported on the efficacy of single-agent PD-1 inhibitors in chemotherapy-pretreated MPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Following the non-small-cell lung cancer paradigm, where the combination of first-line chemotherapy with PD-1 pathway blockade has become a standard approach for advanced disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, chemo-immunotherapy is currently being explored in MPM. In the first-line setting, the phase 2 DREAM study of durvalumab with chemotherapy achieved its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and showed the regimen to be tolerable and active in this setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the combination of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab was shown to improve survival for previously untreated patients when compared to chemotherapy, with robust efficacy being limited to non-epithelioid histology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Although several studies have expanded understanding of the genomic landscape of MPM and identified putative actionable alterations, these have not been translated to therapeutic progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. More than 50% of MPMs carry germline or somatic mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. BAP1, a nuclear ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase, has been reported to be frequently mutated in the germline and tumor cells of patients with MPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Heterozygous germline <italic>BAP1</italic> alterations predispose to mesothelioma, especially in the context of asbestos exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and, similarly, germline <italic>BLM</italic> mutations might increase susceptibility to asbestos carcinogenesis and emergence of mesothelioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, such as <italic>BAP1</italic>, <italic>NF2</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>SETD2</italic>, by sequence or structural alterations, is thought to be the predominant oncogenic mechanism for MPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Notably, MPM harbors a low tumor mutation burden (TMB) of fewer than two non-synonymous mutations per megabase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and has, therefore, been considered a tumor with low neoantigen-driven immunogenicity. Nevertheless, the promising clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade for MPM calls for in-depth genomic and functional analyses to investigate the mechanisms of therapeutic response and resistance. In this study, we investigated the combination of durvalumab with platinum-based chemotherapy in a phase 2 clinical trial, to establish safety and efficacy and explore genomic and immunologic features of response in patients with unresectable MPM.</p>

                <p id="Par5">PrE0505, a phase 2, single-arm, multicenter study, enrolled patients with previously untreated, unresectable MPM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02899195">NCT02899195</ext-link>; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Patients received durvalumab (at a fixed dose of 1,120 mg intraveneously) given once every 3 weeks in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin at their standard doses for up to six cycles. Substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin was permitted on cycle 1 for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of ≥45 ml min<sup>−1</sup> but ≤60 ml min<sup>−1</sup>, for patients with another documented contraindication to cisplatin (for example, hearing loss) or because of cisplatin toxicity during treatment. Patients with stable or responding tumors after concurrent therapy continued on maintenance durvalumab for a maximum duration of 1 year from the first study treatment. A protocol-defined safety review was performed after enrollment of the first six and 15 patients. Pre-specified dose-limiting toxicities during the safety run-in period included any immune-mediated adverse event of grade 4 or higher or any non-resolving, immune-mediated adverse event of grade 3 or higher during the first two cycles of therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par6">The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS), defined as time from study registration to death from any cause. Patients last known to be alive were censored at their date of last follow-up. We assumed a null hypothesis that the median OS with chemo-immunotherapy would be equal to the OS of 12 months with pemetrexed/cisplatin alone (historical control). The total planned enrollment of 55 patients (50 eligible) with 32 events allowed for 90% power to detect a 37% reduction in the OS hazard rate of 0.058–0.037 based on Wald test for the log failure rate parameter using a one-sided type I error rate of 10%. This would correspond to a 58% improvement in the median OS from 12 to 19 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.

The median OS for all patients enrolled was 20.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.0–28.5, 80% CI: 15.1–27.9) and was significantly longer than the historical control of 12 months (one-sided <italic>P</italic> = 0.0014; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), with an observed hazard rate of 0.034. The estimated percentages of patients alive at 6, 12 and 24 months were 87.2%, 70.4% and 44.2%, respectively. Median PFS was 6.7 months (95% CI: 6.1–8.4, 80% CI: 6.3–8.2; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

No patients had a complete response (CR); 31 patients showed partial response (PR); and 20 patients had stable disease (SD).

The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mostly of low grade and included fatigue (67%), nausea (56%) and anemia (56%) (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in 65.5% of patients and included anemia (20%), hyponatremia (9%), fatigue (7%), leucopenia (5%), thrombocytopenia (5%) and hypertension (5%); all other grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in fewer than 5% of patients.

There were also no unexpected adverse events of special interest (defined as adverse events with a potential immune-mediated mechanism), and those that did occur were grade 2 or lower (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In terms of treatment received, 29 (53%) patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy from the start of treatment, whereas the rest began with carboplatin, and an additional seven patients in the cisplatin group switched to carboplatin during concurrent treatment. No statistically significant differences in PFS or OS were observed based on which platinum agent was received (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

                <p id="Par10">As previously shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, MPMs in this cohort harbored a low TMB, with some tumors harboring a higher than expected TMB in the setting of mutations in DNA damage repair genes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Despite the notion that TMB might not predict response to immunotherapy for MPM, given the low mutation burden, we found that tumors from patients with a radiographic response to chemo-immunotherapy had a higher non-synonymous missense mutation burden and a more clonal mutation repertoire than non-responding tumors (<italic>P</italic> = 0.086 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.072, respectively; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>), especially in the epithelioid group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.051 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.025, respectively; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>).

To place these findings in context with respect to the potential role of TMB in predicting response to standard-of-care treatment versus chemo-immunotherapy, we analyzed tumor WES data from an independent cohort of 82 MPM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which pre-dated the era of immune checkpoint blockade. In the TCGA MPM cohort, TMB-low tumors (TMB less than or equal to the second tertile in the cohort; <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) showed a non-significant trend toward a longer PFS, suggesting that the relationship between high TMB and clinical response seen in the PrE0505 cohort might be driven by durvalumab (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

As DNA breaks occur frequently in mesothelioma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we quantified chromosomal instability by estimating the number of copy number breakpoints across the genome (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) and found a higher content of genome-wide breakpoints in epithelioid MPM of patients with an OS of 12 or more months (<italic>P</italic> = 0.053; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Analysis of breakpoints of the TCGA mesothelioma cohort failed to identify such an association with OS (univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, HR = 1.36, <italic>P</italic> = 0.23). Furthermore, we computed a composite homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, incorporating telomeric allelic imbalance, LOH and large-scale state transitions and found that a higher HRD score defined epithelioid tumors from patients with long-term survival (<italic>P</italic> = 0.014; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref>); by contrast, no association was observed between a higher HRD score and outcome in the TCGA mesothelioma cohort (either as a continuous variable (HR = 1.02, <italic>P</italic> = 0.14) or a binarized variable (HR = 1.58, <italic>P</italic> = 0.18), using univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis).

Three cases showed genomic near haploidization, which is a phenomenon where cells lose one copy of nearly all chromosomes followed by duplication of the remaining chromosomes, and, interestingly, all of these patients had an OS of 12 or more months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). It is plausible that mutations and associated neoantigens contained in regions of the genome with a single copy per cancer cell cannot be eliminated under the selective pressure of therapy and, therefore, mediate sustained neoantigen-driven immune responses and long-term clinical benefit. Consistent with this notion, we discovered a higher number of sequence alterations contained in single-copy regions of the genome in tumors from responders compared to non-responders (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027; Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>); notably, the overwhelming majority of these were clonal (71 of 93, 76%; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">8</xref>). To further support these findings, we investigated the background rate of loss in regions of the genome with a single copy per cell (haploid regions) versus two copies per cell (euploid regions) and analyzed somatic copy number profiles of 1,086 mesothelioma and non-small-cell lung cancer tumors from TCGA (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These analyses revealed that the rate of loss in haploid regions was consistently lower than that of euploid regions (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), supporting the notion that mutations contained in these regions are difficult to eliminate and might drive a sustained anti-tumor immune response.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Large-scale copy number analyses.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Genome-wide copy number analyses predominantly revealed genomic regions with copy number losses (shown in blue) and were used to determine the extent of copy number breakpoints and fraction of genome with complete allelic imbalance, reflecting genomic instability and tumor aneuploidy.

In looking at the tumor microenvironment of MPM, the composition of the pre-existing intra-tumoral TCR repertoire tied into the genomic footprint of MPM has not been previously investigated in the context of chemo-immunotherapy. Baseline tumors of patients with an OS of 12 or more months harbored a more diverse TCR repertoire in contrast to tumors of patients with shorter OS, which showed a higher TCR repertoire clonality and a higher proportion of high-frequency TCR clones (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.006, respectively; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a–c</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We investigated the reshaping of the intra-tumoral T cell repertoire for three patients (295, 459 and 926) who had long-term therapeutic responses but eventually developed acquired resistance, by serially sampling tumors before therapy and at the time of acquired resistance. Interestingly, at the time of acquired resistance, significant reshaping signified by TCR clonotypic expansions and regressions was noted, such that the tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) repertoire from all three cases was significantly more clonal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). These findings potentially suggest that an effective anti-tumor immune response is mediated by a polyclonal T cell repertoire, and dependency on fewer TCR effector cells might not be sufficient to mount an effective anti-tumor immune response.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Baseline TCR repertoire characteristics and dynamic changes at the time of therapeutic resistance.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, The intratumoral T cell repertoire was interrogated by TCR Vβ sequencing; clonality of the TCR repertoire was computed; and the representation of dominant clones (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) as a proportion of the whole TCR repertoire was determined.

              <p id="Par15">The PrE0505 trial delivered promising rates of response, PFS and OS for patients who received durvalumab with standard chemotherapy as first-line therapy for unresectable MPM. Treatment was well tolerated, and there were low rates of immune-mediated toxicity. The median OS of 20.4 months in the PrE0505 trial is encouraging in the context of several recent phase 2 and 3 clinical trials that enrolled a similarly representative population of treatment-naive patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Allied to recent results from the DREAM study, these data launched the ongoing phase 3 PrE0506/DREAM3R trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04334759">NCT04334759</ext-link>), which compares durvalumab with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Notably, the survival for patients with epithelioid MPM in the PrE0505 trial exceeded 2 years, and several patients with epithelioid MPM continue to be free from tumor progression at the time of this publication. This potential benefit from chemo-immunotherapy for epithelioid MPM is in contrast to the recent CheckMate 743 trial that reported a striking survival advantage favoring ipilimumab–nivolumab over chemotherapy for patients with non-epithelioid histology (18.1 versus 8.8 months); however, no significant survival difference was observed between the two treatment arms for patients with epithelioid MPM (18.7 versus 16.5 months)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Given the known chemosensitivity of epithelioid MPM and the relative chemo-resistance of non-epithelioid MPM, it is possible that chemo-immunotherapy confers a synergistic advantage, particularly for patients with epithelioid MPM. As both DREAM and PrE0505 trials mandated that patients conclude durvalumab treatment after one full year of treatment, it is conceivable that some patients would derive additional benefit from maintenance therapy until disease progression, although data on this point are conflicting across tumor types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The investigational arm of the ongoing phase 3 PrE0506/DREAM3R trial includes treatment with maintenance durvalumab until confirmed disease progression, thus addressing this potential concern.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The clinical efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy shown in the PrE0505 trial challenged the common paradigm of immunotherapy-responsive tumors, as MPM harbors a low non-synonymous TMB that conceptually might limit the number of presented immunogenic neoantigens. Although tumors with TMB in the lower end of the spectrum are historically thought to have TMB-independent mechanisms of response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we discovered that a higher immunogenic mutation load distinguished responding tumors, particularly in the epithelioid MPM group. Notably, these findings were not corroborated in MPM treated with standard-of-care therapies, suggesting an association with durvalumab. Clonal TMB represents a dominant tumor-intrinsic determinant of clinical response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, which is consistent with our findings of clonal TMB predicting radiographic response in epithelioid MPM. Similarly, a high subclonal mutation burden, in part mediated by abnormal activity of the APOBEC enzymes, might enable tumor immune escape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We indeed discovered an inverse association between an APOBEC mutational signature and response to chemo-immunotherapy in epithelioid MPM in the PrE0505 cohort. To substantiate these findings, we pulsed autologous T cells with peptides derived from immunogenic mutations and identified neoantigen-specific TCR expansions in vitro, suggesting that robust neoantigen-specific responses were linked with favorable clinical outcome.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Consistent with the notion that MPM is driven by inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, we identified recurring inactivating largely non-overlapping genomic alterations in <italic>BAP1</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A, NF2</italic>, <italic>SETD2</italic>, <italic>PBRM1</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> independent of therapeutic response. Although we did not find an enrichment in alterations of any single gene in tumors from patients with differential responses to chemo-immunotherapy, a trend toward an enrichment in somatic mutations in chromatin-regulating genes was noted in tumors from patients achieving an OS of 12 or more months; these alterations might mediate transcriptional changes of genes involved in immune-related signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> or might be linked with a genomic instability phenotype that can predispose to response to immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Germline genetic susceptibility has been established as a seminal event in MPM tumorigenesis, mostly involving tumor suppressor genes in DNA repair mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The frequency of 32% for <italic>BAP1</italic> genomic alterations in the PrE0505 cohort is in line with these previously reported analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Presence of germline <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations has been linked with a longer 5-year survival, suggesting a less aggressive phenotype of MPM arising in the context of a <italic>BAP1</italic> cancer syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The underlying etiology of this phenomenon remains unclear, with one potential explanation being that the tumor microenvironment of BAP1 null tumors is more inflammatory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Although we did not find a prolonged survival for patients with somatic <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations, <italic>BAP1</italic> mutant tumors were found to have a higher degree of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Notably, patients harboring deleterious germline mutations in MPM-predisposing genes, including, but not limited to, genes involved in DNA homologous recombination, achieved significantly longer PFS and OS with chemo-immunotherapy. Inherited defects in homologous recombination repair, resulting in microdeletions and DNA breaks, might be linked with longer OS after platinum chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> as well as affect adaptive and innate immunity, ultimately potentiating response to immune checkpoint blockade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that germline genotypes might affect clinical outcomes after chemo-immunotherapy, and germline testing should be considered for clinical decision-making for patients with mesothelioma.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Notably, we found that DNA repair deficiency, and defective homologous recombination in particular, determined by both sequence mutational spectra and genome-wide copy number analyses, were hallmarks of responding tumors, especially for epithelioid MPM. Overall, responding epithelioid tumors harbored a higher content of genome-wide copy number breakpoints, suggesting that genomic instability affects therapeutic efficacy for chemo-immunotherapy. Although we did not detect any evidence of oscillating copy number changes within any given chromosome indicative of chromothripsis in the PrE0505 cohort, there were three cases with extensive genome-wide LOH, a phenomenon called genome near-haploidization (GNH), which has been previously reported in five MPM cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Interestingly, two of the tumors with GNH in our cohort harbored <italic>BAP1</italic> mutations, and all patients achieved an OS longer than 12 months. As GNH-harboring MPM might comprise a novel molecular subtype of MPM with distinctive clinical behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, our findings suggest that these unique genomic features might be linked to favorable response to chemo-immunotherapy. Conceptually, immunogenic mutations residing in genomic loci that undergo haploidization cannot be lost under the selective pressure of immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and, therefore, might drive a sustained anti-tumor immune response. Consistent with this hypothesis, we discovered that tumors that harbored a higher number of sequence alterations in single-copy regions of the genome responded to combined chemo-immunotherapy.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The density of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrate has been associated with effective anti-tumor immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>; however, in the PrE0505 cohort, neither CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration nor PD-L1 protein expression predicted response to chemo-immunotherapy. Notably, the tumor microenvironment of responding tumors contained a less clonal TCR repertoire that become more polarized at the time of acquired resistance. In contrast to the notion that anti-tumor immune responses in the context of immunotherapy are driven by a clonal T cell repertoire in TMB-high tumors such as melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> or non-small-cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, our findings suggest that maximal immune cell repertoire diversity is required to mount an effective anti-tumor immune response in MPM. Consistent with this notion, a higher TCR diversity has been previously shown to correlate with improved outcome in bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and uterine cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Our study was limited by its small sample size and absence of a non-durvalumab control arm. To interpret our molecular findings with respect to response to chemo-immunotherapy compared to standard-of-care therapy alone, we performed genomic analyses of an independent cohort of 82 mesotheliomas obtained from the TCGA registry. This cohort did not include patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy or immunotherapy, and analyses of the TCGA mesothelioma cohort suggested that the genomic features of response in the PrE0505 trial were driven by durvalumab. Notably, definitively assessing the predictive versus prognostic nature of our findings is needed and planned within the ongoing phase 3 randomized DREAM3R/PrE0506 trial. Furthermore, although the control survival was chosen based on the historical control that led to the approval of pemetrexed with cisplatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, recent randomized data have shown both shorter and longer survival for the pemetrexed–cisplatin combination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>; it is, therefore, possible that control assumptions might have underestimated the expected survival with chemotherapy alone.</p>
              <p id="Par22">In summary, we report the favorable clinical efficacy of the PrE0505 study of chemo-immunotherapy for unresectable MPM with in-depth molecular and functional analyses, which provide an understanding of the complex genomic and immune cell features of response to combined chemo-immunotherapy with potential broad clinical implications.</p>

The estimated allele-specific copy number profiles were reviewed to ensure quality of fit. In four cases with very low tumor purity (329, 351, 629 and 923), the copy number states and ploidy could not be resolved; these cases were excluded from subsequent copy-number-based analyses. Furthermore, we investigated potential associations between copy-number-derived tumor purity and tumor mutation and IMM load; these analyses revealed a weak association between tumor purity and TMB-derived features when all patients were considered, but no statistically significant association was observed among these features in epithelioid mesotheliomas (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">10</xref>).

In each tumor sample, the number of sequence alterations overlapping loci with total copy number of 1 was recorded.

The estimated ploidy was rounded to the closest integer level and was used as the reference for determining loss, gain or neutral status of each copy number segment. Gain, loss or LOH in each chromosome arm was evaluated if at least 90% of the length of the arm was covered by segments of the given status. The statistical significance of the prevalence of each category of alterations across the arms was evaluated by performing a permutation experiment. In this experiment, each permutation sample was a vector of size 39 where the total number of chromosome arms harboring gain, loss or LOH equaled this value for one of the samples in the main cohort to match the observed level of aneuploidy in the population.</p>

                        <p>We investigated co-occurrence of mutations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes involved in base excision repair, DNA damage sensoring, the Fanconi anemia pathway, homologous recombination, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, non-homologous end joining and translesion DNA synthesis. Mutations were characterized by consequence (missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice site, in-frame) and recurrence (hotspots) and loss of the wild type allele was considered in case of truncating mutations (biallellic inactivation, marked with an ‘x’). There were no significant differences in somatic genomic alterations in the DDR gene set between tumors from responders and non-responders. When confirmed pathogenic germline mutations in DDR genes were considered, 5 patients harboring such alterations (629-BAP1 c.1717del, 295-BRCA2 c.6730 A&gt;T, 628-BAP1 c.581-1 G &gt; T, 976-MSH6 c.3261dup and 506-BLM c.968 A&gt;G) had a longer overall survival as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

(<bold>e</bold>,<bold>f</bold>) Immunogenic mutations associated with HLA class I and II neoantigens (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) better distinguished responders from non responders (n = 40 MPM tumors, Mann Whitney p = 0.064 for class I IMMs and Mann Whitney p = 0.023 for class II IMMs).

The center line in the boxplots represents the median, the upper limit of the boxplots represents the third quantile (75th percentile), the lower limit of the boxplots represents the first quantile (25th percentile), the upper whiskers is the maximum value of the data that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range over the 75th percentile, and the lower whisker is the minimum value of the data that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range under the 25th percentile. (<bold>i</bold>) Survival analyses did not reveal any significant differences in overall survival between MPM tumors in the TCGA cohort with high TMB vs. those harboring a low TMB (log rank p = 0.21). (<bold>j</bold>) Analyses of progression-free survival revealed a trend towards longer PFS for patients with MPM tumors in the TCGA cohort harboring a low TMB (log rank p = 0.05).

There were no differences in the degree of germline homozygosity found between responders and non-responders. HLA class I and II germline zygosity and somatic LOH events were combined to calculate the unique number of HLA class I and class II alleles on cancer cells, which did not differ between responders and non responders. Similarly, there was no evidence of biallellic inactivation of β2-microglobulin or differential abundance of β2-microglobulin LOH events with respect to therapeutic response. (<bold>b</bold>) When sequence divergence of the allele’s peptide-binding domains was computed for HLA class I alleles, patients with high pairwise divergence between HLA alleles and in particular in HLA-B achieved a radiographic response (Mann Whitney p = 0.06), suggesting that in high HLA divergence may be linked with an increased diversity of the neopeptide repertoire presented and reflective of a more potent-antitumor immune response. (<bold>c</bold>) While there were no differences in mean HLA class I divergence for patients with epithelioid MPM (Mann Whitney p = 0.3), (<bold>d</bold>) a higher HLA-B divergence was linked with radiographic response (Mann Whitney p = 0.003).

Neopeptides derived from class I immunogenic mutations were tested in vitro in autologous T cell cultures from peripheral blood of patient 459 that achieved an overall survival of 32.88 months after chemo-immunotherapy.
