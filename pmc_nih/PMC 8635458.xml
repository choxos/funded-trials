                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The pathophysiology of COVID-19 includes immune-mediated hyperinflammation, which could potentially lead to respiratory failure and death. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is among cytokines that contribute to the inflammatory processes. Lenzilumab, a GM-CSF neutralising monoclonal antibody, was investigated in the LIVE-AIR trial to assess its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 beyond available treatments.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In LIVE-AIR, a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were recruited from 29 sites in the USA and Brazil and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three intravenous doses of lenzilumab (600 mg per dose) or placebo delivered 8 h apart. All patients received standard supportive care, including the use of remdesivir and corticosteroids. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age and disease severity. The primary endpoint was survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 in the modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), comprising all randomised participants who received at least one dose of study drug under the documented supervision of the principal investigator or sub-investigator. Adverse events were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04351152" id="interrefs20">NCT04351152</ext-link>, and is completed.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Patients were enrolled from May 5, 2020, until Jan 27, 2021. 528 patients were screened, of whom 520 were randomly assigned and included in the intention-to-treat population. 479 of these patients (n=236, lenzilumab; n=243, placebo) were included in the mITT analysis for the primary outcome. Baseline demographics were similar between groups. 311 (65%) participants were males, mean age was 61 (SD 14) years at baseline, and median C-reactive protein concentration was 79 (IQR 41–137) mg/L. Steroids were administered to 449 (94%) patients and remdesivir to 347 (72%) patients; 331 (69%) patients received both treatments. Survival without invasive mechanical ventilation to day 28 was achieved in 198 (84%; 95% CI 79–89) participants in the lenzilumab group and in 190 (78%; 72–83) patients in the placebo group, and the likelihood of survival was greater with lenzilumab than placebo (hazard ratio 1·54; 95% CI 1·02–2·32; p=0·040). 68 (27%) of 255 patients in the lenzilumab group and 84 (33%) of 257 patients in the placebo group experienced at least one adverse event that was at least grade 3 in severity based on CTCAE criteria. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher were related to respiratory disorders (26%) and cardiac disorders (6%) and none led to death.</p>

                  <p>Lenzilumab significantly improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. The added value of lenzilumab beyond other immunomodulators used to treat COVID-19 alongside steroids remains unknown.</p>

              <p id="para10">The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can extend to critical illness, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death. These sequelae result from the viral-induced hyperinflammatory immune response, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) being among other cytokines involved in the redundant inflammatory processes characterised by activation and trafficking of myeloid cells,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> leading to elevations of downstream inflammatory chemokines (macrophage chemotactic protein 1, interleukin 8 [IL-8], interferon gamma induced protein 10), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1),<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, ferritin).</p>
              <p id="para20">In COVID-19, high levels of GM-CSF have been associated with disease severity, myeloid cell trafficking to the lungs, and ICU admission.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Elevation of circulating GM-CSF in patients with emerging hyperinflammation 4 days after symptom onset differentiated mild or moderate from severe disease.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Since GM-CSF is produced by activated T cells in tissue microenvironments and is bound by extracellular matrix and GM-CSF receptors, its detection in the serum probably indicates elevated tissue levels. GM-CSF might therefore be an important target to treat early stages of the hyperinflammatory immune response and prevent its downstream sequelae.</p>

                  <p id="para50">A MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials was evaluated. The terms “granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor”, “COVID-19”, “cytokine storm”, “cytokine release syndrome”, “hyperinflammatory immune response”, ”hospitalization”, “ventilation-free survival”, “outcomes”, and “clinical trials” were used to search for articles published up to June, 2020, with no restrictions to language. No completed randomised clinical trials were identified. One small case-controlled study, which made use of the neutralising anti- granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody lenzilumab was reported to show improvement in COVID-19 outcomes. Several publications highlighted poor clinical outcomes associated with the hyperinflammatory immune response of COVID-19. The hyperinflammatory immune response, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterised by elevated markers of systemic inflammation, was implicated in disease progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. The potential of various immunomodulator agents to affect the COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory immune response was under active investigation during the period up to June, 2020, and beyond. GM-CSF is an upstream mediator of the hyperinflammatory immune response in COVID-19 and neutralisation of GM-CSF presented a novel therapeutic approach to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease progression alongside corticosteroids and antiviral remdesivir therapy.</p>

              <p id="para100">Lenzilumab is a novel anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody (Humaneered, Burlingame, CA, USA; manufactured by Calalent in the USA) that directly binds GM-CSF, with high specificity and affinity, and a slow off-rate, to prevent signalling through its receptor.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> It has shown efficacy in clinical studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT01603277" id="interrefs30">NCT01603277</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02546284" id="interrefs40">NCT02546284</ext-link>) of various disease settings with no serious adverse events attributed to its administration (Humanigen, unpublished). In a matched case-cohort study of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, lenzilumab was associated with a significantly shorter time to clinical improvement and a lower incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death compared with the cohort receiving standard of care (8% <italic>vs</italic> 41%; p=0·07).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>

                <p id="para180">Physical examinations including vital signs, assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia, ARDS assessment, use of supplemental oxygen, clinical status assessment, and pharmacokinetic and cytokine samples were done daily from baseline (day 0) to day 10, then on days 14 and 28 or at discharge. Laboratory assessment including blood chemistry and coagulation parameters were done on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 28 or at discharge. These measures are not presented herein. Adverse events were graded by means of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0).

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para190">The primary efficacy endpoint was survival without ventilation (sometimes referred to as ventilator-free survival) by day 28. For the purposes of the survival analysis for the primary endpoint, an event was defined as mortality or the requirement for IMV. Survival without IMV is a robust composite endpoint used in many COVID-19 studies that is less prone to favour treatments with discordant effects on survival and days free of ventilation<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> and avoids the need for sample sizes approaching those of mortality trials to enable timely availability of study results.</p>
                <p id="para200">An 8-point ordinal scale (from 1=death to 8=not hospitalised, no limitations) adapted from the NIH-sponsored ACTT study<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> was used for the assessment of clinical status. Time to recovery, a key secondary endpoint, was defined as the time to achieve an ordinal score of 6 (hospitalised, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and no longer requiring ongoing medical care), 7 (not hospitalised, limitation on activities, or requiring home oxygen), or 8 (not hospitalised and no limitations on activities) on the 8-point clinical status ordinal scale. Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, the recovery probabilities and associated 95% CIs on days 28 are reported. In addition, the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of the time to recovery with associated 95% CIs are provided, as data permit. Other key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with the composite of IMV (ordinal score 2), ECMO (ordinal score 2), or death (ordinal score 1); ventilator-free days; duration of ICU stay; and mortality.</p>
                <p id="para210">Additional secondary endpoints included time to two- point improvement (reported herein), proportion of patients who recovered, change in clinical status, incidence of severe ARDS, difference in mean haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, duration of hospitalisation, time to discharge, proportion of participants discharged from ICU and hospital, organ failure-free days, incidence of ICU stay, duration of high-flow oxygen, time to improvement in oxygenation, proportion of participants with improvement in oxygenation for 48 h, time to clinical improvement defined by National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), proportion of participants with clinical improvement in NEWS2, and number of participants alive and off supplemental oxygen, all measured through day 28. These endpoints are not reported herein.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para220">The original primary efficacy endpoint for this trial was the incidence of IMV or death up to day 28, which was then amended to time to recovery up to day 28. A prespecified interim analysis for safety, futility, and sample size re-estimation was performed by the DSMB when 50% of the events had occurred to assess the time to recovery in patients receiving standard treatment and whether any amendments to the protocol were required to validate the effect of lenzilumab in this patient population. The DSMB was masked to all other data. On the basis of the interim analysis, the sample size was increased to the approximately 515 participants who would be necessary to observe 402 recovery events. Several months after increasing the sample size of the trial, while maintaining masking by both the sponsor and the DSMB, the primary endpoint was modified to survival without IMV to day 28 on the basis of the changing therapeutic landscape, with an increased focus on mortality and IMV as more clinically meaningful and reliable study endpoints.</p>
                <p id="para230">The sample size estimate was based on the event rates in similar patient populations from other published studies.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The event rate of patients who required IMV or died by day 28 in the placebo group was estimated as 25%, and the event rate in the lenzilumab treatment group was approximated as 15%, resulting in a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·565.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> By means of a Cox proportional hazard model to test for inequality of the HR, a total of 100 events were calculated to provide 81% power to detect a difference with a two-sided alpha of 5% at the final analysis and assuming a fixed follow-up of 28 days. Therefore, approximately 516 enrolled patients (258 patients in each treatment group) were needed to observe the 100 targeted events.</p>
                <p id="para240">The primary endpoint was the difference between lenzilumab treatment and placebo treatment in survival without IMV to 28 days following treatment in the prespecified, modified intention-to-treat population (mITT), in which patients received at least one dose of investigational treatment under the documented supervision of the principal investigator or sub-investigator. This population was used for the primary analysis, including a Cox proportional hazard model (HR lenzilumab relative to placebo) accounting for the stratification variables (ie, age and disease severity) and was supplemented by a display of Kaplan-Meier curves in each treatment group. The Cox proportional hazard model included the time to first event (death or IMV) as the dependent variable (1=IMV use or death, 0=alive with no IMV use), treatment (covariate), and strata (covariates). Where data were non-proportional on the basis of a χ<sup>2</sup> test proposed by Grambsch and Therneau with a global p value of &lt;0·05, a Cox proportional hazard model with weighted extension was used to correct for non-proportionality. For sensitivity and exploratory analyses of the primary endpoint, stepwise addition of all possible two-way interactions between the three covariates was considered. The model with the best fit (lowest Akaike information criteria value) was selected. A further sensitivity analysis was done on the primary endpoint including the most common comorbidities (hypertension, obesity, diabetes), respiratory comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and baseline CRP as a marker of systemic inflammation as covariates, each assessed independently of other covariates. Patients who were alive and did not get placed on IMV were right censored at the date of the last non-missing assessment on or before day 28. The primary analysis was done in the mITT population and in the prespecified subgroup of patients who received remdesivir or both remdesivir and any corticosteroid.</p>
                <p id="para250">For each secondary endpoint, the proportion of patients who had had the event was calculated by treatment group. An odds ratio (OR) was calculated for the composite endpoint of the first incident IMV, ECMO, or death by means of logistic regression and including baseline age group and disease category as covariates. For ventilator-free days and duration of ICU stay, the ANCOVA model of normality assumption was found to be clearly violated (eg, p&lt;0·05 for the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality), so a sensitivity analysis was done by means of an alternative non-parametric approach. A negative binomial regression model that was specified in the statistical analysis plan was used, although the data did not conform to a Pascal distribution. Given that the data are not a Pascal distribution, a non-parametric stratified Wilcoxon test was done. A zero inflated negative binomial regression was done on ventilator days as a sensitivity analysis. HRs were calculated for each of time to death and time to recovery, separately, as described in the aforementioned statistical analysis plan. For time to recovery, deaths were censored at day 28. Patients who were alive yet did not recover were right censored at the date of the last non-missing assessment on the 8-point clinical status ordinal scale on or before day 28. Last, the proportion of patients who had treatment-emergent serious adverse events that were National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or more were quantified for each randomisation group by system organ class. All data reported herein are reported to day 28. Due to the low amount of missing data, the last observation carried forward method was used. Robust monitoring yielded 100% source data verification and adherence to good clinical practices.</p>

              <p id="para280">Enrolment began with the first patient dosed on May 5, 2020, and ended with the last patient dosed on Jan 27, 2021. 528 patients were screened, of whom 520 were randomly assigned and included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>
). 41 patients (8%) were excluded from the mITT population. Of these, 22 were from two sites in Brazil (12 in the lenzilumab group and ten in the placebo group) who joined during the final stage of the study and had documented limitations in terms of access to basic supportive COVID-19 care including high-flow oxygen devices, owing to the pandemic surge in Brazil, which resulted in a disproportionate increase from low-flow supplemental oxygen directly to IMV. Eight randomly assigned patients were not dosed, and 11 lacked documented supervision of dosing by either the principal investigator or sub-investigator. These participants were excluded while the study remained masked. The mITT population included 236 (90%) patients randomly assigned to lenzilumab and 243 (94%) patients randomly assigned to placebo. In the mITT population, 11 patients (five in the lenzilumab group and six in the placebo group) were lost to follow-up: seven had ecovered and were discharged and subsequently lost to follow-up, and four patients withdrew from the study before day 28 (two lenzilumab and two placebo).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>The intention-to-treat population consisted of all randomised patients. *The safety set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and is presented by the actual drug received; safety was assessed on study drug received, regardless of assignment group. Eight randomly assigned patients were never treated and were therefore excluded from the safety analysis but were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. †Randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug under the documented supervision of the principal investigator or sub-investigator were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. This population excluded patients from sites that had documented limitations in terms of access to basic supportive care for COVID-19. One patient, randomly assigned to placebo, received lenzilumab in error and was included in the safety analysis of lenzilumab and in the modified intention-to-treat efficacy analysis of placebo.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p>
              <p id="para290">Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>
). Approximately two-thirds of the patients were male, and mean age of participants was 61 years. The patients were of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, with 185 (39%) of them self-reported as Hispanic or Latinx and 72 (15%) reported as Black or African American, which is consistent with real-world demographics of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. At baseline, 197 (41%) patients had ordinal score 3 (high-flow oxygen or NPPV), 241 (50%) had ordinal score 4 (low-flow supplemental oxygen) and 41 (9%) had ordinal score 5 (SpO<sub>2</sub> ≤94% on room air) on the adapted 8-point clinical ordinal scale. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, followed by obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. 449 (94%) patients received corticosteroids, 347 (72%) received remdesivir, and 331 (69%) received both, while also receiving placebo or lenzilumab. Baseline demographics of patients receiving remdesivir were similar between the study groups (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>) and were not different from those reported in the mITT population. Given that 331 (69%) of patients given remdesivir were also given steroids, the demographics for that group are assumed to be similar and are not reported.

              <p id="para340">The results of this randomised trial indicate that lenzilumab improves survival without ventilation in adults hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. A reduction in the risk of IMV was also observed. Importantly, the observed benefit was greater than that provided by standard background care including remdesivir and corticosteroids. Improvement in ventilator-free days and incidence of IMV, ECMO, or death with lenzilumab treatment was not observed in the primary analysis population but was observed in the prespecified remdesivir treated subgroups. Lenzilumab was well tolerated with no significant differences in adverse events or serious adverse events compared with placebo. No differences in secondary infection rates were observed with lenzilumab treatment. The potential for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, a concern with anti-GM-CSF therapeutics, has not been reported with lenzilumab in this or other clinical trials.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

              <p id="para350">Targeting the hyperinflammatory immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection has been evaluated with anti-cytokine therapies in multiple clinical trials of COVID-19 with some success. Although early reports evaluating IL-6 inhibition were inconsistent,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> more recent open-label studies have suggested a role for tocilizumab in certain patient populations.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> On the basis of the REMAP-CAP<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> and RECOVERY<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> studies, tocilizumab is recommended for patients who are within 24 h of ICU admission and require either IMV, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or are experiencing rapidly increasing oxygen demands and have significantly increased markers of inflammation (CRP &gt;75 mg/L).<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para360">In contrast to REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY, where median baseline CRP levels were 136 mg/L and 143 mg/L, respectively, LIVE-AIR participants had a median baseline CRP of 79 mg/L (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>). These exploratory findings might indicate the therapeutic potential of targeting a single upstream cytokine earlier in the disease process, guided by baseline CRP. The concept is supported by the SAVE-MORE trial, in which soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) serum levels, predictive of risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19, were successfully used to guide treatment with an IL-1α–β inhibitor (anakinra) for improved World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and 28-day mortality.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Further evaluation of CRP for guiding treatment with lenzilumab might be warranted.</p>
              <p id="para370">In contrast to lenzilumab, two other anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies are undergoing evaluation for their safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Mavrilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the α subunit of the GM-CSF receptor. Although an initial single-centre, prospective cohort study of 13 non-mechanically ventilated patients who received mavrilimumab (a single 6 mg/kg intravenous infusion) and 26 control patients appeared promising,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> a subsequent double-blind, randomised trial of mavrilimumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation was terminated early, did not meet its primary endpoint of proportion of patients free of supplemental oxygen support at day 14, and exhibited no significant improvements in clinical outcomes.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> A study of mavrilimumab in 116 patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation—a similar population to that of LIVE-AIR—showed a reduced requirement of mechanical ventilation and improved survival through day 29.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para380">Otilimab, another anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, has been evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 806 adults who required high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, or IMV—a different population from that recruited for LIVE-AIR. In the overall population, otilimab (a single 90 mg infusion) did not confer a significant improvement in the primary outcome of proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at day 28, although a post-hoc analysis suggested benefit in those aged 70 years and older.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para390">Several potential reasons might explain inconsistencies in observed outcomes of studies with anti-GM-CSF agents. One factor might be related to the unique pharmacological properties of lenzilumab, including differences in binding affinity, dosage, or dissociation rate between lenzilumab and the other two anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies. The clinical population in LIVE-AIR reflects an earlier stage of disease progression than was studied with otilimab and suggests that GM-CSF inhibition alone might be more beneficial earlier in the disease process. Other relevant differences might include patient selection; dose limitations with otilimab and mavrilimumab, or the manner (over 24 h) in which lenzilumab was administered might also be factors.</p>
              <p id="para400">A strength of this study was adequate power to show a significant difference for a clinically meaningful outcome across multiple sensitivity analyses. Secondary endpoints of ventilator-free days, duration of ICU stay, composite of IMV–ECMO–death, and mortality were not significantly different, but provide point estimates supportive of the primary efficacy results. An additional strength is that lenzilumab was administered in addition to available treatments including corticosteroids and remdesivir in the majority of patients. The study contributes to the emerging body of evidence about how CRP concentrations relate to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and to patient and treatment selection, which warrants further investigation. These points are further addressed in the prospectively designed ACTIV-5–BET-B (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04583969" id="interrefs80">NCT04583969</ext-link>) trial, which includes lenzilumab treatment and will use CRP to define the primary analysis population.</p>
              <p id="para410">Among study limitations, LIVE-AIR was not designed to show a survival benefit. However, survival without IMV, which has been used in other studies such as EMPACTA<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> as the primary endpoint and RECOVERY<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> as a secondary endpoint, was used herein as a composite endpoint including mortality. Another limitation is heterogeneity in the availability of and access to basic supportive care and remdesivir across countries. Additionally, the exclusion of IL-6 or Janus kinase inhibitors might not be reflective of current practice; however, approximately 60% of LIVE-AIR patients were on room air or low-flow oxygen support for which the use of tocilizumab or baricitinib is not recommended. In this context, LIVE-AIR raises the possibility that lenzilumab might be positioned for use before ICU admission and progression of respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen and non-invasive or invasive ventilation.</p>
              <p id="para420">In summary, LIVE-AIR showed that lenzilumab treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can improve the likelihood of survival without the need for mechanical ventilation, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo.</p>
