                <p>Low-income families are more likely to have a child with an early-onset Behavior Disorder (BD); yet, socioeconomic strain challenges engagement in Behavioral Parent Training (BPT). This study follows a promising pilot to further examine the potential to cost-effectively improve low-income families’ engagement in and the efficiency of BPT. Low-income families were randomized to (a) Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC; McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003), a weekly, mastery-based BPT program that includes both the parent and child or (b) Technology-Enhanced HNC (TE-HNC), which includes all of the standard HNC components plus a parent mobile application and therapist web portal that provide between-session monitoring, modeling, and coaching of parent skill use with the goal of improved engagement in the context of financial strain. Relative to HNC, TE-HNC families had greater homework compliance and mid-week call participation. TE-HNC completers also required fewer weeks to achieve skill mastery and, in turn, to complete treatment than those in HNC without compromising parent satisfaction with treatment; yet, session attendance and completion were not different between groups. Future directions and clinical implications are discussed.</p>

            <p id="p0025">Engagement, generally considered reflective of an individual’s or family’s commitment to treatment, is a challenge in the delivery of evidence-based mental health care to children (see <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Becker et al., 2018, for a review</xref>). Defined by a range of constructs (e.g., session attendance, homework compliance, treatment completion), engagement has consistently been linked to treatment outcome; therefore, optimizing engagement is critical if we are to realize the full clinical potential of our evidence base (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko et al., 2016</xref>). One prime example of such engagement challenges is evident in the treatment for young children (3 to 8 years old) with early-onset behavior disorders (BDs), including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional-defiant disorder, and conduct disorder (see <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013, for a review</xref>). BDs are the second-leading cause of child mental health referrals worldwide (<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Merikangas, Nakamura, &amp; Kessler, 2009</xref>), affecting an estimated 113 million youths (<xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Polanczyk, Salum, Sugaya, Caye, &amp; Rohde, 2015</xref>). If left untreated, early-onset BDs predict later antisocial behavior, substance use, underachievement, employment instability, and chronic illness (e.g., <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Fergusson, John Horwood, &amp; Ridder, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Odgers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Piquero et al., 2016</xref>). Early identification and intervention can thus save $2.6 to $4.4 million per high-risk child (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Cohen &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>); yet, poor engagement in evidence-based early-intervention programming limits effectiveness and outcomes (e.g., <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Shaw &amp; Taraban, 2016</xref>). Importantly, the evidence base for Behavioral Parent Training (BPT), the standard of care for early-onset BDs, has been called robust and the efficacy seems to be equivalent regardless of socioeconomic status, at least at posttreatment and particularly when the behavior is clinically significant (see <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Leijten, Raaijmakers, deCastro, &amp; Matthys, 2013</xref>, for a meta-analysis). Attrition rates hovering at 50%, however, suggest that engagement in and completion of BPT is difficult for all families and even more so for low-income families (see <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl, Risser, &amp; Lovejoy, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Reyno &amp; McGrath, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Shaw &amp; Taraban, 2016, for reviews</xref>).</p>
            <p id="p0030">Consistent with family stress theory (see <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Conger &amp; Donnellan, 2007, for a reviews</xref>) and the poverty-related stress model (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Wadsworth, Raviv, Santiago, &amp; Etter, 2011</xref>), chronic socioeconomic strain increases low-income families’ vulnerability to the coercive cycle of parent–child interaction implicated in the development and exacerbation of early-onset BDs (e.g., <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Shaw &amp; Taraban, 2016</xref>). Financial strain and associated stressors (e.g., illness, shift work, lack of child care) also make it difficult for low-income families to effectively engage in time-intensive BPT services (e.g., 12 to 28 session hours, mid-week check-ins, daily home practice; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Eyberg, Nelson, &amp; Boggs, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Reyno &amp; McGrath, 2006</xref>). Consideration of promising advances in the engagement literature more generally suggests that improving BPT engagement among low-income families in particular likely requires support for parental engagement both in- and out-of-session and in the context of those stressors (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Wymbs, Chimiklis, Wymbs, &amp; Pelham, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Miller &amp; Prinz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Nock &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Williams, Lynch, &amp; Glasgow, 2007</xref>). One possible strategy to accomplish this goal capitalizes on the potential for technology-enhanced treatment models, particularly those that rely on mobile phones, to increase the reach and impact of services to low-income families (e.g., <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Georgeson, Highlander, Loiselle, Zachary, &amp; Jones, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Lindhiem, Bennett, Rosen, &amp; Silk, 2015</xref>).</p>
            <p id="p0035">Although terminology continues to evolve, telemental health broadly refers to the use of technology to increase the reach, use, and impact of evidence-based mental health services. To this end, technology has been firmly rooted in the long history of BPT in particular, with efforts ranging from the relatively early and basic (e.g., videotape modeling) to those more recent and sophisticated (e.g., online therapist training, remote coaching, internet-delivered sessions) (e.g., <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Isham, Cleek, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Comer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Ortiz, Vidair, Acri, Chacko, &amp; Kobak, 2020</xref>; also see <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013, for a review</xref>). While proposing a technology-enhanced treatment model for low-income families may seem somewhat counterintuitive in light of the challenges linked to the digital divide more generally, low-income homes are equally if not more likely to “cut-the-cord” on landlines than other SES groups, relying instead on mobile phones alone as the primary and often only digital device in the home (e.g., <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg &amp; Luke, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Pew Research Center, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Vangeepuram et al., 2018</xref>). This trend makes practical sense, given that mobile phones can cost-effectively increase low-income parents’ ability to access and use a range of features and functionality (e.g., text/email, internet/web, electronic/shared calendars) essential to parenting young children in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Building upon these trends, a prototype of a technology-enhanced treatment model was developed using one example, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC; <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>), of the Hanf Model or a family of BPT programs collectively characterized by common theory and practice element targeting the coercive cycle of parent-child interaction implicated in the etiology and maintenance of early-onset BDs (see <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Kaehler, Jacobs, &amp; Jones, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Reitman &amp; McMahon, 2012, for reviews</xref>). Although there are also group-based Hanf Model programs, HNC is one example of an individual, family-focused program characterized by weekly sessions, mid-week telephone check-ins to assess skill practice and progress, and the assignment of daily skill practice and use. Although mixed, some data suggest that individual family-focused BPT programs may be a better fit when the goal is improved engagement in particular (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>), including for low-income families who may evidence better outcomes with family-focused rather than group-based programs (see <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Lundahl et al., 2006</xref> for a meta-analysis). Hypotheses for the potential benefit of family-focused BPT programs include the opportunity for in vivo skill practice with the parent and child and thus providing treatment tailored to the particular presenting needs of the family (see <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Kaminski, Valle, Filene, &amp; Boyle, 2008</xref> for a meta-analysis). For example, HNC is a mastery-based BPT program for which progression with skills (i.e., Attends, Rewards, Ignoring, Clear Instructions, Time-Out), Phases (I. Differential Attention, II. Compliance Training) and, ultimately, program completion is dependent upon clinician coding of parent use and mastery of skills, as well as the child’s response to those skills (e.g., Time-Out mastery criterion includes ratio of parent Clear Instructions and child compliance). HNC materials are also written at a sixth-grade reading level, making it accessible for low-income families who are more likely than relatively higher income parents to have literacy challenges (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>).</p>
            <p id="p0040">Results from a preliminary randomized control trial suggested that the Technology-Enhanced HNC (TE-HNC) prototype held promise as a cost-effective approach to increasing engagement in (i.e., session attendance, mid-week call participation, homework compliance) and efficiency of (i.e., fewer sessions to meet mastery criteria) services relative to HNC (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). TE-HNC did not increase the likelihood that low-income families would complete treatment in the pilot; however, the relatively low dropout rate in both groups (<italic>n</italic> = 2 TE-HNC; <italic>n</italic> = 2 HNC) suggested the need for further inquiry. This study aimed to replicate and extend that pilot work by designing and testing an integrated TE-HNC parent mobile application and therapist web-portal in a larger RCT. It was predicted that the TE-HNC group would have higher levels of engagement relative to HNC and that those gains would be achieved with greater efficiency of service delivery without significantly increased implementation costs. Given documented clinicians’ concerns regarding technology compromising treatment process (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2019</xref>), we also compared parent satisfaction between the two groups.</p>

Although various measures of socioeconomic status have strengths and limitations (see <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2016</xref>, for a review), FPL (i.e., number of people in home or family/annual income) is generally used to determine qualification for federal, state, and local benefits, programs, and subsidies. Forty-nine states cover children with incomes up to at least 200% of the FPL (3 people in home/annual income) through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and 19 of these (including North Carolina) cover children with incomes <underline>&lt;</underline> 300% FPL. Given that our focus was reaching families in our area who otherwise have difficulty accessing and/or engaging in mental health services, we used incomes <underline>&lt;</underline> 250% of the FPL. Families were recruited via (a) advertisements targeting areas, work places, retail outlets, and social media with an overrepresentation of low-income parents; (b) healthcare, social service, and other agencies that serve low-income families; (c) local schools; and (d) word-of-mouth (see <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Khavjou, Turner, &amp; Jones, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Khavjou et al., in press, for details</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram describing participant flow in RCT.

In Phase I, Differential Attention, the parent is taught to: (a) Increase the frequency and range of positive attention (i.e., Attends, Rewards); (b) Eliminate instructions, questions, and criticism; and (c) Ignore minor inappropriate behavior (i.e., Ignoring). Parents practice these skills in the context of child- directed play (i.e., Child’s Game), which they are also instructed to do at home for at least 15 minutes per day, as well as to use the skills throughout the day. In Phase II, Compliance Training, parents are taught the Clear Instruction sequence in order to maximize child compliance, as well as a nonphysical consequence (i.e., Time-Out) for noncompliance, as well as safety-related behaviors (e.g., aggression). Phase II skills are taught in the context of Parent’s Game (i.e., clean-up task); however, parents are instructed to continue to practice Child’s Game at home to maintain mastery of Phase I skills.</p>

                  <p id="p0085">Homework is a common practice element in children’s mental health generally; yet, there are well-documented challenges to relying on therapist-report of client’s homework completion (e.g., <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Busch, Ubelacker, Kalibatseva, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Detweiler &amp; Whisman, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">Primakoff, Epstein, &amp; Covi, 1986</xref>). Therefore, we developed an observer-based coding system to characterize parent-responses to therapist prompts, explicit in the therapist guide, regarding if and how often parents reported: (a) daily practice of Child’s Game and (b) daily use of skills throughout the day. Building on prior work demonstrating that coding a subset of sessions affords a good proxy for overall homework completion (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Busch et al., 2010</xref>), we selected 4 sessions per family for observers to watch and code: (a) first Phase I skills-focused session (i.e., Attends); (b) first Rewards session (2<sup>nd</sup> skill families learn in HNC program); (c) first Phase II session (i.e., Path A, Clear Instructions, the first phase in the Clear Instruction Sequence); and (d) the last session for which homework is assigned [i.e., Paths A (Clear Instruction), B (Warning), and C (Time-Out) of Clear Instruction Sequence]. The coding team, which was trained and supervised by a master’s-level graduate student, used a 3-point scale: 0 = <italic>parent did not do homewor</italic>k, 1 = <italic>parent did homework, but less than half of the possible days</italic>, and 2 = <italic>parent did homework at least half of the possible days</italic>. Sessions were initially reviewed as a group to allow coders to practice identifying where in the session the discussion of homework typically occurred (i.e., first 15 minutes), as well as to practice using the coding system in response to therapist check-in regarding home practice (e.g., “Were you able to practice Child’s Game this week?” If yes, “how often?”) until reliability with the master coder was consistently achieved. Then, selected sessions were coded by a single coder. Twenty-five percent of coded sessions were coded by second person to assess inter-rater reliability (83% observer agreement). Any code deviations were reviewed and reconciled by a third coder and/or consensus of the group. Homework completion was averaged for families by group.</p>

                  <title>Efficiency and Program Costs</title>
                  <p id="p0090">Service efficiency was measured using the number of weeks and sessions required for each family to complete the program. Of note, only weeks in which no session occurred due to client reasons (e.g., cancellation, no show, unavailable), rather than therapist reasons (e.g., therapist sick) were included in analyses. Program costs were quantified using a payer approach. Data on program costs were collected using Excel-based cost instruments that therapists and program staff used to report nonlabor resources and time spent on various program activities (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Honeycutt, Khavjou, Jones, Cuellar, &amp; Forehand, 2015</xref>). Costs were estimated separately for (a) research-specific programmatic activities, including participant recruitment, phone screens, and assessments, as well as therapist supervision, and (b) delivery of the program to participants. Our decision regarding therapist supervision stems from acknowledgement that the clinical supervision offered in efficacy trials such as this one (e.g., weekly, observation and discussion of session, administration) can differ widely from that offered in community practices settings (see <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Bearman et al., 2013</xref>, for a review). For example, results from <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Accurso, Taylor, and Garland’ (2011)</xref> study of clinics serving youth with behavior disorders suggest that supervisees report discussing evidence-based practice elements in supervision thoroughly only rarely (4.5% of sessions) and not at all in nearly half (42.5%) of sessions. Therapist and supervisor time were valued using the 2017 median national hourly wage for marriage and family therapists and psychologists, respectively, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonlabor costs were valued based on the payments made for program materials and supplies and were expressed in 2017 dollars. Research-specific programmatic costs were estimated per family enrolled as total costs divided by the number of enrolled families. In the case of supervision costs, for example, cost was estimated based on the 1 hour per week that each therapist was delivering the intervention and divided by the total number of families enrolled in order to estimate a per family supervision cost rather than actual cost per family or by group. Program delivery costs were estimated per family who completed the program. Therapist time spent on delivering the program captured the time spent both during and outside of face-to-face sessions, including both typical clinical related activities (e.g., phone calls, paperwork), as well as technology-specific costs (e.g., watching home practice videos, reviewing survey responses). Phone-related costs, such as phone cases, screen protectors, and monthly phone bills, were also tracked for TE-HNC participants because these were provided to families that participated in the study. Even though research-specific and phone-related costs are not expected to be incurred during the implementation of this intervention in community-based practice settings, these costs are important to consider to better understand the resources required to deliver a program in various settings.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0140">This study aimed to improve BPT engagement and efficiency without increasing intervention costs or compromising consumer satisfaction. Similar to the pilot, families in TE-HNC were more likely to do their daily practice of Child’s Game, as well as to use their skills throughout the day, than those in HNC. Research on homework process and implementation in general (<xref rid="bb9000" ref-type="bibr">Kazantzis, Whittington, &amp; Dattilio, 2010</xref>), as well as well as on BPT homework in particular (e.g., <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Chacko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Anderson, Wymbs, &amp; Wymbs, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Nock &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>), suggests that the primary reasons parents fail to complete homework are less specific to the therapist or the session and more related to remembering to do it and then finding the time and overcoming obstacles to doing it. Thus, consistent with recommendations by others, the technology-enhancements available to TE-HNC parents (e.g., homework reminders, daily surveys of skill use and practice, skills modeling videos) may have increased the salience of and support for parent homework completion in the context of families ‘everyday lives (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Chacko et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0145">Also consistent with the pilot, TE-HNC improved participation in the mid-week call. While less standard across BPT programs (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Kaehler et al., 2016</xref>), HNC’s mid-week call assesses and problem solves obstacles to home practice in order to maximize parent confidence and competence between sessions toward better skill mastery and progress. Indeed, HNC’s mid-week call serves a similar function as “coaching calls,” which, for example, are now a standard part of other evidence-based approaches, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira &amp; Rizvi, 2018</xref>). Thus, increasing the probability that families complete mid-week calls allows for the possibility of more personalized weekly sessions and overall treatment model (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0150">TE-HNC did not, however, improve session attendance or prevent dropout. Although our dropout was substantially lower than in prior BPT work with low-income samples (e.g., 56%; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez, Butler, &amp; Eyberg, 2011</xref>), it was consistent with the broader literature that estimates that a quarter (26%) of families begin, but dropout of BPT services (see <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>, for a review). This is perhaps particularly important given changes in the significance of our findings when we used raw counts to examine engagement in analyses that included noncompleters (i.e., ITT) instead of the primary analyses of percentages with completers only (i.e., per protocol).<sup>1</sup> Although we detail our rationale for the per protocol approach, the pattern of findings between the two sets of analyses suggest that the added boost for TE-HNC relative to HNC for mid-week calls and homework may be more pronounced in analyses that capture the variable number of sessions inherent in a mastery-based program like HNC and/or when focusing only on those who complete treatment (i.e., TE-HNC helps those who do not complete less). The latter is important to consider as it reaffirms the point that we need to continue to better understand the precipitants of dropout in BPT in general and if and how technology can better prevent dropout for low-income families in particular (e.g., <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Wymbs, Rajwan, Wymbs, &amp; Feirsen, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Kazdin &amp; Whitley, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Nock &amp; Kazdin, 2005</xref>). One possibility to further consider on this front is that while TE-HNC was designed to motivate and support skill practice and progress in the context of stressors so common among low-income families, neither functionality nor content explicitly addresses those stressors or associated parental distress. This seems particularly important given that the majority of dropout families identified at least one stressor as the precipitant for their decision, which is consistent with work by Chorpita and colleagues (e.g., <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Chorpita, Korathu-Larson, Knowles, &amp; Guan, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Guan, Park, &amp; Chorpita, 2019</xref>) highlighting the correlation between unexpected stressors more likely to occur among low-income families and disruption of treatment process and outcome. In addition, findings by <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Wadsworth et al. (2011; i.e., poverty-related stress model)</xref> and <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Matthews and colleagues (2011; i.e., reserve capacity model)</xref> suggest that chronic socioeconomic strain not only increases the severity and frequency of stressors with which low-income families must cope, but also depletes reserves necessary to cope with those stressors. This study was completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, COVID-19 provides a context for precisely this point, given that lower-income families have been disproportionality affected by both the health and economic impacts of the virus. Thus, future work targeting service completion must continue to explore how technology can play a more central and perhaps tailored role as low-income parents continue to navigate how best to seek and engage in mental health services for their children while also coping the emergence of often acute, unpredictable, and even devastating stressors.</p>
              <p id="p0155">Although TE-HNC did not improve rates of completion relative to HNC, TE-HNC completers mastered program skills in fewer weeks and sessions, although the latter was not statistically significant. One way to conceptualize this is that TE-HNC did not facilitate skill mastery per se (i.e., number of sessions per skill determined by parent skill mastery) but instead reduced the overall amount of time (i.e., weeks) required for families to progress through the skills/sessions. This suggests that if we can keep families coming consistently each week then TE-HNC may allow them to complete services more efficiently. Moreover, TE-HNC efficiency did not come at the cost of consumer satisfaction, which we know is a worry for therapists as technology increasingly intersects with mental health delivery (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2019</xref>). Efficiency comes without significant added implementation costs as well, suggesting the promise of a cost-effective approach.</p>
              <p id="p0160">As with all research this project has limitations. First, we provided all families with phones and service plans, given data to suggest that 44% of low-income users let service plans lapse due to finances (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Pew Research Center, 2015</xref>). While families with a mobile phone may have found carrying two phones inconvenient, it also did not prevent a sizeable portion of families from having technical issues. This affected our sample size, analyses, and interpretations, but also reflects the reality of consumer uptake of technology in general, and telemental health will not be an exception. Second, costs limited us to choosing one platform and we chose the iPhone as at the time iOS allowed us to develop more functionality; however, price points suggest that low-income families are more likely to choose an Android phone. Third, mobile technologies have the potential to boost a range of psychotherapy outcomes whether as a technology-enhancement or standalone approach (see <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Lindhiem et al., 2015</xref> for a review); however, there continues to be discussion regarding the potential need for a technology-enhanced model in particular with more vulnerable populations and/or for clinical intervention rather than prevention (e.g., <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Mohr, Burns, Schueller, Clarke, &amp; Klinkman, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tate &amp; Zabinski, 2004</xref>). That said, technology-enhanced models like the one tested here still require weekly, clinic-based session, which our findings further highlight are difficult for low-income families to continue. Fourth, our findings suggest that TE-HNC requires minimal additional time outside of session for therapists relative to HNC; yet, further work must continue to examine uptake of and satisfaction with technology-enhanced treatment models, particularly in publicly funded clinics where low-income families are more likely to seek children’s mental health services (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Anton and Jones, 2019</xref>). Fifth, we conceptualized supervision as a research cost and estimated time per family, rather than actual time by family or group. We did this given discussion in the literature regarding the lack of consistency between the more intensive nature and clarified focus of supervision in clinical trials relative to what happens or may be feasible in community mental health settings. That said, that decision may be less relevant for front-line service settings that do provide more intensive supervision and would be interested in actual costs per family and by group. A final limitation, unrelated to technology, is our decision to exclude parents with current psychopathology, as well as to rely on study-specific rather than community-based therapists, which may limit generalizability (see <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Weisz, Krumholz, Santucci, Thomassin, &amp; Ng, 2015</xref>, for a review).</p>
              <p id="p0165">This study also has strengths. First, there has been significant investment in technology-enhanced service delivery models. For example, the National Institute of Mental Health reports having awarded 404 grants totaling $445 million for technology-enhanced mental health interventions between fiscal years 2009 and 2015 (<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">National Institute of Mental Health, 2017</xref>). While improving engagement has been cited as a primary rationale, few studies in child or adolescent mental health in general or BPT in particular assess or report whether engagement improves as a function of a technology-enhanced delivery model (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Georgeson et al., 2020</xref>). Second, we focused on low-income families who are more likely to have a child with an early-onset BD and less likely to engage in mental health services; yet, it is important to note that we do not have a theory-driven reason to expect TE-HNC to work differently for higher income families. Third, like most (if not all) evidence-based treatments for children, homework compliance is critical to skill generalization in BPT; yet, rates of homework compliance (and other out-of-session markers) are less commonly reported in the literature than other engagement measures (e.g., <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Chorpita, Daleiden, &amp; Weisz, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">McMahon &amp; Forehand, 2003</xref>). We look at both in- and out-of-session indicators of engagement in this study. Finally, given that HNC is one example of a family of evidence-based BPT programs with common history, theory, and practice elements, findings may be generalizable to other programs as well (see <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Kaehler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Reitman &amp; McMahon, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Southam-Gerow &amp; Prinstein, 2014, for reviews</xref>).</p>
              <p id="p0170">In summary, TE-HNC contributes to a growing literature exploring the potential for technology to increase engagement in children’s mental health (see <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Georgeson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2013, for review</xref>; also see <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Isham, et al., 2016</xref>, for promising pilot work in this area). Additional work is needed to further understand how to continue to optimize session attendance and program completion in particular, which is critical if all children, including low-income children, are to benefit fully. In addition, our work and that of others must continue to explore if, how, and when improved engagement is linked to improved clinical outcomes. In the case of mastery-based programs like HNC, we have increased confidence that parents’ skill use is improved and children’s problem behavior reduced as a function of reliance on the mastery-criterion to determine progress in and completion of the program. Yet, prior pre-to-post pilot analyses has shown technology-enhanced approaches can bolster outcomes even relative to standard BPT (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). It will also be important to examine variability in the extent to which TE-HNC parents were motivated to engage with the technology-enhancements in order to determine if greater or more consistent use is linked to improved outcomes (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Anton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Dewar, Bull, Malvey, &amp; Szalma, 2017</xref>). Importantly, these latter two directions, symptom reduction and technology use, can most richly be examined using time-intensive data analyses, which is increasingly a hallmark of the technology-enhanced treatment literature (see <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Baraldi, Wurpts, MacKinnon, &amp; Lockhart, 2014</xref>, for a review). Finally, others have highlighted the difficulties inherent in inconsistent definitions of engagement throughout the literature (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>). We chose to focus this examination of engagement on families who enroll in treatment, rather than those who are eligible but never enroll (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Chacko, Jensen, et al., 2016</xref>). We believe that both directions are critically important, albeit slightly different in terms of the feasibility of clinician’s time and resources in community settings. We developed our technology-enhancements with the goal of not substantively increasing therapist out-of-session activity for current cases. It is more difficult to consider how best to do this for cases that have perhaps had a general intake with an agency, but never initially met with the therapist or started BPT. That said, data on the implications of children failing to receive treatment highlights the importance of increasing families’ access to and initiation of BPT as well.</p>

                <p id="np0010">Variability in the total possible sessions (i.e., mastery-based nature of HNC), as well as number of number of sessions to dropout, made it difficult to determine the appropriate numerator and denominator for the engagement variables (i.e., ratio of actual/possible sessions, mid-week calls, homework) for dropouts for parallel ITT analyses and common missing data strategies could not remedy this. The last observation carried forward, for example, would mean that a family’s last session attended would be included in the “number of weeks to completion” calculation, while their overall participation at the last session would be carried forward resulting in group-level statistics that were skewed towards a less conservative estimate of outcomes (i.e., greater participation and quicker treatment completion). Therefore, ITT analyses were conducted with raw counts, rather than percentages, for each engagement variable. Patterns of findings for number of sessions attended [HNC M = 8.33 (SD = 3.50), TE-HNC = 7.45 (SD = 3.81); t = 1.08, n.s.], number of mid-week calls completed [HNC M = 4.69 (SD = 2.95), TE-HNC = 5.15 (SD = 3.66); t = -1.10, n.s.], and homework assignments completed [HNC M = 9.87 (SD = 4.44), TE-HNC = 10.06 (SD = 3.81); t = 5.20, n.s.] suggest the same pattern of findings. The between- group differences for mid-week calls and homework are no longer statistically significant, however, suggesting that the obtained engagement boost for TE-HNC relative to HNC is more pronounced when using percentages that reflect the mastery-based nature of the program and for families who complete treatment.</p>
