              <abstract>
                <p>The mechanisms responsible for the remarkable remission of type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) are still puzzling. To elucidate the role of the gut, we compared β-cell function assessed during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an isoglycemic intravenous glucose clamp (iso-IVGC) in: <italic>1</italic>) 16 severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes, up to 3 years post-RYGBP; <italic>2</italic>) 11 severely obese normal glucose-tolerant control subjects; and <italic>3</italic>) 7 lean control subjects. Diabetes remission was observed after RYGBP. β-Cell function during the OGTT, significantly blunted prior to RYGBP, normalized to levels of both control groups after RYGBP. In contrast, during the iso-IVGC, β-cell function improved minimally and remained significantly impaired compared with lean control subjects up to 3 years post-RYGBP. Presurgery, β-cell function, weight loss, and glucagon-like peptide 1 response were all predictors of postsurgery β-cell function, although weight loss appeared to be the strongest predictor. These data show that β-cell dysfunction persists after RYGBP, even in patients in clinical diabetes remission. This impairment can be rescued by oral glucose stimulation, suggesting that RYGBP leads to an important gastrointestinal effect, critical for improved β-cell function after surgery.</p>

            <p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) remits type 2 diabetes in ∼40–80% of cases (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); however, mechanisms surrounding this remarkable improvement are still elusive. Although caloric restriction and weight loss are important contributors, evidence suggests that altered gut physiology, including bypass of the proximal small intestine, may also contribute. Bolus delivery of oral glucose elicits significantly lower plasma glucose excursions compared with intravenous (IV) bolus delivery, and an isoglycemic IV glucose clamp (iso-IVGC) leads to significantly lower insulin excursions than an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These experiments highlight the importance of gut-mediated factors in the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. The difference in postprandial insulin excursion, or incretin effect, is severely blunted in diabetes and normalized shortly after RYGBP, in parallel with a marked increase in the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which has been shown to improve glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and β-cell glucose sensitivity (BCGS) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In fact, GLP-1 agonists are used for diabetes management.</p>
            <p>β-Cell function, often evaluated using BCGS, relating insulin secretion to plasma glucose levels, and the disposition index (DI), which also adds an insulin sensitivity component, has been shown to be an optimal predictor of diabetes risk (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). β-Cell function is impaired in diabetes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and significantly improved after RYGBP (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); evidence suggests this could be GLP-1–mediated (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, the contribution of the gastrointestinal tract to improvement in β-cell function after RYGBP has not been directly tested. To investigate this, we examined change in β-cell function up to 3 years after RYGBP in severely obese individuals with type 2 diabetes who experienced clinical diabetes remission post-RYGBP (OB-DM) and compared them to both nonoperated, obese normal glucose-tolerant (OB-NGT) and lean NGT (LEAN) subjects. To assess if improvements in β-cell function after RYGBP were mediated by the gut, we compared measures of β-cell function during an oral and isoglycemic glucose challenge. Lastly, we studied predictors of β-cell function and glucose control after RYGBP.</p>

                <p>A total of 185 outpatient testing procedures were performed. Sixteen severely obese subjects with type 2 diabetes of short duration (mean 3.0 ± 2.6 years) were studied before (OB-DM0; <italic>n</italic> = 16) and at 1 month (OB-DM1M; <italic>n</italic> = 16), 1 year (OB-DM1Y; <italic>n</italic> = 15), 2 years (OB-DM2Y; <italic>n</italic> = 16 for OGTT, <italic>n</italic> = 14 for iso-IVGC), and 3 years after RYGBP (OB-DM3Y; <italic>n</italic> = 13). Diabetes and diabetes remission were defined using American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Exclusion criteria included insulin therapy, diabetes duration ≥10 years, current treatment with thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 agonists, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and type 1 diabetes. Medications used presurgery, including metformin and/or sulfonylurea (9 of 16 subjects), were withheld 2 to 3 days prior to study visits. Eleven severely OB-NGT and 7 LEAN subjects were used as control subjects (all OB-NGT control subjects: fasting plasma glucose &lt;5.5 mmol/L, 2-h postprandial glucose &lt;7.7 mmol/L, and HbA<sub>1c</sub> &lt;6.5%). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. OB-NGT and OB-DM were recruited from the bariatric center of our institution, LEAN from the community, and all provided written informed consent.</p>

                  <p>Plasma glucose was determined at bedside by the glucose oxidase method with an Analox glucose analyzer (Analox Instruments, Lunenburg, MA). Total GLP-1 was measured by radioimmunoassay (Millipore) after plasma ethanol extraction.

Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) was determined by ELISA (Millipore) and reacts 100% with GIP<sub>1–42</sub> and GIP<sub>3–42</sub> but not with GLP-1, GLP-2, oxyntomodulin, or glucagon. Plasma insulin and C-peptide were measured by radioimmunoassay (Millipore). All hormone and metabolite assays were performed at the Hormonal Core Laboratory at the Obesity Nutrition Research Center.

                <p>Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal method for 180 min unless otherwise indicated. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) calculated as: (fasting-insulin<sub>μU/mL</sub> × fasting-glucose<sub>mg/dL</sub>)/405. Incretin effect of insulin, C-peptide, and insulin secretion rate (ISR; "X") calculated as difference in β-cell response, or action of the incretin factor, expressed as the percentage of response to oral glucose: ([X<sub>AUC</sub>OGTT − X<sub>AUC</sub>iso-IVGC]/[X<sub>AUC</sub>OGTT]) × 100. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) calculated as: 10,000/([fasting glucose × fasting insulin × mean glucose<sub>0–180 min</sub> × mean insulin<sub>0–180 min</sub>]<sup>0.5</sup>). ISR calculated by mathematical deconvolution using a two-compartment model for hormone clearance using C-peptide from the OGTT (i.e., O-ISR) and iso-IVGC (i.e., IV-ISR), using the Chronological Series Analyzer (CSA) (Van Cauter, Hasak and Leproult, University of Chicago) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). ISR was calculated both adjusted and unadjusted for body weight. Measures of β-cell function include insulin secretion index (ISX), BCGS, and DI. ISX calculated as: ISR AUC/glucose AUC from 0–180 min, from either the OGTT (O-ISX) or iso-IVGC (IV-ISX). BCGS calculated as: slope between ISR (pmol/kg/min) and corresponding blood glucose (mmol/L), from baseline to peak glucose level, from OGTT (O-BCGS) and iso-IVGC (IV-BCGS). DI calculated for OGTT (O-DI) and iso-IVGC (IV-DI) as: BCGS × (1/HOMA-IR). DI was alternatively calculated as BCGS × ISI (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>

                <p>Data are expressed as mean ± SD except in figures, in which mean ± SEM is reported. The study sample consisting of 15 to 16 subjects was originally powered to compare incretin levels (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). An additional power analysis was completed to justify the use of this sample to look at differences in other outcomes, namely, O-DI and IV-DI (OB-DM0 vs. OB-DM1Y). This indicated that the minimum effect size was 1.15, which required at least eight subjects to achieve 80% power (α = 0.05) for a simple paired means comparison of each of these outcomes. We therefore proceeded with these analyses.</p>
                <p>Normality was tested, variables were log-transformed if not normally distributed, and nonparametric tests were used if variables were still not normally distributed. ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test was used to analyze data across all groups presurgery, and Dunnett post hoc test used at all time points postsurgery to compare LEAN and OB-NGT to OB-DM postsurgery. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare OB-NGT versus OB-DM, if no LEAN comparison was possible. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare data (ISR, ISX, BCGS, and DI) for OGTT versus iso-IVGC. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare plasma glucose matching between the OGTT and iso-IVGC. Mixed-model regression used to compare changes over time in OB-DM and with additional covariates to evaluate predictors of: <italic>1</italic>) β-cell function measured during oral glucose stimulation, and <italic>2</italic>) fasting and postprandial oral glucose after surgery. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values were estimated for predictors in mixed-model regression analyses based on improvements in log likelihoods between baseline and more complex models (e.g., model containing one or more predictors compared with model with slope only) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

Diabetes was significantly improved in this subject, and including or excluding this subject from the data analysis did not alter the overall results (data not shown). Glucose levels, HOMA-IR, and ISI all improved as early as 1 month, and glucose and HOMA-IR normalized by 1 year; this was sustained at 2 and 3 years, compared with presurgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

                <p>As expected, plasma concentrations of incretins, in response to oral glucose, were significantly increased after RYGBP. The increase was rapid, with peak GLP-1 elevated approximately fivefold at 1 month compared with presurgery, further increased to ∼10-fold at 1 year, and remained approximately five- to sevenfold higher at 2 to 3 years. Compared with presurgery values, peak GIP was significantly elevated ∼1.4-fold by 1 month and sustained thereafter up to 3 years.

                <p>Results for β-cell function (O-BCGS and O-DI) as outcome were similar. Weight loss, presurgery β-cell function, and GLP-1 response were all significant predictors of postsurgery β-cell function, although weight loss was consistently the strongest predictor for O-BCGS, and both weight loss and presurgery O-DI were strong predictors of postsurgery O-DI, based on <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1176/-/DC2">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>); this remained true when all significant univariate predictors were put into a multivariate model.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study demonstrates that impairment in β-cell function persists up to 3 years post-RYGBP, in subjects with "clinical diabetes remission" (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, this impairment was only detected when glucose was administered IV, as parameters of β-cell function normalized upon oral glucose stimulation after surgery, highlighting the critical role of gut factors in the improvement in β-cell function after RYGBP. Although engagement of the gut appears important for the stunning improvement in β-cell function and insulin secretion after RYGBP, predictor analyses in our limited, small cohort suggest that weight loss was the strongest predictor of postsurgical β-cell function, along with presurgery β-cell function and GLP-1.</p>
              <p>This study is the first to demonstrate the importance of the oral route to improvements in β-cell function after RYGBP and to show that improvements persist 3 years after surgery. Other studies have observed an improvement in β-cell function after RYGBP using an oral glucose or meal test (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). BCGS, impaired in diabetes, shown in this study and in others (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), increases acutely (1–6 weeks) after RYGBP, with little further improvement longer term (3–12 months) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This is similar to our observations, as O-BCGS markedly increased 1 month after RYGBP, with a more modest increase at 1 year. This increase in BCGS post-RYGBP is not observed in NGT populations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Furthermore, although we observed a normalization of O-BCGS in OB-DM after RYGBP, compared with LEAN and OB-NGT control subjects by 1 year, others (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) observed a lesser improvement at 1 year in subjects with diabetes. However, in these studies (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), diabetes also improved to a lesser extent after RYGBP than in our OB-DM group, thus corroborating the discrepancy in BCGS. Note, after adjustment for insulin sensitivity (i.e., DI), similar improvements were observed. DI, impaired in diabetes, shown in this study and in others (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), increases after RYGBP regardless of diabetes status. We showed that O-DI normalized to the levels of both control groups, LEAN and OB-NGT, by 1 year. This is similar to Jørgensen et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), who showed that by 1 year postsurgery, DI in subjects with diabetes approached levels of unoperated obese NGT populations.</p>
              <p>Despite the rapid and marked improvement in β-cell function and increase in ISR during oral glucose stimulation after RYGBP, exposure to equivalent plasma glucose levels via an iso-IVGC, to calculate the incretin effect (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), elicited a much smaller response, suggesting that gastrointestinal factors are important for the remarkable improvement in β-cell function after RYGBP. We observed that BCGS and DI were not significantly different between the OGTT and iso-IVGC in OB-DM subjects prior to surgery; however, this differential was restored after surgery. This is in agreement with Muscelli et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), who observed greater BCGS during an OGTT versus an iso-IVGC in NGT individuals, but not individuals with diabetes. Furthermore, the rapid normalization of the incretin effect 1 month after surgery, in agreement with previous studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), is sustained up to 3 years.</p>
              <p>GLP-1, significantly increased after RYGBP and a significant predictor of postsurgery β-cell function in our study, may be one of the factors that explains the difference in β-cell function after oral and iso-IVGC glucose stimulation. Indeed, infusion of GLP-1 with a hyperglycemic clamp in healthy subjects significantly increased the slope of ISR versus plasma glucose (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, the blunted stimulation in insulin, C-peptide, and ISR during an iso-IVGC can be rescued, and even further amplified compared with an OGTT, with an IV GLP-1 infusion (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Additionally, exendin(9–39), a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, has been used to illustrate GLP-1’s role in postprandial insulin secretion in post-RYGBP subjects (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These studies highlight the crucial role of GLP-1 in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and implicate the robust GLP-1 response after RYGBP in the improvement in insulin secretion and β-cell function observed in our study after oral, but not IV, glucose stimulation. However, the effect of GLP-1 on glucose control, albeit significant, may be small. Exendin(9–39) administration does not severely worsen glucose tolerance in individuals after RYGBP (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Other factors such as accelerated gastric emptying (GE) and GIP, as well as yet unknown intestinal factors, may be important. Although the GIP response after RYGBP was not a significant predictor of β-cell function in our study, others have shown that GIP infusion mildly enhances insulin secretion (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The development of GIP antagonists for human studies will clarify GIP’s role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.</p>
              <p>Despite the important influence of intestinal factors, we cannot discount the contribution of weight loss to improvement in β-cell function after RYGBP. Although GLP-1 and presurgical β-cell function predicted postsurgical β-cell function, weight loss appears to be a superior predictor. Weight loss, along with postsurgical β-cell function (O-BCGS) predicted fasting glucose, and weight loss, along with presurgical β-cell function (O-DI), predicted 120-min glucose. Yet, these predictor analyses should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size.</p>
              <p>The importance of weight loss versus an independent effect of the gut after RYGBP is a topic of fervent investigation. Bradley et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) showed that in a nondiabetic population, equivalent 20% weight loss after RYGBP and gastric banding similarly improved DI during a meal test coupled with a clamp. However, diabetes remission has been reported after duodenal bypass, sans weight loss (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Future studies comparing β-cell function in a diabetic population, at matched weight loss after RYGBP, compared with caloric restriction and/or restrictive bariatric surgery will help elucidate the impact of weight loss versus gut-mediated factors.</p>
              <p>Although this study has merits, with a unique comparison of β-cell function after oral and IV glucose, in a cohort of patients with diabetes followed for 3 years postsurgery, there are limitations to its interpretation. There are some technical issues that should be discussed. First, during the latter part of the experiment, plasma glucose levels during the iso-IVGC were slightly greater than during the OGTT; however, this would actually favor increased insulin secretion during IV versus oral glucose. Second, the amount of glucose administered during an iso-IVGC is ∼50% of that administered during a 50-g OGTT (54% reported [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 46% in OB-NGT) in an NGT individual; however, the amount delivered IV is similar (88% in our OB-DM group) in individuals with diabetes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Third, a lower amount of glucose is delivered IV after RYGBP, and it could be hypothesized that this may elicit a lesser insulin response. Yet, the amount of glucose delivered IV postsurgery was higher than both the LEAN and OB-NGT groups, suggesting that the lackluster improvement in IV β-cell function postsurgery is not an artifact of the lower amount of glucose infused. To correct for this we presented ISR versus glucose concentrations (ISX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and still did find an increase in ISR during IV glucose stimulation after RYGBP. Fourth, we did not report glucagon levels in this study, although effects of RYGBP on glucagon have been reported by our group (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and others (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Interestingly, with type 2 diabetes, glucagon suppression is impaired during oral, but not IV, glucose stimulation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and this may be secondary to a change in the balance in incretin levels (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>The 50-g OGTT also introduces some limitations. This lower load was used to circumvent dumping post-RYGBP and has been used previously to derive indices of insulin secretion (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, this may have underestimated diabetes status in OB-NGT and postsurgery OB-DM subjects. Diabetes remission was defined according to ADA criteria (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>); however, the interpretation of remission after RYGBP is controversial (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), as faster GE and episodes of hypoglycemia complicate the interpretation of postprandial glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. Using more stringent criteria (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), we observed some deterioration of glucose control at 3 years, which is consistent with recent data showing diabetes remission wanes from 1 to 3 years (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It is possible that the persistent defect in β-cell function, only revealed with IV glucose stimulation, may contribute to the relapse in diabetes observed years after surgery.</p>
              <p>Another point worthy of discussion is the calculation of the DI. OGTT-derived DI (from a 75-g OGTT) has been shown to correlate with DI derived from frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance tests (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), as well as predict future diabetes status (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). To calculate DI, we measured the slope of the relationship between ISR versus plasma glucose levels (i.e., BCGS) from a 50-g OGTT or matched iso-IVGC and adjusted this for insulin sensitivity using HOMA-IR or ISI. Using HOMA-IR circumvents obvious changes in postprandial glucose dynamics after RYGBP and has been reported previously post-RYGBP (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, ISI provides a measure of whole-body insulin sensitivity that correlates well with clamp-derived measures (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and has been suggested for use in DI calculations (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In this study, HOMA-IR in OB-DM normalized to the level of LEAN from 1–3 years postsurgery, despite obesity (BMI = 30). ISI improved post-RYGBP but still remained significantly lower versus LEAN, and levels slightly deteriorated from 1–3 years. Using either HOMA-IR or ISI in the DI measurement showed a similar trend, with a far greater improvement in DI after oral than after IV glucose stimulation. However, using ISI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1176/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>) revealed a more pronounced deterioration in DI at 2 to 3 years postsurgery. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that the rapid GE and resulting leftward shift in glucose and insulin curves (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1176/-/DC1">Supplementary Figures 1 and 2</ext-link>) post-RYGBP may complicate the comparison with OB-NGT and LEAN and potentially overestimate BCGS and DI after surgery; however, the remarkable paradox in β-cell function after surgery between the oral and IV glucose measurements remains unaffected by this.</p>
              <p>This study shows that in the setting of clinical diabetes remission and large, sustained weight loss, RYGBP does not rescue impairment in insulin secretion and β-cell function when the gastrointestinal tract is not engaged. However, oral glucose stimulation rescues impairment rapidly, at 1 month, and this is sustained up to 3 years after RYGBP, demonstrating the essential role of the gut in this effect. Predictor analyses showed that weight loss, GLP-1, and presurgery β-cell function are all important contributors to postsurgical β-cell function. Evidence from the literature suggests GLP-1 may mediate some of this remarkable effect; however, it is possible that there are other gut-mediated factors, aside from incretins, that are important in this phenomenon.</p>
