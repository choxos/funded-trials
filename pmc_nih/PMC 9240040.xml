Salvage therapy SCID-X1 patients over 2â€‰years old (NCT01306019) is a non-randomized, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial for administration of lentiviral-transduced autologous hematopoietic stem cells following busulfan (6â€‰mg/kg total) conditioning. The primary and secondary objectives assess efficacy in restoring immunity and safety by vector insertion site analysis (VISA). In this ongoing study (19 patients treated), we report VISA in blood lineages from first eight treated patients with longer follow up found aâ€‰&gt;â€‰60-fold increase in frequency of forward-orientated VIS within intron 3 of the High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 gene. All eight patients demonstrated emergence of dominant <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clones in progenitor and myeloid lineages, but without disturbance of hematopoiesis. Our molecular analysis demonstrated a cryptic splice site within the chicken Î²-globin hypersensitivity 4 insulator element in the vector generating truncated mRNA transcripts from many transcriptionally active gene containing forward-oriented intronic vector insert. A two base-pair change at the splice site within the lentiviral vector eliminated splicing activity while retaining vector functional capability. This highlights the importance of functional analysis of lentivectors for cryptic splicing for preclinical safety assessment and a redesign of clinical vectors to improve safety.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Ex vivo lentivector-mediated transduction of autologous CD34+â€‰hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as gene therapy has achieved significant clinical benefit for many inherited diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Some clinical trials using murine gamma retrovirus vectors for autologous HSC gene therapy resulted in malignancy and myelodysplasia from insertional activation of nearby oncogenes from the action of enhancer elements within the vector long terminal repeat (LTR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Until recently, vector integration mediated oncogenesis has not been observed in any of the many hundreds of patients treated with self-inactivating (SIN) lentivector-transduced autologous HSCs over the past decade. The observed lack of vector integration mediated oncogenesis by SIN lentivectors is presumed to be due to the introduction of the U3 deletion of enhancer elements in the LTR that confers the SIN characteristic, plus a genome insertional pattern for lentivectors that is less likely to affect nearby gene promoter activation compared to murine gamma retrovirus vectors. However, the recent case of leukemia in a patient with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) treated with SIN lentivector (bluebird bio) demonstrated a breakthrough of these safety barriers when a strong internal promoter like MND is used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This further highlights the importance of long-term genetic analysis of lineage specific vector integration site (VIS) patterns for safety assessment of patients treated with lentivector gene therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Surveillance for potential genotoxicities relies on characterization of the VIS landscape across blood lineages. Observing a diverse polyclonal pattern, lack of emergence of increasing dominance of a blood lineage by a single clone, and lack of significant progressive disturbance of hematopoietic lineage cell proportions are generally considered indications of safety. Since 2012, we have been conducting a clinical trial of SIN lentivector transduced autologous HSC for older children and young adults with X-linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID-X1) who entered this clinical trial because haploidentical transplant with no or minimal conditioning in infancy had resulted in incomplete immune reconstitution (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019). The patients at entry into our study had donor engraftment in only the T lymphocyte lineage, required supplemental IgG, and had increasing medical problems including in most cases chronic norovirus infection. In 2016 we reported clinical outcomes for the first five patients, demonstrating significant restoration of T cell, B cell and NK cell immunity in all patients. The first two patients (both young adults) at &gt;2â€‰yearsâ€™ follow up had achieved independence from IgG supplementation, had mounted protective responses to immunization, and had eradicated their long-standing chronic norovirus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In that report, we observed in those first two patients that there was an increasing over-representation of VIS within the High Mobility Group AT-hook 2 gene (<italic>HMGA2</italic>) relative to the otherwise abundant diverse VIS in other genes and intergenic regions. We noted no disturbance in hematopoiesis pattern, no expansion of any lineage beyond the normal range and no emergence of leukemic clones. By 2016, a total of 8 patients had been treated with clinical benefit from the gene therapy for all but Subject P8 reproducing the improvement in immune function together with the clinical benefit reported for the first five patients. However, more recently we noted in Subject P6 the appearance of a single clonal population containing a forward-oriented insertion in intron 3 of <italic>HMGA2</italic> comprising 15â€“22% of the CD34+â€‰hematopoietic progenitor and myeloid lineages without any evidence for disturbance in hematopoiesis or any cytogenetic abnormalities. The molecular mechanism for this clonal dominance in Subject P6 and the relative increase in VIS within <italic>HMGA2</italic> in the other patients is the basis of this report.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Here, we show transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood immune cells and single-cell colony analysis of CD34+â€‰HSCs and inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reveal vector-induced alternative splicing events to create aberrant fusion transcripts that lead to the clonal dominance in P6 and clonal expansions in other patients. We confirm that the potent gene-trapping effect of the vector can be mitigated by the removal of its cryptic splice acceptor (SA). This report show results of an unplanned interim analysis of a secondary safety outcome.</p>

                <p id="Par7">Stable multi-lineage gene marking was observed following gene therapy in all of the first 8 patients treated in this study (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As expected, there was substantial increase in vector copy number (VCN) in T, B, and NK cell lineages over time because of the physiologic growth advantage provided by the <italic>IL2RG</italic> transgene-mediated production of common gamma chain protein (IL2RÎ³c) essential to the restoration of function of the receptors for Interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9, 15 and 21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, there was also a slight to modest increase in VCN in myeloid lineages and peripheral blood circulating CD34+â€‰progenitors. In general, the greatest increase in VCN was observed in NK cells, often exceeding 1 copy/cell (e.g., P1, 4, 5, and 6), suggesting a selection for higher copy number of the <italic>IL2RG</italic> transgene during the reconstitution of NK cells in these patients. Subject P2 had longstanding very severe bronchiectasis pre-gene therapy and died from a fatal pulmonary bleed at 2.5â€‰years after treatment; and Subject P8 did not achieve levels of gene marking sufficient to provide clinical benefit and was successfully retreated with gene therapy at 30â€‰months. For this reason, data for P2 and P8 (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) are truncated at 24â€‰months and 30â€‰months, respectively.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Chronological surveillance of gene marking and polyclonal vector insertion sites (VIS) in sorted immune cells following lentivector (LV) gene therapy in X-SCID patients (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰8).</title><p><bold>a</bold> Surveillance of multi-lineage gene marking in sorted immune (CD3, CD14, PMN, B, NK, and CD34+) cell lineages over time following gene therapy. <bold>b</bold> Tracking of vector integration sites at different time points in sorted immune cell lineages for each patient treated with LV-gene therapy.

For this analysis we distinguished between <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS in the sense (forward) orientation versus the antisense (reverse) orientation relative to the <italic>HMGA2</italic> coding sequence. The frequency of forward and reverse orientation <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS were approximately equal in the baseline transduced CD34+â€‰product and were at a frequency similar to that expected for a gene of this size.

                <p id="Par10">There is a previous report of lentivector insertion-mediated activation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> causing a large expansion of a single clone restricted to the erythroid lineage in human lentiviral HSPC Î²-thalassemia gene therapy trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The activation was caused by alternative splicing of the <italic>HMGA2</italic> transcript to the integrated lentivector LTR which increased the stability of the transcript. To evaluate for potential alternative splicing as a mechanism for the <italic>HMGA2</italic> clonal expansion, our initial assessment by reverse transcription of RNA from patient CD14+â€‰PMN myeloid cells which generally harbored the highest level of HMGA2 VIS failed to detect any endogenous <italic>HMGA2</italic> transcripts. Since <italic>HMGA2</italic> is highly expressed in early embryonic development and is turned off with differentiation in adult tissues except in some stem cells including CD34+â€‰HSC, we reasoned that the high frequency of HMGA2 VIS clones in the short-lived myeloid CD14+â€‰cells may simply reflect an increased pool of <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clones in the upstream progenitors from which they are derived. To evaluate the upstream progenitors, we isolated peripheral blood (PB) CD34+â€‰cells from P6 who had a dominant <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clone at 18â€‰months following treatment, and by RT-PCR, identified a fusion <italic>HMGA2</italic>-lentivirus transcript (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Sequencing of the fusion transcript confirmed the alternate splicing mechanism generated by the splicing donor (SD) of <italic>HMGA2</italic> exon 3 and a cryptic splicing acceptor (SA) in the cHS4-400 element in the vector LTR (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Characterization of <italic>HMGA2</italic>-cHS4 fusion transcripts in single-cell CD34+â€‰clones and derived-iPSCs clones with potential synergy in multi-insert clones.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Illustration of lentivector insertion in the 3<sup>rd</sup> intron of HMGA2 gene in the bottom of the panel.

                <p id="Par11">We then quantified the expression of the fusion transcript (containing only the first 3 exons) relative to the full-length <italic>HMGA2</italic> transcript (includes exons 4, 5) using the ratio of exon 1â€“2/exon 4â€“5. The ratio in healthy donor (HD) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells was ~1, while in P6 CD34<sup>+</sup> cells the ratio increased to 5.91 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), consistent with an accumulation of truncated fusion transcripts of <italic>HMGA2</italic> that lack exon 4â€“5 and the 3' UTR because of the lentivirus integration. <italic>HMGA2</italic> transcript could also be detected in NK cells from P6 but with an exon 1â€“2/exon 4â€“5 ratio of 7.55 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Since both the full and the truncated transcripts retained the same endogenous promoter, it was interesting that HMGA2 expression was detected in CD34+â€‰as well as NK cells, suggesting a physiological role for HMGA2 in these cell types, but not in differentiated PMN, CD14+, T or B cells. This expression pattern was also confirmed by RNAseq. The fusion transcript of HMGA2-cHS4 has been detected by RNAseq in P6 CD34+â€‰cells and in CD34+â€‰cells from other patients. These data confirm that the truncated <italic>HMGA2</italic> fusion transcripts initiated in CD34+â€‰cells led to their clonal expansion that was reflected in the short-lived PMN and CD14+â€‰cells that served as useful surrogate biomarkers for the genetic composition in the rarer CD34+â€‰progenitors from which they were derived.</p>

                <title>Expanded HMGA2 clones are commonly associated with multicopy transgenes</title>
                <p id="Par12">In P6, the largest HMGA2 clone remained stable from 24â€‰m to 48â€‰m in CD34+â€‰cells, which constituted about 4% of VIS in PMN, CD14, or CD34 cells. Strikingly, there were ten other VIS tracked at the high frequency throughout this time course, also observed in multiple cell lineages (CD19, NK, PMN, and CD14+â€‰cells) (Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). This synchronized kinetics of multiple VIS was also observed in other patients (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), raising the possibility that HMGA2 insertion and multiple other insertions resided in the same cell clones. To evaluate this possibility, we established single-cell CD34+â€‰colonies from P6 (at 36â€‰months) for vector integration site (VIS) or ddPCR analyses, and found that 20/88 (22.7%) of them harbored the same (10 inserts) or closely similar (11 inserts) with one additional integration, possibly acquired during in vitro transduction, in the <italic>TALDO1</italic> gene (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Frequencies of specific VIS out of total VIS are commonly used as a surrogate to estimate the frequency of the cell that carry the VIS. However, the presence of multiple inserts per cell give rise to a much larger total number of clones than number of cells. Using the frequency of a VIS alone therefore underestimates the contribution of a multi-insert cell clone and the degree of clonal expansion. To address this, we used ddPCR to quantify all integration site junctions in this set relative to a human genome reference gene and confirmed from multiple assays a true cell clone frequency of 23% of CD34+â€‰and CD14+â€‰cells from P6, much higher than ~4% estimated by VIS (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). We developed a simple statistical method to predict potential multicopy cell clones based on VIS frequency correlation coefficient (Supplementary Methods, Figs.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> to <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). Based on this approach, we identified numerous other multi-insert clones in many of the patients (Fig.Â <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> and Supplementary DataÂ <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), that generally also harbored an insert in <italic>HMGA2</italic>, suggesting that while insertion in the <italic>HMGA2</italic> may drive the clonal expansion, the association with multiple copies of transgene also raises the possibility that activated <italic>HMGA2</italic> works in synergy with high dose of IL2RÎ³c for the observed growth advantage.</p>

Low-level alternative splicing of host genes with integrated lentivectors is known to happen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We quantified the impact of transcription termination of cHS4 on host genes. By comparing the sequence read numbers of the upstream exon-cHS4 gene-trap event and the normal exon-exon splicing event (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), where insertion causing loss of one allele should result in a 50:50 ratio in RNAseq. Our data demonstrated that for many genes, the fusion transcripts of exon-cHS4 were detected at similar (<italic>HMGA2, MARK3, CDKAL1</italic>) or even higher level (<italic>DIP2A</italic>, <italic>STAG3</italic>, <italic>GOSR</italic>) comparing to normally spliced transcript. For <italic>HMGA2</italic>, the data here seemed to contradict what was observed in patient CD34+â€‰HSC or NK cells. The ratio of the fusion transcript versus the normal transcript was roughly equal in iPS cells, whereas it was much higher in CD34+â€‰or NK cells. This is attributable to the lack of mature let-7 miRNAs in iPSCs and embryonic stem (ES) cells.

In total, these data show that the cryptic splice acceptor in cHS4-400 is a very strong gene trap that can cause orientation-specific transcription termination of any genes it integrates into via its splicing acceptor and polyadenylation signal in the LTR. It can even cause dysregulation of target genes even if it is integrated outside the gene. This could lead to either gain of function if the truncated protein has new functions or loss of function of the target genes that are needed for cellular growth.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Dominant termination of insert alleles due to a cryptic splice acceptor in the cHS4 region of the vector.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Quantification of exon-cHS4 gene trap splicing and normal exon-exon splicing of target genes in single-cell iPS clones.

A notable clone was one identified in P3 at 20â€‰months following transplant that accounted for ~50% of his NK cells and harbored only one VIS in the sense orientation in <italic>NF1</italic>, a tumor suppressor gene, the gene product of which negatively regulates Ras activity.

              <p id="Par18">Although no cancers were reported with over a hundred patients treated with lentiviral gene therapy over the past 12â€“15â€‰years, the recent <italic>MECOM</italic>-related leukemia in one patient with adrenoleukodystrophy treated with a SIN-lentivector (bluebird bio) reaffirms that insertional mutagenesis remains a safety concern for gene therapy using integrating vectors. Long-term surveillance remains critical as events may present late, as demonstrated in the Î³RV-treated SCID-X1 patient and adenosine-deaminase deficient SCID patient many years after treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Clonal expansion of <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clones was noted in our first two patients of SCID-X1 gene therapy following a relative short time period. Long-term surveillance of these clones revealed the kinetics of these clones that were also identified in the entire cohort of treated 8 patients, indicating a system-wide problem related to the cryptic SA in the cHS4 region of the vector. Single-cell clone derived RNA sequencing data characterized fusion transcripts of multiple genes, including tumor suppressor genes.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Integrating vectors may trigger oncogenesis by (a) interactions between viral enhancer sequences and cellular promoters to cause transcriptional activation and dysregulation of oncogenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, (b) insertion of vector splicing and polyadenylation signals that may lead to dysregulation of gene expression through aberrant splicing, premature transcript termination, and the generation of chimeric transcripts. The recent SIN lentivirus-related leukemia in the ALD patient raises another mechanism through a strong internal promoter (MND) that upregulated a nearby oncogene (Bluebird Bio). Our report highlights risks associated with the preferential integration of lentivectors within transcription bodies that also increases risks of aberrant transcripts. Although aberrant transcripts have been demonstrated in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and in a tumor model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, the long-term biological impact in humans following lentivector gene therapy remains unclear.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Analysis of the gene-trapping events revealed interesting biology in vivo not previously appreciated. The <italic>HMGA2</italic> gene encodes a small protein with three DNA-binding AT-hook domains that modulates chromatin structure, transcription, and epigenetic regulation of multiple genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. It plays crucial roles in the proliferation, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and senescence of cells, and given its high expression level selectively in primitive embryonic tissues, it is not surprising that <italic>HMGA2</italic> has been recently shown to be involved in self renewal of hematopoietic stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> and neural stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. <italic>HMGA2</italic> clonal expansion in our patients was first noticed in peripheral blood, especially myeloid cells. However, <italic>HMGA2</italic> transcripts were not identified from circulating myeloid cells, but only from CD34+â€‰cells, highlighting the importance of surveilling expressing cells. While PMNs with short half-life are a good surrogate for stem and progenitor cells with regards to genomic VIS, the transcriptional profile is highly dependent on the specific cell stage. Our data demonstrated that lentiviral insertion-mediated activation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> can provide a growth advantage for CD34+â€‰cells and supports its role in hematopoietic stem cell renewal and promoting survival and proliferation after stem cell transplantation.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The activation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> in our patients caused by the cHS4 insulator element in the lentivector was also observed in Î²-thalassemia gene therapy that used a similar cHS4 element containing vector where the same SA was involved in the alternative splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>HMGA2</italic> clonal expansion has not been reported in lentivector gene therapies for other rare single-gene diseases such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, metachromatic leukodystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or chronic granulomatous disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> using vectors without the cHS4 insulator, thereby indicating that the gene trapping activity is vector specific. Interestingly, although the expanded <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clone was restricted to the myeloid lineage in the Î²-thalassemia study, we identified <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clones in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages in our study, raising the possibility that there may be additional factors affecting the clonal expansion of <italic>HMGA2</italic> clones. A key difference between our studies is the transgene itself, where the multiple <italic>IL2RG</italic> transgenes in the present study may super-impose an additional growth advantage. Interestingly, Wang et al. reported enrichment of <italic>HMGA2</italic> clones in two SCID-X1 patients treated with Î³ retroviral gene therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> even though the vector did not involve cHS4, supporting the concept that the <italic>IL2RG</italic> transgene may play a synergistic role in <italic>HMGA2</italic> clonal expansion.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The chromatin insulator was introduced to act as a barrier to prevent silencing of the transgene or interference with the host cell or transgene expression as an enhancer blocker. Two copies of insulators flanking the transgene are deemed necessary to achieve protection from gene silencing and enhancer blocking. Since the large (1200â€‰bp full length cHS4) size and repetitive nature can generate problems with instability in the lentivector LTR and reduce the titer of the virus, a shorter 400â€‰bp fragment with full protection function was used instead. Our data suggest that cHS4 should not be used in its current form due to its strong transcription termination activity. There are many other cryptic splicing sites in lentivectors, although most of them are known to cause only low-level alternative splicing of host genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We did not identify any other aberrant transcripts in this study, although it is possible that less active cryptic splice sites may manifest in the absence of cHS4 SA. We demonstrated that introduction of a simple point mutation in the cHS4 SA eliminated its gene trap activity and recommend such modification for clinical lentivector containing splice elements to reduce genotoxicity risks.</p>
              <p id="Par23">While the proliferative advantage from increased <italic>HMGA2</italic> expression in CD34+â€‰cells may appear advantageous for a CD34+â€‰transduced cell product, its potential causative involvement in multiple types of cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> poses a safety concern that requires long-term follow up. The concerns are somewhat offset by our observations that to date, (1) our vector has not caused uncontrolled expansion, and (2) there has been spontaneous attrition of the <italic>HMGA2</italic> VIS clones after a peak at 1â€“2â€‰years post treatment in most patients. We attribute the limitation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> effects from increased stability to regulation by its endogenous promoter restricting its expression to specific phases and lineages of cell development. Increased levels of the truncated <italic>HMGA2</italic> protein may provide an advantage to CD34+â€‰HSCs and animal models to evaluate whether the potential benefits and safety issue with <italic>HMGA2</italic> dysregulation for hematopoiesis would be of value. In a study with a transgenic mouse model that expressed 3â€²UTR truncated <italic>HMGA2</italic>, a growth advantage was seen for <italic>HMGA2</italic> expressing bone-marrow cells after serial transplantation, but no malignancy was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

The strong cHS4 gene trap activity can have two different consequences, the commonest being a loss of function for one allele of an autosomal gene, that can be compensated by the other functional allele. However, loss of one allele may lead to haplo-insufficiency that may be problematic for tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>NF1</italic>, a potential cause of dysregulated hematopoiesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Alternatively, the cHS4 gene trap may result in truncated transcripts/proteins with a gain of function as demonstrated by the increased stability of <italic>HMGA2</italic> fusion transcript. Most of the truncated HMGA2 transcripts retain the first three exons, which encode all three AT-hook DNA-binding domains of the protein. The truncated protein is functional in providing a growth advantage to cells in which it is expressed. Cesana et al. and colleagues showed that the truncated protein, even though lacking in the C-terminal domains, is highly comparable to the full-length protein in chromatin binding patterns and overexpression of either the short or long HMGA2 protein can promote engraftment of conditionally immortalized iPSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors and human bone-marrow HSPCs in mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Our data showing enrichment for multi-insert clones suggest that the multiple copies of <italic>IL2RG</italic> may augment <italic>HMGA2</italic> activation, acting in synergy to provide a growth advantage.</p>
              <p id="Par25">In summary, we have reported potent gene trapping due to a cryptic splice acceptor in the lentivector cHS4 region of the <italic>IL2RG</italic> vector causing substantial increase in <italic>HMGA2</italic> clones in CD34+â€‰cells. Identification of the aberrant fusion transcripts is dependent on the use of appropriate cells in which the genes are expressed. A simple mutagenesis of the strong SA removed the gene trapping activity to improve safety of the vector.</p>
