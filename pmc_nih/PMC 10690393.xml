                  <title>Aim:</title>
                  <p>Preventing unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy is a key opportunity to reduce antibiotic overuse in children 2Â years of age and older with acute otitis media (AOM). Pragmatic interventions to reduce durations of therapy that can be effectively scaled and sustained are urgently needed. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the effectiveness and implementation outcomes of two low-cost interventions of differing intensities to increase guideline-concordant antibiotic durations in children with AOM.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>The higher intensity intervention will consist of clinician education regarding guideline-recommended short durations of antibiotic therapy; electronic health record (EHR) prescription field changes to promote prescribing of recommended short durations; and individualized clinician audit and feedback on adherence to recommended short durations of therapy in comparison to peers, while the lower intensity intervention will consist only of clinician education and EHR changes. We will explore the differences in implementation effectiveness by patient population served, clinician type, clinical setting and organization as well as intervention type. The fidelity, feasibility, acceptability and perceived appropriateness of the interventions among different clinician types, patient populations, clinical settings and intervention type will be compared. We will also conduct formative qualitative interviews with clinicians and administrators and focus groups with parents of patients to further inform the interventions and study. The formative evaluation will take place over 1.5Â years, the interventions will be implemented over 2Â years and evaluation of the interventions will take place over 1.5Â years.</p>

                  <title>Discussion:</title>
                  <p>The results of this study will provide a framework for other healthcare systems to address the widespread problem of excessive durations of therapy for AOM and inform national antibiotic stewardship policy development.</p>

                  <title>What is this article about?</title>
                  <p>Ear infections are the most common reason children are prescribed antibiotics. National guidelines recommend 5â7Â days of antibiotics for most children over 2 years of age, but over 90% of children are prescribed durations over 5â7Â days, resulting in unnecessary exposure to antibiotics. This article details the protocol for a study that evaluates two interventions that aim to reduce antibiotic overuse in children 2Â years of age and older with ear infections. This study takes place in 35 clinics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, TN, USA and Washington University Medical Center in MO, USA.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common indication for antibiotics in children, affecting over 5Â million children and resulting in greater than 10Â million antibiotic prescriptions annually in USA [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1â3</xref>]. By 3Â years of age, 60% of children will have had AOM at least once [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For most children 2Â years of age and older, 5â7-day antibiotic durations, rather than conventional 10-day durations, have been shown to be sufficient for treating AOM [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, national guidelines recommend 5â7-day antibiotic durations for non-severe AOM in this age group [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite these recommendations, more than 90% of children 2Â years of age and older are prescribed longer durations [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6â8</xref>] which results in substantial unnecessary antibiotic exposure. It is estimated that more than 40% of all antibiotic-days prescribed for AOM are unnecessary [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This may harm children by causing adverse drug events (ADE) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], selecting for antibiotic-resistant bacteria [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and increasing risk for <italic toggle="yes">Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Antibiotic exposure is also associated with the development of chronic diseases later in life [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12â14</xref>].</p>
              <p>One method to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure is to use the shortest duration of antibiotics needed to effectively treat an infection. In a recent single-center study to promote use of the shortest guideline-recommended duration of therapy for AOM, an intervention that included clinician education, individualized clinician audit and feedback with peer comparison, and electronic health record (EHR) changes was associated with a 76% absolute increase in prescribing of the recommended antibiotic duration, while a lower intensity intervention with only EHR changes increased prescribing of the recommended duration by 50% (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A definitive study is needed to make appropriate recommendations on which intervention to implement in diverse settings while minimizing resource utilization and to compare implementation outcomes to effectively scale the interventions. This study will evaluate and compare effectiveness and implementation outcomes of two low-cost pragmatic interventions with differing intensities using mixed methods analyses and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, the Practical Implementation Sustainability Model (PRISM) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] will be used to assess multilevel relevant contextual factors to prescribing shorter antibiotic durations for AOM in children 2Â years of age and older to help inform intervention and implementation strategy adaptations.</p>

                <title>Overview of study design</title>
                <p>This is a pragmatic, cluster randomized clinical trial. We will compare the effectiveness of two interventions to increase prescribing of guideline-concordant durations of antibiotic therapy for children with AOM. The study uses a type two hybrid implementation-effectiveness design [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to evaluate effectiveness and implementation outcomes using PRISM and RE-AIM. Adaptations will be documented using the iterative RE-AIM method throughout the implementation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Randomization will be clustered at the clinic-level using covariate constrained randomization to achieve balance between the arms on site- and patient-level characteristics. The formative evaluation will take place over 1.5Â years, the interventions will be implemented over 2Â years, and evaluation of the interventions will take place over 1.5Â years. The primary outcome is the proportion of children 2Â years or older treated with antibiotics for AOM who are prescribed a 5-day duration of therapy.</p>
                <p>Participating clinics will be randomly assigned to a higher intensity or lower intensity intervention. The interventions were modeled after a prior single-center study that compared the effectiveness of interventions of differing intensity in pediatric clinics within a federally qualified health center system (FQHC) in Denver, CO, USA [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Both interventions were found to significantly increase adherence to institutional guidance for short (5-day) durations of antibiotics for AOM. However, a higher intensity intervention led to a greater absolute increase in appropriate durations than the lower intensity intervention (76 vs 50% absolute increase, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).</p>

                <title>Study setting &amp; population</title>
                <p>The study will take place in 35 clinics (general pediatric, urgent care, and retail clinics) in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center system and 11 clinics (general pediatric clinics) in the Washington University Medical Center system (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). These clinics serve approximately 15,627 children with AOM annually. The participating clinics were selected to represent a broad range of community-based practice types because more than 40% of children with AOM in the US are cared for in non-primary care locations such as urgent cares and retail clinics [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the patient populations from these sites are diverse: 33% are non-white, 8% are Hispanic, 9% have a language preference other than English, and 34% have public insurance or are self-pay. Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) will lead the implementation of the intervention components at Vanderbilt and Washington University, as the intervention has already been successfully implemented in most DHHA ambulatory care locations.</p>

In the main, adjusted analysis, intervention group, period (pre- vs post-intervention), an interaction term between intervention and period, and a priori specified confounding factors (age, race, gender, ethnicity, language preference and insurance type) will be included in the model. In addition, any covariates that appear unbalanced between the study arms in bivariate analysis at pÂ &lt;Â 0.2, will be included as predictors. As it is possible that clinicians (within clinics) are another source of variation, variance components will also be estimated for clinicians within practices and both random effects will be retained if there is evidence of sufficient variability at both levels. Changes in the proportion of prescriptions will be compared between pre-intervention and intervention periods within and between intervention groups. Comparisons between intervention and period groups will be expressed as proportion differences and odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Hypothesis tests will be two-sided with an alpha of 0.05.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using linear mixed effects regression for mean days of antibiotics prescribed and mixed effects logistic regression for ADE rates and balance measures (treatment failure and recurrence).

Preventing unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy for AOM is one key opportunity to reduce antibiotic use for pediatric AOM. Interventions to promote the shortest effective duration of antibiotic therapy for common infections have proven to be a highly effective outpatient antibiotic stewardship approach. Unfortunately, pragmatic interventions to reduce durations of therapy that can be effectively scaled and sustained are lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the effectiveness and implementation outcomes of two low-cost pragmatic interventions of differing intensities to increase prescribing of recommended short antibiotic durations for AOM in children 2Â years of age and older.</p>
              <p>The strengths of this study include the cluster-randomized design, large number of participating clinics, diversity of the practice types (primary care, urgent care, retail clinics), and the mixed methods approach to guide implementation and evaluate outcomes and sustainability. Furthermore, the components of the intervention are pragmatic and utilize freely available tools so could be implemented in clinics with limited resources. Limitations include use of secondary data to evaluate changes in antibiotic durations associated with the intervention and clinical outcomes, minimal geographic diversity with only two participating health systems, and the inability to assess the long-term sustainability of the interventions. Nevertheless, this study will represent a substantial contribution to the pediatric AOM literature where large, randomized trials have been lacking, provide a framework for other healthcare systems to address the widespread problem of excessive durations of therapy for AOM, and inform national antibiotic stewardship policy development.</p>
