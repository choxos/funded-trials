                <p id="Par1">The World Health Organisation advocates a direct focus on adolescent men in reducing adolescent pregnancy; however, no trials have been conducted. This trial (ISRCTN11632300; NCT02092480) determines whether a novel Relationship and Sexuality Educational intervention, <italic>If I Were Jack</italic>, is acceptable and feasible to implement in mixed sex UK classrooms. The intervention is a teacher-delivered intervention that emphasises male alongside female  responsibility in preventing unintended pregnancies and is designed to prevent unprotected sex. The trial was a parallel-group cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial with embedded process and cost evaluation in eight secondary schools (unit of randomisation) among 831 pupils (mean age 14) in Northern Ireland, alongside a qualitative evaluation of transferability in ten schools in Scotland, Wales and England. The sampling strategy was a maximum variation quota sample designed to capture a range of school management types. Four schools were randomised to each arm and the control arm continued with usual practice. Study duration was 12 months (from November 2014), with follow-up 9 months post-baseline. Results demonstrated that the intervention was acceptable to schools, pupils and teachers, and could be feasibly implemented, cost-effectively, with minor enhancements. The between-group difference in incidence of unprotected sex (primary outcome at pupil level) of 1.3% (95% CI 0.5–2.2) by 9 months demonstrated a potential effect size consistent with those reported to have had meaningful impact on teenage pregnancy. The study responds to global health policy for a paradigm shift towards inclusion of men in the achievement of sexual and reproductive health goals in a practical way by demonstrating that a gender-sensitive as well as a gender transformative intervention targeting males to prevent teenage pregnancy is acceptable to adolescent men and women and implementable in formal education structures. <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> now merits further effectiveness testing.</p>

                <title>Why Men?</title>
                <p id="Par2">Feminist research has transformed health science in general, such that it is no longer scientifically acceptable to model either the causes or the cures of ill-health without taking sex and, in more progressive research, the gender continuum into account (Connell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Yet, in the field of reproductive health research, the field arguably most driven through feminist concerns, men are often overlooked (Lohan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>). Not only is there a need for a paradigm shift in the gender bias in reproductive health research, but there is a need for a shift in the practical interventions that are intended to achieve an improvement in reproductive health goals, such as a reduction in teenage pregnancies worldwide.</p>
                <p id="Par3">The latest systematic reviews of educational interventions targeted to the prevention of teenage pregnancies speak to a number of innovative approaches, including combining school- and community-based approaches; combining education, skills building and contraception promotion; targeted programmes to at risk groups or areas; and incentive-based interventions to maintain school attendance (Chin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Mason-Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>; Oringanje et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>; Goesling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). While teenage men are rarely excluded from these innovations designed to address teenage pregnancy, equally, they are seldom the central focus (for exceptions, see Gruchow and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>; Herrman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>; Pulerwitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). Yet, it is acknowledged at the global health policy level that tackling the gendered power relationships in society that relinquish some men from reproductive/contraceptive responsibility (arguably more prevalent in liberal high-income nations) while giving some men power over women’s reproductive bodies, such as their right to access contraceptive and pregnancy termination services (perhaps more prevalent in conservative low-income countries), is a substantial part of the problem in addressing teenage pregnancy world-wide (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>; WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>).</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Why This Intervention?</title>
                <p id="Par4">We report the results of a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial (cRCT) of a schools-based Relationship and Sexuality Educational (RSE) intervention, which especially emphasises the role of teenage men in preventing teenage pregnancy and is delivered to both males and females aged 14–16. The intervention, <italic>If I Were Jack</italic>, which is centred around an interactive video drama with accompanying classroom materials and activities is described more fully below. This is the first intervention to be developed and trialled which explicitly promotes a gender-sensitive approach to addressing teenage pregnancy by focussing on male perspectives and a gender transformative perspective by encouraging males to share reproductive responsibility. It is also the first controlled trial of an RSE intervention in the UK that reports the recruitment of faith-based schools.</p>
                <p id="Par5">The complex socio-economic determinants of unintended pregnancy have been précised in systematic reviews (Acharya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>; Harden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Imamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>; Lohan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2010</xref>) which highlight that while RSE on its own may have limited effects in reducing the incidence of teenage pregnancy, it has played an important role in its decline in recent decades (Mason-Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>; Pound et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>; MacDowall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>; Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). Furthermore, high-quality RSE is considered fundamental to respecting and fulfilling the right of the child to appropriate sexual health education (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par6">We report the results of a feasibility trial and additional transferability study designed to rigorously test acceptability and feasibility of implementation of the intervention. The trial was conducted in Northern Ireland and the qualitative transferability study was conducted in the other countries of the UK. The results of this paper inform the literature on whether or not there is demand for a new approach to education on preventing teenage pregnancy which explicitly focuses on males; the possible reach of this intervention into a diversity of schools; the cost of delivery; and whether or not a future effectiveness trial is possible and warranted. In addition, the reported study prepares for a future effectiveness trial and is in line with the UK Medical Research Council’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>) recommendations for a staged approach to the evaluation of complex interventions. In line with the standards for feasibility studies outlined by Bowen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>), the following outcome measures are reported in this paper: demand, acceptability, implementation/practicality (including cost of delivery), integration and preliminary effectiveness of the primary outcome that we will use in a future effectiveness trial, namely unprotected sex. We use the CONSORT guideline for cRCTs to describe the method (Campbell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>) complemented by the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (Hoffmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>) to describe the intervention. We first report methods for the feasibility trial and then the methods for the transferability study. The latter was designed according to the principles of Wang et al.

                <p id="Par8">All registered secondary schools in Northern Ireland (NI) were eligible for inclusion with the exception of eight schools with fewer than 30 pupils aged 14. In order to test feasibility in a broad spectrum of schools and robustness of trial methods for a future effectiveness trial, eight schools were sought for recruitment during 4 months of 2014 using a maximum variation sampling method capturing school management types to include:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par9">Secondary schools (managed by the state) in deprived areas; these schools tend to have a higher intake of pupils of protestant religion.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Grammar Schools (managed by the state) which select pupils by academic selection and have higher rates of pupils from high socio-economic status households, and a higher intake of protestant pupils.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Roman Catholic (RC) schools (managed by state and RC church), including grammar and secondary with the distinctions noted above and have a higher intake of RC pupils.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">All other types of schools, including integrated religious state-managed schools.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par13">Schools were approached at RSE training events, through introduction by members of the trial steering and advisory groups or by letters of invitation. Eligible participants were all pupils (along with subject teachers) in year 4 of participating secondary schools (mean age 14.45 years at baseline) with the exception of those who were unable to read the questionnaire. Following a decision to participate by school principals, schools sent letters and a DVD informing parents about the study. Pupils were provided with information sheets by teachers and an overview of the study by the research team.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Clusters, the unit of randomisation, were secondary schools in NI. Randomisation was conducted following baseline data collection by the NI Clinical Trials Unit (NICTU), a UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) registered CTU. Schools were randomised as pairs stratified by their school management type using simple randomisation (via the computer software NQuery 3.0), to ensure intervention and control arms contained similar types of variation of schools. Although concealed allocation was deployed (by NICTU, who were not involved in recruitment) at the cluster level, blinding was not possible because this trial, pragmatic by nature, was designed to evaluate a teacher-led intervention to change pupil behaviour in a real-world secondary school classroom setting. Schools in the control group continued with usual RSE practice, whilst schools in the intervention group received the 4-week <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> intervention in replacement of usual RSE practice. Schools were retained in the study for a period of 12 months (November 2014 to November 2015), with follow-up 1 occurring at 5 months and follow-up 2 at 9 months post-baseline.<table-wrap id="Taba"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Intervention</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Name and brief description: <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> is an evidenced-based educational resource designed to prevent unintended pregnancy by increasing teenagers’ intentions to avoid unprotected sexual intercourse.

                  <p id="Par15">The demand for the intervention was assessed through willingness of both intervention and control schools to participate in the trial without the use of incentives. We stipulated that we should recruit at least 25% of schools approached, no more than 25% of parents should withdraw their children from the study and no more than 25% of pupils should refuse to participate.</p>

We stipulated that no more than one school should withdraw from the study. Qualitative measures of acceptability were an analysis of the satisfaction of pupils and teachers with regard to the intervention and teachers’ willingness to use the intervention in the future, along with independent observations of engagement and reactions during one lesson in each school in the intervention group.</p>

                <sec id="Sec11">
                  <title>Implementation/Practicality, Integration and Economic Cost</title>
                  <p id="Par17">Implementation and practicality were assessed through adherence to delivery by teachers and participation by pupils as intended in the intervention group. Teachers completed an implementation log and discussed delivery at interview, and the research team independently observed one intervention session in each school. Implementation and practicality was also assessed with pupils through process evaluation focus group interviews.</p>
                  <p id="Par18">The economic costs of the intervention were calculated in the intervention group, using the principle of opportunity cost, to measure the resources actually used in the delivery of each component of the intervention in terms of time input and materials, and a qualitative analysis of the teaching activities displaced or time gained as a result of the intervention being implemented. Regarding the use of actual resources, a micro-costing approach was taken from a public sector decision maker perspective, guided by Ritzwoller et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>). Relevant costs were identified, measured and valued in monetary units using the 2013/2014 price year. Two cost stages were defined. Stage one referred to recurring costs associated with printing the classroom materials for teachers, providing the IVD and the delivery of teacher training. These costs were recorded by the research team prospectively via a specifically designed Teacher Resource Use Questionnaire. Stage 2 referred to the teacher time input for lesson preparation, printing or photocopying of worksheets and teaching, and administration time input for printing or photocopying of worksheets. Pre-start-up costs associated with the development of intervention were not included in the analysis because these are non-recurring costs incurred prior to the start of this study. The trainer in the trial was a researcher employed by the study team, and the costs of this training are included, but no costs were associated with the training location as training took place at schools. Data collection on displaced teaching activities was conducted by interviews with teachers and analysed as part of process evaluation.</p>

                  <title>Preliminary Study of Effects</title>
                  <p id="Par19">As this was a feasibility trial, it was not powered to detect effectiveness of the intervention. The purpose of the analysis was to produce an effect-size estimation for a larger effectiveness trial. The primary intended effect associated with this intervention is avoidance of unprotected sex. We evaluated this using a composite primary outcome measure to include self-reports of abstinence from sexual intercourse (delay initiation of sex or return to abstinence) or avoidance of unprotected sexual intercourse at time of last sex. This was determined by use of a questionnaire administered to individual participating pupils (available online). While a reduction of teenage conceptions may be regarded as the ideal, objective primary outcome measure due to bias introduced in self-report measures (Mason-Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>), the sample size in an effectiveness trial would be prohibitively large to have sufficient power to detect change in teenage conceptions. In addition, teenage conception rates are not collected in NI health and social care data, prohibiting the use of data linkage to collect these data for this trial. Unprotected sex during teenage years, measured through self-reports of last sexual intercourse and ever had sexual intercourse, is well established as the main proximate behavioural determinant of teenage pregnancy (Henderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Stephenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2003</xref>), and studies indicate that, although other behavioural determinants (such as frequency of sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners) are important, avoidance of unprotected sex via consistent use of contraception is central in explaining variation in levels of teenage pregnancy (Swann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>; Santelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>).</p>

Two of the schools were faith-based schools (one in England and one in Wales).

These interviews occurred in classroom settings in small groups (ranging from two to eight participants for eight focus groups), while two group interviews occurred with the whole class. The researcher showed an excerpt of the IVD and shared examples of the classroom exercises at the outset of the interview and interviews lasted between 40 and 80 min.

Demand was also demonstrated by the most common reasons offered by schools to participate, namely that the intervention would be useful to pupils and that the intervention had strong credibility with teachers. The study demonstrated demand across the full range of the most common types of schools in NI. We successfully recruited schools of the differing school management types, including faith-based schools, schools which are academically high achieving (grammar schools) and those which are less academically focused (secondary schools), and schools in economically deprived as well as economically affluent catchment areas calculated by reference to percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Nonetheless, demand for the intervention seemed lowest in schools which were both faith-based (RC) and high academic achieving schools. The recruitment rate for these schools was 13% compared to 38% overall. Reasons offered by faith-based and high academic achieving schools for declining to participate were similar to those from other schools: no space in curriculum and current involvement in other research.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Schools recruited to feasibility trial (June, July, Sept. and Oct. 2014)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>School ID</th><th>Location</th><th>School management type</th><th>All pupils eligible free school meals</th><th>% Religion per school</th><th>Trial allocation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Urban</td><td>Integrated secondary in deprived area</td><td>57.4%</td><td>50.4 P<break/>31.3 C<break/>18.3 0</td><td>Intervention</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Semi-urban</td><td>Roman Catholic secondary</td><td>45.5%</td><td>P<sup>a</sup><break/>C<sup>a</sup><break/>0.0 O</td><td>Intervention</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Urban</td><td>State grammar</td><td>4%</td><td>62.7 P<break/>12.4 C<break/>25.0 O</td><td>Intervention</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Urban</td><td>State secondary</td><td>35.1%</td><td>P<sup>a</sup><break/>C<sup>a</sup><break/>16.5 O</td><td>Intervention</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Rural</td><td>Roman Catholic secondary in deprived area</td><td>48%</td><td>0.0 P<break/>C<sup>a</sup><break/>O<sup>a</sup></td><td>Control</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Semi-urban</td><td>Roman Catholic grammar</td><td>8.5%</td><td>0.0 P<break/>99.5 C<break/>O<sup>a</sup></td><td>Control</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Urban</td><td>State grammar</td><td>15%</td><td>62.7 P<break/>6.5 C<break/>30.5 O</td><td>Control</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Semi-Urban</td><td>Integrated secondary</td><td>32.4%</td><td>74.4 P<break/>5.9 C<break/>19.8 O</td><td>Control</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>P</italic> Protestant, <italic>C</italic> Catholic, <italic>O</italic> other, <italic>Urban</italic> city, <italic>semi-urban</italic> town in a rural area</p><p><sup>a</sup>Figure concealed under rules of disclosure</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

This one was a lot better because it was set with someone our age, like at the present time, doing the same stuff as we’d do. (Male pupil, S7, FG1)</p><p id="Par35">You immediately sort of put yourself in their shoes. (Male pupil, S3, FG1)</p></disp-quote>They remarked that it was thought provoking in relation to gender norms and got them talking:<disp-quote><p id="Par36">Yeah, it was good to see … because, usually, you focus on the girl, like how it would affect the girl, but there, you see…it isn’t affecting the guy physically at all. But it’s…like the moral implications of it, so how he’d think, what would be right, and usually you don’t think of that. Usually, guys are portrayed as just leaving. (Male pupil, S7, FG1)</p><p id="Par37">It’s kind of hard to get a serious conversation between your friends because, a lot of the time, especially … with guys, you know. I think everyone thinks about it but nobody really … Like nobody thinks it’s a suitable topic to discuss within a group of friends. (Male pupil, S7, FG1).</p></disp-quote>Young people thought that it was useful in helping them to plan not to have a teenage pregnancy:<disp-quote><p id="Par38">P1: It helped us learn a bit more about protection and stuff like that there.</p><p id="Par39">P2: Yeah, it was beneficial. Like it reminded me of the dangers of having sex unprotected anyway. (Male pupils, S5, FG2)</p><p id="Par40">… what it’s trying to show you is, like, this can happen to anybody, and like, it makes you think about it more before you, like, maybe do something you’d regret. (Female pupil, S3, FG2).</p></disp-quote>Nonetheless, there were also some criticisms of the intervention which will inform suggested changes. The IVD, it was thought, would date quickly, if it had not already done so: ‘Look at that phone!’ (Male principal, S7). The most common complaint about the IVD, however, was that there were too many interactive questions and too many demands on the viewer to answer questions when they wanted to let the film flow. Occasionally also, there was concern expressed that there was a disproportionate emphasis on boys’ perspectives in the IVD:<disp-quote><p id="Par41">It would be better if you could, like, go from, like, each side, each perspective, if they took, like, the girl and the boy. It would be better because you’d get a rounded perspective of what it would be like. (Male pupil, S7, FG1).</p></disp-quote></p>

                <p id="Par42">Full attendance was recorded at teacher training sessions offered by the same person within each school. Clear lesson plans and materials enhanced implementation and practicality for teachers within the classroom.<disp-quote><p id="Par43">T8: I think we appreciated it from the point of view that we had lessons to follow, timings were there, suggested activities, but also the worksheets. It was great that we were able to get them run-off [photocopied].… So the off-the-shelf materials are great to have. (Female teacher, S4).</p></disp-quote>However, implementation logs and follow-up interviews with teachers demonstrated that not every teacher followed ‘the wee book’. While all four intervention schools attempted to watch the online version of the film on individual computers with at least one class group, technical difficulties relating to the school network meant that all but one school showed the film on an overhead projector with pupils provided with a paper copy of the questions. Teachers saw the advantages of using individual computers, but most agreed that showing the film on an overhead projector was easier to organise and had benefits for pupils with reading difficulties. Pupils had mixed views and seemed to tolerate both approaches.<disp-quote><p id="Par44">P1: Yeah, I liked it on the overhead better…Miss explained it more, on the questions. (Female pupil, S5, FG1)</p></disp-quote>Overall, interviews with teachers and pupils and observations made by the researchers suggested that teachers wanted to ‘tweak’ the intervention to help it fit with lesson timings and to respond to what engaged the pupils most or caused least disruption. Somewhat ironically, there was a perception by some teachers and female pupils that boys in the classroom were sometimes the hardest to engage and that this disrupted implementation.<disp-quote><p id="Par45">P1: No, the boys like… They were so immature about it.</p><p id="Par46">P2: Because the boys were being quite immature so we didn’t get to do it as much. And then the teacher kept stopping to shut them up… (Female pupils, S3, FG2)</p></disp-quote>Turning to future integration into the RSE school curriculum, in general, teachers and pupils appeared very positive about the potential for this.

The second lesson related to the need for greater ethnic diversity among the characters in the IVD which were ‘too white’. This was especially relevant in the London area schools.</p>

                <title>Preliminary Effectiveness</title>
                <p id="Par52">Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows that approximately 3% of the sample reported unprotected sex at baseline (3.6% intervention and 2.5% control) and approximately 5% reported unprotected sex at follow-up, 9 months later (5.4% intervention, 5.6% control). This equates to a 50% increase in unprotected sex in the intervention group (3.6% rising to 5.4%) compared to a more than doubling of unprotected sex in the control group (2.5% rising to 5.6%). The effects were stronger at shorter term follow-up of 5 months with a between-group difference of 2.6%. Nonetheless, the between-group difference in the incidence of unprotected sex of 1.3% (95% CI 0.5 to 2.2%) by 9 months is consistent with effect sizes seen in the literature (Chin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>) and demonstrates that such an effect size is plausible for this intervention. A difference of 1.4% among this age group has been shown to have a meaningful impact on teenage pregnancy rates (Chin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Henderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Parkes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>). However, due attention should also be given to differentials in outcomes for males and females. In the sub-group analysis of the primary outcome measure by sex (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), there was a decrease in percentage of unprotected sex for males in the intervention group (0.5% decrease at FU2), but an increase in females in the intervention arm was evident (4.4% increase at FU2). Thus, the overall reduction in unprotected sex is positive, although the impact may potentially be stronger on males’ behaviour than females’. This is important as in NI males are more likely than females to have had sex before age 16 (Schubotz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Primary outcome measure—unprotected sex</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Outcome measure</th><th colspan="2">Intervention baseline<break/><italic>n</italic> = 411</th><th colspan="2">Intervention 9 months<break/><italic>n</italic> = 370</th><th colspan="2">Control baseline<break/><italic>n</italic> = 392</th><th colspan="2">Control 9 months<break/><italic>n</italic> = 375</th><th>Between-group difference (control/intervention)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unprotected sex</td><td colspan="2">3.6% (1.8–5.5%)</td><td colspan="2">5.4% (3.1–7.7%)</td><td colspan="2">2.5% (1.0–4.1%)</td><td colspan="2">5.6% (3.3–7.9%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Change from baseline</td><td colspan="2"/><td colspan="2">+ 1.8%</td><td colspan="2"/><td colspan="2">+ 3.1%</td><td char="." align="char">1.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Unprotected sex (stratified by sex)</td><td>Male (<italic>n</italic> = 225)<break/>5.3% (2.4–8.3%)</td><td>Female (<italic>n</italic> = 186)<break/>1.6% (0.0–3.4%)</td><td>Male (<italic>n</italic> = 188)<break/>4.8% (1.7–7.8%)</td><td>Female (<italic>n</italic> = 182)<break/>6.0% (2.6–9.5%)</td><td>Male (<italic>n</italic> = 191)<break/>4.2% (1.3–7.0%)</td><td>Female (<italic>n</italic> = 201)<break/>1.0% (0.0–2.4%)</td><td>Male (<italic>n</italic> = 185)<break/>5.4% (2.1–8.7%)</td><td>Female (<italic>n</italic> = 190)<break/>5.8% (2.5–9.1%)</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Change from Baseline</td><td/><td/><td>− 0.5%</td><td>+ 4.4%</td><td/><td/><td>+ 1.2%</td><td>+ 4.8%</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

              <title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par53">Teenage pregnancy is a world-wide public health concern and teenage men have a vital yet neglected role to play in prevention (UN 2013; WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>; WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>). Overall, the unique contribution of our study is the demonstration through a cRCT that an RSE intervention targeted to engage teenage men alongside teenage women to think through the gendered responsibilities of preventing unintended teenage pregnacy is acceptable and feasible to implement in mixed-sex schools, with minor recommended changes to enhance overall implementation. The study builds on extant expertise of what makes good RSE interventions but adds an additional component, a gender-sensitive approach to target teenage  men and a gender-transformative approach by encouraging teenage men to share reproductive responsibility. The study thus responds to world-wide policy calls to test interventions designed to include men in the achievement of reproductive health goals. The cost of delivery per pupil in the UK was £13.66, and preliminary results regarding behaviour change were positive. The results showed a reduction in unprotected sex in teenage populations considered to have meaningful impact on teenage pregnancy rates (Chin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>; Henderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>; Parkes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>).</p>
              <sec id="FPar5">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par54">Some caveats to the interpretation of the results are that the sampling method was a maximum variation quota sample of schools in NI rather than a random sample and broader generalisability is not claimed. The use of the surrogate measure of unprotected sex rather than a biological measure (such as conception rates) introduces self-report bias (Mason-Jones et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2016</xref>), but veracity of this measure is enhanced by privacy of exam like conditions for data collection and assurances of anonymity and confidentiality of data (Oringanje et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>). Teacher presence at the top of the room helps to maintain exam-like conditions, while visibility of fieldworkers inserting each completed questionnaire into a matched envelope, held in their possession only, helps to authenticate codes of confidentiality. There was loss to follow-up at time 1 due to school absences (19%) with much less at time 2 (11%) for which the main results are reported. Time 1 coincided with end of school term, and lessons were learned about recruitment and retention in school trials (Aventin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>). Estimates of student attrition will also inform sample size calculations for an effectiveness trial.</p>

              <sec id="FPar6">
                <title>Implications for further research</title>
                <p id="Par55">The results of this feasibility trial demonstrate that a larger effectiveness trial of the intervention is warranted and has now begun (ISRCTN99459996). More broadly, the study will incentivise further trials of RSE interventions targeting adolescent men in the prevention of unintended pregnancy and the greater inclusion of men in addressing the UN’s (2015) Sustainable Development reproductive goals as well as the broader gender equality goals. The fact that this cRCT study also demonstrated that it was possible to include RC faith-based schools in a trial of an RSE intervention encouraging a comprehensive approach to RSE (i.e. both delaying sexual intercourse and consistent use of contraception if sexually active) is also significant. Given the influence of religion in preventing contraceptive use in parts of the world where the need to tackle teenage pregnancy is greatest (for example in Sub-Saharan Africa) (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>), it is important to recognise that RSE interventions need to be evaluated in settings that are perceived as less receptive.</p>
                <p id="Par56">Evidence supporting the use of interactive digital media in RSE interventions is growing (Bailey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Our paper adds to this evidence and further suggests that it was the combination of the interactive digital medium with an ethnographically informed culturally contextualised IVD (script and actors) that captured the engagement of our target audience. While this was a teacher-delivered intervention, the IVD served to situate the intervention as coming from the voices of young people. Undoubtedly, the culturally sensitive approach will add to the expense of transferring this intervention to other places. Indeed, our transferability study showed that ideally, two different versions of the IVD using appropriate accents are required for use in the UK, with care taken to include greater ethnic diversity where geographically relevant. However, studies replicating our ethnographically informed and culturally sensitive approach to the development of an IVD for inclusion in health promotion programmes, such as marijuana usage (University of Victoria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>) and smoking cessation (Bottorff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>) add to the evidence that this approach is worth the investment in generating target audience engagement.</p>
