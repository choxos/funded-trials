                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Despite being in clinical remission, many people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) live with fatigue, chronic abdominal pain and bowel urgency or incontinence that limit their quality of life. We aim to test the effectiveness of an online self-management programme (BOOST), developed using cognitive behavioural principles and a theoretically informed logic model, and delivered with facilitator support.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">In people with IBD who report symptoms of fatigue, pain or urgency and express a desire for intervention, does a facilitator-supported tailored (to patient needs) online self-management programme for fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence improve IBD-related quality of life (measured using the UK-IBDQ) and global rating of symptom relief (0–10 scale) compared with care as usual?</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A pragmatic two-arm, parallel group randomised controlled trial (RCT), of a 12-session facilitator-supported online cognitive behavioural self-management programme versus care as usual to manage symptoms of fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence in IBD. Patients will be recruited through a previous large-scale survey of unselected people with inflammatory bowel disease. The UK Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and global rating of symptom relief at 6 months are the co-primary outcomes, with multiple secondary outcomes measured also at 6 and 12 months post randomisation to assess maintenance. The RCT has an embedded pilot study, health economics evaluation and process evaluation.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">We will randomise 680 patients, 340 in each group. Demographic characteristics and outcome measures will be presented for both study groups at baseline. The UK-IBDQ and global rating of symptom relief at 6 and 12 months post randomisation will be compared between the study groups.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">The BOOST online self-management programme for people with IBD-related symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency has been designed to be easily scalable and implemented. If it is shown to improve patients’ quality of life, this trial will enable clinicians and patients to make informed management decisions. This is the first trial, to our knowledge, focused on multiple symptoms prioritised by both people with IBD and health professionals.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par37">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes unpredictable bouts of gut inflammation, with acute illness, diarrhoea, and pain. In remission, many people with IBD live with fatigue, chronic abdominal pain and bowel urgency/incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is no current cure for IBD, which usually starts in childhood or as a young adult. Most previous IBD research has focused on controlling inflammation. However, many people report continuing IBD-related fatigue (41%), abdominal pain (62%) and difficulty with continence (up to 75%) even when IBD is in remission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although patients in clinical remission may still have a burden of inflammation detected endoscopically or histologically, even patients with clinical and endoscopic/ histologic healing often continue to experience these symptoms. These symptoms limit peoples’ quality of life and ability to work and socialise. Patients feel that these symptoms are not taken seriously by health professionals and report that little help is given [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The James Lind Alliance IBD research priority-setting consensus put fatigue, pain and incontinence amongst the top 10 issues that IBD patients and clinicians want to be addressed by research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

              <title>Rationale for the choice of a cognitive behavioural intervention</title>
              <p id="Par39">Symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency/incontinence have a major impact on quality of life of people with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite this, there has been remarkably little research on managing these troublesome IBD symptoms. Cognitive behavioural (CB) theories of these symptoms in other conditions suggest that disease factors trigger symptoms, but an interaction of cognitive, behavioural, emotional, environmental and physiological factors may strengthen and/or perpetuate them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For instance, believing that pain and fatigue signal damage to the body (cognitions), may lead to avoidance of activity (behaviour) and distress (emotion). Distress activates the autonomic nervous system (physiology) which may generate additional symptoms, lead to poor sleep and perpetuate fatigue and pain. CB-based interventions which aim to alter these responses have been shown to reduce symptom severity and improve quality of life in other long-term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Online delivery of these interventions for chronic pain and fatigue appear effective in other conditions, with evidence of enhanced effects through the addition of minimal health care professional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Most studies in other medical conditions have focused on either fatigue or pain. Having separate CB interventions for each major symptom in IBD would create a substantive treatment burden. CB therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As IBS is a multi-symptom condition, including abdominal pain alongside bowel disturbance, creating a single intervention to help manage all three of these IBD symptoms seemed justified. To test this empirically and in line the MRC framework for developing and testing complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], we conducted a series of modelling studies and systematic reviews to define the specific cognitive and behavioural variables and treatment approaches that would benefit pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and urgency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] in IBD.</p>
              <p id="Par41">In separate studies, we have shown that severity and impact of fatigue and pain share several cognitive, emotional and behavioural correlates. For example, both pain and fatigue were found to correlate with depression, anxiety, focusing more on symptoms, interpreting these symptoms as signals of damage to the body and responding to symptoms with all-or-nothing or avoidance behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All-or-nothing behaviour is when individuals exert themselves when symptoms are mild or absent, feel extreme fatigue or pain as a result and then avoid activity or rest up until symptoms subside again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In IBD fatigue, psychosocial factors explained 41% of variance after controlling for disease status. In IBD pain, psychosocial factors explained 9.5% of variance in IBD pain severity and 24% of variance in IBD pain interference when controlling for demographic and clinical variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">Similar processes have been observed in people experiencing bowel urgency, as hypersensitivity to rectal sensation leads to constant monitoring of rectal contents (hypervigilance) and anxiety in anticipation of incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Anxiety stimulates gut peristalsis and triggers a need to rush to the toilet; running makes incontinence more likely. Amongst people with IBD-related incontinence, 58% feel that anxiety worsens incontinence; even those who never experience incontinence worry about the possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The long-term impact of these psychological responses may perpetuate and maintain low mood and symptom chronicity, due to the physiological effects of the stress response, disrupted circadian rhythms, deconditioning and inflammation via the autonomic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The aim of our intervention was therefore to target these transdiagnostic factors through evidence-based cognitive behavioural techniques focused on breaking vicious cycles, fostering self-management and improving quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par43">Our modelling work also identified specific symptom-related factors which are important to include. For instance, to manage urgency in IBD, behavioural methods to strengthen the pelvic floor and bowel retraining techniques (such as practicing ‘holding on’) help to re-build confidence and the ability to defer defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The intervention therefore needed to target both shared and symptom-specific cognitive and behavioural factors.</p>
              <p id="Par44">To provide an initial map for the content of the intervention, we drew the evidence base together in a conceptual logic model. We also drew content from previous evidence-based manuals for treating fatigue and pain in other conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and a self-management booklet for incontinence in IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Details of this process and the role of patient feedback to refine the intervention will be reported elsewhere (paper in development).</p>
              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Rationale for guided web-based self-management</title>
                <p id="Par45">People with IBD have been found to be willing to engage with, and complete, online self-management interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In a 12-month trial in 333 patients, 79.6% completed the study and 88% finding this feasible and preferable to face-to-face care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Some minimal health professional support has been shown to enhance engagement with self-management in IBD and other chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. People with IBD want to take a greater role in self-management, including information that is both therapeutic and supportive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Previous studies of online CBT in IBD have shown significantly improved quality of life, even when participants were recruited with no specific symptoms to be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">In other chronic illnesses, self-management has been shown to improve management of cognitive symptoms and reduce fatigue, distress and social limitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. CB models, theory and principles described above are ideally suited to self-management interventions, providing a clear structure to develop theoretical models and treatment mechanisms related to the outcome of interest (e.g. quality of life related interference of symptoms). CB models also map onto specific evidence-based techniques to enhance behavioural and cognitive change relevant to self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">Our previous experience of recruiting people with IBD for interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and extensive patient engagement and literature on the popularity of electronic self-management in IBD determined our choice of online self-management. Although people want help with symptoms, they do not want repeated hospital visits and may decline help offered on that basis. We therefore designed BOOST as an online, tailored CB-based self-management programme which patients could complete in their own time at home with some minimal guided support from an IBD nurse trained in the intervention.</p>

                <p id="Par61">A facilitator-supported, online, tailored self-management programme for fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence in people with IBD will result in better quality of life compared to care as usual at 6 months after randomisation.</p>

                <title>Design for the main RCT</title>
                <p id="Par62">The design is a pragmatic multi-centre two-arm, parallel group superiority RCT. We will compare facilitator-supported online self-management versus care as usual (CAU) to manage symptoms of fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence in IBD. There are one baseline assessment and two assessments at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Primary outcomes are as follows: IBD quality of life and global rating of symptom relief at 6 months. The CONSORT diagram for the RCT is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

                <p id="Par63">An internal pilot study will test planned methods and procedures for the main RCT and identify barriers to the components working together and potential recruitment issues. We will recruit and randomise the first 100 participants in the RCT, aiming to complete this within the first 6 months of the RCT recruitment. The methods planned for the main RCT will be followed. If no substantive changes are made, these 100 participants will be included in the main RCT analysis. Note: this pilot has been a little delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic and will now cover the first 10 months of the RCT.</p>

                <p id="Par65">People with IBD with symptoms of fatigue, pain and/or urgency will be recruited from people responding to our earlier IBD-BOOST survey (stage 2 of the programme) or from people who have completed the survey plus medical symptom optimisation study (stage 3 of the programme), who request further intervention for these symptoms and who meet our eligibility criteria (below). The survey was sent by post or an electronic link in an email to unselected patients with IBD by IBD clinic hospital sites, the UK national IBD BioResource or the charity Crohn’s &amp; Colitis UK. The completed surveys were returned by post or electronically.</p>
                <p id="Par66">The central IBD-BOOST research team will screen the IBD Survey (stage 2) responses and the follow-up questionnaires of participants in the IBD-BOOST Optimise study (stage 3) who have consented to be contacted for further research. Sufficient English and capacity for consent will be presumed from the previous response to the survey. A link to the online consent form for those who wish to participate in the RCT will be embedded in an email from a member of the central research team. If the online database is not available, paper copies of the Participant Information Leaflet and consent form will be sent.</p>

                <p id="Par78">After participants consent, they will self-complete an online or paper copy checklist to check eligibility criteria above. Following consent, we will screen patients for ‘red flags’. These are potentially serious issues identified by our clinical co-investigators that may be undetected underlying causes of symptoms. If a participant’s responses indicate a potential red flag, the participant will be advised to seek a consultation with their health care team and only recruited to the trial once the symptoms have been adequately investigated.</p>
                <p id="Par79">We will also send consenting participants who have not already taken part in IBD-BOOST Optimise (stage 3 of the programme, who will have already done this) a kit for testing the faecal calprotectin level (see below and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), but non-response to this test will NOT delay randomisation.</p>
                <p id="Par80">Additionally, item 9 (suicidal ideation) of the PHQ-9 in the baseline questionnaire (see below) will be reviewed to assess for risk of harm/suicidal ideation. If the participant has scored 2 or 3 (indicating frequent thoughts around suicidal ideation) then a risk assessment will be carried out by a psychologist by telephone. Participants assessed as low or medium risk will be able to continue into the trial, reminded of resources to access for further support and provided with an optional template letter to notify their GP. Appropriate urgent action will be taken for patients assessed as high risk and these individuals will not proceed into the trial.</p>

                <title>Study interventions</title>
                <p id="Par81">BOOST is a web-based programme for self-management of pain, fatigue and urgency/incontinence symptoms in IBD based on the principles of CBT. ‘BOOST’ was initially mapped out based on the theoretical models described above and then developed with extensive patient and IBD specialist nurse input. BOOST has undergone extensive user feasibility testing prior to the pilot study, as recommended by the Medical Research Council when developing complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par82">BOOST includes 12 online sessions which can be viewed on computer, smart phone or tablet (however, participants are advised that computer or tablet is likely to give a better view of the programme). The content has been developed to be interactive and tailored to patients’ needs. A number of logic pathways have been programmed into the programme alongside self-assessments, so the computer only provides content and tasks relevant to issues identified by the participant.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Sessions 1–7 are core sessions to be completed by all participants experiencing fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence. Based on a Cognitive Behavioural model of IBD symptoms, the core sessions cover topics around understanding IBD symptoms, balancing activity and exercise, sleep hygiene, changing negative thoughts, coping with stress and emotions, and making the most of social support. These core sessions have associated tasks for participants to complete in between sessions in their day-to day-life, such as working toward completing goals or keeping a sleep diary. Sessions 8–11 are symptom-specific sessions to be completed by participants experiencing or with a specific interest in fatigue, pain and faecal urgency/incontinence, respectively. Some of the content of the website was adapted from previous manuals using a similar approach for managing specific symptoms in IBD or with different illness populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> provides a summary of each session for all BOOST sessions. The symptom-specific sessions provide participants with more in-depth psychoeducation on the interaction between medical and psychosocial factors contributing to the severity and impact of the specific symptom, together with practical tips and ongoing exercises on how to better manage them.

                <p id="Par84">Participants will be able to log into BOOST via a computer, tablet or smart phone, according to their preference, and advised to complete approximately one session per week. Each session takes 30–60 min to complete. Participants will be able to complete the sessions at a time and place that is convenient to them and to pace themselves in a way that suits them and their lifestyle.</p>

                  <title>Facilitator support</title>
                  <p id="Par85">During the intervention, the participants will be supported by an assigned healthcare professional, who will act as their facilitator. Facilitators will be recruited (and trained) from our 15–20 sites, aiming for at least 2 per site, enhancing generalisability. Facilitators will predominantly include IBD nurses and a small number of academic psychologists within the research team in instances where nurses are not available, for instance supporting participants recruited through non-hospital sites.</p>
                  <p id="Par86">The programme suggests one 30-min phone call after participants have completed session 1, and then online messaging from the participant to the facilitator as the participant wishes thereafter. During the phone call, the facilitator will review the participant’s personal vicious cycle completed in session 1, guide the participant’s understanding of factors contributing to symptoms from a cognitive behavioural model and review the participant’s programme aims. Each facilitator will use a telephone checklist prompt sheet to guide the telephone call. At the end of each online session, the participant is prompted to consider if they want to send a message. The facilitator can reply to online messaging within the intervention platform. The facilitator will have access to information on how participants are using the intervention (sessions and task completed) and will monitor and help to promote participants’ engagement with the intervention, together with supporting participants work toward achievement of their intervention goals. Facilitators will be encouraged to log in weekly to check their participant’s completion of sessions/tasks and send any necessary messages to promote engagement, as well as reply to messages received.

                  <p id="Par88">Participants will log in to the online programme (unique login), undertake symptom self-assessment, prioritise what symptom they want to work on, with signposting to relevant sections depending on symptoms and response to online questions.

                  <p id="Par91">Participants in group 1 with an active IBD flare during intervention will not be expected to discontinue the intervention and will have continued access to the online programme. All randomised participants, regardless of whether they have reported a disease flare or not, will be sent the questionnaires to capture outcome measures at 6 and 12 months after randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">At 12 months, participants allocated to CAU will be offered access to the online intervention (but no facilitator support). Uptake within 6 months will be reported.</p>
                  <p id="Par93">For use of primary and secondary healthcare, other health care resources and medication use will be collected using the baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up questionnaires (see Economic Evaluation section below).</p>

                  <title>Facilitator training and intervention fidelity</title>
                  <p id="Par95">There will be specific training for facilitators on delivering the intervention and the principles of CBT via a manual (which contains the full text of the online intervention for reference) and a 1-day intensive course delivered by expert psychologists in the intervention development team. The training will introduce facilitators to the principles of a cognitive behavioural approach, provide opportunity to observe and practice telephone call role plays and review example models of vicious cycles of symptoms which participants will construct during session 1. The training will also cover responding to online messaging, and what to do in certain situations (e.g. the participant not engaging with the programme, getting stuck or frequent or persistent use of the messaging service). Adverse events will be discussed and the manual contains standard operating procedures (SOPs) for actions to be taken in certain scenarios, such as the participant appearing very depressed or suicidal.</p>
                  <p id="Par96">Facilitators will receive further training and supervision during the site initiation visit from the intervention development/trial team. Prior to starting the trial, facilitators will also receive one-to-one supervision on a ‘practice patient’ (a person with IBD from our Patient and Public Involvement panel) over a 2-week period. A practice telephone session between facilitator and patient will be audio-recorded for training purposes, where facilitators will use the telephone checklist prompt sheet to guide the call. Facilitators will receive feedback from a member of the intervention development team on the telephone conversation and online messaging responses with the practice patient.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Online messaging contacts will be recorded and analysed in the process evaluation (below). Facilitators will receive monthly supervision (or on request of the facilitator) with a trained member of the research team to ensure fidelity and provide support for any difficult issues that may arise. Supervision will include reviewing online messaging and tasks. Participants are told when they commence the online programme that their facilitator and the supervisor will be able to see their messages and tasks. Facilitators will complete the telephone checklist prompt sheet for each participant and provide these to the research team, and receive supervision on a trial patient telephone call, upon the patient’s permission for a psychologist to listen (but not audio record). At the end of the trial, a randomly selected sample of online messages will be rated for fidelity by an independent rater (see process evaluation below).</p>

                  <p id="Par123">Our primary outcome is the UK-IBDQ, range 0 to 120 where low values indicate poor quality of life. Using several published studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], we estimate the standard deviation of the change in score to be between 20 and 30. This would mean an effect size of 0.3 would equate to a difference of between 6 and 9 points on the scale. In the validation study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the difference in score between those with mild disease and disease in remission was 12 points and the effect of relapse was 10 points.</p>

Assuming there are 30 facilitators, they will each support ~ 11 patients on average of whom ~ 9 will contribute to the analysis. If the ICC for clustering between facilitator is 0.04, the design effect will be 1 + 0.04 × 8 = 1.32 and the effective sample size in the intervention arm is 270/1.32 = 204. 270 in the control and 204 in the intervention arm would allow an effect size of 0.3 to be detected with 90% power.</p>

If primary outcome measure is not returned by 8 weeks after the 6-month time point, an attempt will be made to have this (the IBDQ and global rating of symptom relief only) completed over the phone by a member of the central trial team reading out the questions and recording the responses.</p>

We will also interview at least two thirds of the facilitators who are IBD nurse specialists (approx. 20: or until apparent data saturation) to understand their views on supporting the online intervention and fit with their existing workload.</p>

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par177">To explore moderators of intervention effect</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par178">This will allow us to assess if there are any key subgroup effects and if the intervention should in future target specific groups of patients. For instance, if depression and disease activity moderate treatment effects, it may be best to focus the intervention on patients in remission and provide alternate treatment to people with depression. If medical treatment optimisation moderates outcome, then again this confirms best practice would be to provide optimised medical treatment before the intervention. Alternately, if there are no significant moderators of effects, the intervention may be generalisable to the broader IBD population.</p>
                <p id="Par179">Subgroup analyses to be investigated are those who underwent Optimise (stage 3); IBD in remission (see definition above); baseline measure of anxiety and depression (PHQ-9 and VSI); and ROME IV criteria for IBD met at baseline or not. These will be investigated by adding interactions terms to the analysis models used for the primary outcomes (UK- IBDQ and global symptom relief).

                <p id="Par181">Mediation analysis using structural equation models allows us to explore if a treatment effect occurs through hypothesised treatment mechanisms. We have based our choice of mediator measures on our cognitive behavioural model underpinning the intervention and described in our logic model (available on request form the lead author). Putative mediators have been mapped onto the key intervention components, i.e. the factors the intervention attempts to target to bring about improvements in symptom and quality of life. These include the following: the Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and PHQ-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] for symptoms of anxiety and depression; Self-efficacy for managing chronic disease 6-item scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; Brief Illness Perception questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]; All-or-nothing and avoidance/resting subscales from the Cognitive and Behavioural Responses to Symptoms questionnaire (CBRQ); IBD-Control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; faecal calprotectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]; satisfaction with outcome.</p>

If the online self-management programme for those with IBD-related symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency is shown to improve patients’ quality of life, this trial will enable clinicians and patients to make informed management decisions. The intervention has been designed to be easily scalable and implemented. This is to our knowledge the first trial focused on multiple symptoms that have been prioritised by both people with IBD and health professionals. If the intervention improves Quality of Life, it has potential to be adapted to the same symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency in other conditions or for additional symptoms of IBD to be added.</p>

                <p id="Par223">The day-to-day management of the study will be co-ordinated through the IBD-BOOST programme manager in collaboration with the CI, and through the Programme Management Group.</p>
                <p id="Par224">The Programme Management Group (PMG) includes all co-investigators of the IBD-BOOST programme as well as the research team. The PMG and research team are responsible for the planning, execution, analysis and writing up the project.</p>
                <p id="Par225">The programme is overseen by a Programme Steering Committee whose members are independent of the programme and liaise with the study funders, the NIHR. In the case of study deviations or serious breaches of protocol, study deviation forms will be completed and forwarded to the programme steering committee and the study sponsor.</p>
                <p id="Par226">Regarding the data monitoring committee, it is not considered necessary to have such a committee for this low-risk trial. The Programme Steering Committee will act in this capacity if needed and includes an independent statistician.</p>
                <p id="Par227">The patient and public involvement (PPI) team is responsible for contributing to development of all patient-facing materials and for co-analysing data generated.</p>
