                  <p id="Par1">The Chronic Headache Education and Self-Management Study (CHESS) multicentre randomised trial evaluated the impact a group education and self-management support intervention with a best usual care plus relaxation control for people living with chronic headache disorders (tension type headaches or chronic migraine, with or without medication overuse headache).

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The CHESS trial included 736 (380 intervention: 356 control) people across the Midlands and London UK. We used a mixed methods approach. Our extensive process evaluation looked at context, reach, recruitment, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity and experiences of participating in the trial, and included participants and trial staff. We also looked for evidence in our qualitative data to investigate whether the original causal assumptions underpinning the intervention were realised.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The CHESS trial reached out to a large diverse population and recruited a representative sample. Few people with chronic tension type headaches without migraine were identified and recruited. The expected ‘dose‘of the intervention was delivered to participants and intervention fidelity was high. Attendance (“dose received”) fell below expectation, although 261/380 (69%) received at least at least the pre-identified minimum dose. Intervention participants generally enjoyed being in the groups but there was little evidence to support the causal assumptions underpinning the intervention were realised.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">From a process evaluation perspective despite our extensive data collection and analysis, we do not have a clear understanding of why the trial outcome was negative as the intervention was delivered as planned. However, the lack of evidence that the intervention causal assumptions brought about the planned behaviour change may provide some insight. Our data suggests only modest changes in managing headache behaviours and some disparity in how participants engaged with components of the intervention within the timeframe of the study. Moving forwards, we need a better understanding of how those who live with chronic headache can be helped to manage this disabling condition more effectively over time.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">The Chronic Headache Education and Self-Management Study (CHESS) was a multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing a group education and self-management intervention with a best usual care plus relaxation control for participants living with chronic tension type headaches, chronic migraine with or without medication overuse headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It was a large, adequately powered, trial exploring the effect of the self-management intervention on the adverse impact of headache (social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, psychological distress and pain). No detectable effect was found for the intervention on headache related quality of life at 12 months. This was measured with HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test) - a measure of the adverse impact of headache on social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, and psychological distress. Among the predefined secondary outcomes, self-efficacy was improved in the self-management group at four and 12-months but there were no observable effects on headache days and severity, anxiety or depression. (Ref -Monograph and main paper).</p>
              <p id="Par16">Evaluation of the principal processes of a complex study helps to explain how an intervention could be optimised or why it may have failed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There is now a growing body of published process evaluations that help to put trial results into context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We conducted an extensive process evaluation (PE) alongside the CHESS trial using a mixed methods design collecting data on: context, reach, recruitment, dose-delivered, dose received, fidelity, and experiences of involvement in the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this paper, we report this process evaluation and explore why the intervention failed to achieve a detectable clinical effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>The CHESS randomised controlled trial</title>
                <p id="Par17">This was undertaken between 2017 and 2020 in two areas of the UK (The Midlands and Greater London). We published our intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and protocols for the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The latter includes the causal assumptions of the intervention. Participants were primarily recruited from 164 general practices following a search of electronic clinical records that was wide in scope as chronic headache was poorly coded. For the trial there were 736 randomised participants with chronic headache, the primary analysis was on the 727 participants with migraine. For this evaluation we include all 736 participants. The intervention used a cognitive behavioural approach including behaviour change techniques aimed at helping participants manage their headaches better. Following informed consent, but prior to randomisation, participants had a consultation with a CHESS trained nurse to classify their headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

                <p id="Par27">We entered quantitative data onto the study database and analysed using descriptive statistics. We took a random 3% sample of expression of interest forms from people who chose not to enter the trial and categorised reasons given. We assessed dose received based on the a priori definition of adherence for the trial: partial = day one plus one-to-one session, full = two sessions plus one-to-one.</p>
                <p id="Par28">We assessed fidelity of eight components of the intervention (see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) from audio recordings of group sessions using an approach used in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We took a random sample of three of these components from each group (see Supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Tables S1 – S3 &amp; Fig. S1, for further detail). One researcher (VN or DE) listened to these and rated adherence (whether the intervention was delivered as directed in the facilitators’ manual) and competence (a subjective assessment of facilitation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We assessed interrater reliability through DE and VN independently rating an 11% sample and comparing results. We took a random 10% sample (<italic>n</italic> = 27) of the case report forms completed as part of the one-to-one sessions and assessed whether the proforma for the session was fully completed.</p>
                <p id="Par29">We interviewed participants from both arms of the trial at four and 12-months post randomisation. Recruitment to the process evaluation is detailed in the process evaluation protocol. All participants provided informed consent to participant in the trial and a purposive sample of these who, at the time of consent, agreed that they could be contacted to consider involvement in the process evaluation interview study were informed and consented to this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We sampled for diversity of practice context and type of headache continuing until we achieved data saturation from participants in both trial arms. In the four-month interviews we explored experience of intervention and asked intervention participants about each of the sessions from the two days and their experience of the one-to-one that followed this. In the 12 month interviews we explored impact on headache management of the intervention. Interviews were mostly face-to-face at four-months and by telephone at 12-months. All interviews were audio recorded with consent. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and identifying data removed prior to analysis using the framework method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">On completion of the trial, we held focus groups with the nurses and allied health professionals (AHP) who delivered the intervention. These consisted of two parts: 1) nurses and AHP facilitators reflected on the training they received and their experiences of delivering the intervention; 2) nurse facilitators reflected on the nurse specific training they received and delivering the nurse one-to-one sessions. We analysed thematically.</p>
                <p id="Par31">We reported our full analysis in detail, online, prior to trial results becoming available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

                <p id="Par80">Among the nine control intervention participants interviewed, several found the pre-recorded guided relaxation session useful and used it regularly. Others did not find time in the day to devote time to relaxation or found the CD format inconvenient. In terms of the information provided by the study team, four control participants could not recall getting the information. Of the rest: One noted that the information was nothing new to them but then said that they did like the information about medications. Another noted that the information provided made them think about the triggers for their headaches. One participant commented that it made them aware of medication overuse headaches and as a result was careful with taking over the counter medications, also commenting that the information generally was useful. The final participant appreciated the information provided and being part of the study saying that the study “validated their headaches…”.</p>

                <title>Facilitator experiences explored in focus groups</title>
                <p id="Par81">Twelve nurse facilitators and four allied health professional facilitators participated. The facilitators were generally happy with their training. They noted that a considerable amount of unplanned preparation time was needed before each session. There were sometimes long delays between training and session delivery and refresher training would have been beneficial. Facilitators found some sessions more challenging to deliver, notably: Session 4. Acceptance, Session 5 Impact of thoughts mood and emotions on headaches, Session 14. Mindfulness and relaxation for headaches, Session 15. Medication management, and Session 18. Managing setbacks.</p>
                <p id="Par82">Nurse facilitators found their specific training excellent, although more role play might have been beneficial. They found the CHESS manual very useful. The one-to-one sessions required more time than planned with many participants divulging much personal information. The nurse facilitators suggested that some debriefing would have been helpful. They found MOH was a difficult topic although they felt that some participants came to a realisation of its relevance. They noted that most participants reported cutting down their medication gradually with good results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

Noting that whilst this study tried a novel approach to the treatment of chronic headache, they felt that the results implied it was clearly not enough. They felt that chronic headache is under researched, a ‘hidden’ condition, which is often misunderstood and a major cause of disability and time off work, impacting on all aspects of life. The group noted that chronic headaches should be seen as a long-term condition which needs coordinated long term medical review, support, signposting to appropriate clinicians, information and services which may be of benefit. Future research will be important to explore the most useful avenues. The group felt that the results of this study should be presented in a way that gives clinicians and the public an understanding that chronic headache is a complex condition which should be taken seriously and that there is further work to be done.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par90">The CHESS intervention was delivered as planned with good levels of fidelity consistent with similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Over two thirds of participants received at least the planned minimum dose, consistent with other chronic disease self-management studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par91">The opportunity to meet and have discussions with others who had a similar condition was valued by almost every study participant interviewed. Intervention group sessions were perceived as informative, but few people reported making changes to how they managed their headaches because of specific content. Most study participants had previous experience of keeping a headache diary. Although most participants valued the opportunity to discuss their medication in the one-to-one session with a nurse, only a few went on to discuss their medication with their GPs. Few participants interviewed for the process evaluation spoke of goal setting and none reported having achieved their goals. Twelve months after the intervention, participants reported little change to their headache management. There was little evidence to suggest that the causal assumptions for our intervention were realised within the time frame of our study.</p>
              <p id="Par92">Chronic headache is a condition that becomes embedded in all aspects of life. Our own systematic review completed in the early stages of this study, found that headache is a driver of behaviour, affects people’s relationships and is an ever present ‘spectre’ over their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This is echoed in more recent studies. A survey from Norway indicates that living with a chronic headache condition is associated with high levels of disability and considerable negative consequences for daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A US survey which included over a 1000 people with chronic migraine demonstrates the negative impacts that the condition has on sufferers including relationships, careers, finances, achievements, and overall health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An interview study from Spain found pain becomes the main focus of life and strongly impacts work and family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our intervention was insufficient to prompt enough change in the way our participants managed their headaches and their lives to bring about a detectable effect for the intervention on headache related quality of life at 12 months. There is emerging evidence that suggests why this might be. An interview study exploring goal management in chronic headache demonstrates the complexities of goal management, the effort involved and that this can be a prolonged process sometimes involving major life changes such as changing work or avoiding expanding family size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Some of our participants reported modest goal setting such as monitoring fluid intake and improving sleep hygiene with a few considering or making major changes to their life such as their work within the time frame of our study. A qualitative study of people with chronic migraine and MOH explores the difference between those who frequently relapse after structured withdrawal for MOH and those who less frequently relapse. The former tend to attribute headache to uncontrollable factors, are resigned to their headaches and use passive coping strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This may help explain the range of responses to the component of our intervention on MOH. Studies such as these that explore the complexities of responses to components of our intervention may help us understand how to personalise interventions both in terms of content and duration. Such interventions may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the evaluation</title>
                <p id="Par93">Our process evaluation was extensive and followed a published protocol. Our assessment of the fidelity of the intervention was comprehensive. The interview sample may not be large enough to capture the diversity of ways participants responded to the intervention. GP feedback was limited due to the COVID pandemic. Evaluation of the one-to-one sessions was limited to clinical record forms. Nearly one third of those in the intervention arm did not attend enough to achieve our definition of “partial adherence”, this could, potentially, have diluted the effects of the intervention. Finally, whilst we approached a large population the trial failed to identify and recruit those with TTH without co-existent migraine and as a result was predominantly those with migraine.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par94">Our intervention for chronic headache was delivered as planned and received by two thirds of participants. However, within the time frame of the study, there were only modest changes in how participants managed their headaches. The variation in how people responded to the components of the intervention suggests we need more understanding of how and why people respond as they do.</p>
