                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial extension including 86 patients, from baseline to week 97, the least squares mean (SE) change in forced vital capacity percent predicted increased by 2.65 (1.05) while continuing avalglucosidase alfa and by 0.36 (1.12) after switching from alglucosidase alfa. Frequency of potentially treatment-related adverse events was similar between treatment arms.</p>

Immunogenicity was assessed using a tiered bioanalytical strategy and validated assays. Antidrug antibodies (ADA) were detected using a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, confirmed by binding inhibition and titer by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. ADA-positive participants were further evaluated for neutralizing antibodies using both inhibition of enzymatic activity assay and cell-based inhibition of enzyme uptake assay.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Testing was done at Sanofi US, Biomarkers and Clinical Bioanalyses, Cambridge, Massachusetts.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Treatment-emergent AEs occurring in 10% or more of participants during avalglucosidase alfa treatment are summarized by number and percentage of participants experiencing events in eTable 1 in <xref rid="note-NOI230015-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 3</xref>. The most common events were headache (31 of 96 [32%]), nasopharyngitis (30 [31%]), arthralgia (28 [29%]), back pain (27 [28%]), diarrhea (23 [24%]), and nausea (22 [23%]).</p>
                <p>During the extension period, 5 patients discontinued treatment due to AEs, including 2 participants continuing avalglucosidase alfa (mild to moderate treatment-related nonserious AE for 1 participant and a moderate non–treatment-related serious AE for 1 participant) and 3 participants who switched (severe treatment-related serious AEs for 2 participants and a severe non–treatment-related serious AE for 1 participant). The AEs leading to discontinuation were ocular hyperemia (mild), erythema (mild), urticaria (severe), and respiratory distress (severe), all considered related to treatment, and acute myocardial infarction (moderate), considered unrelated to treatment. During the extension period, 1 participant who switched died of pancreatic adenocarcinoma that was considered unrelated to treatment.</p>
                <p>Most participants developed ADA during the primary analysis period, and given the cross-reactivity of ADA, most participants previously treated with alglucosidase alfa were positive for avalglucosidase alfa ADA at the time of switching (eTable 2 in <xref rid="note-NOI230015-1-s" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 3</xref>). Patients originally randomized to avalglucosidase alfa continued to decrease in ADA titers and additional participants tolerized during the extension period. Of the participants who switched who were negative at baseline, 1 developed low ADA titers and the others tolerized during the extension period. Fewer participants who switched were positive for neutralizing antibodies that inhibited enzyme activity or cellular uptake.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In the double-blind, primary analysis period of the phase 3 COMET trial, the totality of the data consistently showed a more favorable effect on respiratory function, ambulation, functional endurance, health-related quality of life, and safety for treatment-naive participants with LOPD treated with avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The COMET extension period has demonstrated stabilization and maintenance of these early improvements for participants treated with avalglucosidase alfa over 97 weeks of treatment as well as stabilization of these clinical parameters during the first 48 weeks of avalglucosidase alfa treatment among participants initially treated with alglucosidase alfa. Furthermore, participants who switched functionally stabilized and did not have an increase in AEs or immunogenicity, demonstrating the ability for patients to make this switch safely in a clinical setting.</p>
              <p>The initial results from the COMET trial extension add to a growing body of evidence supporting avalglucosidase alfa’s ability to improve or stabilize disease parameters, including in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with LOPD in the phase 1 NEO1 trial of avalglucosidase alfa<sup><xref rid="noi230015r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> and up to 6 years in the phase 2 NEO-EXT extension study.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Patients in the NEO-EXT study received avalglucosidase alfa (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg every other week) for 6 months before entering the NEO-EXT study, and eventually all received 20 mg/kg every other week, which is what patients in the COMET trial received. In the phase 2 Mini-COMET trial of children with IOPD and incomplete response to alglucosidase alfa, avalglucosidase alfa, 40 mg/kg every 2 weeks, demonstrated stabilization or improvement in exploratory efficacy outcomes, including GMFM-88, QMFT, Pompe–Paediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and left ventricular mass <italic>z</italic> score, even in a subset of patients who had previously received 40 mg/kg per week.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Stabilization of respiratory function, ambulation, and functional endurance are important benefits for patients with LOPD in the context of the progressive decline of untreated Pompe disease<sup><xref rid="noi230015r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and the decline observed during long-term treatment with alglucosidase alfa.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Participants of the COMET trial who switched from alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa after week 49 did not show the same improvements observed among treatment-naive participants who started avalglucosidase alfa treatment in the double-blind treatment period. This lack of improvement may be related to ongoing progression of disease pathology, incomplete degradation of glycogen during alglucosidase alfa treatment, and potential irreversible muscle damage during time taking alglucosidase alfa, which is known to yield lower cellular enzyme uptake compared with avalglucosidase alfa.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="noi230015r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although the relative improvements in FVC and 6MWT with avalglucosidase alfa are small, they show that avalglucosidase alfa can offset the natural course of this progressive disease more potently than alglucosidase alfa, which is meaningful for patients and their families. The positive effect on patient quality of life is evident in the consistent patient-reported improvements across Pompe-specific measures (PGIC score, PDSS total symptom score, and PDIS difficulty performing activities score). Taken together, these findings suggest a benefit to treating patients with avalglucosidase alfa earlier in their disease.</p>
              <p>We observed small declines in functional endurance measures (6MWT, HHD, and QMFT) during weeks 73-97. In the NEO-EXT study, declines in 6MWT distance during long-term follow-up were seen among patients 45 years and older, but those younger than 45 years had gains in 6MWT distance.<sup><xref rid="noi230015r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The authors attributed this to interaction of age-related physiologic muscle wasting (sarcopenia) with LOPD and possibly other comorbidities affecting mobility or exercise tolerance in older patients. In addition, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic overlapped with the COMET extension period, and treatment compliance was affected; 19 of 25 patients who missed 2 or more consecutive infusions were attributable to the pandemic. While it is difficult to assess the impact of stay-at-home orders and self-imposed restrictions on physical activity, declines in functional measures may also reflect a more sedentary lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the pandemic requirement to wear face masks may have affected assessment of functional measures at later time points.</p>
              <p>Data from the COMET double-blind treatment period suggested a more favorable safety profile with avalglucosidase alfa compared with alglucosidase alfa, with similar proportions of participants experiencing AEs (44 of 51 [86%] vs 45 of 49 [92%], respectively) and lower rates of serious AEs (8 [16%] vs 12 [25%]) and protocol-defined IARs (13 [26%] vs 16 [33%]).<sup><xref rid="noi230015r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> The longer-term results show a similar safety profile for avalglucosidase alfa among participants who were treatment naive at the start of avalglucosidase alfa treatment and those who switched from alglucosidase alfa. Serious AE rates during the extension period were similar for those continuing avalglucosidase (12 of 51 [23.5%]) and those who switched (10 of 44 [22.7%]).</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations. During the extension phase of COMET, there was no comparator group because all patients were receiving avalglucosidase alfa, and thus no direct comparison can be made over this period to long-term alglucosidase alfa treatment. Data from the ongoing real-world experience with avalglucosidase alfa will provide additional evidence of its effectiveness and safety.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In the COMET trial extension period, participants treated with avalglucosidase alfa for up to 97 weeks maintained improvements in respiratory function, motor function, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life that began in the first 49 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, participants who switched to avalglucosidase alfa after 49 weeks of treatment with alglucosidase alfa maintained disease stability as assessed by these parameters. In both treatment groups, no new safety or immunogenicity-related concerns were observed. Data from the COMET trial support long-term maintenance of positive clinical outcomes for patients receiving avalglucosidase alfa treatment.</p>
