                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>In the anifrolumab systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) trial programme, there was one trial (TULIP-1) in which BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) responses favoured anifrolumab over placebo, but the SLE Responder Index (SRI(4)) treatment difference was not significant. We investigated the degree of concordance between BICLA and SRI(4) across anifrolumab trials in order to better understand drivers of discrepant SLE trial results.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>TULIP-1, TULIP-2 (both phase 3) and MUSE (phase 2b) were randomised, 52-week trials of intravenous anifrolumab (300 mg every 4 weeks, 48 weeks; TULIP-1/TULIP-2: n=180; MUSE: n=99) or placebo (TULIP-1: n=184, TULIP-2: n=182; MUSE: n=102). Week 52 BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes were assessed for each patient.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Most patients (78%–85%) had concordant BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes (Cohen’s Kappa 0.6–0.7, nominal p&lt;0.001). Dual BICLA/SRI(4) response rates favoured anifrolumab over placebo in TULIP-1, TULIP-2 and MUSE (all nominal p≤0.004). A discordant TULIP-1 BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) responder subgroup was identified (40/364, 11% of TULIP-1 population), comprising more patients receiving placebo (n=28) than anifrolumab (n=12). In this subgroup, placebo-treated patients had lower baseline disease activity, joint counts and glucocorticoid tapering rates, and more placebo-treated patients had arthritis response than anifrolumab-treated patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Across trials, most patients had concordant BICLA/SRI(4) outcomes and dual BICLA/SRI(4) responses favoured anifrolumab. A BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) responder subgroup was identified where imbalances of key factors driving the BICLA/SRI(4) discordance (disease activity, glucocorticoid taper) disproportionately favoured the TULIP-1 placebo group. Careful attention to baseline disease activity and monitoring glucocorticoid taper variation will be essential in future SLE trials.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems and causes substantial disease burden.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> As standard therapies do not always adequately control disease activity, additional effective SLE-targeted therapies are needed, which has led to unprecedented SLE clinical trial activity over the last two decades. Efficacy assessments in these trials often use composite indices of global lupus disease activity, such as the BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) and the SLE Responder Index (SRI).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Anifrolumab is a human monoclonal antibody to the type I interferon receptor that is approved in the United States, Japan and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe SLE receiving standard therapy.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> Anifrolumab was investigated in patients with SLE in the phase 2b MUSE trial and in the phase 3 TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> Clinical responses were assessed using both the BICLA and SRI(4) composite indices.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> MUSE had an SRI(4)-based primary endpoint and, given the robust outcomes, SRI(4) was originally selected as the primary endpoint for TULIP-1 and TULIP-2. BICLA, a secondary endpoint that also yielded robust outcomes in MUSE and TULIP-1, was subsequently designated the primary endpoint in TULIP-2 prior to unblinding of the TULIP-2 dataset.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In TULIP-2, anifrolumab demonstrated a statistically significant benefit compared with placebo measured by both BICLA and SRI(4) responses at week 52; similar results were also observed in MUSE.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> In TULIP-1, the effect of anifrolumab 300 mg on BICLA response was of similar magnitude to that seen in TULIP-2 and MUSE; however, the treatment difference between anifrolumab and placebo with SRI(4) did not achieve statistical significance.</p>
              <p>While BICLA and SRI(4) both evaluate clinically meaningful elements of global SLE disease activity,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> differences in their metric properties may give rise to inconsistent classification of a patient’s response between these measures.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The BILAG-2004 index, on which the BICLA is anchored, grades each manifestation according to severity and the physician’s intention to treat; it also captures incremental, clinically meaningful improvement or worsening.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 17 18</xref> By contrast, the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), on which the SRI(4) is anchored, consists of dichotomous scoring (present/absent) of each manifestation independent of severity and assigns differential weights to the SLEDAI-2K elements.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 19 20</xref> To be a BICLA responder, a patient must have at least partial improvement in all severe (BILAG-2004 A) or moderate (BILAG-2004 B) clinical manifestations affected at baseline, whereas to be an SRI(4) responder, a patient needs to have complete resolution of enough manifestations affected at baseline to reduce the total SLEDAI-2K score by ≥4 points.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>In this analysis, we investigated the degree of concordance between BICLA and SRI(4) across anifrolumab trials to better understand drivers of discrepant SLE trial results. In particular, we aimed to determine whether a subgroup of patients with discordant BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes could be identified that may explain the lack of significant SRI(4) treatment difference in TULIP-1 and, more generally, whether we could draw lessons to inform future SLE trial design/execution.</p>

                <p>In TULIP-1 and TULIP-2, attempts to taper oral glucocorticoids to ≤7.5 mg/day (prednisone or equivalent) were mandatory between weeks 8 and 40 for patients receiving ≥10 mg/day at baseline, and taper was considered sustained if maintained from weeks 40 to 52. In MUSE, oral glucocorticoid tapering was encouraged for all patients but was at the discretion of investigators.</p>

                <p>Most placebo-treated patients in the TULIP-1 BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) responder subgroup attained an SRI(4) response as a result of their arthritis response (22/28, 78.6%) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>); 25.0% (7/28) of patients in the placebo group attained resolution only in the arthritis domain, whereas none of the 12 anifrolumab-treated patients had responses solely restricted to the arthritis domain (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). In the anifrolumab 300 mg group, domain improvements that led to SRI(4) responses showed more variation, with 6 (50%) patients attaining a SLEDAI-2K arthritis response. The proportion of patients with musculoskeletal responses at week 52 is also presented for the BICLA responder/SRI(4) responder, BICLA responder/SRI(4) non-responder, and BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) non-responder subgroups in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S6</xref>; the proportion of patients with arthritis response was similar between treatment groups in the concordant subgroups.

However, patients in this subgroup were BICLA non-responders because other moderate or severe organ involvement did not resolve. The most common reason for a BICLA non-response in this subgroup was a lack of improvement in BILAG-2004 rash in both the anifrolumab (8/12, 66.7%) and placebo groups (24/28, 85.7%) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S7</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Across the three trials in the anifrolumab clinical development programme for the treatment of patients with SLE, consistent BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes favouring anifrolumab were observed in TULIP-2 and MUSE, but not in TULIP-1.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref> At an individual patient level, we identified a high level of concordance between the BICLA and SRI(4) composite endpoints across all trials. The proportion of patients in TULIP-1 who met the stringent ‘dual responder’ criteria was greater with anifrolumab than placebo and was similar to the effect size for ‘dual responders’ seen in TULIP-2, supporting a beneficial effect of anifrolumab on disease activity in patients with SLE. To our knowledge, this is the first time a ‘dual responder’ group has been defined in a clinical trial setting.</p>
              <p>Discordant outcomes were observed in small proportions of patients in all three trials. In contrast to the TULIP-2 and MUSE trials, in which the proportions of discordant patients were similar in the anifrolumab and placebo treatment groups, BICLA non-responders/SRI(4) responders were more frequent in the TULIP-1 placebo group. This patient subgroup likely contributed to the lack of a significant SRI(4) treatment difference in TULIP-1.</p>
              <p>In the TULIP-1 BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) responder subgroup, the primary reason for SRI(4) response was SLEDAI-2K resolution of arthritis (with a weight of 4 points). Arthritis improvement is sufficient to achieve individual SRI(4) responses, but alone is insufficient for a BICLA response unless all other baseline BILAG-2004 A and B organ activity improves.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Baseline joint scores tended to be lower in the discordant placebo group than the anifrolumab group; therefore, SLEDAI-2K arthritis responses, and hence SRI(4) responses, may have been achieved more easily in the placebo group. In TULIP-1, residual clinical manifestations, which remained after arthritis improvement (predominantly rash), accounted for most of the patients classified as SRI(4) responders but BICLA non-responders.</p>
              <p>In this same discordant TULIP-1 subgroup, smaller numbers of patients in the placebo vs the anifrolumab group achieved glucocorticoid taper. As such, the combination of less frequent glucocorticoid tapering and fewer active joints may have inflated the proportion of patients with an SRI(4) response in the placebo group. Fewer patients in the placebo group tapered glucocorticoids despite lower baseline joint involvement; this was surprising, since these patients may have been less likely to need high-dose glucocorticoids.</p>
              <p>These variations in glucocorticoid tapering may reflect regional differences in standard therapy use. In TULIP-1, there was a baseline imbalance in patients enrolled from Eastern vs Western Europe between the anifrolumab and placebo groups. Regional differences in placebo group response rates have been previously identified, with higher SRI(4) response rates with standard therapy in patients from Eastern Europe and Central America than those in Western Europe or North America.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In a previous international inception cohort study, there was significant between-centre variation in glucocorticoid use, even after adjustment for factors known to influence glucocorticoid dose.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Our observations from TULIP-1 confirm that physician glucocorticoid prescribing behaviour varies<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> which, if not accounted for, can contribute to an imbalance in trial outcomes. Inconsistent BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes should be expected given their different definitions and is consistent with previous findings in other trials. A previous phase 2 trial of epratuzumab reported similar disagreement between SRI(4) and BICLA, resulting in a higher placebo response rate using SRI(4).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Despite similar SRI(4) and BICLA placebo response rates (33%) in a phase 2 trial of ustekinumab, SRI(4) response with ustekinumab was 62%, compared with a BICLA response of 35%.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Two previous reviews comparing BICLA and SRI(4) concluded that, while both are viable tools for use as primary endpoints in SLE studies, differences in the trial populations and in study designs can impact the outcomes of each measure.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 28</xref> Our findings add further evidence to support this conclusion.</p>
              <p>This secondary analysis of TULIP-1 data provides important lessons for future SLE trial design. Variations in the number of active organ domains and joint counts at baseline, glucocorticoid prescribing/tapering practices and/or regions of trial recruitment may all increase the risk of discordant BICLA and SRI(4) outcomes. Baseline imbalances in these demographic and clinical factors potentially jeopardise the primary outcome; therefore, every effort should be made to ensure adequate balancing of these factors at study entry and during clinical trials. As regional differences in glucocorticoid tapering have been reported,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> additional sponsor-led training to normalise glucocorticoid tapering practice across centres may result in more standardised handling of background medications and more consistent placebo response rates in multicentre clinical trials.</p>
              <p>In addition, setting minimum thresholds at enrolment for active joint counts, rash, oral ulcers and alopecia may improve the stringency of an endpoint such as SRI(4), which can be confounded by improvement in one or two highly-weighted organ domains in patients with low baseline disease activity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 29</xref> As SLEDAI-2K/SRI scoring may allow patients with lower joint counts to achieve the threshold for ‘response’, lupus trials may also benefit from the use of less subjective methods to assess lupus arthritis disease activity. This may require more refined clinical assessment of joints and/or imaging modalities such as MRI or ultrasound; however, imaging brings additional challenges of training and added expense, particularly in phase 3 trials.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref>
</p>
              <p>There were limitations in this study. This was a post hoc analysis, although of prospectively collected data. The numbers of patients in each treatment group in the discordant subgroups were relatively small, particularly for anifrolumab-treated patients, which prevents firm conclusions being drawn from comparisons between the anifrolumab and placebo groups. The complexity of trial outcomes and inclusion criteria may limit the extent to which these findings are generalisable to clinical practice. Furthermore, elements of the proposed explanation for the TULIP-1 SRI(4) discrepancy rely on circumstantial connections rather than a demonstrated causal relationship. However, analysis of future datasets may serve to validate these observations.</p>
              <p>To conclude, in individual patient-level analyses, the majority of patients across the TULIP-1, TULIP-2 and MUSE trials of anifrolumab had concordant outcomes on BICLA and SRI(4). Using a stringent definition of response requiring dual BICLA and SRI(4) response, anifrolumab treatment was associated with efficacy compared with placebo in all three trials. A discordant BICLA non-responder/SRI(4) responder subgroup was identified in all three trials but this subgroup was larger in the TULIP-1 placebo group. Discordance was primarily driven by the sensitivity of SRI(4) to single organ (arthritis) improvement as the discordant placebo group was enriched for patients with lower baseline joint counts. The BICLA definition was less sensitive to this treatment group imbalance due to a requirement for at least partial improvement in all domains that were scored with moderate or severe BILAG-2004 scores at entry. Discordant placebo-treated patients showed regional recruitment variation, tended to have lower baseline disease activity and were less likely to taper glucocorticoids, providing additional reasons for higher placebo response rates. Given the emphasis placed on primary endpoint attainment in phase 3 trials by regulators, factors that jeopardise study outcomes need to be recognised and mitigated during trial design and execution. Confirmation of our observations in other trial cohorts may also suggest ways in which we can improve on current composite endpoints in a data-driven fashion. For now, we suggest that careful attention to baseline factors and maintaining uniformity in glucocorticoid tapering are essential in future SLE clinical trials to reduce the likelihood of discordant results and maximise the ability to detect efficacy signals.</p>
