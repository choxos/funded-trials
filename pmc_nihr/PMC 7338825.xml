                  <p id="Par1">
To support future dosing recommendations, the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of adavosertib, a first-in-class, small-molecule reversible inhibitor of WEE1 kinase, was assessed in patients with advanced solid tumors.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In this Phase I, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study, the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg adavosertib dose were investigated in fed versus fasted states.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Compared with the fasted state, a high-fat, high-calorie meal (fed state) decreased adavosertib maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) by 16% and systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration–time curve [AUC]) by 6%; AUC<sub>0–<italic>t</italic></sub> decreased by 7% and time to maximum plasma concentration was delayed by 1.97 h (<italic>P </italic>= 0.0009). The 90% confidence interval of the geometric least-squares mean treatment ratio for AUC and AUC<sub>0–<italic>t</italic></sub> was contained within the no-effect limits (0.8–1.25), while that of <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> crossed the lower bound of the no-effect limits. Adverse events (AEs) related to adavosertib treatment were reported by 20 (64.5%) of the 31 patients treated in this study. Grade ≥ 3 AEs were reported by four (12.9%) patients (one in the fed state, three in the fasted state); two of these AEs were considered treatment-related by the investigator. Three serious AEs were reported in three (9.7%) patients; these were not considered treatment-related. No patients discontinued because of treatment-related AEs, and no new safety signals were reported.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">A high-fat meal did not have a clinically relevant effect on the systemic exposure of adavosertib, suggesting that adavosertib can be administered without regard to meals.</p>

              <p id="Par5">Adavosertib (AZD1775) is an orally active, first-in-class, small-molecule reversible inhibitor of WEE1 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. WEE1 is a protein tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which drives cells from the G2 phase into mitosis, and CDK2, which drives cells through the S phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In response to DNA damage, WEE1 inhibits both CDK1, to maintain the cell in an inactive state and prevent mitosis, and CDK2, to delay the replication process and allow time for DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Through inhibition of WEE1, adavosertib prevents G2 cell cycle arrest, leading to premature mitosis, and enhances CDK2 activation in cells in the S phase; this results in uncontrolled DNA replication and replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The majority of human cancers have abnormalities in the p53 G1/S checkpoint, making them more dependent on the S and G2 checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The S and G2 checkpoint abrogation induced by adavosertib could selectively enhance killing of p53-deficient tumor cells when administered in combination with other anticancer agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], while single-agent activity may be achieved in tumor cells by inducing high levels of replication stress and/or endogenous DNA damage, resulting in mitotic catastrophe. With this in mind, adavosertib is being developed for use as a chemosensitizing agent in combination with one or more cytotoxic agents, or with olaparib, or with durvalumab, and as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The mechanism of action of adavosertib was confirmed in a Phase I study, which provided the first direct evidence of a reduction in phosphorylated Tyr15-Cdk (a target of WEE1 kinase) levels in paired tumor biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This study also provided concurrent evidence for a DNA damage response (based on increased levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX) and, thus, demonstrated the single-agent activity of adavosertib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other Phase I studies have assessed the safety and tolerability of adavosertib as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and in combination with chemotherapy, olaparib, or durvalumab in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Multiple dosing schedules have been evaluated for adavosertib mono- and combination therapy to maximize clinical activity and minimize toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">In addition to these Phase I studies, Phase II data have shown adavosertib to have promising antitumor activity in women with <italic>TP53</italic>-mutated ovarian cancer refractory or resistant to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy when administered in combination with carboplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Preliminary results from an open-label, four-arm, Phase II study of adavosertib plus four different types of chemotherapy regimens in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer also suggested that adavosertib plus carboplatin shows promise in terms of efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, a randomized Phase II study, also in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, has demonstrated that adavosertib and gemcitabine combination therapy improves treatment efficacy compared with gemcitabine alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The pharmacokinetic parameters of single-dose adavosertib are approximately linear and increase in a dose-proportional manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Adavosertib is absorbed at a modest rate, with a median time to peak plasma concentration (<italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) of 3–4 h and terminal half-life of 9.0–12.3 h following single doses of 325–1300 mg in patients with advanced solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In vitro data indicate that the major pathway of adavosertib metabolism in humans involves CYP3A4, although FMO3 and FMO5 may also be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with no significant metabolites representing &gt; 10% of unchanged adavosertib in human plasma.</p>
              <p id="Par9">It is critical that the effect of food on drug exposure is investigated early in clinical development because food can alter systemic exposure of an orally administered drug and mitigate or exacerbate toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. FDA guidance stipulates that food effect studies should be conducted early in the drug development process (ideally Phase I) in oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Knowing whether food affects the bioavailability of a drug before the pivotal trial can help to optimize study design, increase patient comfort by avoiding unnecessary fasting, reduce cost and ultimately improve efficiency in oncology drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The data from several food effect studies for orally administered cancer drugs were the subject of a review published in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Of the 16 drugs with available data, only two had completed food effect data collection before the start of the pivotal trial. Consequently, for four of the 14 drugs with a food effect study that was completed after the pivotal study, the food restrictions on the label were different to those imposed in the trial.</p>

A total of 15 patients were assigned to treatment sequence 1 and 16 patients to treatment sequence 2. Three patients discontinued treatment because of worsening of the disease, resulting in 28 patients (14 per treatment sequence) who completed the study. As the three patients discontinued treatment after having received one dose of adavosertib (one in the fasted state and two in the fed state), data for the study safety and PK analyses were available for 29 and 30 patients in the fasted and fed states, respectively.

                <p id="Par26">Fourteen patients had important protocol deviations. Of these, six were excluded from the PK analysis: one patient in the fasted state was excluded because it was uncertain whether movicolon had been withheld for 3 h before and after adavosertib dosing in accordance with the protocol; and five patients in the fed state were excluded, one because they received metoclopramide, potentially affecting the absorption of adavosertib, and four because they received adavosertib more than 45 min after the start of the meal. By accounting for these six excluded patients and the three patients who had discontinued because of worsening of the disease after the first treatment period, data were available for the final PK analysis for 28 and 25 patients in the fasted and fed states, respectively.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par41">The purpose of this Phase I, open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover study was to assess the effect of food on the PK of a single oral dose of 300 mg adavosertib in patients with advanced solid tumors. Food is an important extrinsic factor that may influence the PK profile of a drug because it can change the extent of absorption, or delay absorption by decreasing the rate of gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">The current study was designed to meet key FDA recommendations for a food effect study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Specifically, the FDA recommends a two-period, two-sequence crossover design testing a fed and a fasting condition to support the clinical development of a new agent. Furthermore, to generate the maximum possible effect on systemic drug availability, the fed group should receive a high-fat, high-calorie meal consisting of 50% calories from fat and 800–1000 calories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The current study was not, however, conducted in healthy volunteers because adavosertib is a DNA damage response inhibitor, and it is neither safe nor ethical to administer this anticancer agent to healthy individuals. Therefore, the study was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors for which standard therapy did not exist or had proven ineffective or intolerable.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of food on the PK of a single dose of adavosertib following oral dosing. Co-administration of adavosertib with food did not meaningfully affect its systemic exposure (AUC, AUC<sub>0–<italic>t</italic></sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) compared with administration in the fasted state. Co-administration of adavosertib with food decreased geometric LS mean systemic exposure by 6% (AUC) and 7% (AUC<sub>0–<italic>t</italic></sub>), and decreased geometric LS mean <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> by approximately 16%, compared with the fasted state. The decrease in adavosertib exposure was not considered to be clinically relevant.</p>
              <p id="Par44">The secondary objective of this study was to characterize the PK of a single dose of adavosertib following oral administration. Adavosertib taken with food delayed the rate of absorption (median <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>) by approximately 2 h compared with administration in the fasted state. The study also assessed the safety and tolerability of a single dose of adavosertib following oral administration. The safety profile of single-dose adavosertib in this study was consistent with its known safety profile as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most prevalent AEs were gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea). Four patients experienced AEs of grade 3 or worse; these were considered to be treatment-related in two patients (one in the fed state and one in the fasted state). Of the three SAEs reported in three patients, none were considered to be treatment-related. No significant AEs of clinical importance were observed in this study, nor were new safety signals identified.</p>
              <p id="Par45">The results of this study have several important clinical implications; for example, a lack of food effect minimizes the risk of unintended alterations to drug exposure, toxicity, and efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, food restrictions associated with a dosing regimen can have a negative impact on patient adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], especially when cancer patients are taking multiple agents with different and confusing instructions relating to dosing with food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. For cancer treatments that are subject to positive food effects, resources may subsequently be used in the development of alternative formulations that negate the restriction of a food label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">The study also has a number of limitations. Patients only received single doses of adavosertib; thus, although this is sufficient for PK assessments, no comparison could be made between the fed and fasted states in relation to toxicities occurring with the full treatment schedules, such as myelosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To that end, the AEs reported herein occurring in the fed and fasted states were observational; no formal analyses were performed, and it is not possible to conclude whether adavosertib is better tolerated when administered with or without food. The high-fat, high-calorie meal consumed by patients in this study was based on FDA guidance; therefore, the assumption was made that it would have the greatest effect on gastrointestinal physiology and would thus have the maximum effect on systemic drug availability. All patients in the present study received intravenous anti-emetic medication with granisetron or ondansetron prior to adavosertib administration; while no formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed with adavosertib, a potential drug–drug interaction seems unlikely based on the low potential of these agents to significantly induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Finally, the small sample size was chosen to balance the need to gain adequate PK data against exposing as few patients as possible to study procedures. No formal hypothesis testing was planned, and no conclusions can be drawn in relation to the efficacy of adavosertib.</p>
              <p id="Par47">In summary, administration of adavosertib 300 mg as a single oral dose following a high-fat, high-calorie meal did not have a clinically relevant effect on its systemic exposure, and the data from this study suggest that adavosertib can be administered in a fasted or fed state. Excluding SAEs and events leading to discontinuation of study treatment, no other significant AEs of clinical importance were observed in this study. Furthermore, no new safety signals were identified in this study.</p>
