                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is being actively
researched as an adjunct to psychotherapy. It may be beneficial
to trust, empathy and cooperative behaviour due to its acute
prosocial effects.</p>

                <sec id="section2-0269881120926673">
                  <title>Aim:</title>
                  <p>To test (a) the acute effects of MDMA on measures of empathy, trust
and cooperative behaviour, and (b) subacute changes in mood
three days after MDMA administration.</p>

                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Twenty-five participants (<italic>n</italic>=7 female),
participated in this double-blind, repeated-measures,
placebo-controlled experiment. Participants attended two acute
sessions, one week apart. Each acute session was followed by a
subacute session three days later. Participants received placebo
(100 mg ascorbic acid) during one acute session, and MDMA
(100 mg MDMA-HCl) at the other, with order counterbalanced.
Participants completed the following tasks assessing prosocial

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug being actively researched as
a possible adjunct to psychotherapy, with 17 Phase II clinical trials either
ongoing or already completed (<xref rid="bibr35-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schenberg, 2018</xref>). Phase II trials
focusing on patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have yielded
large (0.8) effect sizes (<xref rid="bibr32-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer et al., 2019</xref>). The
mechanism by which MDMA might improve psychotherapy outcomes is yet to be
established. Testing MDMA’s effect on social processes and behaviours in
laboratory studies has yielded mixed results (<xref rid="bibr21-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kamilar-Britt and Bedi,
2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>Acutely, MDMA consistently induces self-reported prosocial effects when given
in clinical trials and when used recreationally (‘recreational MDMA’). For
recreational users, these have been reported as an increased feeling of
‘closeness’ to others and greater interactions with others (<xref rid="bibr2-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Baylen and Rosenberg,
2006</xref>). In laboratory studies, the subjective effects of MDMA
include feelings of ‘sociable’ or ‘gregarious’ (<xref rid="bibr5-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Bedi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr23-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al.,
2014a</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2014c</xref>),
‘close to others’ (<xref rid="bibr18-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek
et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr19-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek and Liechti, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al.,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>), and ‘trusting’ (<xref rid="bibr11-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Dolder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al.,
2014</xref>). However, laboratory evidence concerning MDMA’s prosocial
effects on trust, empathy and cooperative behaviour is mixed.</p>
              <p>Emotional empathy appears to be enhanced by MDMA (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al.,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>). For cognitive empathy, MDMA may impair
accurate recognition of negative emotions (<xref rid="bibr11-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Dolder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bibr18-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al.,
2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek
et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr43-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Wardle and de Wit, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr4-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Bedi et al.,
2010</xref>). However, null drug effects on cognitive empathy have also been
reported (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al.,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr13-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers et al.,
2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>Results are mixed for the effect of MDMA on perceived trustworthiness. A
naturalistic study, in which participants took their own recreational MDMA
and were assessed in their homes, reported increases (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>).
Conversely, one laboratory study found a null effect (<xref rid="bibr25-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2014c</xref>).</p>
              <p>In the same naturalistic study, Stewart and colleagues also assessed the effect
of recreational MDMA on cooperative behaviour, finding a prosocial effect on
both the ultimatum and dictator games. A laboratory experiment of MDMA on
the ultimatum game also found a prosocial effect (<xref rid="bibr12-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>Other laboratory studies have found positive effects of MDMA on the social
value orientation (SVO) (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al., 2014</xref>), the prisoner’s dilemma (<xref rid="bibr13-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al.,
2019</xref>) and the welfare-trade off tasks (<xref rid="bibr22-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al., 2015</xref>). At a
lower (75 mg) dose, others have found null effects of MDMA on a trust game,
which assesses trust and cooperative behaviour (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers et al., 2014</xref>), and on the
SVO (<xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al.,
2014</xref>). In summary, existing research into MDMA’s effects on
empathy, trust and cooperative behaviour has produced inconsistent
results.</p>
              <p>Use of recreational MDMA has been shown to lead to low mood a few days after
having taken the drug: the ‘mid-week blues’ (<xref rid="bibr10-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Curran and Travill, 1997</xref>). This
has also been found in a laboratory study of MDMA 24 hours after drug
administration (<xref rid="bibr28-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Liechti
et al., 2001</xref>), though this was not replicated in a pooled
analysis of nine other studies (<xref rid="bibr41-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Vizeli and Liechti, 2017</xref>). Low
mood in the 7 days after administration has also been noted in some clinical
trials of MDMA (<xref rid="bibr33-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Ot’alora
G et al., 2018</xref>). Given some inconsistencies, it remains
important to further characterise the subacute effects of MDMA on mood. This
is particularly relevant given interest in MDMA as an adjunct to
psychotherapy.</p>
              <p>We aimed firstly to extend and replicate the findings from a naturalistic study
of recreational MDMA’s acute prosocial effects (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>) in a
controlled laboratory experiment, using measures of empathy, trust and
cooperative behaviour. Secondly, we aimed to assess subacute changes to mood
three days after MDMA administration. We hypothesised that relative to
placebo: (a) MDMA would increase prosocial behaviour on assessments of
cooperative behaviour, trust ratings and empathy and (b) MDMA would lead to
subacute low mood.</p>

                <p>Participants were enrolled in a within-subject, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study with drug order balanced across participants.
Participants attended four sessions in total, with two acute drug
administration sessions and two subacute sessions. The acute drug
administration sessions were 7 days apart. The subacute sessions
occurred 3 days after each of the acute sessions. Data collection was
conducted between January and October 2012.</p>

London Research Ethics Committee, Imperial College London’s Joint
Compliance and Research Office, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust
and Imperial College London’s Faculty of Medicine, University College
London Research Ethics Committee, and was conducted in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. A Home Office Licence was obtained
for the storage and handling of a Schedule 1 drug and Imperial College
London sponsored the research. Participants gave informed consent.</p>

                <p>Participants were 25 healthy, right-handed, poly-drug (including MDMA)
users, aged 18 and 58 years. Participants were required to abstain
from MDMA for 7 days and other psychoactive drugs for at least 48
hours. This was confirmed by a urine screen and self-reported drug
use. Participants took an alcohol breathalyser test to confirm that
they had no recent alcohol consumption.</p>
                <p>Participants underwent a screen of their general health and present
mental health. Inclusion criteria were: (a) currently mentally and
physically healthy as determined by a psychiatric interview and
medical screen and (b) at least one previous experience with MDMA. For

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We examined the prosocial effects of MDMA in a laboratory using a
repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. We
investigated social processes believed to be mechanistically important for
MDMA’s benefit as an adjunct to psychotherapy: trust, cooperative behaviour
and empathy. MDMA significantly increased subjective measures of euphoria,
feel drug effects, jaw clenching and closeness to others. However, we found
no significant effects of MDMA on task-based measures of prosocial behaviour
and Bayesian analyses largely supported the null hypotheses that there were
no differences between MDMA and placebo.</p>
              <p>There are extensive reports that MDMA enhances self-reported subjective trust
(<xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al.,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr11-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Dolder et al., 2018</xref>). This augmentation in trust is thought to
be important for the value of MDMA as an adjunct to psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr37-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Sessa, 2017</xref>).
However, in laboratory settings, when using task-based measures of trust,
null effects of MDMA are often reported (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kirkpatrick et al.,
2014c</xref>). We found that MDMA did not increase subjective ratings
of feeling ‘trusting of others’; participants were not more trusting of
others with their money. We also found support for this null finding (that
MDMA did not affect perceived trustworthiness of others’ faces or
cooperative behaviour) through the Bayesian analysis. Subjectively-rated
trust did not correlate with trust measured by tasks, which suggests these
may involve different psychological processes.</p>
              <p>We found no evidence that MDMA affects emotional empathy (though it did
increase scores of closeness to others). This contrasts with some previous
work, which has found that MDMA selectively affects emotional empathy (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al.,
2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>). However,
this effect has not always been consistently reported and may depend on a
participants’ gender (<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et al., 2014</xref>) or occur only for positively valenced
stimuli (<xref rid="bibr36-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Schmid et al.,
2014</xref>).</p>
              <p>We found a null effect on the cooperative behaviour games and the trustworthy
face rating task. This may seem surprising, as these tasks have been found
to be sensitive to recreational MDMA in a naturalistic setting (<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al.,
2014</xref>). However, the between-subject design with non-blinded
participants in this previous study may have contributed to an expectation
of drug effects. Additionally, the lack of information about the dose or
purity of the recreational MDMA used complicates interpretation of this
earlier study. It may also be that the controlled laboratory setting, as
opposed to testing within participants’ homes, dampened the prosocial
effects. The importance of context when administering a psychoactive drug
has been recognised particularly with psychedelic treatment (<xref rid="bibr8-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al.,
2018</xref>). Indeed, a comfortable physical setting is recommended as
a key part of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (<xref rid="bibr31-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Mithoefer, 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>Some differences between the tasks in our study and previous ones yield
important insights. In the ultimatum game, we asked participants to respond
with the minimum offer they would accept. This – as opposed to the
‘direct-response’ method used by <xref rid="bibr12-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al. (2018)</xref> where
participants are presented with different offers to accept or reject – can
lead to less punishment of unfair offers. Indeed, our participants were
willing to accept offers that were below 40% of the total stake – below what
is considered to be a ‘fair’ offer (<xref rid="bibr14-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al., 2014</xref>). We also used
a ‘one-shot’ task for our cooperative behaviour games. This contrasts to
<xref rid="bibr12-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al.
(2018)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr13-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Gabay et al. (2019)</xref>, where participants received feedback on
their performance over multiple rounds. Such feedback might be important to
more closely match real-world social interaction and allow for detection of
an effect of MDMA. This again suggests there may be an important role for
context, whereby true social feedback may be necessary to elicit effects of
this drug – but this would need to be tested experimentally.</p>
              <p>In the context of previous mixed findings, a possible interpretation of our
results is that MDMA may not enhance all aspects of prosocial behaviour. We
add to existing evidence that in a laboratory setting, perceived
trustworthiness and financial trust do not seem affected by MDMA. Perhaps
MDMA may augment specific, rather than all, prosocial behaviours.
Additionally, as suggested by some of the factors in previous studies (sex
differences, different effects for positive versus negative stimuli), these
specific effects may not be seen in all individuals in all situations.
Future studies will need to further focus on which specific aspects of
prosocial behaviour are affected by MDMA and address whether these are
moderated by sex, dose, top-up doses and positive versus negative stimuli.
It would be useful to test whether MDMA affects participants’ willingness to
trust others with their personal feelings or confidential information
differently to financial tasks (such as with the envelope task paradigm of
<xref rid="bibr30-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Mikolajczak et al.
(2010))</xref> and whether physical setting impacts on MDMA
effects.</p>
              <p>More generally, tasks which are completed on paper or via a computer are
inherently different to the interpersonal process of psychotherapy. In order
to delineate MDMA’s prosocial effects in relation to the psychotherapeutic
process, it may be necessary to use procedures which involve measurements of
interpersonal behaviour and to utilise frameworks for measuring the effects
of context as proposed in <xref rid="bibr8-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Carhart-Harris et al. (2018)</xref>. For instance, it would be
valuable to extend the work of <xref rid="bibr1-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Baggott et al. (2016)</xref> on the
effect of MDMA on more intimate sharing by assessing differences in outcomes
in a comfortable versus neutral setting, with patient groups, and with
varying levels of responsiveness of the researcher listening to the
memory.</p>
              <p>Corroborating results from some laboratory reported adverse effects (<xref rid="bibr41-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Vizeli and Liechti,
2017</xref>), and contrasting results from recreational MDMA use
(<xref rid="bibr10-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Curran and
Travill, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 2014</xref>) we did not
find increased depression in the subacute visits (i.e. there were no
‘mid-week blues’). This was supported by Bayesian analysis. This phenomenon
may have been attributable to lack of sleep and/or interactions with other
recreational drugs used (<xref rid="bibr37-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Sessa, 2017</xref>). This is clearly important to know when planning
future clinical trials of MDMA; it does not necessarily produce low mood
when administered at these doses in safe settings.</p>
              <sec id="section52-0269881120926673">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>A key strength of our acute study is that it was a placebo-controlled,
double-blind experiment. For schedule I drugs, these studies are
difficult, expensive and time-intensive to conduct. Our experiment
therefore partially addresses the issue of participant and
experimenter expectation, present in the previous naturalistic study
(<xref rid="bibr39-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et
al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis of MDMA in plasma demonstrated
that the drug was successfully absorbed to levels similar to other
studies (<xref rid="bibr26-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Kuypers
et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr42-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Vizeli and Liechti, 2018</xref>).
We examined prosocial feelings and behaviour across a wide range of
self-report and task-based assessments, for a comprehensive
investigation of MDMA’s effects. Our results were consistently null
with support from Bayesian analyses across our task-based assessments
of prosocial behaviour.</p>
                <p>However, we must acknowledge limitations. Our participants experienced
pronounced subjective effects, which will have contributed to
unblinding. Whilst the dose used lies in the range typically used for
this type of research (e.g. within 75 mg–125 mg), in the
psychotherapeutic setting higher doses and top-up doses midway through
the session are often used. It is possible that a higher dose would
have resulted in more pronounced MDMA effects on our tasks. It is also
possible that some tasks were conducted post-peak effect, however,
MDMA prosocial subjective and task effects have been reported 4 hours
post administration (<xref rid="bibr42-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Vizeli and Liechti, 2018</xref>;
<xref rid="bibr20-0269881120926673" ref-type="bibr">Hysek et
al., 2014</xref>). Our participants still significantly felt the
effects of the drug and had MDMA in their plasma an hour after these
tasks were completed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, in a controlled laboratory setting, MDMA did not have an effect
on measures of prosocial behaviour, despite increases in self-report levels
of closeness to others, feel drug effect and euphoria. In the future,
research should test the effects of MDMA on more ecologically valid measures
with more focus on the context, as both could be important for the effects
of MDMA. This will allow delineation of which prosocial effects of MDMA are
moderated by setting, and therefore could aid the development of
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</p>
