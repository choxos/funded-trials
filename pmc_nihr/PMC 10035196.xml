                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability, and its sequelae are associated with inadequate food intake which can lead to sarcopenia. The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of creatine supplementation on functional capacity, strength, and changes in muscle mass during hospitalization for stroke compared to usual care. An exploratory subanalysis will be performed to assess the inflammatory profiles of all participants, in addition to a follow-up 90 days after stroke, to verify functional capacity, muscle strength, mortality, and quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Randomized, double-blind, unicenter, parallel-group trial including individuals with ischemic stroke in the acute phase. The duration of the trial for the individual subject will be approximately 90 days, and each subject will attend a maximum of three visits. Clinical, biochemical, anthropometric, body composition, muscle strength, functional capacity, degree of dependence, and quality of life assessments will be performed. Thirty participants will be divided into two groups: intervention (patients will intake one sachet containing 10g of creatine twice a day) and control (patients will intake one sachet containing 10g of placebo [maltodextrin] twice a day). Both groups will receive supplementation with powdered milk protein serum isolate to achieve the goal of 1.5g of protein/kg of body weight/day and daily physiotherapy according to the current rehabilitation guidelines for patients with stroke. Supplementation will be offered during the 7-day hospitalization. The primary outcomes will be functional capacity, strength, and changes in muscle mass after the intervention as assessed by the Modified Rankin Scale, Timed Up and Go test, handgrip strength, 30-s chair stand test, muscle ultrasonography, electrical bioimpedance, and identification of muscle degradation markers by D3-methylhistidine. Follow-up will be performed 90 days after stroke to verify functional capacity, muscle strength, mortality, and quality of life.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The older population has specific nutrient needs, especially for muscle mass and function maintenance. Considering that stroke is a potentially disabling event that can lead the affected individual to present with numerous sequelae, it is crucial to study the mechanisms of muscle mass loss and understand how adequate supplementation can help these patients to better recover.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par10">Stroke is an important public health problem and is one of the leading causes of death in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Stroke is the main cause of disability in the adult population, and approximately two-thirds of patients experience an incomplete recovery. Malnutrition on admission, reduced level of consciousness, dysphagia, and enteral tube feeding use may impair the nutritional status of these individuals, who generally become more susceptible to involuntary weight loss at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">Studies on the acute phase of stroke have shown that patients who were malnourished at the time of ictus had more complications and higher mortality rates than patients with adequate weight, overweight, or obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par12">After stroke, appetite loss, dysphagia, depression, changes in mobility, and functional dependence can lead to inadequate food intake, which is associated with neurological damage. Moreover, bed rest compromises nutritional status, resulting in a negative effect on physical and cognitive abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">A previous study on patients in the acute phase of stroke demonstrated that individuals with some degree of dysphagia at the time of hospital discharge had higher mortality rates, regardless of stroke severity and other clinical factors, which may indicate the importance of adequate nutritional management during hospitalization for stroke and monitoring after hospital discharge for patients with food intake difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Malnutrition has been associated with inflammation and metabolic stress, which are proportional to injury severity, and increased protein catabolism, hypermetabolism, and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Sarcopenia is associated with aging and is commonly observed in patients after stroke. Sarcopenia is considered primary when the patient has skeletal muscle mass decline, reduced water content, and increased body fat, or secondary to chronic or disabling diseases such as stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Unlike age-related sarcopenia, stroke-related sarcopenia has specific characteristics, such as rapid muscle mass decline and structural changes. The type of stroke and location and size of the brain injury are important factors affecting the differences in physical and functional performance, depending on the side affected by stroke, which is independent of age. Moreover, catabolic signals from brain damage can result in an imbalance in the neurovegetative state. Therefore, there is a complex metabolic and systemic change in individuals with stroke that can lead to weight loss and reduced anabolism, worsening the prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Muscle changes occur within 4 h after stroke, and over 7 days, patients can develop muscle weakness on both the affected and contralateral sides of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Daily intake of 1.2 to 1.5 g of protein per kg of body weight is recommended along with exercise for sarcopenia prevention in older adults, as this population is more susceptible to inadequate protein intake for several aging-related reasons leading to increased proteolysis and anabolic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, limited data are available regarding the prevention of sarcopenia or malnutrition in the acute phase after stroke.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Some nutrients and amino acids such as creatine appear to be potential compounds capable of promoting hypertrophy and improving muscle function. Creatine supplementation has been proven effective in improving muscle mass in healthy older individuals, even when only taken for a few days; in pathological conditions, these positive results are supported by studies in several populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">A combination of resistance exercise and adequate protein intake is recommended to maintain healthy skeletal muscles. However, there is no recommendation for this type of multimodal therapy in older people after stroke. Evidence is scarce regarding the influence of protein supplementation and specific amino acids associated with physical activity on the functional capacity and quality of life among this population.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The aim of the study is to verify the effectiveness of creatine supplementation on functional capacity, strength, and changes in muscle mass during hospitalization for stroke compared to usual care. A descriptive and comparative evaluation between groups in order to verify the inflammatory and potential serum biomarkers behavior during hospitalization will be performed with all participants randomized. A follow-up 90 days after stroke to verify functional capacity, muscle strength, mortality, and quality of life will be carried out.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par25">Creatine supplementation will be administered in the intervention group to avoid the muscle loss that is common in patients after stroke. The control group will receive maltodextrin, a complex carbohydrate with no direct effect on muscle loss. All participants will receive the same amount of protein per kg of body weight so that the groups are homogeneous in the consumption of this nutrient. The intervention will proceed as follows:</p>
                <p id="Par26">Intervention group (15 participants)—Will be administered one sachet containing 10 g of creatine twice a day.</p>
                <p id="Par27">Control group (15 participants)—Will be administered one sachet containing 10 g of placebo (maltodextrin) twice a day.</p>
                <p id="Par28">All sachets will be the same color and size. All patients will receive assisted supplementation with powdered milk protein serum isolate, if necessary, to achieve a daily intake of 1.5 g/kg of body weight and standard physiotherapy care. Supplementation will be offered during the 7-day hospitalization.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Rehabilitation will start after the first 24 h of the ictus, and the intensity will be proportional to the benefit and tolerance of each individual. Standard physiotherapy will be performed according to the current rehabilitation guidelines for stroke patients and will consist of contracture prevention, limb and trunk strengthening, gait training, and independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">All individuals will be instructed at the time of hospital discharge on healthy eating habits, and adequate fractioning, and provided incentives for eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and maintaining water intake in accordance with the Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population by the Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">Participants who are intolerant to the supplements or who withdraw their consent will be excluded from the study. All patients will be followed up daily and encouraged to consume all meals and study products.

The samples will be sent to the Centre for Musculoskeletal Aging Research &amp; NIHR Nottingham BRC (Clinical, Metabolic, and Molecular Physiology research group, University of Nottingham, Royal Derby Hospital Centre, Derby, UK). The ratio between labeled and unlabeled 3-methylhistidine will be evaluated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par81">This clinical trial encompasses the use of creatine in the acute phase of stroke. Indeed, research about therapeutic strategies to mitigate the muscle mass decline after stroke is urgent. In general, the researches are focused on assessment, instead of treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par82">The limitation of the study is the sample size. However, the studies involving nutritional interventions to old people are a big deal, because of compliance and preferences. In addition, the stroke may add an extra difficulty because of the chance of conscience level, dysphagia, and tube feeding. In fact, studies published in a systematic review involving creatine supplementation in different scenarios included an average of 10 patients per group, showing that creatine might exert benefits for muscle mass and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the study will be rigorously conducted inside a stroke unit, with intake control, standardized care, and monitoring.</p>
              <p id="Par83">In addition, the trial may bring information for next larger studies, especially regarding side effects, compliance, and future sample size calculation. ICaRUS Stroke Trial will not be conducted as a feasibility study because we intend to make an entirely statistical analysis and follow-up.</p>
