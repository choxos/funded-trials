                  <p>To compare normothermic (35Â°Câ36Â°C) versus hypothermic (28Â°C) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in paediatric patients undergoing open heart surgery to test the hypothesis that normothermic CPB perfusion maintains the functional integrity of major organ systems leading to faster recovery.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Two single-centre, randomised controlled trials (known as <italic>Thermic-1</italic> and <italic>Thermic-2</italic>, respectively) were carried out to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of normothermic versus hypothermic CPB in children with congenital heart disease undergoing open heart surgery. In both studies, the co-primary clinical outcomes were duration of inotropic support, intubation time and postoperative hospital stay.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In total, 200 participants were recruited; 59 to the <italic>Thermic-1</italic> study and 141 to the <italic>Thermic-2</italic> study. 98 patients received normothermic CPB and 102 patients received hypothermic CPB. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for any of the co-primary outcomes: inotrope duration HR=1.01, 95% CI (0.72 to 1.41); intubation time HR=1.14, 95%âCI (0.86 to 1.51); postoperative hospital stay HR=1.06, 95%âCI (0.80 to 1.40). Differences favouring normothermia were found in urea nitrogen at 2 days geometric mean ratio (GMR)=0.86 95%âCI (0.77 to 0.97); serum creatinine at 3 days GMR=0.89, 95%âCI (0.81 to 0.98); urinary albumin at 48âhours GMR=0.32, 95%âCI (0.14 to 0.74) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin at 4âhours GMR=0.47, 95%âCI (0.22 to 1.02), but not at other postoperative time points.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Normothermic CPB is as safe and effective as hypothermic CPB and can be routinely adopted as a perfusion strategy in low-risk infants and children undergoing open heart surgery.</p>

              <p>Whole body cooling is an integral part of congenital cardiac surgery, with most procedures being conducted at 28Â°C.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The main rationale for body cooling is to protect the brain, kidneys and heart from ischaemic injury, by reducing the metabolic rate and decreasing oxygen consumption.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during adult cardiac surgery. The concept that normothermic systemic perfusion may confer advantages over hypothermic regimes arose from adult clinical experience in which an absence of shivering, haemodynamic stability, mimimal inotropes and early extubation was observed when patients were not cooled. This led several investigators to study the effects of systemic hypothermia and normothermic perfusion on cellular and organ function.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3â6</xref> CPB perfusion temperature strategies and their effects on the function of several organs are largely the result of work carried out on adult humans and the conclusions cannot necessarily be applied directly to infants or children. Having demonstrated that in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery, normothermic CPB was associated with reduced oxidative stress and similar myocardial reperfusion, renal injury and inflammatory response compared with hypothermic CPB,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> we hypothesised that maintaining the body at 35Â°Câ37Â°C (normothermia) rather than cooling to 28Â°C (hypothermia) during surgery could translate into better clinical outcomes. We report the results of two trials referred to as Thermic-1 and Thermic-2, respectively, designed to compare the clinical effectiveness of normothermic versus hypothermic CPB for the repair of common congenital cardiac pathologies.</p>

                <p>Patients (agedÂ â¤18 years) having scheduled surgery to repair a congenital heart defect using CPB were eligible to participate. Patients admitted for an emergency operation and those requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest were excluded. Parents/guardians (if agedÂ under 16Â years) provided written informed consent, and children aged 11â15 yearsÂ provided written assent.</p>
                <p>Both studies were conducted at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, a regional congenital cardiac surgery centre in the UK. Thermic-1 recruited patients between 2002 and 2004, and Thermic-2 between 2012 and 2014. All paediatric cardiac surgeons participated in Thermic-2.</p>

                <p>Eligible patients were randomised to receive either normothermic or hypothermic CPB. CPB and anaesthetic management adhered strictly to a locally agreed protocol, details of which are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9</xref> In the hypothermic group, the CPB temperature was targeted to decrease until the nasopharyngeal body temperature had lowered to 28â°C and in the normothermic group the CPB temperature was targeted to maintain the nasopharyngeal temperature at 35Â°Câ36Â°C. Rewarming commenced after completion of the anatomical correction and only took place in the normothermic group if the body temperature dropped below 36Â°C. In both groups, CPB was discontinued only after the participant was fully rewarmed to above 36â°C. The CPB flow rate was kept at 2.6â2.8âL/min/m<sup>2</sup> and cold blood (4Â°Câ6Â°C) cardioplegia (4:1 dilution blood/St Thomas' no. I crystalloid cardioplegia) was used for myocardial preservation in all patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The co-primary endÂ points were: i) duration of inotropic support, ii) intubation time and iii) postoperative hospital stay (from date of surgery to discharge from cardiac ward). Inotropic support was standardised; dopamine and milrinone were started in the operating room before weaning from CPB. Epinephrine was used if a low cardiac output state persisted. All the inotropic support drugs were weaned in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) according to the unit protocol. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and morbidity; blood loss and transfusion requirements; postoperative echocardiographic findings; near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during CPB, renal function measured by urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urinary albumin, urinary creatinine, retinal binding protein (RBP), N-acetyl-Î²-glucosaminidase (NAG) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL); cerebral function measured by glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP); neuropsychological development, assessed using the NEPSY-II psychometric tool (valid for participants aged â¥3 years andÂ &lt;17 years only). Unexpected serious adverse eventsÂ (SAEs) were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (V.14.1;Â McLean, VA,Â USA).</p>
                <p>Renal function was measured from serial blood and urine samples taken preoperatively, at cross clamp removal and 4, 24 and 48âhours thereafter. Cerebral function was assessed preoperatively, at cross clamp removal and 30âmin and 2, 6, 24 and 48âhours thereafter. NEPSY-II was assessed preoperatively and at 3 and 12âmonths postoperatively.</p>
                <p>There were no changes to the outcomes during Thermic-1. Several secondary outcomes were added to the Thermic-2 protocol after the start of the study: RBP, NAG and NGAL markers of renal function (collected for a subset of 60 patients not having isolated atrial septal defect surgery); and NIRS. In addition, the marker of brain damage was changed from protein S100B to GFAP, to give a more accurate measure of cerebral function.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>

Allocations were computer generated using block randomisation with varying block sizes by a statistician independent of the study team. A password-protected database concealed allocations until data had been entered to confirm identity and eligibility.

                <p>Analyses were based on a prespecified statistical analysis plan (SAP) and performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. Outcomes were compared using logistic regression (binary outcomes), linear regression (continuous outcomes), Cox proportional hazards regression with appropriate censoring (time-to-event outcomes) or mixed-effects regression (continuous longitudinal outcomes); see onlineÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary material</xref> for further details. All analyses used the hypothermic group as the reference group and were adjusted for trial phase (Thermic-2 vsÂ Thermic-1) and age (&gt;12 vsÂ â¤12 months). Results are reported as effect sizes with 95% CIs. Serial measurements taken as part of routine care (eg, blood gases) are described and frequencies of adverse events are tabulated. Prespecified subgroup analyses by trial phase (Thermic-1 vs Thermic-2) were performed by adding an interaction term to the models. Analyses specified in the SAP but not in the study protocol were a) sensitivity analyses: i) excluding protocol deviations (all deviations, and only those deemed major), ii) reanalysing inotropic data including only dopamine, the only inotrope collected in both trial phases and b), analyses of each component of the primary outcome using instrumental variable (IV) techniques to estimate the unbiased effect of CPB temperature, with randomised allocation as the instrument (see onlineÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary material</xref>).

                <p>All measures of operative duration were longer in the normothermic group than the hypothermic group by approximately 10âmin (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> and onlineÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table S3</xref>). These differences were reflected in Thermic-2, but not in Thermic-1. Median temperatures were similar toÂ pre-CPB. During CPB, the median temperature in the normothermic group was 34.8Â°C vs 28.6Â°C in the hypothermic group, and at cross-clamp removal 36.1Â°C vs 35.0Â°C, respectively. By the end of CPB, temperatures had reverted to similar levels in the two groups. All other characteristics were similar; haemodynamic instability (8/140; 6%), the need for cardioversion (3/187; 2%) and ischaemic changes when coming off CPB (2/113; 2%) were rare. All received inotropes when coming off CPB.</p>

For urinary creatinine, RBP and NAG, no statistically significant differences between the groups were found.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The combined results of the Thermic trials suggest normothermic CPB is safe with no evidence of a clinical advantage in cooling the body of low-risk infants and children undergoing open heart surgery. Inotrope duration, intubation time and postoperative stay were similar in the two groups, a conclusion supported by the IV analysis. These results are clinically important given that moderate hypothermia (26Â°Câ30â°C) is still widely used in this patient population. Practise among congenital cardiac surgeons in relation to systemic cooling is variable, with a significant proportion still cooling the childâs body to 26Â°Câ30Â°C.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Our results are consistent with Pochelet <italic>et al</italic> (RCT, n=47), who demonstrated that normothermic CPB protocols are reproducible and safe.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Hypothermic CPB is still considered the most effective strategy for protecting the brain during surgery, aiming for a low metabolic state and providing protection in case of increased blood return and the subsequent reduction in bypass flow or perfusion failure. However, these problems are extremely rare. There is no cardiac surgical evidence from newborns with asphyxial encephalopathy that moderate hypothermia (34Â°C) protects the brain, and there is no advantage from further cooling these neonates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> We found no significant difference in cerebral function between the groups (as measured by GFAP levels), and the neuropsychological outcomes were also similar, suggesting that a normothermic strategy safely protects the brain. Previous neurological evaluations also failed to demonstrate differences between the hypothermic and normothermic groups in terms of verbal, performance and full-scale intellectual neuropsychological development.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Significant differences in renal function, in favour of normothermic CPB, were observed across several markers of renal damage. This is important as acute kidney injury is a common postoperative complication and independently associated with adverse outcomes including mortality. The higher NGAL levels 4âhours postoperatively in the hypothermic group are indicative of renal tubular injury that can be exacerbated by the cooling and rewarming process. This phenomenon has been previously shown in adult cardiac surgery.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> We also found a trend towards lower levels of NAG and albumin (â14% and â37%, respectively) when expressed as a urinary creatinine ratio in Thermic-1.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>The only significant difference in favour of the hypothermic group was reduced blood loss, but this did not lead to a significantly lower transfusion rate and postoperative haemoglobin levels were similar in the two groups. Also, there was a tendency towards higher NIRS readings during CPB in the hypothermic group, but this did not correlate with other outcomes. Evidence suggests that NIRS in isolation is not very sensitive in predicting low cardiac output and neurological dysfunction after paediatric cardiac surgery and should be used alongside other haemodynamic and clinical metrics.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref>
</p>
              <p>The longer median cross-clamp time in the normothermic group was unexpected but is likely due to the higher proportion of more complex procedures in Thermic-2 (44% with RACHS score of 3 or 4 in the normothermic group vs 28% in the hypothermic group).</p>
              <sec id="s4a">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Strengths include the inclusive eligibility criteria and minimisation of bias through concealed allocation. Within both trials the blood and urinary samples were analysed in a single hospital laboratory, thereby avoiding interlaboratory variability, and laboratory personnel were blinded to the group allocation.</p>
                <p>With respect to limitations, participants were recruited from a single centre, limiting the generalisability of the findings. The two trials were carried out 10 years apart and there were differences between the two cohorts; participants in Thermic-1 were younger and bypass and cross-clamp times were shorter than in Thermic-2. There were also imbalances in preoperative characteristics between the two groups in Thermic-1, which may account for the greater difference in length of stay between the groups observed in Thermic-1. Some outcomes were collected in Thermic-2 only, reducing the power to detect differences between the two groups for these outcomes. The lack of blinding of the operating room team and the potential for staff caring for participants postoperatively to determine the allocation from the medical records represents a further weakness. Finally, very few neonates were recruited. Although there is observational evidence that normothermic CPB is safe and effective in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> RCT evidence in this subgroup is lacking.</p>
