                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Breastfeeding has health benefits for infants and mothers, yet the UK has low rates with marked social inequalities. The Assets-based feeding help Before and After birth (ABA) feasibility study demonstrated the acceptability of a proactive, assets-based, woman-centred peer support intervention, inclusive of all feeding types, to mothers, peer supporters and maternity services. The ABA-feed study aims to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the ABA-feed intervention compared with usual care in first-time mothers in a full trial.</p>

                  <p>A multicentre randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation to explore clinical and cost-effectiveness, and embedded process evaluation to explore differences in implementation between sites. We aim to recruit 2730 primiparous women, regardless of feeding intention. Women will be recruited at 17 sites from antenatal clinics and various remote methods including social media and invitations from midwives and health visitors. Women will be randomised at a ratio of 1.43:1 to receive either ABA-feed intervention or usual care. A train the trainer model will be used to train local Infant Feeding Coordinators to train existing peer supporters to become ‘infant feeding helpers’ in the ABA-feed intervention. Infant feeding outcomes will be collected at 3 days, and 8, 16 and 24 weeks postbirth. The primary outcome will be any breastfeeding at 8 weeks postbirth. Secondary outcomes will include breastfeeding initiation, any and exclusive breastfeeding, formula feeding practices, anxiety, social support and healthcare utilisation. All analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Breastfeeding has considerable benefits for infants and in later childhood and for mothers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Additionally, there are increasing risks of infection and overfeeding from unsafe formula feeding.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Breastfeeding duration in the UK is among the shortest worldwide, with rapid discontinuation in the first 2 weeks postbirth.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> While the WHO recommends 6 months exclusive breastfeeding,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> only 12% of babies in England are exclusively breastfed at 4 months. A 2017 survey of women’s experiences of maternity services identified infant feeding as the greatest area of unmet need for support.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Women reporting insufficient support for breastfeeding difficulties are more likely to discontinue within the first 2 weeks.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Current UK policy is to increase breastfeeding rates and recommends implementation of the Baby Friendly Initiative, which recognises that not all mothers will breastfeed exclusively or for long durations, and emphasises support that seeks to ‘maximise’ the amount of breastmilk infants receive.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>A 2022 Cochrane review of support for breastfeeding mothers reported moderate-certainty evidence that interventions providing breastfeeding support probably reduce the risk of women stopping any breastfeeding at 4–6 weeks, 3–4 months and 6 months and exclusive breastfeeding at 4–6 weeks, 2 months, 3–4 months and 6 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>The UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommends peer support to improve breastfeeding rates in disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Peer support is valued by women<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> and many UK programmes exist. However, four consecutive UK trials of breastfeeding peer support<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> found no significant improvement in breastfeeding rates. Probable explanations are only recruiting women who planned to breastfeed, low intensity of contacts and/or contact made only several days after birth, when many breastfeeding difficulties have already occurred and women have already decided to give formula. Evidence suggests that to increase acceptability, peer support interventions should be woman-centred<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 16–18</xref> including help with formula/mixed feeding, offered proactively,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17 19</xref> span the antenatal and postnatal periods,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and focus on early weeks<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11 18</xref> but continue beyond 2 weeks postbirth.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 21</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Findings from ABA feasibility study</title>
                <p>The ABA feasibility study was undertaken in two English areas with low breastfeeding rates.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> It was feasible to recruit and train existing paid and volunteer peer supporters to the ABA infant feeding helper (IFH) role; to deliver the intervention with acceptable fidelity; and it was acceptable to women, IFHs and maternity staff. Trial processes were feasible with acceptable recruitment and follow-up rates. Intervention contamination in the control group was low and with no evidence of any intervention-related harms. Timely birth notification was challenging with only half the births notified within 3 days resulting in delays commencing the enhanced support.</p>
                <p>Elements of IFH training identified as needing improvement included better use of the Friends and Family diagram (genogram) to stimulate conversation, explicit guidance on use of behaviour change techniques and greater focus on active listening skills.</p>

              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Trial rationale</title>
                <p>Inequalities in breastfeeding are marked, with breastfeeding initiation and continuation lowest among women in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, teenagers, women with lower educational outcomes and those reporting to be from a white ethnic group.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
                <p>Given the feasibility of intervention delivery and trial components, and low contamination, an individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) is justified. Given the large variation in breastfeeding rates by sociodemographic characteristics, it is important to undertake an RCT to address confounding.</p>

              <sec id="s1-3">
                <title>Assets-based approach</title>
                <p>Assets-based approaches focus on positive capabilities of individuals and communities, rather than needs, deficits and problems.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> Assets can include material resources<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> or individual and collective psychosocial attributes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–32</xref> Use of peer support and encouragement to access community support for breastfeeding and social opportunities for new mothers are exemplars of an assets-based approach to public health.</p>
                <p>In the context of infant feeding, assets may include intrinsic personal resources such as willingness to request and accept help, self-efficacy<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and motivation.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–35</xref> Extrinsic assets concern availability of social support from partners,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36–38</xref> family and friends; networks of new mothers and women who have breastfed; and community assets such as breastfeeding or baby groups. Assets may reduce stress and increase well-being. Local breastfeeding peer supporters are also community assets for breastfeeding. An assets-based approach is consistent with woman-centredness in focussing on a woman’s own priorities.</p>

              <sec id="s1-4">
                <title>Behaviour change theory</title>
                <p>The ABA-feed intervention was developed based on the Behaviour Change Wheel framework including the COM-B (capabilities, motivation, opportunities—behaviour) model at its theoretical core.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> The intervention includes two core behavioural change techniques (BCTs) (social support and restructuring the social environment) which target motivation (reflective) and opportunity (social). Additional non-core BCTs target capability (physical and psychological), motivation (reflective and automatic) and opportunity (social).</p>
                <p>Assets-based approaches and theory-based BCTs are complementary. The assets-based approach informs the style and principles of intervention delivery, and the Behaviour Change Wheel informs intervention content through specific BCTs based on behavioural theory.</p>

              <p>Primary objective: To evaluate if the intervention compared with usual care increases any breastfeeding at 8 weeks postbirth, in first-time mothers.</p>
              <p>Secondary objectives: (1) to evaluate the effect of the intervention compared with usual feeding care on other feeding outcomes and anxiety; (2) to explore feasibility of (i) modelling longer-term clinical benefits, and (ii) costs and outcomes for a lifetime horizon, using a within trial cost-consequence analysis over 16 weeks postbirth; (3) to investigate how trial conduct and context varies across sites to understand any observed differences in outcomes and inform future implementation.</p>

                <title>Study population, setting and recruitment plan</title>
                <p>The trial was planned to take place in 10–15 sites; 17 will be the final number. Each site is an English local authority area or National Health Service (NHS) Health Board in Wales or Scotland, or part of a local authority area with low breastfeeding rates. Sites are selected for usual care that does not deliver universal proactive peer support antenatally and postnatally. Sites can deliver their peer support service through an NHS acute or community trust, Health Board, local authority or third sector organisation.</p>
                <p>Women who are 20<sup>+0</sup>–35<sup>+6</sup> weeks’ gestation with their first, singleton pregnancy, aged 16 years or over and living in study areas are eligible for inclusion, regardless of feeding intention.</p>
                <p>To maximise participation, and for pragmatic reasons including resilience to any future pandemic restrictions, several recruitment methods will be used.</p>
                <p>A summary leaflet is issued by direct care staff with details of how to register interest in the trial and the option of completing an agreement to contact form. Direct invitations are made in antenatal and 20 week scan clinics. Remote invitations include posters in antenatal clinics and other places frequented by pregnant women (with QR code linking to study website); direct email invitations sent from maternity or health visiting services, with a link to the study website and use of social media. Before recruitment, all women will receive a full participant information leaflet, and have an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
                <p>Informed consent will be obtained from each participant either in writing or by telephone or video call. Women with computer or smartphone access can complete e-consent. Where in-person or e-consent is not possible, remote documented consent will be undertaken where the researcher initials, signs and dates the consent form during a discussion with the woman, and then posts a copy to the woman.</p>
                <p>Following eligibility check, receipt of informed consent and completion of a baseline questionnaire, the participant is randomised using a secure online system at the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU) by researchers with unique login usernames and passwords.</p>
                <p>Women are randomised by computer at a ratio of 1.43:1 to receive intervention or usual care. This inflated sample size in the intervention group will account for the effect of potential clustering by IFH. A minimisation algorithm within the online randomisation system ensures balance in treatment allocation for study site and woman’s age (&lt;25, ≥25) given association with maternal age and breastfeeding.<sup>3</sup></p>

                  <p>Before starting the intervention, researchers work with local infant feeding leads to develop an ‘assets leaflet’ at each site. The leaflet includes information on local ‘assets’ (ie, antenatal/postnatal groups, breastfeeding drop-ins, breastfeeding counsellors and baby groups) and national helplines and internet resources. The assets leaflet is handed to women meeting their IFH face-to-face or sent electronically and posted at 36 weeks gestation.</p>
                  <p>The intervention starts around 30 weeks’ gestation and can continue until 8 weeks after birth. Around 30 weeks’ gestation, the IFH contacts the woman to arrange an antenatal meeting at a convenient location (eg, children’s centre or café, or at home if the peer support service permits this). Alternatively, the meeting can be held remotely via video call, or telephone if the woman prefers. Women can choose to include partners or family in this meeting, and subsequent contacts. The aim is to talk about infant feeding and explore the woman’s ‘assets’ for feeding. A narrative storytelling approach is used to produce a ‘Friends and Family diagram’ that shows the woman’s friends’ and family members’ experiences with infant feeding, and the expected quality of support<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> to facilitate reflection on available sources of support. At the meeting, IFHs introduce the assets leaflet, explain the support available for infant feeding and swap contact details. Following the meeting, IFHs call or text the woman every 2–3 weeks during pregnancy to encourage rapport and facilitate immediate engagement with support postbirth. Where possible, IFHs offer an antenatal visit to a local breastfeeding group with the woman (if she plans to breastfeed), so women know where and how to access support postnatally.</p>
                  <p>Postnatally, IFHs offer daily contact with the woman by text or phone until the baby is 2 weeks, with less frequent contact until 8 weeks. Frequency of contact depends on women’s preferences, for example support needs may be less if fully formula feeding.</p>
                  <p>IFHs are offered reimbursement for expenses.</p>

                <title>Training</title>
                <p>The intervention is delivered by existing breastfeeding peer supporters who receive extra training to become IFHs. The IFHs are supported and managed locally by peer support or infant feeding leads.</p>
                <p>A train-the-trainer model is used, where infant feeding and peer support leads at each site are trained to provide training locally to peer supporters; training is delivered remotely in four 2 hour sessions, with sessions recorded and made available to sites.</p>
                <p>The training aims are (1) to promote competence and confidence in delivering the intervention and (2) to facilitate understanding of the study overall. Training is interactive and involves watching simulations and role play of contacts with women and group-based learning activities. Local training of IFHs is delivered remotely or in-person.</p>
                <p>Building on feasibility study findings, we propose to explain the two core BCTs to IFHs which should be delivered to every woman (social support and restructuring the social environment), focussing particularly on how these can be delivered in line with an asset-based and women-centred approach. BCT training will explicitly introduce using specific techniques and draw on good practice examples from the feasibility study.

A text message sent 2 weeks prior to the due date reminding the woman to notify the Trial Office when she has given birth. She can reply to the text message or email/call the Trial Office with her study identification number. Additionally, the consent form includes permission for site staff to notify the Trial Office of the birth.</p>

                <p>Given the low-risk nature of the intervention, an expedited reporting of serious adverse events will not be required. However, during follow-up, we will collect self-reported data from participants regarding overnight admissions to hospital by infant and mother. We will capture any infant deaths and cause. These will be regularly reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).</p>
                <p>Should we receive any reports from participants, feeding teams or healthcare professionals of an infant death in which an IFH was the last healthcare professional/feeding supporter to have been in contact with the woman, then this will be investigated by the local principal investigator and assessed by the chief investigator for relatedness.</p>

                <p>The pathway of identification of pregnancy loss, stillbirth and neonatal death will differ between sites. Careful discussions will take place between the research team and sites to identify a pathway of identification and communication to ensure that no woman is contacted by the study team or by an IFH if they have experienced loss.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>Assuming 90% power and a two-sided 5% significance level, with a control group rate of 44% for the primary outcome (95% CI 30.0% to 58.7%; from the ABA feasibility data), a sample size of 2136 women (1068 per group) would be required to detect a risk ratio of 1.16 (ie, an increase of 7% from 44% to 51%), considered to be a clinically meaningful increase. Since the intervention is delivered by IFHs, there is a potential for clustering of outcomes by IFH. To allow for this, the sample size for the intervention arm requires inflation, assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.039 taken from ABA feasibility data and given that each IFH will support about 12 women. The sample size required for the intervention arm is thus 1526, giving a total sample size of 2594 (1526 intervention+1068 control). Allowing for a 5% loss to follow-up (as in the ABA feasibility study), a total of 2730 (1606 intervention and 1124 control arm) women would be required (2594/0.95).</p>
                <p>With an average 12 women/IFH, we need to train 134 peer supporters (1606/12). Assuming 80% power, the sample size of 2730 would allow detection of a risk ratio of 1.14 equivalent to a 6% absolute increase.</p>

                <p>For all outcome measures, appropriate summary statistics and differences between groups (eg, mean differences, relative risks) will be presented, with 95% CIs and p values from two-sided tests. Intervention effects will be adjusted for minimisation variables (age group and site) where possible, and baseline value for outcomes where this was measured. Clustering by IFH will be accounted for in the model. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome (baby receiving any breastmilk at 8 weeks postbirth) is a binary outcome and will be analysed using a mixed-effects log binomial regression model, adjusting for the intervention group and the minimisation variables (age group and site). Age (a continuous variable) will be treated as a fixed effect and site and IFH will be treated as random effects. The treatment effect will be expressed as an adjusted risk ratio and a risk difference with associated 95% CIs. If the model does not converge, alternative models will be considered, eg, log Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> The p value from the associated model will be produced and used to determine statistical significance of the estimated treatment group parameter.</p>

                              <p>Qualitative interviews with participants, purposively sampled to obtain a sample with a range of feeding experiences identified using the open question in the 8 week questionnaire. These will take place after the 8 week follow-up with up to 30 women at case study sites (5–6 women per site). They will explore the delivery of the key components of the intervention: genogram, assets-based leaflet, women centred approach, core BCTs and extent to which women were encouraged to draw on personal and community assets to support feeding (ie, fidelity of delivery). They will also explore acceptability of the intervention. Interviews with women in the usual care group (up to 10 across the five sites) will be purposively selected for examples of possible contamination, based on responses to the open question in the questionnaire. Interviews will be face-to-face, by skype or telephone, according to the mother’s choice. We aim for a diverse sample, and will ensure that this includes teenage mothers, women in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and women who have experienced different feeding journeys, including those who have primarily formula fed, those who have mixed fed and those who have primarily breastfed. We will include women whose contact with the feeding helper has been very high, about average and very low.</p>

                <p>The focus of the case studies is to explore how pre-existing aspects of baseline context shape intervention delivery and observed outcomes.</p>
                <p>Qualitative analysis of case study data will include the universal dataset for case study sites with additional data: researcher field notes, free text data from 8 week questionnaires, interviews with 30 women in the intervention group, interviews with key informants. NVivo 12 will be used to manage data.</p>
                <p>Data will be analysed thematically using the framework method.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> A combined deductive and inductive approach will be taken to code, and theme development. Coding will draw on existing evidence and theory regarding breastfeeding peer support interventions<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> while allowing space for novel codes to be developed from the data. Codes will be grouped into themes, primarily focussed on (1) key stages/components of intervention delivery and (2) contextual influences on implementation and intervention outcomes. We will triangulate between different process evaluation data sources (questionnaires, log data, documentary data and interview/focus group data).</p>
                <p>Indexing and charting into framework matrices will follow the approach previously employed in case study evaluation of a breastfeeding group support trial.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Separate framework matrices will be constructed for each case study site. Data from across sources will be summarised in cells in each matrix according to (1) key stages of intervention delivery (rows) and (2) contextual influences on outcomes (columns). The matrices will compare patterns and associations between sources within and across case study sites to build descriptive and explanatory accounts of how intervention context shaped implementation delivery and outcomes.</p>

                <p>Resource use data will be collected prospectively from both NHS and Personal Social Service perspective, through questionnaires to estimate the overall cost of initiating and running ABA-feed compared with usual care.</p>
                <p>The feasibility of collecting appropriate resource use to quantify the costs associated with delivering ABA-feed was demonstrated in our feasibility trial.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> It is feasible to estimate health service costs associated with the intervention appropriately including the resource and costs associated with training the IFHs, telephone calls, text messaging service, one-to-one meetings with mother and expense payments to peer supporters. Other main resource categories to be monitored include additional postnatal consultations by midwives, GP visits or hospital admissions for mother or baby associated with feeding mode, for example, respiratory or gastrointestinal infection in infants, or mastitis in mothers.</p>

              <p>The ABA-feed trial was approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Committee on 18 May 2021 (21/ES/0045). Capacity and capability assessment was undertaken by local NHS sites involved in recruitment or intervention delivery; where local authorities had procedures in place, separate ethical approval was obtained from local authorities that delivered the intervention.</p>
              <p>The trial is managed by BCTU, University of Birmingham. The University of Birmingham is the nominated sponsor and holds insurance for the study.</p>
              <p>The intervention will comply with policies and quality standards of participating sites.</p>
              <p>Final results will be available through open-access publication in a peer-reviewed journal, and presented at relevant meetings and conferences. The PPI group will be involved in the dissemination plans.
