                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>One in eight women suffer from depression during pregnancy. Currently, low-intensity brief treatment based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the only talking treatment widely available in the National Health Service (NHS) for mild and moderate depression. CBT involves identifying and changing unhelpful negative thoughts and behaviours to improve mood. Mothers in our patient advisory groups requested greater treatment choice. Interpersonal counselling (IPC) is a low-intensity version of interpersonal therapy. It may have important advantages during pregnancy over CBT because it targets relationship problems, changes in role and previous losses (eg, miscarriage). We aim to compare CBT and IPC for pregnant women with depression in a feasibility study.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A two-arm non-blinded randomised feasibility study of 60 women will be conducted in two UK localities. Women with depression will be identified through midwife clinics and ultrasound scanning appointments and randomised to receive six sessions of IPC or CBT. In every other way, these women will receive usual care. Women thought to have severe depression will be referred for more intensive treatment. After 12 weeks, we will measure women’s mood, well-being, relationship satisfaction and use of healthcare. Women, their partners and staff providing treatments will be interviewed to understand whether IPC is an acceptable approach and whether changes should be introduced before applying to run a larger trial.</p>
                  <p>Several groups of patients with depression during pregnancy have contributed to our study design. A patient advisory group will meet and advise us during the study.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Study results will inform the design of a larger multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT). Our findings will be shared through public engagement events, papers and reports to organisations within the NHS. National Research Ethics Service Committee approved the study protocol.</p>

              <p>Antenatal depression is common, with a reported prevalence of 11%<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and a point prevalence of up to 44% in certain populations.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Antenatal depression is associated with a range of poor outcomes including continuing depression into the postnatal period, reduced breastfeeding rates,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> infant developmental delay<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and social/emotional problems, including depression in the offspring during adolescence.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Pregnancy does not appear to be protective against developing depression or relapsing in those with a previous history of depression.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Currently, the Whooley questions are used to identify women who may have antenatal depression.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This screening method has high sensitivity (95%) and modest specificity (65%) for antenatal depression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, anecdotal evidence suggests that women are not always aware that they are referred for further help following a positive Whooley screen.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of psychological interventions for antenatal depression,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> despite a widespread reluctance of mothers to take antidepressants during pregnancy<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with 75% of women discontinuing antidepressant medication in the first trimester.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is also concern among clinicians about prescribing antidepressant medication,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> largely due to a lack of evidence regarding their safety,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> indicating that psychological interventions are particularly important at this time.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 15</xref> One study found that women who discontinue antidepressant medication during pregnancy are five times more likely to experience a relapse in their depression requiring treatment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The current treatment recommendation for mild to moderate depression, including depression that occurs during pregnancy, is a brief, one-to-one supported self-help approach using the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) known as low-intensity CBT.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Theoretical basis of CBT and limitations for this population</title>
                <p>The theoretical basis of CBT is that individuals prone to depression hold dysfunctional beliefs and therefore see the world through a negative filter.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Adversity, such as pregnancy, triggers these underlying beliefs and prone individuals then behave in a way that is consistent with these negative beliefs thus triggering and reinforcing depression. There is no specific relevance of this model to pregnancy and it relies on the skill of the therapist to adapt CBT to individual circumstances. Although there is a growing evidence base for ‘high intensity’ CBT delivered by experienced therapists for perinatal depression, ‘low-intensity’ CBT is briefer and delivered by less experienced practitioners who have limited scope to adapt to the perinatal context and be flexible in its use. The use of high-intensity CBT is limited within current clinical frameworks due to limitations in funding and therapist availability. CBT has few explicit strategies to manage many of the problems that are common for women with antenatal depression, including role transitions and problems in relationships.</p>
                <p>A recent review highlighted the need for more personalised therapies to treat perinatal depression, including interpersonal psychotherapy as a plausible treatment option.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Women in our patient advisory group consultations reported that CBT is ‘too clinical’ and ‘inflexible’ with practitioners not appearing to consider the circumstances of pregnancy. This may be one reason why the uptake of CBT treatment for antenatal depression is low. It has been reported that 14% of women with antenatal depression receive psychological treatment and only 5% with antenatal depression achieve remission following treatment.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Women who are pregnant receive lower rates of psychological intervention than those outside the perinatal period (30% vs 50%) despite an increased need for psychological treatment rather than drug treatment at this time.</p>

              <sec id="s1-2">
                <title>Theoretical basis of interpersonal counselling and advantages for treating antenatal depression</title>
                <p>Interpersonal counselling (IPC) is a brief treatment which may be more appropriate for addressing the problems that depressed women have during pregnancy and postnatally. It is derived from interpersonal therapy, which holds that interpersonal relationships are a basic human need and attachment to key individuals provides a secure base from which to manage stressful events and conditions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Problems in interpersonal relationships can trigger symptoms of depression, such as low mood or sleeplessness, and these symptoms further compromise relationships leading to a downward spiral.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This is particularly relevant to pregnancy as conflict in relationships and poor social support are the strongest risk factors for antenatal depression.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
                <p>IPC offers a more structured version of IPT that promotes understanding of depression through psychoeducation, problem solving and active involvement of the people in the person’s life to provide support and promote recovery. IPC helps individuals develop useful strategies to manage interpersonal conflict and can involve the partner if appropriate. It also focuses on approaches that help manage changes in role, conflict, isolation and loss (ie, miscarriage, stillbirth, termination, previous loss of would be grandparents) and the impact of these on relationships. By directly approaching these issues, IPC addresses what is theoretically central to depression and what service users report are significant worries and concerns for them. The approach is simple and focused and could be provided by practitioners who have limited training or experience.</p>
                <p>Currently, there are limited data on the effectiveness of IPC.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It is critical to test its effectiveness because although almost half (43%, n=2 01 591 in 2015–16) of all individuals who receive a talking treatment in the National Health Service (NHS) will receive a brief, ‘low-intensity’ treatment, interpersonal brief treatment approaches are currently not available in the NHS.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p>
                <p>IPC has been clearly developed and rigorously manualised as an intervention allowing assessment of fidelity to the model. Although there have been very few studies of the effectiveness of IPC, and none in the UK, one study of depression in primary care in Italy found IPC to be more effective than antidepressants Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) particularly for those with less severe depression,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and a small UK pilot study found that IPC is an effective and acceptable treatment for young people with primarily depressive symptoms.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A small feasibility study of IPC for antenatal depression in the USA among low-income mothers indicated high satisfaction with IPC and some improvement in mood.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
                <p>There are therefore good reasons to hypothesise that IPC may be more acceptable at this time and particularly effective in treating antenatal depression. There is some evidence that interpersonal therapy (IPT), a high-intensity therapy from which IPC is derived is more acceptable than 'high intensity' CBT, with sessions more likely to be attended and that outcomes are better for IPT than 'high intensity' CBT in existing psychological treatment services.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> We argue that evaluating this intervention for treating antenatal depression is particularly important because:</p>

                  <list-item>
                    <p>The model is particularly relevant to pregnanc,y and therefore the advantages of this approach over standard CBT treatment may be greater than at other times.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Psychological treatment provision is a priority at this time because of the potential risks of antidepressants during pregnancy and the costs of depression during pregnancy.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>Training low-intensity practitioners in IPC has the potential to offer women an acceptable, empirically valid option which may prove to be more effective than CBT and provide the NHS with a treatment option that may be both effective and cost-effective.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>Our overall aim is to improve psychological treatment for depression during pregnancy to improve outcomes for the mother, infant and the wider family. We aim to test whether six sessions of IPC are acceptable, effective and cost-effective for treating mild to moderate antenatal depression compared with the most commonly provided existing intervention, low-intensity CBT. Both interventions are one-to-one therapies comprising up to six sessions.</p>
                <p>The aim of this first study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a full-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effectiveness of these two low-intensity interventions for antenatal depression. Using a pragmatic study design operating within the existing care pathway, we will explore whether a full-scale trial using such a design is feasible.

                <p>This feasibility study over 21 months will be carried out in two centres (site A and site B) in preparation for a pragmatic fully powered RCT. Women with mild to moderate depression during pregnancy considered suitable for a low-intensity intervention will be randomised 1:1 either to the usual low-intensity treatment (CBT) or to a novel treatment called IPC.</p>

                <p>Women who are aged 18 years or over are eligible for inclusion between 10 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, with an Edinburgh Depression Scale (EPDS) score of 10 or above and mild or moderate depression according to Clinical Interview Schedule Revised (CIS-R),<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which gives an International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision diagnosis, whether or not they are taking an antidepressant. Both primiparous and multiparous women will be eligible. Recruitment will continue for 9 months.</p>
                <p>We will exclude women with psychotic illness, organic brain disorder, bipolar disorder, personality disorder, alcohol or substance dependency, which will be identified through self-report. Also excluded will be those judged to be at high suicide risk in assessor’s judgement or from response to items on suicide in CIS-R or EPDS, those with severe depression according to CIS-R criteria and those who have had CBT or IPT within the last 6 months. If women miscarry or have a termination during the trial, they will be offered the opportunity to continue with the treatment but will not be included in the rest of the study.</p>
                <p>We will compare recruitment through two routes which have been used successfully in two previous trials of antenatal depression and antenatal anxiety.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref></p>
                <p>Method 1: Women will be identified at community midwife booking clinics (around 8–10 weeks’ gestation) through the routine screening undertaken for depression using the Whooley questions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Those who answer ‘yes’ to either question and are considered by the midwife to be appropriate for further assessment for talking therapy, will be asked for their consent to be contacted by the research team about the study.</p>
                <p>Method 2: Women will also be identified from ultrasound scan clinics where they will be given study information, eligibility screening questions (EPDS) and a form to indicate their willingness to be contacted by the research team for assessment if screening positive (EPDS 10 or above). This approach will provide a good opportunity to recruit disadvantaged groups, as attendance at scanning clinics does not appear to be socially patterned.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

The practitioners will be required to audiorecord cases, which will be assessed by their supervisor to ensure competence and fidelity to the model. Supervision will be provided weekly initially and then fortnightly once practitioners are more familiar with IPC. Those delivering the six sessions of CBT will be given refresher training and have fortnightly case supervision as is usual practice for CBT. Supervisors will rate adherence from a checklist and feedback to trainees. These ratings will be used to assess fidelity.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement/patient advisory group</title>
                <p>Discussions with women who have perinatal mental health problems and are currently using services, colleagues running voluntary sector perinatal mental health services and feedback from public engagement events have all highlighted the need to improve psychological treatment services available to women and their partners during pregnancy and following childbirth. We asked women attending an antenatal group for those with mental health problems in pregnancy what they thought would have helped them most, and they highlighted the need for a therapy that is more specific to pregnant women. Some reported that current treatment offered (CBT) was ‘too clinical’, and those providing the treatment made little reference to pregnancy or worries about coping with a young baby. We have two collaborators who run voluntary sector organisations providing help to women with mental health problems during the perinatal period. One has been involved in the development of the ideas surrounding this, and the other has been providing advice about women’s experience of local psychological treatment services as well as commenting on the proposal and several aspects of the design. At two public engagement events held in Bristol, we discussed services for families and how these could be improved. At one event for fathers whose partners struggled with their mood and anxiety during pregnancy or following childbirth, they gave a clear message that they felt excluded and even treated with suspicion by services. Fathers welcomed any psychological treatment which might include them and focus on improving the relationship with their partner. Six women, who have been attending either an antenatal group aimed at promoting emotional well-being or postnatal drop-in sessions run by the voluntary sector, have agreed to form a patient advisory group (PAG) meeting three times during the study.</p>
                <p>The PAG members will assist in the development of patient facing materials, advise on recruitment issues, inform the development of the topic guide for the qualitative interviews and discuss and help interpret the results including the decision on whether to proceed to a full trial. They will be offered a study-specific induction pack which will include the INVOLVE materials and relevant study information. Training workshops run by People and Research West of England will also be offered to them. PAG members will have their travel expenses and meeting time reimbursed with vouchers. Our findings will be presented in lay terms at a PAG meeting, and they will advise us on routes for dissemination to patient groups.</p>
