                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The lack of trained mental health professionals is a key barrier to scale-up of evidence-based psychological interventions in low and middle-income countries. We have developed an app that allows a peer with no prior experience of health-care delivery to deliver the cognitive therapy-based intervention for perinatal depression, the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP). This trial aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this Technology-assisted peer-delivered THP versus standard face-to-face Thinking Healthy Programme delivered by trained health workers.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We will employ a non-inferiority stratified cluster randomized controlled trial design comparing the two formats of intervention delivery. A total of 980 women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode, evaluated with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V Disorders (SCID), will be recruited into the trial. The unit of randomization will be 70 village clusters randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome is defined as remission from major depressive episode at 3 months postnatal measured with the SCID. Data will also be collected on symptoms of anxiety, disability, quality of life, service use and costs, and infant-related outcomes such as exclusive breastfeeding and immunization rates. Data will be collected on the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes (depression and anxiety scores, exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 months postnatal to evaluate if the improvements are sustained in the longer-term. We are especially interested in sustained improvement (recovery) from major depressive episode.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">This trial will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a technology-assisted peer-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention in rural Pakistan. If shown to be effective, the novel delivery format could play a role in reducing the treatment gap for perinatal depression and other common mental disorders in LMIC.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">The prevalence of perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is estimated to range from 23.8 to 27.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. South Asia stands out as the region where the rates of perinatal depression are among the highest in the world, and in Pakistan, the prevalence of perinatal depression has been reported to be 30 to 37% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Untreated perinatal depression is of concern not only because of its effect on maternal health but also from the effect that impaired maternal role fulfillment has on the mother-infant bonding and child care and the long-term impact on the infant’s physical and cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Pakistan, children of mothers with depression are 1.5 times more likely to be underweight and 1.4 times more likely to be stunted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In UK, the value of total lifetime costs of perinatal depression has been estimated to be over USD $100,000 per woman with the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but in Pakistan, due to the association with infant malnutrition, the relative impact is likely to be greater.</p>
              <p id="Par7">A number of studies have demonstrated that evidence-based psychosocial interventions for perinatal depression can be effectively delivered by non-specialist health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Pakistan, we developed and evaluated the Thinking Healthy Programme (THP) designed to be delivered by community health workers. The program incorporated cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based techniques focusing on the mother’s mental health and its effect on her relationship with the infant and significant others and inter-session practice activities to help the mother and family to problem-solve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A large randomized controlled trial showed that THP more than halved the rate of depression compared with usual care and led to significant improvements in women’s functioning and disability, and the intervention was effective in the poorest populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In 2015, the THP was incorporated into the World Health Organization’s flagship Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) for global dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">A key barrier to scale-up of the THP in LMICs is the lack of trained health professionals to deliver the intervention. Even where health workers are available, they are over-burdened, which makes it difficult to sustain the program beyond pilot sites. In recent studies, peers (women from the same localities with no prior experience of health-care delivery) have been found to be feasible delivery agents of the Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, longer-term effectiveness of the peer-delivered intervention tends to decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], possibly as a result of what Chambers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] refer to as a voltage drop, i.e., the intervention loses some degree of its potency or fidelity when moving from efficacy to effectiveness in the real world, and program drift, i.e., the intervention deviates from its manualized or implementation protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Applying a technological solution to this challenge, we have developed a technology-assisted version of THP which allows the peers to deliver the Thinking Healthy Programme sustainably without the need for extensive training and supervision. Our approach does not rely solely on technology but builds counseling skills of peers in order to maintain human-contact and empathy, while ensuring the active therapeutic ingredients are delivered to fidelity and at the right dose with the help of a peer-operated app. We envisage this innovation will assist in scale-up of the THP through all types of lay-workers, making the intervention accessible to the most under-served populations.</p>

              <title>Aim and hypotheses</title>
              <p id="Par9">The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technology-assisted Thinking Healthy Programme (THP-TA). Our primary hypothesis is THP-TA delivered by peers will be non-inferior to standard THP delivered by community health workers in improving remission rates in women with perinatal depression at 3 months postnatal.
</p>
              <p id="Par10">We will test several secondary hypotheses both at 3 and 6 months postnatal. We hypothesize that compared to the standard THP, THP-TA will be effective in (a) reducing symptoms severity of perinatal depression at 3-months postnatal, (b) reducing the symptoms severity and improving remission rates of perinatal anxiety at 3 and 6 months postnatal, (c) reducing the maternal disability at 3 and 6 months postnatal, (d) improving maternal quality of life at 3 and 6-months postnatal, (e) improving recovery rates of perinatal depression at 6-months postnatal, and (f) will be cost-effective compared to THP in treating perinatal depression across the pregnancy to 6 months’ postnatal period. Other maternal and infant outcomes include rates of exclusive breast-feeding, rates of immunization, parental time spent playing with the infant and rates of contraception use among women at 3 and 6 months postnatal. As part of the secondary outcomes we will evaluate the process of implementation and fidelity of THP-TA delivered by peers for treating perinatal depression. Lastly, we will also explore mediational pathways of THP-TA in improving perinatal mental health outcomes. Acceptability of the THP-TA intervention will be explored in an embedded qualitative study from the perspective of the end-users and their significant family members and delivery agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par12">The trial will be conducted in rural areas of Kallar Syeddan, Gujar Khan, and Rawalpindi, within Rawalpindi District of Punjab, Pakistan. The rural economy is based largely on subsistence farming, semi-skilled or unskilled laboring, or low-paid government service in nearby cities. The female literacy rate is about 46.88% and the infant mortality rate about 53 per 1000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study area consists of three subdistricts with 19 Union Councils (UCs) or rural administrative units, comprising several villages. These villages are served by community health workers called lady health workers (LHWs). The primary role of the LHWs is to provide health education and basic maternal and child health care through monthly home visits. Each LHW is responsible for about 250 households and keeps a register of every new pregnancy in her catchment area.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p id="Par13">We will employ a non-inferiority stratified cluster randomized controlled trial design comparing technology-assisted THP delivered by peers with standard THP delivered by LHWs. We use a non-inferiority design because standard THP delivered by LHWs has demonstrated strongly positive effects on perinatal depression in a previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p id="Par14">The study area comprises 70 village clusters situated in 19 rural administrative units (Union Councils) where program implementation is approved by the District Health Office. Each village cluster has a population ranging from 2400 to 3600 and is served by two or three LHWs. All 70 village clusters will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms. The stratification will be at the level of the Union Council (UC), while a village cluster (VC) will form the unit of randomization. The reason for choosing village cluster as the unit of randomization is to minimize contamination/spillage between trial participants as the perinatal depression intervention will be delivered within community-based households. The intervention and control village clusters are geographically distinct and the chance of intervention cluster participants communicating on a regular basis with control cluster participants is very small.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Randomization will be done before the participants are recruited. Research teams responsible for identifying, obtaining consent, and recruiting trial participants will be blind to the allocation status. This will help to minimize post-randomization recruitment bias. Randomization codes will be generated via a permuted-block randomization method and stratified by Union Council. Block sizes will vary at two, four, and six. Allocation of clusters will be carried out by an independent statistician based at Liverpool using SAS PROC Plan.</p>

                <p id="Par19">Community meetings with village elders, local counselors, and primary health care doctors will be conducted in each Union Council, during which information about trial activities will be shared. Village cluster-level consent will be obtained from the District Health Office responsible for providing primary health care to Rawalpindi District. At the individual participant level, informed written consent will be obtained before screening and baseline assessment. The procedure will be undertaken by trained researchers.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Information about the rights of trial participants, including confidentiality and voluntariness, will be provided. No personal information will be associated with the data of the respective participants; all data will be assigned a study identification number, and only this number will be used for the study assessments. Identification data will be kept in a password protected computer, which will only be accessible to the data manager. No identifying personal characteristics will be used in any publication or presentation. Participation in the study will be completely voluntary and participants will retain the right to refuse answers to any questions that they do not feel comfortable with or to withdraw from the study at any point in time. Such withdrawal will have no negative effect on the health care the participant receives through the LHWs or at any other health care institution, and it will not limit any other rights for the participant or her baby. The consent will be sought in Urdu after at least 24 h of receiving the information about the trial. Prior to signing the informed consent form, the trial participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions regarding the study.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Wherever possible, the participant’s family will be advised of the need for confidentiality so that the family understands the conditions under which information will be shared. In addition to this, the research team will reiterate confidentiality to family members if any family member would be present at screening or at any other outcome assessment. The research team will be instructed not to divulge information to other family members and will only do so if the trial participant would be at risk to herself or others. While obtaining the consent, the participants will be explicitly informed that any incidence of domestic violence required by law to be reported to the primary care physician may be reported to the authorities without the permission of participants. Furthermore, any clinical worsening (e.g., lowering of mood or suicidal ideation) may result in referral for treatment and the research team could potentially disclose this information to individuals outside of the study or to family members. If the research team believes that the trial participant is at risk of harm to herself or to someone else, the research team will report this to the area’s primary care physician without the consent of the participant. The consent forms will need to be signed by the trial participants and the researcher who will take consent. A copy of the information sheets and consent forms will be left with the participants. A record of age, depression score, and reasons for refusal will be maintained for those who do not consent.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Prior to recruitment, ethical approval will be sought from Research Ethics Committees of Human Development Research Foundation, Pakistan, University of Liverpool, UK, and National Bioethics Committee, Pakistan.

                <title>Monitoring for adverse events and discontinuation criteria</title>
                <p id="Par23">Previous trials of the THP indicate the intervention is associated with negligible adverse events. However, a register will be maintained of potential adverse events, defined as any unfavorable signs, symptoms, or disease associated with the use of a treatment. For this study, specific adverse events include (a) death of the mother due to any cause; (b) suicide attempt; (c) domestic violence against the participant; (d) infant abuse or neglect; (e) stillbirth, miscarriage, or death of infant; (f) hospital admission of participant due to any physical or psychiatric problem; and (g) clinical deterioration.</p>
                <p id="Par24">The detection of potential adverse events will be done by the outcome assessment team (at 3 months and 6 months postnatal) and by the intervention delivery agents (LHWs or peers) throughout the period of intervention delivery in both arms. All these personnel will be trained in detecting the adverse events using questionnaires and mood ratings in each session. Talking about feelings or sensitive topics may be difficult and cause emotional upset in some participants. The intervention delivery agents and assessors in both arms will be trained in counseling skills, which will help them to console the participants if such a situation arises. Equally, delivery agents may also be emotionally affected by listening to emotionally disturbed participants. This will be addressed in supervision.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Trial participants will be discontinued from the study at any time-point in case of miscarriage, abortion, or death of the infant, as determined by the health personnel. They will be offered support from a trained professional. Participants who develop a psychotic episode or physical illness or serious medical condition requiring inpatient care (determined by primary care professional) will also be discontinued and referred to a specialist facility for management. Participants who withdraw their consent or migrate permanently from the study area will also discontinue the study. Discontinuation from the intervention (i.e., THP-TA and THP) will mean that all trial activities will stop for these participants (including follow-up assessments and data collection) leading to discontinuation from the study altogether (and these will not be included in the analyses).</p>
                <p id="Par26">Participants experiencing domestic violence will be offered specialist social services at a primary or tertiary facility for support and management but not discontinued from the study. Similarly, in case of infant abuse or neglect, the participants will be offered specialist social services at a tertiary facility but continue to participate in the trial. The primary care physician will be informed of all such cases.</p>
                <p id="Par27">The current trial is sponsored by the University of Liverpool. The University of Liverpool holds insurance against claims for compensation for injury caused by participation in a clinical trial. The conduct of the trial as described in this protocol is covered under the University of Liverpool’s Clinical Trials insurance policy.</p>

However, outcome evaluation will be masked, as all outcome measures will be administered by trained outcome assessors, who are non-residents of the study area, independent of the intervention and masked to treatment allocation of the participants. Furthermore, participants will be instructed not to disclose to the outcome assessors how they receive the intervention. During all assessments, the primary outcome measure (SCID) will always be completed first to minimize the risk of bias in the event of unmasking and, if it occurs, the point of unmasking will be recorded. Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the effect of unmasking on the measurement of primary outcome. The intervention and outcome assessment teams will not have any interactions during the trial since there will be separate locations and administrative management. The assessment teams will be told that they are evaluating two interventions and that there is genuine equipoise about which one is better.</p>

                <title>Standard Thinking Healthy Programme</title>
                <p id="Par30">The standard Thinking Healthy Programme (THP) is an evidence-based manualized intervention targeting women with perinatal depression in low socioeconomic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It aims to improve health outcomes in the women and their children through the adaptation and integration of CBT techniques into the routine work of community health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CBT techniques include guided discovery using illustrated brief vignettes, behavioral activation, and problem solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Non-specific techniques include empathic listening, psychoeducation, and promoting social support from key family members for the mother in negotiating challenges during the perinatal period. The intervention employs these techniques to improve outcomes in three areas: maternal well-being, mother-infant interaction, and relationship with significant others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The intervention identifies resources within the family and community to address modifiable risks to mental health such as interpersonal conflict. The intervention consists of 8 core sessions starting in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and continuing to 3 months postnatal. The THP manual with a step-by-step guidance on delivery is downloadable from the WHO website in a number of languages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">Mothers in the standard treatment group will receive the THP through 40 specially trained LHWs (i.e., one for each village cluster). The LHWs are trained in a 5-day classroom-based workshop (approximately 4–5 h daily), conducted by specialist trainers using a previously trialed technology assisted cascaded training model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The training format is based on interactive discussions and role-plays, including those dealing with difficult situations. The training topics cover communication skills, underlying theoretical concepts, techniques employed in the intervention, and their step-by-step implementation. Discussions also covers the use of job-aids related to the intervention (e.g., health calendars) and elaborate on the structure and methodology of supervision.</p>

Details of the development process are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In summary, our HCD approach involved (a) involving users throughout design and development, (b) conducting an iterative process with frequent feedback loops, (c) addressing the whole user-experience, and (d) incorporating multidisciplinary skills and perspectives in the design team.</p>
                <p id="Par33">The standard THP manual’s guidance and step-by-step instructions for delivering each session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] were converted into narrative scripts by a panel of experts. An artist converted the characters into “avatars” (graphic image representing each character) which were used to voice the narrative scripts. These culturally appropriate animated avatars representing the therapist, peer, depressed mothers, and other key family members enacted scenarios based on actual issues derived from our qualitative research and experiences of delivering the intervention in the community. Each session consists of several interactive scenarios, with pause buttons and instructions, allowing the health worker, women, and their family-members to discuss each scenario in the context of their own lives and share potential helpful solutions to problems identified. The active ingredients and the core content in the technology-assisted version remain identical to the standard THP. The final technology-assisted version consists of a multimedia android-based app that can be used by a variety of health workers to facilitate program delivery. The prototypes were subjected to extensive user-testing before finalization.</p>
                <p id="Par34">In this arm, the delivery agents are peers. Peers are lay women from the same locality, without any health training background who have shown an interest or desire to help and support other women within their community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All peers are identified and recruited from the local community through community-based key informants. As much of the therapy content is automated and has in-built mechanisms to ensure fidelity, the supervision and training does not require a specialist. Training will be provided by a trained non-specialist who has practiced intervention-delivery for 3 months under supervision. The training is focused on improving communication skills of the peers, giving them a basic understanding of the key ingredients of the intervention, and practicing the operational elements of the app. As less practice is required in delivering the key elements of the intervention, the training is briefer (3 days). Monthly peer-supervision will be conducted.</p>

The EQUIP assessment tools namely the THP competencies and ENACT FHS-A (ENhancing Assessment of Common Therapeutic factors, Foundational Helping Skills for Adults) will be used following the THP training and over the trial period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The 11-item THP competencies form and the 15-item ENACT FHS-A, rate intervention-specific skills, and the foundational helping skills respectively on a four-point Likert scale ranging from level 1 (any unhelpful behavior) to level 4 (all basic skills plus advanced skills). Assessments will be conducted using the EQUIP standardized role plays that will be linguistically and culturally adapted for use in the Pakistani context. Role plays will be assessed by an independent assessors trained in using the tools and on the THP. These assessments will ensure that the intervention is delivered with a high level of quality in order to achieve the intended effects.</p>

However, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will also be used as an outcome measure in the analysis because they contain both longevity and quality of life, allowing comparisons across different diseases and treatment modalities. Quality of life will be estimated using EQ-5D-3L at baseline and end of scheduled follow-up, and it will be converted to utility value using tariffs from the Pakistan EQ-5D-3L value set [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>

              <title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title>
              <p id="Par58">Sample size estimation is based on the primary outcome measure, remission from a major depressive episode elicited by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. In our initial randomized trial of THP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], there was a 75% remission rate in the intervention arm. For non-inferiority trials, it is vital to select a relevant limit for the possible difference between arms that will lead to rejection of the hypothesis of non-inferiority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In this trial, as both arms involve active treatment based on THP, we assume 75% remission rates in both arms at 3 months postnatal and set the limit to − 10%, which would still be considered to be of public health significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. As this is a cluster randomized trial, we set an intracluster correlation (ICC) of 0.005 to allow for between-village cluster correlation. Alpha is set to 0.025, resulting in a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval or two-sided 95% confidence interval for of the assessment of non-inferiority. Allowing for 70 village clusters randomized with a 1:1 allocation ratio and 14 depressed participants per village cluster, and 20% loss to follow-up, a total of 980 participants will be required to detect non-inferiority for the primary outcome at 3 months postnatal with a power of 87.2%.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Primary outcome will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model (GLIMM). It will be based on the intention-to-treat population. Non-inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of one-sided 97.5%CI is larger than the non-inferiority margin of − 10%. The model will have a binomial distribution and identity link function with the treatment (intervention vs control) as a fixed effect, baseline measurement of SCID score as covariate, and cluster as random effect. In addition, adjusted GLIMM model analysis will be performed with the pre-specified covariates measured at baseline being added into the above GLIMM model, which will be identified and listed in the statistical analysis plan. The unadjusted and adjusted risk differences between intervention and control group in the primary outcome together with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be derived from the GLIMM models. The main conclusion will be drawn from the unadjusted analysis. In addition, subgroup analysis of primary outcome will be performed on the above pre-specified covariates.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Analysis of secondary binary outcomes with repeated follow-up measurements will be analyzed using GLMMIX models. The model will have a binomial distribution and logit link function with the treatment (intervention vs control), visit (3 and 6 months), interaction between treatment and visit as fixed effects, baseline measurement of outcome as covariate, and cluster and subject as random effects. The odds ratios between intervention and control group together with its 95% CIs at each visit will be derived from the GLIMM models. Analysis of secondary continuous outcomes with repeated follow-up measurements will be performed using GLMMIX models with normal distribution and identity link function. The models will have the treatment (intervention vs control), visit (3 and 6 months), interaction between treatment and visit as fixed effects, baseline measurement of the outcome variable as covariate, and cluster and subject as random effects. The mean differences with 95%CIs between intervention and control at each visit will be derived from the GLMMIX model. Other statistical analyses may be performed if deemed necessary.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Primary data analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The per-protocol analyses will also be performed as supplemental analysis. All analyses will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan which will be finalized before the un-blinding of the study. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.4. The trial results will be reported following the CONSORT guidelines for cluster-randomized trials.</p>
              <p id="Par62">Exploratory mediation analyses will be conducted in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework using the MPlus software. For this, we will test a 2–1-1 mediation model, where mediation is hypothesized at the level of clusters. This model is found to be appropriate because the intervention condition is randomized at the level of clusters rather than individuals. The mediator variables and PHQ-9 scores available at the level of individuals will be transformed into cluster level mean scores to model higher level variance and then group mean centered scores for lower-level variance.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par76">This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a technology-assisted intervention delivered by peers. The Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health reviewed the use of technology to facilitate training as well as delivery of psychological interventions and highlighted this as a major area for future research to assist scale-up of programs such as THP and help reduce the treatment gap for mental disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This is supported by systematic reviews on technology-assisted mental health interventions in LMIC which underlines the potential role of technology in addressing the treatment gap for mental disorder in LMIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Naslund and colleagues reviewed evidence on the use of mobile, online, and other remote technologies for treatment and prevention of mental disorders in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Of the 49 studies identified, most were preliminary evaluations of feasibility and acceptability of technology for supporting clinical care and educating health workers, mobile tools for facilitating diagnosis and detection of mental disorders, technologies for promoting treatment adherence and supporting recovery, online self-help programs for individuals with mental disorders, and programs for substance misuse prevention and treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par77">In Pakistan, we have previously developed technology-assisted tools to (a) provide training of community health workers in the THP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and (b) provide caregiver skills training to parents of children with developmental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This preliminary work has demonstrated the feasibility of technology to assist in the training and delivery of psychosocial interventions in the rural Pakistani community. Building on this work and the global evidence for technology-assisted approaches, we have developed a technologically-enhanced version of THP which will assist the peers in the delivery of the THP. To our knowledge, this is the first innovation of its type. We envisage the automated features built into the innovation will allow the intervention to be delivered to fidelity and prevent voltage drop and program drift which are major barriers to scale-up of task-shifted psychosocial interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par78">A key gap identified in the use of technologies for mental health is the lack of rigorous studies to evaluate effectiveness, assess costs, and carefully consider potential risks of digital technology interventions for mental health. This problem is not confined to LMIC—a plethora of apps and other technologies have been marketed in developed countries that claim to provide treatments for anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and addictions. However, very few have been subjected to randomized trials that are mandatory for any new treatment before it is released for public consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. We hope the results of this study will stimulate further innovation and research in this important area that can be a game-changer in addressing the treatment gap for common mental disorder globally.</p>
