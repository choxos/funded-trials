                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Rotavirus vaccines reduce rotavirus-related deaths and hospitalisations but are less effective in high child mortality countries. The human RV3-BB neonatal G3P[6] rotavirus vaccine administered in a neonatal schedule was efficacious in reducing severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in Indonesia but had not yet been evaluated in African infants.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, parallel group dose-ranging study of three doses of oral RV3-BB rotavirus vaccine in infants in three primary health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Healthy infants less than 6 days of age with a birthweight 2·5 to 4·0 kg were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) into one of four treatment groups: neonatal vaccine group, which included high-titre (1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> focus-forming unit [FFU] per mL), mid-titre (3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU per mL), or low-titre (1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU per mL); and infant vaccine group, which included high-titre (1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> FFU per mL) using a computer generated code (block size of four), stratified by birth (singleton <italic>vs</italic> multiple). Neonates received their three doses at 0–5 days to 10 weeks and infants at 6–14 weeks. Investigators, participant families, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. Anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion and vaccine take (IgA seroconversion and stool shedding) were evaluated. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. The primary outcome was the cumulative IgA seroconversion 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB in the neonatal schedule in the high-titre, mid-titre, and low-titre groups in the per protocol population, with its 95% CI. With the high-titre group as the active control group, we did a non-inferiority analysis of the proportion of participants with IgA seroconversion in the mid-titre and low-titre groups, using a non-inferiority margin of less than 20%.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 17, 2018, and Jan 27, 2020, 711 participants recruited were randomly assigned into four treatment groups (neonatal schedule high titre n=178, mid titre n=179, low titre n=175, or infant schedule high titre n=179). In the neonatal schedule, cumulative IgA seroconversion 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB was observed in 79 (57%) of 139 participants in the high-titre group, 80 (57%) of 141 participants in the mid-titre group, and 57 (41%) of 138 participants in the low-titre group and at 18 weeks in 100 (72%) of 139 participants in the high-titre group, 96 (67%) of 143 participants in the mid-titre group, and 86 (62%) of 138 of participants in the low-titre. No difference in cumulative IgA seroconversion 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB was observed between high-titre and mid-titre groups in the neonatal schedule (difference in response rate 0·001 [95%CI −0·115 to 0·117]), fulfilling the criteria for non-inferiority. In the infant schedule group 82 (59%) of 139 participants had a cumulative IgA seroconversion 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB at 18 weeks. Cumulative vaccine take was detected in 483 (85%) of 565 participants at 18 weeks. Three doses of RV3-BB were well tolerated with no difference in adverse events among treatment groups: 67 (39%) of 170 participants had at least one adverse event in the high titre group, 68 (40%) of 172 participants had at least one adverse event in the mid titre group, and 69 (41%) of 169 participants had at least one adverse event in the low titre group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>RV3-BB was well tolerated and immunogenic when co-administered with Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines in a neonatal or infant schedule. A lower titre (mid-titre) vaccine generated similar IgA seroconversion to the high-titre vaccine presenting an opportunity to enhance manufacturing capacity and reduce costs. Neonatal administration of the RV3-BB vaccine has the potential to improve protection against rotavirus disease in children in a high-child mortality country in Africa.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para3">We searched the Medline database for research done in humans published between Jan 1, 1983, and May 27, 2021, using search terms “rotavirus” and “rotavirus vaccines”.114 countries have now introduced a rotavirus vaccine into their national immunisation programme or sub-nationally. However, over 80 million or approximately 45% of children less than 5 years of age remained unvaccinated in 2019. Barriers to access and coverage are reported to include vaccine cost, gaps in supply, logistical challenges, and ongoing concerns regarding vaccine safety. Previous studies have reported that the protective efficacy provided by rotavirus vaccines is lower in low-income, high child mortality countries than in high-income, low child mortality countries. It has been proposed that maternal antibodies, the gut microbiome, environmental enteropathy, interference with oral polio vaccine, and differential expression of histo-blood group antigens within populations might be contributing factors. The first dose of the two-dose or three-dose rotavirus vaccine schedule is recommended at, or after, 6 weeks of age. Modelling studies report that a neonatal schedule for a rotavirus vaccine, with the first dose administered at birth, has the potential to prevent more rotavirus deaths and cause fewer excess intussusception deaths than the schedules currently recommended by WHO. Birth is an established Expanded Programme on Immunisation timepoint in many countries and would enable early protection from severe rotavirus disease. Asymptomatic neonatal rotavirus strains containing the P[6] VP4 genotype are structurally and functionally distinct from disease-causing rotavirus strains. Wild-type infection with the neonatal rotavirus strain RV3 (G3P[6]) was associated with protection from severe and moderate rotavirus gastroenteritis over the first 3 years of life. The human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) is based on this human neonatal strain and has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in a neonatal schedule with the first dose administered within 0–5 days after birth or in the routine infant schedule with the first dose from 6–8 weeks of age. Vaccine efficacy of three doses of RV3-BB vaccine (8·6 × 10<sup>6</sup> focus-forming unit [FFU] per mL) administered in a neonatal schedule against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis was 94% at 12 months and 75% at 18 months of age in a high child mortality setting in Indonesia.</p>

                <p id="para5">This phase 2 study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of three different titres of the RV3-BB vaccine in a neonatal administration schedule in Malawian infants. This study found that three doses of oral RV3-BB were well tolerated and immunogenic when administered in an infant or neonatal schedule. A lower titre (3 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU per mL) of vaccine administered in the neonatal schedule did not have an inferior immune response (IgA seroconversion) when compared with the higher titre that has been used in previous clinical studies of the RV3-BB vaccine.</p>

                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para7">Rotavirus vaccines are reported to reduce child death and disease due to rotavirus gastroenteritis; however, there remain challenges in providing timely access to a rotavirus vaccine for many children worldwide. The protection offered by rotavirus vaccines is reported to be lower in low-income, high child mortality countries than in high-income, low child mortality countries. A neonatal administration schedule of a rotavirus vaccine has the potential to improve the protection and safety profile provided. A vaccine based on a P[6] neonatal rotavirus strain that is known to replicate well in the newborn gut without causing symptoms is an ideal candidate to target a neonatal administration schedule. This study builds on the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy data of RV3-BB vaccine and supports large scale manufacture of RV3-BB at a lower vaccine titre. It also shows that the human neonatal rotavirus vaccine RV3-BB is well tolerated and immunogenic when administered in a neonatal administration schedule in a high child mortality, high rotavirus disease burden country in Africa.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para11">This was a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo masked allocation, four-arm parallel group, dose-ranging study of oral human neonatal rotavirus vaccine (RV3-BB) administered at a titre of 1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup>, or 1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> as a three-dose neonate schedule, or administered at a titre of 1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> as a three-dose infant schedule. The study was done in three health centres in the Blantyre district (Ndirande, Bangwe, and Limbe) and included participants recruited from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Healthy babies less than 6 days (or 144 hours) of age with a birth weight of 2·5 to 4·0 kg, irrespective of in-utero exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, were eligible for randomisation. Preliminary written informed consent was obtained from pregnant women before delivery. Final written informed consent was obtained following birth before confirming eligibility. The protocol was approved by the National Health Science Research Committee Malawi, the Ethics committees of the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne and the University of Liverpool, and the Malawi Pharmacy Medicines and Poisons Board. The study was done in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study sponsor was Murdoch Children's Research Institute. An independent data safety monitoring board regularly reviewed safety data. Study conduct was monitored by an independent contract research organisation (TCD Global, South Africa); data management and statistical analysis was conducted by TCD Global and an independent statistical consultant (WR).</p>

                <p id="para12">Eligible infants were randomly assigned into one of four treatment arms (neonatal vaccine group: high-titre group [1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup>], mid-titre group [3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup>], or low-titre group [1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup>] or infant vaccine group high-titre group [1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup>]) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The randomisation code was generated by the randomisation statistician (TCD Global) with block randomisation (block size of four), stratified by birth (singleton <italic>vs</italic> multiple) using SAS software (version 9.4). Multiple births had separate randomisation numbers but randomised to the same treatment arm. The randomisation code was assigned to each participant in order of enrolment. Intervention product (RV3-BB or placebo) doses were drawn into syringes for dispensing by an unmasked pharmacist who was not involved in other aspects of the study conduct or data analysis at the central pharmacy in the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, Blantyre. The RV3-BB vaccine and placebo were indistinguishable in appearance and participating families, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation.</p>

                <p id="para13">Clinical trial lots were prepared at Meridian Life Sciences (Memphis, TN, USA) to a titre of 1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> (high titre), 3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> (mid titre), and 1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> (low titre) FFU per mL in serum free media supplemented with 10% sucrose. Placebo contained the same media with 10% sucrose. Intervention product vials were stored at −70°C until thawed within 6 h before administration.</p>
                <p id="para14">Participants received four 1 mL oral doses of intervention product according to their allocated treatment group, with doses administered at 0–5 days (intervention product dose 1), 6 weeks (intervention product dose 2), 10 weeks (intervention product dose 3), and 14 weeks of age (intervention product dose 4; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The four doses of intervention product consisted of three doses of 1 mL RV3-BB vaccine and one 1 mL dose of placebo. Intervention product doses two, three, and four were preceded by a 2 mL dose of antacid solution (Mylanta Original, Broadway, NSW, Australia). No placebo only group was used as a rotavirus vaccine was included in the EPI schedule in Malawi. The intervention product was co-administered with routine vaccines in the Malawian National EPI schedule with the exception for Rotarix. As it had been planned for the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to be introduced into the Malawi EPI schedule during this study, all study participants were administered IPV instead of oral polio vaccine. Participants were followed until 18 weeks of age with a minimum of monthly face-to-face visits. At completion of all study visits and procedures (18 weeks of age), a single 1·5 mL dose of Rotarix vaccine was administered to ensure that participants were protected from severe rotavirus disease in the event that the study vaccine was not protective. Clinical data were reported using web based electronic data capture (Nukleus version 1.4).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design</p><p>FFU=focus forming unit.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para15">The primary outcome was to assess anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion (henceforth called IgA seroconversion, which was defined as a ≥three-times increase from baseline) 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB administered in a neonatal schedule at a vaccine titre of 1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup>, 3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup>, or 1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU per mL. A secondary outcome of the study was IgA seroconversion after three doses of RV3-BB 1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> FFU per mL administered in the infant schedule. Blood was collected from the cord at delivery, and venous blood was collected immediately before intervention product dose two, three, and four, and 28 days after intervention product dose four. Baseline (prevaccine) was defined as cord blood (or venous blood taken at birth if cord blood not available) for the neonatal schedule comparison or blood drawn before intervention product dose two for the infant schedule comparison. Serum rotavirus IgA antibody titres were measured by ELISA using rabbit anti-RV3 polyclonal antisera as the coating antibody and RV3-BB virus or Vero cell lysate as the capture antigen.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The geometric mean titre of the serum IgA response after three doses of RV3-BB was measured.</p>
                <p id="para16">Vaccine virus-like shedding was determined in a stool sample collected on days 3 to 5 after each intervention product dose using a rotavirus VP6 specific reverse transcription PCR assay with VP6 positive amplicons confirmed by sequence analysis.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Positive vaccine take was defined as IgA seroconversion or stool shedding after intervention product administration. Cumulative vaccine take was defined as positive vaccine take after intervention product dose one, two, or three for the neonatal schedule, and after intervention product doses two, three, or four for the infant schedule.</p>
                <p id="para17">Vital signs were assessed at each study visit and participants were observed for 30 min after intervention product administration. All adverse events occurring up to 28 days after administration of intervention product doses were recorded. Serious adverse events were defined as any untoward health occurrence that resulted in death, hospitalisation, or were considered to be medically significant or life threatening occurring up to 28 days after the last dose of intervention product. Causality and severity grading of adverse events were determined by the investigator. Specific events such as diarrhoea and episodes of blood-in-stool were recorded.</p>
                <p id="para18">All episodes of gastroenteritis during the study period were clinically assessed and stool samples collected. Gastroenteritis was defined as three or more stools looser than normal for that child within a 24-h period presenting for care or actively ascertained by the study team if at home. Severe gastroenteritis was defined as gastroenteritis with a modified Vesikari score of 11 or higher.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Rotavirus gastroenteritis was defined as an episode of gastroenteritis with rotavirus antigen detected in the stool by commercial ELISA (Premier Rotaclone EIA kit Meridian Bioscience, Cincinatti, OH, USA).

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para19">Data were analysed in four participant populations. The full-analysis set included all participants randomised into the study, the safety-analysis population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of intervention product, and the intention-to-treat analysis population included all participants that received at least one dose of RV3-BB and had at least one evaluable serum sample after a dose of intervention product. The primary analysis was based on the per-protocol population, including only participants who completed the study in compliance with the protocol and who reported no major protocol violations that might effect on the primary endpoint, with secondary analysis conducted in the intention-to-treat population.</p>
                <p id="para20">With the high-titre (1·0 × 10<sup>7</sup> FFU per mL) RV3-BB neonatal schedule as the active control group, the sample size was calculated to show the non-inferiority of the lower titre (3·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 1·0 × 10<sup>6</sup> FFU per mL) vaccine group with respect to the proportion of participants who have an IgA seroconversion 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB. We estimated that 30% of participants would be excluded from the per-potocol population due to death, study withdrawal, loss to follow-up, or study non-compliance and a 50% IgA seroconversion probability was assumed for the active controls. Based on a one-sided 0·025 level score test with 90% power under the alternative of no difference in response probabilities, 172 participants per group were required for a total sample size of 688 participants.</p>
                <p id="para21">A non-inferiority analysis of the mid-titre and low-titre groups was compared with the high-titre group with the difference in proportions in the IgA seroconversion rate and its 95% CI calculated. Non-inferiority of the lower titre groups was shown if the upper bound of the CI was below 20%. The 95% CI of the difference in the IgA seroconversion rate between vaccine titre groups was also calculated using the method of Newcombe-Wilson, without continuity correction for the difference between binomial proportions as implemented in PROC FREQ (SAS version 9.4). Measurements below the lower limit of detection were assigned a value of half of limit for analysis (eg, if anti-rotavirus serum IgA is &lt;20 [including zero], this was assigned a value of ten). As maternal serum IgA is acknowledged not to cross the placenta, participants with missing baseline cord blood IgA measurement were assigned a value below the lower limit of detection (ie, a value of ten) for the calculation of IgA seroconversion although the cord blood IgA value was acknowledged as missing when summarising titre. A sensitivity analysis was done with all available cord blood results to ensure there was no bias in reporting. Anti-rotavirus serum IgA titres were also summarised at each serum collection timepoint, by treatment group using geometric means and the mean and standard deviation on the log scale.</p>
                <p id="para22">Difference in responses rates and its 95% CI were based on Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> test for IgA seroconversion, stool shedding and vaccine take at timepoint, and for the difference in response rates between treatment groups. For the analysis of vaccine take a participant was defined as missing only if all components of the outcome were missing. Safety data were summarised by group using the safety-analysis population.

              <p id="para28">RV3-BB vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic when administered in a neonatal or infant schedule in Malawian infants. This study builds on data from a phase 2b trial in Indonesian infants, where three doses of the RV3-BB vaccine administered in the neonatal schedule were associated with a 94% protective efficacy against severe rotavirus disease at 12 months and 75% at 18 months of age.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> These results support an alternative approach to oral rotavirus vaccination, employing the human neonatal rotavirus vaccine RV3-BB (G3P[6]) with the first dose administered at birth.</p>
              <p id="para29">In this study cumulative serum IgA seroconversion was observed in 216 (52%) of 418 participants 4 weeks after administration of three doses of RV3-BB administered in the neonatal schedule. As there was no placebo used as an analytical control in this study, IgA seroconversion was also assessed in the neonatal schedule group compared to the infant schedule group at 18 weeks of age, to account for any background exposure to wild-type rotavirus during the intervening 4-week period between intervention product dose three and intervention product dose four. At 18 weeks cumulative IgA seroconversion was detected in 282 (67%) of 420 participants in the neonatal schedule group compared with 82 (59%) of 139 participants in the infant schedule group. Of note, only one participant (low-titre group) with no previous evidence of vaccine take after three doses had an episode of rotavirus positive diarrhoea between intervention product doses three and four to account for seroconversion at week 18. These results compare favourably with data from current WHO prequalified rotavirus vaccines implemented across Africa.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the pivotal phase 3 trial in Malawi, two doses of Rotarix were associated with IgA seroconversion of 47% (95% CI 30–64) and three doses associated with a seroconversion rate of 57% (42–72).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The Rotarix vaccine is currently administered in a two-dose schedule at age 6 and 10 weeks in the Malawi EPI schedule and has been associated with a vaccine effectiveness of 64% against hospitalisation due to severe rotavirus disease.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para30">The first line of protection from rotavirus infection is provided by secretory IgA on the gut mucosa; therefore, it is likely that serum anti-rotavirus IgA underestimates the level of protection provided by a rotavirus vaccine.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This presents an additional challenge for the assessment of the immune response after a birth dose of a rotavirus vaccine, as IgA does not cross the placenta and serum IgA responses might not be as reliable in the first weeks of life.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> As a further measure of vaccine response, we assessed shedding of vaccine virus in stool 3 to 5 days after vaccine administration, to capture the active replication of the vaccine virus. Additionally, vaccine take was assessed using a combination of IgA seroconversion and stool vaccine virus shedding. Cumulative vaccine take was detected in over two-thirds (67%) of participants assessed 4 weeks after three doses of RV3-BB administered in either the neonatal or infant schedule and between 80% to 90% at the 18 weeks of age timepoint and is consistent with previous clinical trials of RV3-BB.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p id="para31">There are potential advantages for a neonatal administration schedule for a rotavirus vaccine. A dose of an oral rotavirus vaccine at birth provides the earliest opportunity to stimulate the developing mucosal immune system to protect against subsequent exposure to wild-type rotavirus. Furthermore, use of an asymptomatic human neonatal rotavirus strain that binds to specific receptors in the neonatal gut avoids the potential risk of vaccine-associated diarrhoea or liver dysfunction.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In this study when RV3-BB was administered at the same titre in the neonatal and infant schedule, a higher proportion of participants in the neonatal schedule had cumulative IgA seroconversion after three doses at 18 weeks of age (difference in proportions 0·130 [95% CI 0·018–0·237]) In a head to head modelling analysis comparing efficacy and waning over time, the neonatal schedule appeared to offer more durable protection.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> As naturally occurring intussusception is rare in the first weeks of life, a first dose of a rotavirus vaccine delivered at birth could improve the safety profile.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para32">As RV3-BB contains the P[6] genotype, it may have intrinsic advantages for protection in infants in Africa and Asia.

Lowering the titre of the vaccine would reduce the cost of goods and improve manufacturing efficiency and produce RV3-BB vaccine at a cost of less than US$5 for a three dose course of a 2–8°C formulated vaccine.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> This meets the 2020 UNICEF tender price of US$0·85–3·20 per dose or $2·55–9·60 per course.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The BioFarma Indonesia manufactured high-titre RV3 vaccine is currently in a phase 3 clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04185545" id="interref4">NCT04185545</ext-link>) with plans to introduce into the Indonesian National Immunisation Program in 2023. At the time when the decision on the dose to use in the phase 3 trial was made, the results of the trial reported here were not yet available. Future vaccine development can now consider a lower vaccine titre with development of a 2–8°C formulation.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para34">The absence of statistical power to assess protective efficacy for the RV3-BB vaccine in Malawian infants is a limitation of this study, particularly as anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion is an imperfect serological correlate of protection and newborns might not mount a robust serum IgA response. As a rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) is currently implemented in the EPI program in Malawi a placebo group could not be included to evaluate background serum immune responses. However, the placebo was administered at intervention product dose one in the infant schedule group, provided an opportunity to assess serum IgA responses in the absence of RV3-BB in the first 6 weeks of life. Participants were enrolled irrespective of their HIV exposure status and anti-HIV prophylaxis or treatment which might have modified serum IgA responses although this has not been observed in other studies of live oral rotavirus vaccines.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
              <p id="para35">RV3-BB was observed to be safe with robust immune responses and evidence of vaccine take in infants in Malawi in a neonatal administration schedule and in an infant administration schedule. The mid-titre group had similar immune responses and vaccine take to the high-titre group although a lower immune response was observed in the low-titre group. This supports large scale manufacture at mid titre with the aim to improve manufacturing capacity and reduce costs. The neonatal administration schedule takes advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of the RV3-BB vaccine and has the potential to improve protection against rotavirus disease in children in Africa.</p>
