                <p id="Par1">We evaluated the safety and efficacy of fully closed-loop insulin therapy compared with standard insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis. In an open-label, multinational, two-center, randomized crossover trial, 26 adults with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis (17 men, 9 women, average age 68 ± 11 years (mean ± s.d.), diabetes duration of 20 ± 10 years) underwent two 20-day periods of unrestricted living, comparing the Cambridge fully closed-loop system using faster insulin aspart (‘closed-loop’) with standard insulin therapy and a masked continuous glucose monitor (‘control’) in random order. The primary endpoint was time in target glucose range (5.6–10.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>). Thirteen participants received closed-loop first and thirteen received control therapy first. The proportion of time in target glucose range (5.6–10.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>; primary endpoint) was 52.8 ± 12.5% with closed-loop versus 37.7 ± 20.5% with control; mean difference, 15.1 percentage points (95% CI 8.0–22.2; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Mean glucose was lower with closed-loop than control (10.1 ± 1.3 versus 11.6 ± 2.8 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003). Time in hypoglycemia (&lt;3.9 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) was reduced with closed-loop versus control (median (IQR) 0.1 (0.0–0.4%) versus 0.2 (0.0–0.9%); <italic>P</italic> = 0.040). No severe hypoglycemia events occurred during the control period, whereas one severe hypoglycemic event occurred during the closed-loop period, but not during closed-loop operation. Fully closed-loop improved glucose control and reduced hypoglycemia compared with standard insulin therapy in adult outpatients with type 2 diabetes requiring dialysis. The trial registration number is NCT04025775.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for 30% of incident cases in the UK and 29% in Europe in 2018<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases, the number of people with diabetes and ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy is also rising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A scarcity of organs for transplantation as well as cardiovascular comorbidities associated with diabetes that preclude transplantation mean that hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are the only available treatment options for many.</p>
              <p id="Par4">ESRD and dialysis itself increase the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which are associated with adverse outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Management of diabetes in this population is challenging for both patients and healthcare professionals. Many aspects of diabetes care of patients on dialysis are poorly understood, including targets for glycemic control and treatment algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Most oral diabetes medications are contraindicated in people with ESRD, so insulin is the most commonly used diabetes therapy. Optimal insulin dosing regimens are difficult to establish with the altered glucose and insulin metabolism associated with ESRD and dialysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and concerns regarding hypoglycemia often result in sub-optimal glycemic control. There is an unmet need for novel approaches to the safe and effective management of diabetes for people requiring dialysis.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Closed-loop insulin delivery systems comprise a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump and a control algorithm that continuously and automatically modulates subcutaneous insulin delivery in response to real-time interstitial glucose concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Closed-loop systems are increasingly being applied to the management of type 1 diabetes. However, use of this technology in people with type 2 diabetes has been limited to the inpatient setting including those on hemodialysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Safety and efficacy in outpatient settings, a precursor for wider clinical acceptance, is to be determined. In the present study, we address this issue and hypothesize that fully closed-loop insulin delivery may improve glycemic control compared to standard insulin therapy without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in people with type 2 diabetes and ESRD undergoing maintenance dialysis in the outpatient setting.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par18">This study provides evidence that fully closed-loop insulin delivery can improve glucose control and reduce hypoglycemia compared to standard insulin therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes and ESRD requiring dialysis, in an unrestricted home setting. We have shown that the fully closed-loop system has the potential to safely and effectively manage glucose levels in one of the most vulnerable subpopulations with type 2 diabetes where the risk of glycemic complications and diabetes-related adverse events is greatest.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Compared with control therapy, fully closed-loop insulin delivery was associated with over 3.5 additional hours every day spent in the target glucose range. The efficacy of closed-loop directed insulin delivery improved considerably over the study period with algorithm adaptation, and time in the target glucose range increased from 36% on day 1 to over 60% by the end of the 20-day intervention period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of an adaptive algorithm that can adjust in response to individuals’ changing insulin requirements over time, independent of its initialization. This pattern of incremental improvements in time in range with increasing duration of wear time has been reported previously with this fully closed-loop system in the inpatient setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is reasonable to postulate that time in target range could improve further with a longer duration of use. It has previously been reported that 26 days of closed-loop use are required for the proportion of time in target glucose range to plateau, although this is likely to be population-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In this study, the proportion of time in target range with closed-loop was lower than observed in a retrospective analysis of inpatients requiring hemodialysis using the same algorithm in a hospital setting (53% versus 69%, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A higher glucose target was applied in the present study (median 7.3 mmol l<sup>−1</sup> versus 5.8 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>), given the vulnerable population, which probably contributed to the reduced time in target glucose range observed. Higher glucose target settings were associated with less time in target glucose range (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, time spent in hypoglycemia did not increase with lower personal glucose targets, suggesting that the glucose target does not need to be unnecessarily elevated.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The reduction in time in hypoglycemia observed with closed-loop is clinically important in this highly vulnerable population with a high burden of comorbidities. Closed-loop was associated with very low time in hypoglycemia (0.12% time spent with glucose &lt;3.9 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>), despite accommodating the glycemic excursions associated with end-stage renal failure and dialysis. Hypoglycemia exposure during the control period was also low, in contrast with the high frequency of hypoglycemia reported in other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The greatest reductions in hypoglycemia with closed-loop were observed in participants with the highest levels of hypoglycemia during the standard insulin therapy period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Hypoglycemia is a considerable barrier to optimization of insulin therapy. The risk of hypoglycemia is high in this population, and people on dialysis often have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Hypoglycemia has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in those with diabetes on dialysis, but causation has not been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par22">The improved time in target glucose range observed with closed-loop was predominantly due to the reduced time spent in hyperglycemia. Time spent with glucose levels in severe hyperglycemia (&gt;20.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) was also reduced with closed-loop therapy. This degree of hyperglycemia is associated with both acute and chronic complications.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The closed-loop algorithm was able to manage fluctuations in glucose and insulin kinetics between dialysis and non-dialysis days effectively. There was no difference in glucose outcomes between dialysis and non-dialysis days, but closed-loop insulin delivery was lower on dialysis days than non-dialysis days, an effect that is probably related to the impact of the dialysate glucose concentration on blood glucose concentrations.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Closed-loop insulin delivery was safe in this vulnerable population. Although there was one severe hypoglycemia episode during the closed-loop arm, this occurred when closed-loop had not been in operation for over 24 h. No study-related serious adverse events occurred during the closed-loop intervention period, and the commonest study-related adverse events were self-limiting skin reactions.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Closed-loop and sensor glucose usage were high in the study, supporting acceptability of this approach in this population. All study participants were happy to have glucose levels managed with an automated insulin delivery system and would recommend its use to others. Participants felt more confident in managing hypoglycemia with the closed-loop system, although this could be due to the availability of real-time glucose levels and alarms for hypoglycemia. Device burden was reported as the main perceived drawback to this approach.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The strengths of this study include the multinational randomized crossover design, the fully closed-loop approach adopted and the unrestricted and unsupervised home setting, including dialysis sessions.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Limitations include the smaller sample size than planned due to Brexit-related study sponsorship issues and the COVID-19 pandemic. Device management was performed by the study team to minimize training burden and therefore we cannot comment on the competency of this population to self-manage this treatment modality. Diabetes therapies during the control period were not standardized or optimized during the trial. We did not evaluate the accuracy of the glucose sensor in the present study; however, because the same sensor was used during both study arms, we believe this is unlikely to have impacted the results. As this was an exploratory study, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in the statistical analysis. We included only one participant receiving peritoneal dialysis, thus limiting interpretation of efficacy and safety in this specific cohort.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Our study evaluated the performance of a fully closed-loop system in an unrestricted outpatient setting in a highly vulnerable population with type 2 diabetes and end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis. Having demonstrated safety and efficacy in this at-risk population in this exploratory study, larger studies are now required to confirm these findings and to determine if the glycemic improvements observed with closed-loop are associated with a reduction in complications and improved quality of life, as well as whether closed-loop should be targeted towards specific subpopulations (for example, those with high hypoglycemic burden or peri-transplant). We suggest that the fully closed-loop approach may also be beneficial in the wider population of people with type 2 diabetes, and further studies are warranted.</p>

Randomization was done using a computer-generated sequence with a permuted block design (block size 4) and stratified by center. Participants and investigators were not masked to the intervention being used during each period due to the nature of the interventions precluding the ability to mask.</p>

                <title>Closed-loop insulin delivery system</title>
                <p id="Par37">The CamAPS HX closed-loop app (CamDiab) resides on an unlocked Android phone, receives sensor glucose data from a Dexcom G6 transmitter (Dexcom) and uses the Cambridge adaptive model predictive control algorithm (version 0.3.71) to direct insulin delivery on a Dana Diabecare RS pump (Diabecare; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Every 8 to 12 min, and based on sensor glucose data, the Cambridge adaptive control algorithm calculates an insulin infusion rate that is communicated wirelessly to the insulin pump. Sensor glucose and insulin data are automatically uploaded to the Diasend/Glooko (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://diasend.com//en">https://diasend.com//en</ext-link>) data management platform.</p>
                <p id="Par38">The control algorithm is initialized using the participant’s weight and total daily insulin dose and gradually adapts its insulin dosing based on observed glucose patterns. The nominal glucose target is 5.8 mmol l<sup>−1</sup> and can be adjusted as required between 4.4 and 11.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>. In the present study, given the vulnerable population, the glucose target was set at 7.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup> and above, based on individual circumstances. Low glucose alarms were customized at a threshold to suit the participant.</p>

                <p id="Par40">Closed-loop insulin delivery was continued for 20 days, including during dialysis sessions. Faster-acting insulin aspart (Fiasp) was delivered via the insulin pump throughout the closed-loop study period. Fiasp was used for its properties of faster onset and offset of action, and its potential to enhance closed-loop performance. No prandial insulin boluses were delivered and the control algorithm was not aware of timing or carbohydrate content of meals. Infusion sets were changed at each dialysis session by the study team.</p>
                <p id="Par41">Participants were unrestricted in relation to their usual activity and dietary intake. The study did not interfere with or specify the medications prescribed by the local clinical team. All participants were provided with a 24-h telephone helpline to contact the local study team in the event of study-related issues. At the end of the closed-loop period, devices were removed and participants’ usual insulin therapy re-started.</p>

Fingerstick capillary glucose measurements were performed by participants as per usual clinical practice. Glycemic management was performed by the clinical team according to local practice. A continuous glucose sensor, Dexcom G6 (Dexcom), was inserted by the study team on the first day of the study arm.
