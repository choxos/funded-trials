                  <p id="Par1">Ambulatory phlebectomies and foam sclerotherapy are two of the most common treatments for varicose vein tributaries. Many studies have been published on these treatments, but few comparative studies have attempted to determine their relative effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a prospective single-centre randomised clinical trial. Patients with primary truncal vein incompetence and varicose vein tributaries requiring treatment will be assigned randomly to either ambulatory phlebectomies or foam sclerotherapy. The primary outcome measure is the re-intervention rate for the varicose vein tributaries during the study period. The secondary outcomes include the degree of pain during the first two post-operative weeks and the time to return to usual activities or work. Improvements in clinical scores, quality of life scores, occlusion rates and cost-effectiveness for each intervention are other secondary outcomes. The re-intervention rate will be considered from the third month.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Approximately one-third of the adult population have varicose veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Chronic venous disease causes a significant negative effect on the quality of life (QoL) of patients; however, there is a significant improvement in the QoL following treatment for varicose veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Over the last 15âyears, minimally invasive endovenous techniques for treating varicose veins have been introduced. These techniques have been proved to be cost-effective and safe, particularly when performed under a local anaesthetic in an outpatient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The American Venous Forum and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence have recommended endovenous thermal ablation techniques, namely radiofrequency ablation or endovenous laser ablation, as the first-line treatments for truncal reflux since 2011 and 2013, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">However, the treatment of prominent varicosities can be undertaken concurrently or at a later date using either ambulatory phlebectomy (AP) or foam sclerotherapy (FS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Carradice and colleagues compared the concomitant treatment of varicosities to delayed treatment using AP following endovenous laser ablation of truncal veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Their data demonstrated that one patient (4%) in the concomitant group needed to have a re-intervention at 6âweeks compared to 16 out of 24 in the delayed treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">Moreover, Lane et al. conducted a prospective comparative randomised trial comparing delayed AP against simultaneous AP after radiofrequency ablation. Their results showed that 2% of patients in the simultaneous group needed another intervention compared to 36% in the delayed group (<italic>P</italic>â&lt;â0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The relative risk that patients would require further varicosity treatment was 18.36, while the odds ratio was 27.78. In recent work by Gibson et al. with 50 patients, 65% of the patients required adjunctive treatment after 3 months of treating truncal veins with cyanoacrylate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">De Roos et al. compared sclerotherapy and AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They found that the recurrence rate at 1âyear following sclerotherapy was 25% compared to 2.1% in the phlebectomy group. The relative risk for recurrence at 1âyear was 12 and the odds ratio was 15.67. After 2 years, the recurrence rate was 37.5% in the sclerotherapy group with a relative risk of 18 and odds ratio of 28.20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The study, however, considered only the lateral anterior vein and used a liquid sclerosant rather a foam sclerosant, so that these results cannot be generalised to tributaries treated after truncal vein ablation using FS.</p>
              <p id="Par18">We, therefore, propose to undertake a randomised study comparing FS with AP to treat varicose vein tributaries concurrently with endovenous truncal ablation. The study is designed as a parallel group superiority study.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par19">The primary objective is to ascertain the re-intervention rate following treatment with each modality. Pain score over the first 2âweeks will be assessed as a secondary objective using a 100-mm visual analogue scale and a numerical scale from 0 to 10. As additional secondary objectives, we will assess QoL, Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS), degree of bruising and phlebitis, patient satisfaction, time to return to normal activities and cost-effectiveness.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p id="Par21">Inclusion criteria are primary truncal vein incompetence and varicose vein tributaries requiring treatment. Participants must be 18 years old or older. Exclusion criteria are current deep vein thrombosis, recurrent varicose veins, arterial disease (ankle brachial pressure index &lt;â0.8), vein diameterâ&lt;3âmm, unwillingness to participate, inability or unwillingness to complete the questionnaires or attend follow-up appointments, preference for one of the treatment options or currently enrolled in a study of varicose vein treatments.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par22">All eligible patients will be comprehensively informed about the study and given a written information sheet. If they agree to take part in the study, they will be asked to sign a consent form. Following study enrolment, patients will be randomised to receive either of the two study interventions (AP or FS) to treat their varicose tributaries after having their truncal saphenous veins treated (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At the time of randomisation, each patient will then be allocated a unique study number to maintain confidentiality.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Trial flowchart. AVVQ Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire, CIVQ-14 Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire, EQ-5D EuroQol Five-Domain Utility Index, VCSS Venous Clinical Severity Score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3398_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par23">At the baseline, basic demographic data will be collected for each patient. Patientsâ contact details will also be collected to enable the scheduling of follow-up appointments. At the pre-intervention evaluation, patients will be asked to complete the following QoL questionnaires: the EuroQol five-domain utility index (EQ-5D), the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and the Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ). Their VCSS will be also assessed.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Following treatment of the truncal saphenous vein, adjuvant AP or FS will be carried out. AP is performed under either a local or a general anaesthetic, usually with a vein hook to enable venous extraction through micro-incisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. FS is guided by an ultrasound scan according to Tessariâs method to create a stable and compact sclerosant foam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Sclerosants used include sodium tetradecyl sulphate and polidocanol. This study will utilise sodium tetradecyl sulphate.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Post-intervention, all patients will be given a diary in which they will be asked to record their post-procedural pain every day for 10âdays using a validated 100-mm visual analogue scale and asked to record when they are able to return to their normal daily activities and to work. Verbal and written instruction will be given on how the diary should be completed. In both groups, patients will be asked to wear compression stockings (class II 18â24âmmHg) for 1 week post-treatment and they will be advised to be active as much as possible. Each patientâs general practitioner will be sent a letter informing them of their patientâs participation in the study.</p>

                <p id="Par36">From the published literature, we anticipate a re-intervention rate of 5% in the AP group and 25% in the FS group. Utilising Pearsonâs chi-squared test, with a power of 80% at the 5% significance level, 58 patients per group (for a total of 116) would be required to detect an absolute difference of at least 20% in the re-intervention rates. ï»¿Assumingï»¿ a drop-out rate from follow-up of about 30%, we estimate that 160 patients would be required in total. It is assumed that at least three eligible patients will be enrolled per week, giving a total of 156 patients who could potentially be randomised over the year. With the 12âmonths of follow-up, this study will run for 24 months.</p>

At the 2-week follow-up, the patientâs diary will be collected, but no decision regarding re-treatment will be taken. At all follow-ups, they will undergo a clinical assessment and their VCSS will be recorded. Additionally, patients will be asked to fill out the EQ-5D, AVVQ and CIVIQ-14 questionnaires. All patients will be asked how satisfied they were with their treatment using a satisfaction questionnaire (ranging from 0â=âvery bad to 10â=âexcellent). At the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups, a duplex ultrasonographic scan will be carried out to determine if there is occlusion of the treated vein.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schedule of enrolment, interventions and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2019_3398_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>

                <p id="Par40">No decision regarding re-intervention will be made before the 3-month follow-up. From this point, any recurrence of tributaries will be assessed from the patentâs history and a physical examination at the 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Re-intervention is indicated by the symptomatic recurrence of varicosities in the areas previously treated that are deemed to necessitate treatment by both the clinician and the patient. The method used for re-intervention will be chosen by the clinician who is caring for the patient.</p>

                <p id="Par47">All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. To determine the normality of the data, both a visual test and a ShapiroâWilk test will be used. If the data are normally distributed, the mean and standard deviation will be reported, otherwise the median and interquartile range. Categorial variables will be presented as frequencies and percentages. If the data are normally distributed, <italic>t</italic>-tests will be used or the MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic> test if not. Assessments of the changes in scores from the baseline to each follow-up visit will be investigated using a repeated measures ANOVA. The primary outcome measure is a comparison of the re-intervention rates between groups at 12âmonths. This will be assessed with a MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic> test.</p>
                <p id="Par48">The data will be assessed for missing values. The complete data set will be analysed using the listwise deletion methodology. The multiple imputation methodology will be used for missing data points.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Freedom from re-intervention curves will be analysed utilising survival analysis and KaplanâMeier estimation methods with re-intervention classified as the failure event. Missing values for re-intervention due to loss to follow-up will be censored in the survival analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par51">An adverse event is defined as any undesirable medical experience by a patient, whether or not it is related to the intervention. A severe adverse event (SAE) is a life-threatening experience. All adverse events should be documented and these reporting procedures should be followed. Queries should be directed to the chief investigator in the first instance. The chief investigator should be notified of all SAEs within 24âh. All SAEs should be reported to the research ethics committee if, in the opinion of the chief investigator, the event was related to the intervention. Reports of related and unexpected SAEs should be submitted within 15âdays by the chief investigator, using the National Research Ethics Service SAE form for non-investigational medicinal product studies. Local investigators should report any SAEs as required by their local research ethics committee, the sponsor, and the research and development office.
