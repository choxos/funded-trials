                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel corinavirus (later named SARS-CoV-2 virus), was fistly reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China towards the end of 2019. Large-scale spread within China and internationally led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. There are no antivirals of proven clinical efficacy in coronavirus infections. Remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleoside analogue, has inhibitory effects on animal and human highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, in in vitro and in vivo experiments. It is also inhibitory against the COVID-19 virus in vitro. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in adult patients with severe COVID-19.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The protocol is prepared in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelines. This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. Adults (≥ 18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 virus infection, severe pneumonia signs or symptoms, and radiologically confirmed severe pneumonia are randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to intravenously administered remdesivir or placebo for 10 days. The primary endpoint is time to clinical improvement (censored at day 28), defined as the time (in days) from randomization of study treatment (remdesivir or placebo) until a decline of two categories on a six-category ordinal scale of clinical status (1 = discharged; 6 = death) or live discharge from hospital. One interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted once half of the total number of events required has been observed.</p>

              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par5">In December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province experienced an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. On 7<sup>th</sup> January 2020, a previously unidentified betacoronavirus, later named SARS-CoV-2 virus (or the disease named COVID-19), was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) as the aetiological agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 probably derived originally from bats, and amongst coronaviruses known to infect humans, is most closely related to, but distinct from, the SARS coronavirus. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. Although the risk of severe illness is not yet clear, hospitals in areas with significant community transmission have experienced a major increase in the number of hospitalized pneumonia patients, with the frequency of severe disease in hospitalized patients being as high as 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The progression from prodromes (usually fever, fatigue, and cough) to severe pneumonia requiring oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is most commonly seen in the second week following onset of symptoms of a viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The kinetics of viral replication in the respiratory tract has not been well characterized, but this relatively slow progression provides a potential time window and opportunity for antiviral therapies to influence the course of the disease.</p>
                <p id="Par6">Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue (GS-441524) and has broad action against a range of RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been identified as the most promising therapeutic agent for evaluation in the treatment of COVID-19 by an expert committee convened by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The primary mechanism of action is the intracellular incorporation of the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate form into nascent RNA chains by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, causing premature RNA chain termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In vitro experiments have shown that remdesivir inhibits bat coronaviruses, endemic human coronavirus (OC43, 229E), and the human pathogenic coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Remdesivir has shown preventive and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of SARS-CoV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a MERS-CoV mouse model, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir improved lung function, decreased lung viral load, and reduced severe lung pathological findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Remdesivir has also shown prophylactic efficacy in MERS-CoV-infected Indian rhesus monkeys (personal communication: Gilead Sciences, Inc.).</p>
                <p id="Par7">Evaluation of intravenously administered remdesivir tolerance and safety in 94 healthy adult volunteers has found it to be generally well tolerated and to have an acceptable safety profile. The only significant adverse effects were transient grade 1 or grade 2 increases in aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) (personal communication: Gilead Sciences, Inc.). Further clinical experience was obtained through a randomized controlled trial in patients with Ebola virus disease. In this trial 175 patients received intravenous remdesivir with a loading dose on day 1 (200 mg in adults, and adjusted for body weight in pediatric patients), followed by a daily maintenance dose (100 mg in adults) starting on day 2 and continuing for 9 to 13 days. The only reported serious adverse event (SAE) was that of one patient who experienced hypotension that resulted in cessation of the remdesivir loading dose, followed rapidly by cardiac arrest. However, the cause of death could not be distinguished from the patient’s underlying severe Ebola virus disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par8">Given the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of remdesivir against a range of pathogenic human coronaviruses and the acceptable tolerance and safety in humans, we developed this trial with the objective of evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19.</p>

                  <p id="Par30">The active arm is intravenously administered remdesivir in addition to routine supportive care. Remdesivir was chosen for evaluation because of its in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, and its in vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. There are safety data for remdesivir in healthy human volunteers and individuals with Ebola virus disease. These data suggest that remdesivir is generally well tolerated and has an acceptable safety profile. It has been identified as the most promising therapeutic agent for treatment of COVID-19 by the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The dose of remdesivir was selected on the recommendation of Gilead Sciences, Inc., based on known pharmacokinetics and dose-ranging studies in healthy volunteers. The control arm is placebo in addition to routine supportive care. There are no proven antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 to include as an active control comparator.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par99">This study is the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an experimental therapeutic for COVID-19. Whilst the COVID-19 epidemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern, this does not negate the need to generate robust evidence in which healthcare professionals, patients, their families, and public health authorities can have confidence. In past epidemics, unproven treatments have been used on a compassionate use basis, in observational studies, or in underpowered trials, and the results are uncertainty and ongoing treatment dilemmas. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are well established as the best way to minimize bias and confounding and produce reliable evidence. Such trials can be implemented even in the most difficult circumstances; in fact, the difficult circumstances themselves make it even more important that patient care is not driven by fear and rumour but by science and evidence. During health emergencies, doctors and politicians are under enormous pressure to find cures to save lives and stop the epidemic, whilst patients are willing to try anything in the face of a frightening and unknown threat. We must resist these pressures and make sure that patients benefit from the fruits of science, even in difficult times.</p>
              <p id="Par100">The use of placebo is especially beneficial in the midst of great anxiety, when the pressures to announce a cure or act on preliminary, but inconclusive data, are intense. A placebo relieves the temptation from all involved in the trial to engage in speculation and the worry that they are withholding what early (but often false) impressions may suggest is a promising drug. Whilst remdesivir has shown promising activity in preclinical models of severe CoV infection, it is currently unknown whether it will prove safe and effective in treating severe COVID-19, both because of its uncertain antiviral efficacy and the unclear importance of ongoing viral replication versus an inflammatory process in disease pathogenesis in severely ill patients. Of note, remdesivir yielded positive results in preclinical models of Ebola virus infection but was inferior to two monoclonal antibody therapies in treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par101">During epidemics, as well as calls to treat everyone, other voices demand that vulnerable patients not be treated as ‘guinea pigs’. Clinical trials use well-deliberated, tested, and transparent scientific methods, and are undertaken as a joint endeavour between patients and health professionals within a clear ethical framework. Health emergencies raise additional ethical concerns, but these have been carefully considered by various groups, and clear guidance exists on the conduct of clinical research during health emergencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par102">The choice of the primary endpoint for a clinical trial is always challenging, but it has added difficulties when dealing with a disease with uncertain natural history, an overstretched workforce, and the desire for an early answer. This requires an endpoint that is clinically meaningful, is based on simple data collection, has sufficient power, and will occur early. It also requires statistical methods that are robust to misspecification of design parameters, such as the endpoint frequency. We believe that our primary endpoint is both pragmatic and informative, but we have included a range of secondary endpoints to show consistency with the primary endpoint, as recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration for trials in influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
