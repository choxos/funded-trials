                  <p>The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be curtailed by vaccination. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a viral vectored coronavirus vaccine that expresses the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial in five trial sites in the UK of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) as control. Healthy adults aged 18–55 years with no history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19-like symptoms were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at a dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles or MenACWY as a single intramuscular injection. A protocol amendment in two of the five sites allowed prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination. Ten participants assigned to a non-randomised, unblinded ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group received a two-dose schedule, with the booster vaccine administered 28 days after the first dose. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay, three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (a 50% plaque reduction neutralisation assay [PRNT<sub>50</sub>]; a microneutralisation assay [MNA<sub>50</sub>, MNA<sub>80</sub>, and MNA<sub>90</sub>]; and Marburg VN), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay. Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The co-primary outcomes are to assess efficacy, as measured by cases of symptomatic virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were done by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Safety was assessed over 28 days after vaccination. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses. The study is ongoing, and was registered at ISRCTN, 15281137, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04324606" id="interrefs20">NCT04324606</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 23 and May 21, 2020, 1077 participants were enrolled and assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=543) or MenACWY (n=534), ten of whom were enrolled in the non-randomised ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost group. Local and systemic reactions were more common in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and many were reduced by use of prophylactic paracetamol, including pain, feeling feverish, chills, muscle ache, headache, and malaise (all p&lt;0·05). There were no serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. In the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, spike-specific T-cell responses peaked on day 14 (median 856 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells, IQR 493–1802; n=43). Anti-spike IgG responses rose by day 28 (median 157 ELISA units [EU], 96–317; n=127), and were boosted following a second dose (639 EU, 360–792; n=10). Neutralising antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of 35 participants after a single dose when measured in MNA<sub>80</sub> and in 35 (100%) participants when measured in PRNT<sub>50</sub>. After a booster dose, all participants had neutralising activity (nine of nine in MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 and ten of ten in Marburg VN on day 56). Neutralising antibody responses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0·67 by Marburg VN; p&lt;0·001).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed an acceptable safety profile, and homologous boosting increased antibody responses. These results, together with the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses, support large-scale evaluation of this candidate vaccine in an ongoing phase 3 programme.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para30">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of COVID-19 in January, 2020. There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent COVID-19. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has previously been reported to be immunogenic and protective against pneumonia in a rhesus macaque challenge model. We searched PubMed for research articles published between database inception and July 6, 2020, using the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, “clinical trial”, and “phase”. No language restrictions were applied. We identified one published clinical trial, describing a trial done in China of an adenovirus-5-vectored vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, using a single dose at three different dose levels. The vaccine was tolerated, with reactogenicity increased at the highest dose. Antibodies, neutralising antibodies in a proportion of vaccinees, and cellular responses were induced. A further clinical trial, which was done in the USA, has been reported on <italic>medRxiv</italic>. The vaccine was a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified, mRNA vaccine that encodes trimerised SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain administered at one or two doses of three dose levels. The vaccine was tolerated, with reactogenicity increased at the highest dose. Antibodies and neutralising antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent manner and increased after a second dose.</p>
                <p id="para40">
                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">We report the results of the first clinical study of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222). The vaccine was safe and tolerated, with reduced reactogenicity when paracetamol was used prophylactically for the first 24 h after vaccination. Reactogenicity was reduced after a second dose. Humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peaked by day 28 post prime and cellular responses were induced in all participants by day 14. Neutralising antibodies were induced in all participants after a second vaccine dose. After two doses, potent cellular and humoral immunogenicity was present in all participants studied.</p>
                <p id="para60">
                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could be used to prevent infection, disease, and death in the global population, with high-risk populations such as hospital workers and older adults (eg, ≥65 years of age) prioritised to receive vaccination. The immune correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined. Immunisation with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 results in rapid induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, with increased responses after a second dose. Further clinical studies, including in older adults, should be done with this vaccine.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a zoonotic virus late in 2019 and is the causative agent of COVID-19. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can result in a range of clinical outcomes, varying from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory distress and death. SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by WHO. As of July 19, 2020, more than 14 million people globally have been infected with more than 597 000 deaths.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The pandemic has placed substantial pressures on health systems delivering care for patients with COVID-19 and caused disruption of non-COVID-19 health-care provision, in addition to negative effects on the global economy. Further health consequences are anticipated.</p>
              <p id="para90">No vaccines have been approved for prevention of COVID-19. There are currently more than 137 candidates undergoing preclinical development and 23 in early clinical development, according to WHO.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> An ideal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 would be effective after one or two vaccinations; would protect target populations such as older adults and those with comorbidities, including immunocompromised individuals; would confer protection for a minimum of 6 months; and would reduce onward transmission of the virus to contacts. Replication-deficient viral vectored vaccines have been used in immunocompromised individuals with no safety concerns<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and ChAdOx1 vaccines are immunogenic in older adults<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and can be manufactured at large scale, making this platform technology a promising candidate to develop a vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Adenoviral vectors have previously been combined with DNA and poxviral vectors to attempt to improve immunogenicity, with adenovirus or modified vaccinia virus Ankara prime-boost regimens showing enhancement of both cellular and humoral immunity. Use of homologous adenoviral regimens has largely been avoided because of presumed induction of antivector immunity, inhibiting the potency of a second dose.</p>
              <p id="para100">Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a glycoprotein spike on the surface, which mediates receptor binding and cell entry during infection. The roles of the spike protein in receptor binding and membrane fusion make it an attractive vaccine antigen. We have previously shown that a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS, a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine that encodes the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), protected non-human primates against MERS-CoV-induced disease,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and data from a phase 1 clinical trial showed that ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all three doses tested (5 × 10<sup>9</sup> viral particles, 2·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles, and 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In addition, the highest dose elicited both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV in all vaccinees within 1 month of vaccination.</p>
              <p id="para110">The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) consists of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx1, containing the full-length structural surface glycoprotein (spike protein) of SARS-CoV-2, with a tissue plasminogen activator leader sequence. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 expresses a codon-optimised coding sequence for the spike protein (GenBank accession number MN908947).</p>
              <p id="para120">In rhesus macaques, a single vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 induced humoral and cellular immune responses. Protection against lower respiratory tract infection was observed in vaccinated non-human primates after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para130">We did a phase 1/2 single-blind, randomised controlled trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 compared with a licensed meningococcal group A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine (MenACWY; Nimenrix, Pfizer, UK), as control vaccine, in healthy adults in the UK. In this preliminary report, we describe the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of vaccination with 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in single-dose and two-dose regimens.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para140">This phase 1/2, participant-blinded, multicentre, randomised controlled trial is being done at five centres in the UK (Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford; NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton; Clinical Research Facility, Imperial College London; St Georges University of London and University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust; and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust). Healthy adult participants aged 18–55 years were recruited through local advertisements. All participants underwent a screening visit where a full medical history and examination was taken in addition to blood and urine tests (HIV; hepatitis B and C serology; full blood count; kidney and liver function tests; and urinary screen for blood, protein, and glucose and a pregnancy test done in women of childbearing potential). Volunteers with a history of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; those at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure pre-enrolment (ie, front-line health-care workers working in emergency departments, intensive care units, and COVID-19 wards, and close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases; see <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1 p 82</xref> for further details); and those with a new onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and anosmia or ageusia since Feb 1, 2020, were excluded from the study. An amendment to the study protocol (amendment date April 21, 2020) allowed for recruitment of health-care workers with a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology at screening, once an antibody test became available. As it was not possible to screen for negative SARS-CoV-2 serology in all participants, some enrolled participants had high-level anti-spike antibodies at baseline and their data are included in all analyses. Full details of the eligibility criteria are described in the trial protocol provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1 (pp 80–82)</xref>.</p>
                <p id="para150">Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial is being done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. This study was approved in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (reference 21584/0424/001-0001) and the South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (reference 20/SC/0145). Vaccine use was authorised by Genetically Modified Organisms Safety Committees at each participating site.</p>

              <sec id="cesec40">
                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para160">Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or the MenACWY vaccine. MenACWY was used as a comparator vaccine to maintain blinding of participants who experienced local or systemic reactions, since these reactions are a known association with viral vector vaccinations. Use of saline as a placebo would risk unblinding participants as those who had notable reactions would know they were in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine group.</p>
                <p id="para170">Randomisation lists, using block randomisation stratified by study group and study site, were generated by the study statistician (MV). Block sizes of two and four were chosen to align with the study group sizes and the sequence of enrolment, and varied across study groups. Computer randomisation was done with full allocation concealment within the secure web platform used for the study electronic case report form (REDCap version 9.5.22; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA). The trial staff administering the vaccine prepared vaccines out of sight of the participants and syringes were covered with an opaque material until ready for administration to ensure blinding of participants. Clinical investigators and the laboratory team remained blinded to group allocation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para180">The recombinant adenovirus for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was produced as previously described.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The vaccine was manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice by the Clinical BioManufacturing Facility (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) as previously described,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> with only minor modifications, as described in the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier and approved by the regulatory agency in the UK. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was administered at a dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles. The MenACWY vaccine was provided by the UK Department of Health and Social Care and administered as per summary of product characteristics at the standard dose of 0·5 mL. Vaccines were administered as a single intramuscular injection into the deltoid.</p>
                <p id="para190">Participants were recruited and followed up according to groups. Participants were recruited first for groups 1 and 3, then group 2, and then group 4. Group 1 (the phase 1 component of the study) consisted of participants who had intensive early follow-up visits for safety and immunogenicity purposes at days 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 after vaccination. Group 2 consisted of participants who had higher blood volumes drawn for humoral and cellular immunogenicity assessment than group 4, which consisted of participants who had a serum sample drawn for humoral immunology assessments only. Group 3 consisted of ten participants who were enrolled in a non-randomised prime-boost group and received a booster ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administered 28 days after the first dose. These participants were not blinded and had extensive follow-up for safety and immunogenicity purposes, as per group 1, after each dose. A staggered-enrolment approach was used for the first two, six, and 90 participants recruited in groups 1 and 3 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1 p 89</xref>) and interim safety reviews with the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board were done before proceeding with vaccinations in larger numbers of volunteers. Volunteers were considered enrolled into the trial at the point of vaccination.</p>
                <p id="para200">Participants in all groups had blood samples drawn and clinical assessments for safety as well as immunology at days 0 and 28, and will also be followed up at days 184 and 364. A later amendment to the protocol (amendment date June 22, 2020) provided for additional testing of booster vaccinations in a subset of participants, the results of which are not yet available and are not included in this Article.</p>
                <p id="para210">In two of the five trial sites (Oxford and Southampton), a protocol amendment (amendment date May 6, 2020) was implemented to allow prophylactic paracetamol to be administered before vaccination and participants were advised to continue with 1 g of paracetamol every 6 h for 24 h to reduce vaccine-associated reactions. All participants enrolled after the protocol amendment at these two sites were given prophylactic paracetamol and randomised equally to the vaccine or control arms of the study.</p>
                <p id="para220">Participants were observed in the clinic for 30–60 min after the vaccination procedure and were asked to record any adverse events using electronic diaries during the 28-day follow-up period. Expected and protocol-defined local site reactions (injection site pain, tenderness, warmth, redness, swelling, induration, and itch) and systemic symptoms (malaise, muscle ache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, feverishness [ie, a self-reported feeling of having a fever], and objective fever defined as an oral temperature of 38°C or higher) were recorded for 7 days. All other events were recorded for 28 days and serious adverse events are recorded throughout the follow-up period.</p>
                <p id="para230">Severity of adverse events are graded with the following criteria: mild (transient or mild discomfort for &lt;48 h, no interference with activity, and no medical intervention or therapy required), moderate (mild to moderate limitation in activity [some assistance might be needed] and no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required), severe (marked limitation in activity [some assistance usually required] and medical intervention or therapy required), and potentially life-threatening (requires assessment in emergency department or hospitalisation). Unsolicited adverse events are reviewed for causality by two clinicians blinded to group allocation, and events considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study vaccines were reported. Laboratory adverse events were graded by use of site-specific toxicity tables, which were adapted from the US Food and Drug Administration toxicity grading scale.</p>
                <p id="para240">Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay to enumerate antigen-specific T cells. Humoral responses at baseline and following vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS CoV-2 spike protein, a muliplexed immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery multiplexed immunoassay [MIA] against spike and receptor binding domain), three live SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assays (Public Health England [PHE] plaque reduction neutralisation test [PRNT IC<sub>50</sub>], PHE microneutralisation assay [MNA IC<sub>50</sub>, IC<sub>80</sub>, IC<sub>90</sub>], and Marburg virus neutralisation [VN IC<sub>100</sub>]), and a pseudovirus neutralisation assay (PseudoNA IC<sub>50</sub>). PHE PRNT is a live neutralisation assay and was done at PHE (Porton Down, UK). PHE MNA is a rapid microneutralisation assay, which was conducted in the same laboratory. The third assay, Marburg VN, was conducted at Marburg University (Marburg, Germany). Full details on the assays are provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 1 (pp 31–34)</xref>. Owing to the labour-intensive nature of some of these assays, we prioritised analysis of samples from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, randomly selecting more samples from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 participants than control samples to be sent for analysis.</p>
                <p id="para250">Convalescent plasma samples from adults (≥18 years) with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from symptomatic patients admitted to hospital or from surveillance on health-care workers who did not have symptomatic infection. These samples were tested using standardised ELISA, MIA, PseudoNA, and Marburg VN. Different samples were analysed across the assays, dependent on sample availability, laboratory capacity, and assay-specific requirements. Where multiple longitudinal samples were available for the same participant, only one timepoint is included in the analyses in this Article and the earliest timepoint (at least 20 days after initial symptoms) was selected.</p>

              <p id="para470">Our preliminary findings show that the candidate ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine given as a single dose was safe and tolerated, despite a higher reactogenicity profile than the control vaccine, MenACWY. No serious adverse reactions to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 occurred. The majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate in severity, and all were self-limiting. The profile of adverse events reported here is similar to that for other ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines and other closely related simian adenoviruses, such as ChAdOx2, ChAd3, and ChAd63, expressing multiple different antigens<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> at this dose level, as well as to some licensed vaccines.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> A dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles was chosen on the basis of our previous experience with ChAdOx1 MERS, where despite increased reactogenicity, a dose–response relationship with neutralising antibodies was observed.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The protocol was written when the pandemic was accelerating in the UK and a single higher dose was chosen to provide the highest chance of rapid induction of neutralising antibody. In the context of a pandemic wave where a single higher, but more reactogenic, dose might be more likely to rapidly induce protective immunity, the use of prophylactic paracetamol appears to increase tolerability and would reduce confusion with COVID-19 symptoms that might be caused by short-lived vaccine-related symptoms without compromising immunogenicity.</p>
              <p id="para480">We show that a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 elicits an increase in spike-specific antibodies by day 28 and neutralising antibody in all participants after a booster dose. High levels of neutralising antibody at baseline seen in a small number of participants probably indicates prior asymptomatic infection, as potential participants with recent COVID-19-like symptoms or with a history of positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the study. Individuals with high titres on the day of vaccination who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were boosted by vaccination.</p>

In a non-human primate study where primary SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited at least short-term protection against reinfection, neutralising antibody titres of the magnitude found in our study after boosting appeared sufficient to confer protection using the Marburg VN assay methodology.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Neutralising antibody titres were increased by a two-dose regimen, and further investigation of this approach is underway. The correlation of neutralisation assays with IgG quantitation indicates that, if confirmed, a standardised ELISA might be sufficient to predict protection, should neutralising antibody also be shown to be protective in humans. We have presented data from three different live neutralising antibody assays and a pseudo-neutralisation assay, which show tight correlation with each other but give very different neutralising antibody titres. This issue highlights the urgent need for centralised laboratory infrastructure to allow bridging between vaccine candidates and accelerate the availability of multiple products to provide the global capacity to end the pandemic. If any one candidate demonstrates efficacy, bridging this result to other candidate vaccines through rigorously conducted laboratory assays will become a crucial issue for global health.</p>
              <p id="para510">Importantly, there are accumulating data to suggest T-cell responses play an important role in COVID-19 mitigation; individuals who were exposed but asymptomatic developed a robust memory T-cell response without symptomatic disease in the absence of a measurable humoral response.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Adenovirus-vectored vaccines are known to induce strong cellular immunity and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination resulted in marked increases in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific effector T-cell responses as early as day 7, peaking at day 14 and maintained up to day 56 as expected with adenoviral vectors. However, a boost in cellular responses was not observed following the second ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 dose. This is consistent with previous findings on viral vectored vaccines given as part of a homologous prime-boost regimen.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>

              <p id="para520">Severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 disproportionally affect older individuals. Therefore, it is important that vaccines developed to reduce or prevent COVID-19 are suitable for administration in older age groups. Immunogenicity of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against influenza has been shown in older adults (50–78 years of age).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> As previously reported,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> anti-vector immunity was low before vaccination in UK adults aged 18–55 years, with no relationship between the presence of antibodies to ChAdOx1 and immune response to the vaccine antigen.

Further studies are required to assess the vaccine in various population groups including older age groups, those with comorbidities, and in ethnically and geographically diverse populations.

Older age groups with comorbidities, health-care workers, and those with higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure are being recruited and assessed for efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 given as a single-dose or two-dose administration regimen in further trials conducted in the UK and overseas. We will also evaluate the vaccine in children, once sufficient safety data have been accumulated in adult studies. Phase 3 trials are now underway in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK and will evaluate vaccine efficacy in diverse populations.</p>
