In this study, we examined the association between neighborhood regeneration and mental health. Information on regeneration activities in 35 intervention areas (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4,197 subjects) and 75 control areas (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6,695 subjects) was linked to data on mental health from a cohort study with assessments made in 2001 (before regeneration) and 2008 (after regeneration). Propensity score matching was used to estimate the change in mental health in intervention neighborhoods versus control neighborhoods. Baseline differences between intervention and control areas were of similar magnitude as produced by paired randomization of neighborhoods. Regeneration was associated with an improvement in the mental health of residents in intervention areas compared with control neighborhoods (&#x003b2; =&#x000a0;1.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 2.59), suggesting a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in mental health.

In 2001, the Welsh Government, United Kingdom, funded Communities First, a program of neighborhood regeneration delivered to the 100 most deprived of the 881 electoral wards in Wales. In this study, we examined the association between neighborhood regeneration and mental health.

Propensity score matching was used to estimate the change in mental health in intervention neighborhoods versus control neighborhoods. Baseline differences between intervention and control areas were of similar magnitude as produced by paired randomization of neighborhoods. Regeneration was associated with an improvement in the mental health of residents in intervention areas compared with control neighborhoods (β = 1.54, 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 2.59), suggesting a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in mental health. There was a dose-response relationship between length of residence in regeneration neighborhoods and improvements in mental health (<italic>P</italic>-trend = 0.05).

            <p>A series of studies has shown that poor mental health is more common among residents of low-quality housing (<xref rid="kwx086C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="kwx086C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), less desirable neighborhoods (e.g., those with litter, graffiti, and few street lights) (<xref rid="kwx086C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="kwx086C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and socioeconomically deprived areas (<xref rid="kwx086C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="kwx086C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Support for these associations has not been universal; all have shown marked attenuation after individual- or household-level measures of socioeconomic disadvantage have been accounted for (<xref rid="kwx086C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="kwx086C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). If the association between poor mental health and the quality of the neighborhood environment were causal, this would suggest that neighborhood regeneration could help to reduce inequalities in mental health.</p>
            <p>Large regeneration projects are common in the United Kingdom; examples include New Deal for Communities (<xref rid="kwx086C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and Go Well (<xref rid="kwx086C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Regeneration projects also exist elsewhere, including Empowerment Zones in the United States (<xref rid="kwx086C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and the URBAN Community Initiative in mainland Europe (<xref rid="kwx086C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Because low-quality housing and neighborhoods (<xref rid="kwx086C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="kwx086C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), as well as the wider social, economic, and environmental determinants of poor health, are concentrated in the most deprived areas (<xref rid="kwx086C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="kwx086C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), policy-makers often target deprived neighborhoods for regeneration with the expectation that socioeconomic inequality will be reduced and population health will improve. The hypothesized mechanisms through which neighborhood regeneration might improve mental health includes improving physical health through housing improvements (<xref rid="kwx086C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), increasing social capital and support by establishing community groups (<xref rid="kwx086C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), enhancing feelings of control and empowerment (<xref rid="kwx086C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and reducing crime by enhancing neighborhood security (<xref rid="kwx086C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
            <p>There have been few studies on the relationship between targeted neighborhood regeneration and mental health. Of the controlled evaluations carried out to date, the New Deal for Communities project, an areawide regeneration scheme in England, United Kingdom, found that regeneration was not associated with change in mental health in comparison with randomly sampled residents from noncontiguous comparator areas (<xref rid="kwx086C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="kwx086C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or Health Survey for England participants with similar area-level deprivation (<xref rid="kwx086C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the smaller Single Regeneration Budget program, based in Manchester, United Kingdom, no difference in mental health scores was found between residents of intervention wards and neighboring control wards (<xref rid="kwx086C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, the Go Well regeneration program in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, found that residents of areas receiving housing improvements reported an improvement in mental health in comparison with residents in control areas (<xref rid="kwx086C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The improvement was also greater for the residents of areas that received more than £10,000 (US$16,200 at the midyear 2011 currency exchange rate) in investment per household than for residents of areas that received less than £5,000 ($8,100), suggesting a relatively high threshold in the investment required to narrow inequalities (<xref rid="kwx086C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Those studies, however, lack detailed assessments of individual- and household-level socioeconomic disadvantage, such that it is unclear whether intervention and comparison groups were adequately matched on socioeconomic factors that are closely associated with poor mental health.</p>
            <p>“Communities First” is an areawide socioeconomic regeneration program implemented in deprived neighborhoods in Wales, United Kingdom (<xref rid="kwx086C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We exploited an opportunity to evaluate a natural experiment, using data on neighborhoods which did and did not receive regeneration linked to an electronic record-linked prospective cohort study, the Caerphilly Health and Social Needs Electronic Cohort Study (eCATALyST) (<xref rid="kwx086C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Previous analyses of eCATALyST found that Communities First was delivered in an area with substantial socioeconomic inequalities in mental health (<xref rid="kwx086C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We therefore used propensity score matching to reduce the imbalance in socioeconomic disadvantage across intervention and control areas brought about by nonrandom targeted allocation (<xref rid="kwx086C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). We tested the hypothesis that the Communities First regeneration program would be associated with a reduction in mental health inequalities.</p>

              <title>METHODS</title>
              <p>The protocol for this prospective controlled quasi-experimental study or natural experiment has been published previously (<xref rid="kwx086C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). We linked data from 3 sources for this study: regeneration data from the Caerphilly County Borough Council (Caerphilly, Wales), the eCATALyST study (<xref rid="kwx086C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank (<xref rid="kwx086C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The eCATALyST study received ethical approval for the baseline population survey (2001) from the former Gwent Local Research Ethics Committee and for the follow-up survey (2008) from the South East Wales Research Ethics Committee, Panel C. The linking of data sets received approval from the SAIL Information Governance Review Panel at Swansea University (Swansea, Wales).</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p>Caerphilly County Borough, located in southeastern Wales, United Kingdom, is a local government unitary authority with a 2001 census population of 169,519, rising to 180,164 in the latest midyear estimate for 2015 (<xref rid="kwx086C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In 2001, the year in which the Communities First regeneration program was initiated, there were 22 local authorities in Wales, 881 electoral wards, and 1,896 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) defined in the United Kingdom Census (<xref rid="kwx086C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Employment in Caerphilly County Borough has historically been dominated by the coal industry. By 2001, the borough had a higher rate of unemployment than the Welsh average (5.4% vs. 8.5%) and a higher percentage of public housing than the Welsh average (17.1% vs. 13.7%) (<xref rid="kwx086C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the 2000 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD), a small-area-based measure of deprivation based on residents’ income, employment status, education, housing, health, and geographical access to services, it ranked fourth out of 22 local authorities in Wales in the proportion of LSOAs that were in the 10% most deprived (<xref rid="kwx086C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Although intervention in the Communities First program was allocated at the electoral ward level (average population 5,500), we used LSOAs (average population 1,630) as our measure of small-area geography, since they are smaller, more homogeneous, and nested within wards.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Communities First is a Welsh Government program of areawide socioeconomic regeneration. It is targeted at the 100 most deprived of the 881 electoral wards in Wales, according to the 2000 WIMD (<xref rid="kwx086C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). An extra 46 wards were added in 2005 following a change in rankings when the WIMD was updated. In 2001, each of the 22 local authorities in Wales received funding to establish community multiagency partnership boards which included residents of Communities First areas, the police, the United Kingdom National Health Service, local authorities, and housing providers. Partnership boards conferred with residents to identify what regeneration activities were needed. Once a candidate project was identified, a wider consultation with residents was held; if residents agreed that the project was a priority, an application was made to a potential funder, such as a charity, local government, or private industry. In some cases, funding was provided by the partnership board (<xref rid="kwx086C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Communities First was reorganized in 2012, when the ranking of wards changed following publication of the 2011 WIMD. In February 2017, the Welsh Government announced that funding for Communities First would be phased out by March 2018.</p>
                <p>We classified the projects delivered into 48 different types of intervention nested within 6 domains of regeneration. We used text descriptions and geographical locations to classify regeneration activities according to a scheme informed by a similar intervention, New Deal for Communities (<xref rid="kwx086C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Examples of funded activities in the 6 domains included those designed to address community needs regarding: 1) <italic>crime</italic>—installing street lighting; 2) <italic>education</italic>—providing teaching assistants; 3) <italic>health—</italic>providing sports equipment; 4) <italic>housing and physical environment</italic>—conducting housing maintenance and repairs and redeveloping wasteland; 5) <italic>vocational training and business support</italic>—providing computer skills training to the unemployed; and 6) <italic>community</italic>—building community facilities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figures 1 and 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Tables 1 and 2</xref>, available at <uri xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/">https://academic.oup.com/aje/</uri>, for the full classification scheme and additional examples).</p>

Briefly, in 2001, a stratified random sample of 22,236 persons aged 18 years or more was sent a baseline postal questionnaire survey, and 10,892 people responded. In 2008 the survey was repeated, sampling the 9,551 participants who still resided in the borough. Of these, 4,426 provided a valid mental health score. The patterns of response in 2001 and 2008 showed underrepresentation of younger age groups, particularly men, but no discernable bias by 1991 Townsend area-level deprivation scores (<xref rid="kwx086C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="kwx086C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).</p>

              <title>RESULTS</title>
              <p>There were 1,500 funded regeneration projects in Caerphilly County Borough during the 7-year follow-up period (2001–2008) at a cost of £82,857,180 ($161,571,501 at midyear 2008 currency exchange rate). Of these projects, over one-half (59.1%; £16,489,716 ($32,154,946)) were classified as community-based projects, with the remaining classified as improvements in housing and the physical environment (22.3%; £55,670,516 ($108,557,506)), projects in educational settings (8.0%; £5,534,839 ($10,792,936)), health improvement (4.7%; £1,321,639 ($2,577,196)), interventions to reduce crime (4.2%; £1,742,129 ($3,397,152)), and the provision of vocational training or business support (1.7%; £2,098,341 ($4,091,765)).</p>
              <p>Of the 10,892 participants, 4,197 (38.5%) were located in 35 intervention LSOAs and 6,695 in 75 control LSOAs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 2</xref>). The mean length of residence during the study period was 58.8 months (standard deviation, 17.0; range, 0.2–91.0). A total of 208 (5.0%) intervention residents and 160 (2.4%) control residents moved between 2001 and 2008. People with missing eCATALyST postintervention data in 2008 were more likely to be older, to have a semiroutine or routine occupation, to be disabled, to be living in poverty, to be married, and to be a daily smoker but were less likely to be a homeowner (all <italic>P</italic>’s &lt; 0.05).</p>
              <p>As would be expected for an intervention delivered on the basis of area-level deprivation, the largest differences between the intervention and control groups were found for employment status, housing tenure, council tax valuation band, and poverty status (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx086TB1">1</xref>). After matching, the absolute standardized differences were less than 10% for all variables entered into the propensity score, indicating an acceptable match (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx086TB2">2</xref>) (<xref rid="kwx086C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).

              <p>The descriptive data showed a reduction in the mental health of all participants over the course of the study period.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>We estimated the impact of socioeconomic regeneration on mental health in a natural experiment by linking data from a regeneration program delivered to deprived communities to data from a prospective cohort study that collected data both before and after intervention. We found that the targeted regeneration of deprived neighborhoods narrowed inequalities in mental health, and we found some evidence for a dose-response association between length of residence in a regeneration area during the study period and improvements in mental health.</p>
              <p>In propensity-score-matched analyses, regeneration in neighborhoods that had the greatest concentration of socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with a small improvement in the mental health of intervention-area residents compared with control-area residents; thus, inequalities in mental health narrowed. The effect size was equivalent to 1 out of every 3 intervention group residents increasing their response on the MHI-5 scale by 1 category (e.g., from “most of the time” to “all of the time”) or 7% of a standard deviation on the MHI-5 scale. This narrowing of inequality was found at relatively low cost, with the average cost of a community project being £18,590 ($36,251 at midyear 2008 currency exchange rate) and the average cost of a housing project being £166,180 ($324,051). The results contrast with those from most of the prospective controlled evaluations that found no association between regeneration in deprived neighborhoods and changes in mental health (<xref rid="kwx086C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="kwx086C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), but they replicate the narrowing of mental health inequalities found in the Go Well regeneration project (<xref rid="kwx086C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These inconsistencies may be attributed to differences in the effectiveness of regeneration, differences in sampling of areas or residents, or our use of propensity score matching.</p>
              <p>The main strength of this study was the availability of data from detailed pre- and postintervention assessments of socioeconomic disadvantage carried out among residents who participated in a prospective cohort study. The SAIL system enabled clinical records, migration, and duration of residence to be assessed. Our use of propensity score matching allowed us to account for the baseline differences in mental health scores by balancing several characteristics of participants (such as employment status) and households (poverty status) between intervention and control areas. Another concern was selective migration (<xref rid="kwx086C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), but we found little difference in estimates for those who had and had not moved out of intervention areas.</p>
              <p>The main limitation of this study was that a direct measure of individual exposure could not be captured by the data. Although this is common to most evaluations of neighborhood-level interventions, not all residents of intervention areas will have been exposed, and residents of control neighborhoods may have been exposed as people crossed boundaries. This would have acted to underestimate the effect size. A further limitation was loss to follow-up. Although the study had sufficient statistical power to detect a difference across intervention and control areas (<xref rid="kwx086C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), it is likely that the subgroup analysis of the types of regeneration activities was underpowered, increasing the risk of type II error. The use of auxiliary information on mental health symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments meant that for 22.5% of participants with missing cohort data, relevant information on mental health was available from general practice to improve the imputation model.</p>
              <p>The information on intervention subtype relied heavily on the accuracy of Caerphilly County Borough Council records, and it is possible that not all funded activities were recorded or not all those funded through another source were recorded. Our reliance on text descriptions of projects meant that the type of intervention could have been misclassified, which could have biased the subgroup analysis towards the null. A general limitation with propensity score analysis is that it can only balance confounders included in the model; thus, our estimates may have been different if other important variables had been included. The estimates derived from propensity scores can be comparable to those from adjustment in regression (<xref rid="kwx086C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), particularly when using propensity scores as a covariate, but less so when matching participants as we did.</p>
              <p>This study has wider implications for the methods used to evaluate nonrandomized targeted interventions. Given the enormous amounts of money spent on areawide regeneration in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe and the paucity of evidence on its effectiveness, randomized allocation of areas may be both the fairest means of allocation and the best method of enabling robust evaluation to inform decisions on continued support or disinvestment (<xref rid="kwx086C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="kwx086C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). We found that propensity score matching was able to balance intervention and control groups for known confounding factors in an area with socioeconomic inequalities in mental health. In future studies, investigators should compare effect-size estimates from propensity-score-matched analyses with those from randomized trials to examine the value of this analytical approach.</p>
              <p>The regeneration program we evaluated, Communities First, is unique in that community residents, rather than local councils or governments, identified areas to be regenerated. The policy implication of this finding is that targeted regeneration directed by the residents of deprived urban communities may help to reduce inequalities in mental health.</p>
