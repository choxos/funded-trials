                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Gartisertib is an oral inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), a key kinase of the DNA damage response. We aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of gartisertib ± carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This phase I open-label, multicenter, first-in-human study comprised four gartisertib cohorts: A (dose escalation [DE]; Q2W); A2 (DE; QD/BID); B1 (DE+carboplatin); and C (biomarker-selected patients).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Overall, 97 patients were enroled into cohorts A (<italic>n</italic> = 42), A2 (<italic>n</italic> = 26), B1 (<italic>n</italic> = 16) and C (<italic>n</italic> = 13). The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) were not declared for cohorts A or B1. In cohort A2, the RP2D for gartisertib was determined as 250 mg QD. Gartisertib was generally well-tolerated; however, unexpected increased blood bilirubin in all study cohorts precluded further DE. Investigations showed that gartisertib and its metabolite M26 inhibit <italic>UGT1A1</italic>-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation in human but not dog or rat liver microsomes. Prolonged partial response (<italic>n</italic> = 1 [cohort B1]) and stable disease &gt;6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 3) did not appear to be associated with biomarker status. Exposure generally increased dose-dependently without accumulation.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Gartisertib was generally well-tolerated at lower doses; however, unexpected liver toxicity prevented further DE, potentially limiting antitumour activity. Gartisertib development was subsequently discontinued.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Genomic integrity is constantly being challenged by various endogenous and exogenous influences, such as reactive oxygen species and ultraviolet light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, repairing and maintaining the structural integrity of DNA is vital for cell survival and the transfer of an intact genome to the next generation of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex surveillance and signalling network that has evolved to maintain genomic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Inactivation of DDR pathways and the resulting increased genomic instability may lead to development of malignancies; however, DDR defects can also render cancer cells more sensitive to treatment due to the resulting reliance on the remaining intact DDR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">The DDR is controlled by the three related kinases ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR). All eukaryotic genomes encode at least one of these kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In contrast with ATM and DNA-PK, which are mostly activated by DNA double strand breaks, ATR is recruited via ATR interacting protein to replication protein A (RPA) which coats newly exposed single strand DNA (ssDNA) arising from replication forks that have stalled due to replicative stress. Completion of ATR activation requires additional activator proteins and ssDNA/double strand DNA junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Functions of ATR include promotion of transient cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, stabilisation, and the restarting of stalled replication forks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, ATR inhibition can lead to unhindered cell cycle progression in cells harbouring DNA damage, resulting in mitosis of cells with damaged DNA, mitotic catastrophe, and tumour cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">Replication stress appears to be a hallmark of cancer cells as it is rarely observed in healthy cells, even those with a high level of proliferation. Therefore, inhibition of the ATR pathway is an attractive therapeutic approach for patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, certain mutations show synthetic lethality with ATR inhibition as they increase reliance on ATR and consequently, sensitivity to ATR inhibition, leading to cell death. For example, loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in <italic>ARID1A</italic> or <italic>ATM</italic> may predict sensitivity to ATR inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tumour cells that utilise alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanisms to maintain telomere length also appear to be highly susceptible to ATR inhibition. One method of measuring ALT-positivity is determining the incidence of <italic>ATRX</italic> or <italic>DAXX</italic> mutations, which are prevalent in ALT-positive tumours and therefore may be considered proxy markers of potential sensitivity to ATR inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">In addition to the innate replication stress occurring in rapidly proliferating and oncogene-addicted tumour cells, replicative stress is also caused by many DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutics. For example, platinum compounds such as cisplatin and carboplatin generate intra- and inter-strand DNA crosslinks which stall replication forks and increase replicative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, inherent and acquired resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy is due in large part to the DDR. One study showed coordination of RPA phosphorylation via ATM, DNA-PK and ATR to induce replication arrest and recovery after the occurrence of cisplatin-associated DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Preclinical studies have also shown that ATR inhibition increases platinum sensitivity in platinum-resistant cancer cells and may also enhance sensitivity to other chemotherapeutics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Hence, ATR inhibition in combination with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy may improve treatment response rates and increase the time to development of treatment resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Gartisertib (M4344) is an orally administered ATR inhibitor that has shown highly potent antitumour activity in several cancer cell lines, patient-derived tumour organoids and mouse xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Gartisertib has also been shown to be highly synergistic with a broad range of replication stress-inducing therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This suggests that combinations of gartisertib and chemotherapy may enhance antitumour activity, while also overcoming chemoresistance. We report results from a first-in-human study evaluating the safety and tolerability of gartisertib with or without carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours as well as the antitumour activity of gartisertib in biomarker-selected patients.</p>

              <p id="Par26">The study was initiated on 26 January 2015 (first signed informed consent) and completed on 16 June 2021 (last patient visit). The final analyses reported here are based on a database lock date of 23 December 2020 for cohorts A, A2 and B1 and 25 August 2021 for cohort C. In total, 97 patients were enroled across cohorts A (<italic>n</italic> = 42), A2 (<italic>n</italic> = 26), B1 (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and C (<italic>n</italic> = 13), all of whom received ≥1 dose of gartisertib. Cohort C of the study was discontinued early; therefore, fewer patients were enroled than planned, and most pre-specified antitumour activity and PK assessments were not performed.</p>

In general, demographic characteristics were representative of a typical phase I oncology trial population (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents further patient demographic data). Overall, 47.6–69.2% of patients continued gartisertib treatment until disease progression (&gt;45% across all study cohorts) or death (1 patient each in cohorts A [2.4%] and B1 [7.7%]). A total of 22 (52.4%), 12 (46.2%), 7 (43.8%), and 4 (30.8%) patients discontinued gartisertib treatment for other reasons in cohorts A, A2, B1, and C, respectively, the most common of which was AEs: cohort A (<italic>n</italic> = 15 patients [35.7%]), cohort A2 (<italic>n</italic> = 10 [38.5%]), cohort B1 (<italic>n</italic> = 4 [25.0%]), and cohort C (<italic>n</italic> = 1 [7.7%]).

                <p id="Par28">All patients experienced at least one TEAE, with ≥92.3% of patients experiencing a gartisertib-related TEAE across all cohorts reported. Overall, ≥50% of patients experienced at least one serious TEAE; 19.0–37.5% were related to gartisertib across each cohort; 31.3% were related to carboplatin in cohort B1.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported across all study cohorts (50.0% of patients in cohorts A, A2 and B1 and 53.8% of patients in cohort C reported ≥1 SAE).) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). There were six deaths reported across all cohorts, none of which were considered related to gartisertib or carboplatin.

Additionally, one patient in cohort B1 developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This patient had been heavily pre-treated since her diagnosis in 2011 of uterine leiomyosarcoma, with six prior lines of therapy including anthracyclines, alkylators (ifosfamide, dacarbazine), etoposide, and radiation. The MDS was considered to be consistent with a treatment-related karyotype (monosomy 7, loss of 5q and loss of 17p) which often arises due to alkylating therapy or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Treatment with gartisertib + carboplatin was discontinued, and the patient was started on MDS-directed therapy (decitabine + venetoclax). Further information on this patient’s MDS and her prior treatments, as well as information on rates of permanent gartisertib discontinuation and gartisertib dose reductions due to treatment-related TEAEs are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

                <p id="Par34">In cohort A, five patients had ≥1 DLT, including three patients at the gartisertib 1200 mg dose level, during the first cycle of study treatment. DLTs were: grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia (<italic>n</italic> = 1) at the gartisertib 700 mg dose level; grade 2 increase in AST, grade 3 increase in ALT, and grade 2 increase in blood bilirubin (<italic>n</italic> = 1) at the gartisertib 1050 mg dose level; and grade 3 increases in blood bilirubin (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and grade 3 increase in blood bilirubin and pyrexia (<italic>n</italic> = 1) at the gartisertib 1200 mg dose level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Upon further investigation, the increases in blood bilirubin were found to be predominantly due to increases in indirect bilirubin, a finding typically associated with <italic>UGT1A1</italic> inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nonclinical studies were performed, with saquinavir, a known <italic>UGT1A1</italic> inhibitor in human, dog and rat liver microsomes, used as a positive control. IC<sub>50</sub> (µM [standard error]) of gartisertib was 8.36 (0.79), &gt;50, and &gt;50 in human, dog and rat liver microsomes, respectively. Corresponding values (µM) for saquinavir were 24.0 (4.5), 8.42 (3.76) and 11.6 (3.22), respectively, with the value for human liver microsomes being within 2-fold of published IC<sub>50</sub> data (13 µM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additional analyses revealed that M26 (VRT-1363170), a metabolite of gartisertib, was also an inhibitor of <italic>UGT1A1</italic> in human but not rat or dog liver microsomes.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The protocol was subsequently amended on 3 June 2016, following the first three patients in cohort A with DLTs of grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia (<italic>n</italic> = 1; 700 mg dose level) and grade 3 increased blood bilirubin (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 1200 mg dose level). This amendment excluded grade 3 or 4 increases in blood bilirubin from being categorised as a DLT if they were considered to be due to inhibition of bilirubin glucuronidation. If the increase in bilirubin was assessed as arising from inhibition of bilirubin glucuronidation, then only bilirubin levels above 15 mg/dL (257 µmol/L) were considered to be DLTs.</p>

In cohort C the median PFS interval was 1.6 months (95% CI 0.8, 2.1).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CT images showing changes from baseline in target and non-target lesions.</title><p>CT images showing changes from baseline in target lesion 1 at FU 16 (<bold>a</bold>) and 17 (<bold>b</bold>), target lesion 2 at FU 16 (<bold>c</bold>) and 17 (<bold>d</bold>) and non-target lesion 1 at FU 16 (<bold>e</bold>) and 17 (<bold>f</bold>) in the patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma and experiencing a prolonged PR in cohort B1.

Urinary excretion of gartisertib represented a minor route of elimination (cohort A2). In the lower gartisertib dose levels in cohort A, few patients were enroled, and a substantial number of measurements were below the level of quantification.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par43">This first-in-human study of gartisertib, alone and in combination with carboplatin, evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumour activity in patients with advanced solid tumours. The study comprised four cohorts: three in which the gartisertib dose was escalated (A [twice weekly], A2 [once- or twice-daily] and B1 [twice weekly and in combination with carboplatin AUC5]), and another cohort assessing gartisertib monotherapy in a biomarker-selected population (C). The schedule for cohort B1 (carboplatin on day 1 and gartisertib on days 2 and 9 in 21-day cycles) was based on preclinical data showing maximum antitumour activity when an ATR inhibitor is given between 12–24 h post-carboplatin administration as this timepoint coincides with peak accumulation of cells in S-phase and resultant activation of ATR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par44">Liver toxicity was observed, first occurring in cohort A at gartisertib doses ≥700 mg twice weekly, which differed to previous studies of other ATR inhibitors. These liver-associated TEAEs included increased blood bilirubin and were unexpected, with no such signals being previously observed during preclinical studies. Additional analyses showed that gartisertib and its metabolite M26 are both inhibitors of <italic>UGT1A1-</italic>mediated bilirubin glucuronidation in human but not rat or dog liver microsomes. Since preclinical toxicology studies were performed in rats and dogs, these findings explain why no substantial effects on the liver were anticipated. ALT and AST elevations were also frequently observed, occurring as early as 24 h after gartisertib initiation; they were rapidly reversible on study drug interruption and their aetiology remains unclear. Elevations in blood bilirubin, ALT and AST have not been reported with other ATR inhibitors in clinical development, including berzosertib and M1774 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">Although transient, these liver-associated TEAEs were clinically relevant and frequent, being observed across all study cohorts, and further dose escalation was halted. Consequently, the MTD was not defined in cohort A or A2; however, in cohort A2 the RP2D was determined to be 250 mg QD.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Given the absence of comparable safety signals in the clinical evaluation of other ATR inhibitors and the subsequent investigations showing gartisertib inhibition of <italic>UGT1A1</italic>, these findings are likely specific to gartisertib and as such they are not expected to impact the hypothesis of targeting ATR in anticancer therapy. Interspecies differences in drug toxicity are one of the main limitations of preclinical models and other studies have described similar issues regarding translatability to human trials, leading to discontinuation of drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This appears to be a particular issue in phase I oncology trials, with a meta-analysis of 108 targeted oncology drugs showing a lack of strong correlation between animal and human toxicity outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, considering the current number of drugs entering clinical evaluation, ensuring preclinical models better reflect human biology is essential to improve their predictive value for human trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Increased use of chimeric animal models may improve this predicament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">Apart from the liver test abnormalities detailed above, there were no other safety concerns and gartisertib appeared to have a safety profile similar to those reported for other ATR inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Rates of clinically relevant grade 3/4 AEs such as nausea and vomiting were low. Few patients experienced myelosuppression in cohorts A and A2; however, this may have been due to the limited gartisertib dose escalation in these study cohorts. In cohort B1, one heavily pre-treated patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma developed MDS, the karyotype of which (monosomy 7, loss of 5q and loss of 17p) suggested prior alkylating agents or radiotherapy to be the cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Alkylating agent-associated MDS, the most common type of chemotherapy-induced MDS, typically occurs years after initiation of alkylating treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">Of note, this patient with MDS also experienced a prolonged RECIST v1.1 PR while receiving gartisertib 400 mg plus carboplatin AUC5 and remained in a PR at 6 months post-study treatment discontinuation due to MDS. She had a somatic mutation in <italic>TP53</italic>, among others; preclinical data suggest that in the presence of a <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, addition of an ATR inhibitor may augment the antitumour activity of platinum treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Aside from the PR observed in cohort B1 (6.3%), three patients across all study cohorts (3.1%) experienced SD for &gt;6 months. No difference in disease control was observed according to selected biomarker status. Preclusion of further dose escalation due to the occurrence of liver-associated TEAEs may have impacted the antitumour activity of gartisertib.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Gartisertib did not appear to accumulate substantially following multiple dose administration and exposure increased in a generally dose-dependent manner; there appeared to be no evidence of interaction or accumulation with carboplatin. However, limited conclusions can be inferred as few patients were enroled at each dose level and several results were below the limit of quantification.</p>
              <p id="Par50">In our study, complete <italic>ɣ-H2AX</italic> target inhibition was observed; however, these data should be interpreted with caution, as the assay was not a direct measure of target inhibition in patients due to target modulation being assessed in blood samples rather than in tumour biopsies. ɣ-H2AX in particular is a measure of intracellular ATR, ATM and DNA-PK inhibition under alternate experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Preclinical data have shown that replication fork collapse due to gartisertib results in a marked induction of ɣ-H2AX, suggesting extensive DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par51">Considering the current study’s findings, gartisertib development was discontinued to prioritise development of the orally administered ATR inhibitor M1774 which has achieved superior exposure with less corresponding toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although the gartisertib dose escalation in this study was limited by unexpected clinically relevant safety signals, potentially impacting antitumour activity, these findings do not preclude the evaluation of ATR inhibitors in patients with advanced solid tumours. Other studies have found ATR inhibitors in combination with DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy to be tolerable and showing preliminary antitumour activity; therefore, the ATR pathway still represents an attractive therapeutic target for future development of anticancer therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
