                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Studies have shown some benefits to single approaches to psychological therapies for the treatment of anxiety in people with intellectual disability such as modified cognitive–behavioural therapy and mindfulness. To our knowledge, no studies have used a multicomponent approach for the individual treatment of anxiety-related disorders in this population group. A co-production group of clinical experts and people with intellectual disability has created a novel multicomponent anxiety management programme (MCAMP-ID). The aims of this study are to investigate (1) the feasibility of this approach in reducing anxiety for people with a mild/moderate intellectual disability, (2) the feasibility of outcome measures and (3) the feasibility of completing a future randomised controlled trial of this programme. The data from this feasibility study will be used to inform trial design and to complete power calculation.</p>

                  <p>Sixty people with intellectual disability will be invited to participate in the study across four intellectual disability services within one mental health trust in Northwest England. The specialist services will deliver either treatment as usual (TAU) or the novel intervention (MCAMP-ID). MCAMP-ID comprises of 10 individual sessions delivered by a member of the clinical team once a week for between 10 and 12 weeks. TAU will be based on standard treatment currently delivered to meet the person’s specific needs. The outcomes of the study will be feasibility of recruitment, attrition, adherence to the programme and suitability of outcome measures. A mixed-methods approach will be used to assess outcomes.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is a greater incidence of mental health difficulties in people with intellectual disability than in the general population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Anxiety-related issues are the most common<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Some evidence suggests anxiety difficulties may increase over a person’s life course due to exposure to negative life events which can impact on quality of life.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> High levels of anxiety in people with intellectual disability is sometimes demonstrated as behaviour of challenge, for example, self-injury, aggression or property damage, since individuals may be unable to effectively communicate or cope with high levels of stress and anxiety.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Subsequently, there can be a tendency for interventions to focus more towards behavioural management strategies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Anxiety can have a significant effect on quality of life and limit opportunities to engage in social and recreational activities. This can result in people experiencing poor self-esteem, low mood, increased isolation, loneliness and cognitive distortions.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Equally, people with intellectual disability can have difficulty making sense of their own thoughts, with overcoming avoidance behaviours or developing effective self-management strategies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Psychoeducation is an important component in treatment for anxiety-related difficulties for people with intellectual disability because it helps the individual to understand that they can influence their illness experience and live a better quality of life.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Therefore, the efficacy of psychological therapies is of paramount importance given the prevalence of mental health difficulties in this population group.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>In the UK, clinical guidance for the treatment of mental health difficulties in people with intellectual disability highlighted the limited body of evidence for effective psychological therapies<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)). However, there are a small but growing number of studies which have examined the effectiveness of adapted psychological therapies for the treatment of mental health problems.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>Studies have examined modified cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) for a range of emotional problems for people with intellectual disability.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) of CBT for the treatment of depression and anxiety in people with a mild intellectual disability demonstrated limited long-term effectiveness.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A meta-analysis examining CBT for the treatment of a range of mental health problems found limited efficacy for the treatment of anxiety in people with intellectual disability.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> More significant and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms were reported for 12 people with intellectual disability in a study examining a modified transdiagnostic programme of CBT.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Discrepancies may be partly explained by a systematic review finding small sample sizes and lack of methodological rigour in study designs a significant factor in identifying clinical effectiveness within study outcomes.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Studies of psychological therapies such as mindfulness have been found to be effective when people with intellectual disability are provided with adequate support and guidance to practise requisite skills.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 18 19</xref> NICE clinical guidelines suggest psychological therapy be adapted for people with intellectual disabilities, identifying CBT, relaxation and graded exposure techniques as recommended treatment for anxiety.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, despite recommendation, there is no current evidence of any adapted multicomponent therapies for the treatment of anxiety in people with intellectual disability.</p>
              <p>Multicomponent therapies combine key therapeutic skills that work together to improve the effectiveness of treatment.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> More recently, some success of multicomponent therapies for anxiety in the general adult population has been identified which demonstrates promise for this psychological approach.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> There are very few adapted therapies for mental health difficulties that are suitable for people with a moderate intellectual disability as well as those with a milder intellectual impairment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 22</xref></p>

                <title>Co-producing a multicomponent anxiety management programme manual</title>
                <p>We have worked with people with intellectual disability with a lived experience of mental health difficulties to co-produce and develop a multicomponent psychological therapy for the treatment of anxiety.

                <p>The aim of this study is to discover the feasibility of this approach in reducing anxiety for people with mild or moderate intellectual disability. Additionally, we will establish the feasibility of conducting a future RCT using a multicomponent approach for the treatment of anxiety and development of self-management skills in people with intellectual disability. This will be assessed by examining recruitment, attrition rates, adherence to the treatment programme and National Health Service (NHS) treatment costs.</p>
                <p>Our secondary objective is to assess the appropriateness of outcome measures which include the Glasgow Anxiety Scale (GAS-ID),<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> adapted WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL-8)<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> with the intervention.

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This feasibility study is a randomised controlled quasi-experimental trial of a novel multicomponent anxiety management intervention in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). Each arm of the study will have 30 participants and they will be allocated between four sites, with two sites comprising the control group and the other two sites the intervention arm. To reduce selection bias, group allocation will be completed by allocating each team with a number and one investigator placing numbers in an envelope and an independent person randomly selecting numbers for the assignment of groups.</p>
                <p>The intervention will be delivered over the duration of 10 weeks to allow for some flexibility to meet the needs of people with severe intellectual disability. Baseline measures will be completed 1 week prior to the intervention, at the end of the intervention (12 weeks) and again at follow-up 8 weeks post-completion to establish any sustained effect on levels of anxiety.</p>
                <p>The feasibility trial will be supported by people with intellectual disability who have a lived experience of mental health issues and will form an essential part of the patient and public involvement (PPI) group.</p>

The descriptive analysis will focus principally on recruitment rates, characteristics of participants and the function of the programme manuals. The primary outcomes (mean scores and CIs) will be reported at baseline, 12 weeks and 20 weeks (8 weeks post-completion) for both comparative arms. The variability of the primary outcome measure will be used to inform the power calculation and sample size for the definitive RCT. Additionally, we will complete analyses of treatment preference and number of sessions received.</p>

                <p>We will consider progressing to a full RCT, if we are able to recruit and retain participants. Therefore, feasibility of recruitment will be a key aspect of this feasibility study. A Stop/Go process will be used to ascertain the percentage of participants recruited to the trial. Go: 100% recruited and at least 80% of eligible participants retained. Review: 50–79% of eligible participants recruited; Stop: &lt;50% participants recruited. With the retention rate of 80%, a sample size of 60 will allow these outcomes to be estimated with an accuracy of ±11%.</p>
