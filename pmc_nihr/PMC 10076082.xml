                  <p>Heterologous COVID vaccine priming schedules are immunogenic and effective. This report aims to understand the persistence of immune response to the viral vectored, mRNA and protein-based COVID-19 vaccine platforms used in homologous and heterologous priming combinations, which will inform the choice of vaccine platform in future vaccine development.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Com-COV2 was a single-blinded trial in which adults ≥ 50 years, previously immunised with single dose ‘ChAd’ (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AZD1222, Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) or ‘BNT’ (BNT162b2, tozinameran, Comirnaty, Pfizer/BioNTech), were randomised 1:1:1 to receive a second dose 8–12 weeks later with either the homologous vaccine, or ‘Mod’ (mRNA-1273, Spikevax, Moderna) or ‘NVX’ (NVX-CoV2373, Nuvaxovid, Novavax). Immunological follow-up and the secondary objective of safety monitoring were performed over nine months. Analyses of antibody and cellular assays were performed on an intention-to-treat population without evidence of COVID-19 infection at baseline or for the trial duration.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In April/May 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9.4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (N = 540, 45% female) or BNT (N = 532, 39% female) as part of the national vaccination programme.</p>
                  <p>In ChAd-primed participants, ChAd/Mod had the highest anti-spike IgG from day 28 through to 6 months, although the heterologous vs homologous geometric mean ratio (GMR) dropped from 9.7 (95% CI (confidence interval): 8.2, 11.5) at D28 to 6.2 (95% CI: 5.0, 7.7) at D196. The heterologous/homologous GMR for ChAd/NVX similarly dropped from 3.0 (95% CI:2.5,3.5) to 2.4 (95% CI:1.9, 3.0).</p>
                  <p>In BNT-primed participants, decay was similar between heterologous and homologous schedules with BNT/Mod inducing the highest anti-spike IgG for the duration of follow-up. The adjusted GMR (aGMR) for BNT/Mod compared with BNT/BNT increased from 1.36 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.58) at D28 to 1.52 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.90) at D196, whilst for BNT/NVX this aGMR was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.64) at day 28 and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.78) at day 196.</p>
                  <p>Heterologous ChAd-primed schedules produced and maintained the largest T-cell responses until D196. Immunisation with BNT/NVX generated a qualitatively different antibody response to BNT/BNT, with the total IgG significantly lower than BNT/BNT during all follow-up time points, but similar levels of neutralising antibodies.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Heterologous ChAd-primed schedules remain more immunogenic over time in comparison to ChAd/ChAd. BNT-primed schedules with a second dose of either mRNA vaccine also remain more immunogenic over time in comparison to BNT/NVX. The emerging data on mixed schedules using the novel vaccine platforms deployed in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that heterologous priming schedules might be considered as a viable option sooner in future pandemics.

              <p id="p0030">Several COVID vaccines based on different technologies, have received both full and emergency authorisation licensure and have been used to save tens of millions of lives worldwide.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> While some technologies, such as adjuvanted protein have been well-studied and widely used in other vaccines, the complete immunological profiles of some of these newer vaccine technologies such as viral-vectored and mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines, have not yet been completely understood, nor how these may change in combined heterologous priming schedules.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Many countries have pragmatically opted to administer additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> in order to boost antibody levels, thereby hoping to prevent severe disease associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. Furthermore, data on long-term persistence of immune protection against severe disease afforded by primary immunisation schedules is lacking and still of critical importance.</p>
              <p id="p0035">Com-COV2 was a single-blinded randomised study investigating the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of heterologous and homologous priming COVID-19 vaccine schedules, for which the primary outcome of immunogenicity at 28-days post-second dose has been previously reported.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In summary, following a first dose of ChAd (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AZD1222, Vaxzevria, Astrazeneca) the greatest increase in antibody concentrations was seen after a second dose of ‘Mod’ (mRNA-1273, Spikevax, Moderna), with a second dose of ‘NVX’ (NVX-CoV2373, Nuvaxovid, Novavax) providing the next highest response, and a second dose of homologous ChAd the lowest. For participants primed with BNT (BNT162b2, tozinameran, Comirnaty, Pfizer/BioNTech) the ordinal order was Mod, BNT, NVX. Overall, BNT-containing schedules had an antibody response approximately 4–10 times greater than homologous ChAd, depending on priming interval. T-cell responses for ChAd-primed participants were greatest for Mod and NVX with a lesser response for ChAd. The T-cell response of BNT-primed participants was ordered Mod, BNT, NVX. It remains the only trial to study COVID adjuvanted protein vaccines in heterologous priming schedules in adults with accompanying data in adolescents to follow from Com-COV3.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="p0040">The related Com-COV study has published its persistence data,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> which showed mRNA vaccine-containing schedules all maintained higher antibody responses than the homologous ChAd schedule up to 6 months follow up. Antibody responses were generally further increased by prolonging priming interval from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. Decay of antibody response following priming schedules was slower for less immunogenic schedules. Only the homologous BNT/BNT schedule showed a significantly slower decay by prolonging the priming interval. T cell decay rates were similar amongst all schedules regardless of peak T-cell response or priming interval.</p>
              <p id="p0045">In this report, we aim to delineate the longevity of immunological responses of the six vaccine schedules in Com-COV2. Understanding the different rates of waning after primary immunisation will not only inform national immunisation programmes on the necessity for further boosting against COVID-19, but also how best to use these novel vaccine platforms against other pathogens.</p>

                <p id="p0050">The single-blinded trial (ISRCTN: 27841311 EudraCT: 2021-001275-16) has been previously reported.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In brief, participants who were aged 50 years or over, with no or well-controlled, mild-moderate comorbidities and no history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who had received a single dose of either ChAd or BNT by routine immunisation 8–12 weeks earlier were separately randomised 1:1:1 into the general cohort to receive a single dose of either the same vaccine as their prime dose (BNT or ChAd homologous schedules), or Mod, or NVX (heterologous schedules). A separate immunology cohort had a smaller number of participants (25 per arm) randomised to it for more detailed exploratory immunological analyses, including mucosal immunity assessment not presented here. The trial was approved by the South-Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (21/SC/0119), the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the NHS Research Ethics Service (UK Human Research Authority). An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed safety data, and local trial-site physicians provided oversight of all adverse events in real-time. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the protocol.</p>
                <p id="p0055">Participants had blood sampled at day 14 and 28 post-second dose (already reported)<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> then day 56, 112 and 196, with the last timepoint being brought forward from day 294 to accommodate the rapid roll out of the national third dose ‘booster’ campaign. The protocol was amended on 21st June 2021, around the time of the day 56 visit, to allow individual unblinding of participants to prevent disadvantaging them in accessing facilities or travel.

Solicited, unsolicited and medically attended adverse events were collected for 7 days, 28 days and 3 months, respectively, following vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were collected for the duration of the trial.

Sensitivity analyses also excluded any participants who had more than a 2-fold increase in anti-spike IgG titre at any point beyond 28 days post-second dose.</p>
                <p id="p0065">The geometric means of anti-Spike IgG concentrations (GMC) and T cell frequencies (GMF) were calculated, as were the adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMR) of these values between heterologous and homologous schedules. If these aGMRs got closer to one from day 28 to day 196, it means the decay rate of the more immunogenic schedule out of the homologous and heterologous schedules being compared was faster over time than for the less immunogenic schedule. We also calculated the fold-change of immunological endpoints in the intervals of day 28–56, day 56–112 and day 112–196 (i.e. the ratios of GMCs between each of these time points) for each participant and then present the GMRs of these for each vaccine arm. A higher ratio indicates a slower decay over that time period. The heterologous/homologous aGMRs of these fold change GMRs (i.e. ratio of ratios) are also presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the homologous arms as the reference. A trend of the aGMR approaching one over these three time periods indicates the difference in rates of decay between the schedules is reducing. All aGMRs and 95% CIs were estimated using non-hierarchical mixed-effects linear regression models; one model per prime vaccine per timepoint. The log<sub>10</sub> transformed immunogenicity data (absolute titre or time-period ratio) was the dependant variable and the ‘sites’ and ‘cohort’ variables were included as non-hierarchical random effects in the model with age, baseline immunogenicity, vaccine schedule, interval between first and second vaccine, the duration between 2nd vaccine and actual visit timepoint, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity and body-mass index (BMI) as fixed effects. Each aGMR was calculated as the antilogarithm of the adjusted difference between arms in the model. Subgroup analyses were conducted in a similar fashion, on timepoints subsequent to day 0 to explore the factors affecting differences between schedules. P-values for the effect of covariates on immunogenicity, were not adjusted for multiple testing, but arbitrarily set at 0.05, as this was an exploratory analysis. Unadjusted data was plotted as boxplot time series to explore the change in absolute GMCs over time in addition to the forest plots demonstrating changes in relative aGMRs. All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10), SAS v9.4 and Stata 17.</p>

For ChAd/NVX this aGMR was 4.2 at day 28 and 2.2 at day 196. Amongst homologous schedules, there was a suggestion that despite the relatively poor expansion in antigen-specific T-cells in the peripheral blood for ChAd/ChAd following second dose, there was better maintenance of ELISpot count than for BNT/BNT (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B).</p>

                <p id="p0110">The mixed effects linear regression models, grouped by first vaccine dose, used to estimate the GMCs of the different schedules at individual timepoints, suggest that some covariates have a significant effect on humoral immunogenicity in addition to which schedule was received. These included anti-spike IgG level at the point of second-dose (‘Baseline’) and body mass index (BMI) for both ChAd- and BNT-primed schedules. BNT-primed schedules were also affected by age and interval between doses, whilst ChAd-primed schedules were affected by participant sex (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Tables 4A and 4B</xref>). For T-cell responses, baseline immunogenicity and arm schedule were significant covariates for both ChAd- and BNT-primed, whereas BMI, age and comorbidity were significant only for BNT-primed schedules (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Tables 4C and 4D</xref>). Decay rate, as measured by ratio of day 196 vs day 28 responses, for both anti-spike IgG and T-cell ELISpot in ChAd-primed schedules was affected by peak response at day 28 and by BMI, but not by the schedule received. Anti-spike IgG decay for BNT-primed schedules was additionally affected by interval and schedule received (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Tables 4E–H</xref>).</p>
                <p id="p0115">Exploratory subgroup analyses (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 4–7</xref>) suggest that ChAd/Mod was humorally more immunogenic in participants aged 63 years or older than in those aged 50–62 years (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 4A and 5A</xref>). Both ChAd/NVX and BNT/NVX demonstrated trends of lower response with higher BMIs (<xref rid="sec0085" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figs. 4C and 5C</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0130">Here we report the first randomised data elucidating persistence of heterologous priming schedules deploying ChAd, BNT, Mod &amp; NVX. Schedules with higher peak antibody had a more rapid initial wane. All schedules displayed non-linear decay of the logarithmically transformed data indicating that all schedules’ rates of decay slowed over time. However, as rates of decay slowed, humorally less immunogenic schedules (ChAd/ChAd and BNT/NVX) waned even more slowly. There was no indication that heterologous priming schedules per se have improved persistence on homologous schedules nor was there any indication whether each schedule was decaying to the same baseline (either zero or some above-zero set-point). T-cell decay differed from antibody decay with an apparent plateauing.</p>
              <p id="p0135">It should be noted that there were qualitative differences in the nature of the antibody response between schedules, most notably BNT/BNT and BNT/NVX, where the latter produced proportionally more neutralising antibodies, most obviously at day 112, although this result will be affected, in part by increased lower bound censoring. This lower bound censoring affects less immunogenic schedules more, as well as later timepoints, whose antibody titres will have waned, and finally affects more the VOC assays against which there was overall lower neutralising activity.</p>
              <p id="p0140">The implications of the statistically significant covariates in the models to the practical implementation of vaccine programs are not yet clear; however, by comparing the exploratory analyses’ box plots of raw data with the adjusted GMR forest plots, one may hypothesise that the negative correlation of BMI with NVX-boosted regimens may suggest that the vaccine response is affected by the relative antigenic dose. The improved immunological response in female participants with homologous ChAd has been demonstrated previously,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> however, caution must be exercised when interpreting the relevance of this as no difference in vaccine efficacy has been noted to date. The positive correlation of immune response with interval with BNT-primed schedules has been similarly noted in the secondary analyses of the Com-COV trial,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> although the effect in ChAd-primed schedules was not reproduced here.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The previously reported effect of increasing interval improving persistence in BNT/BNT is again suggested to be true by these data.</p>
              <p id="p0145">The exploratory analyses of covariates generate hypotheses that require further investigation – most notably that boosting with an adjuvanted protein appears to show more rapid waning in younger participants. Additionally, the reduced immunogenicity of these two schedules in those with higher BMI, might suggest that this is dose-related and that one might postulate that higher second doses of adjuvanted protein may give a better response. The fact that a higher baseline immunity level is correlated with a better response is unsurprising, but what is interesting is that this is at odds with a longer interval also giving a better response and further to this, that a longer interval might improve persistence, as already suggested for BNT/BNT in Com-COV. This may indicate either that there are groups of people who are ‘low-responders’ or ‘high-responders’ to vaccination for both first and second doses. Alternatively, it might also suggest that there may be an optimum interval at which to give the second dose. It should be noted that the magnitude of effect of baseline appears not to be linear, but becomes less for higher baseline participants, suggesting that there may be a ‘cap’ or ‘ceiling’ effect.</p>
              <p id="p0150">The differences in waning speeds between schedules may be due to fundamental differences in the way immunological memory is laid down between different combinations of vaccine platforms. An alternative explanation may be that there is a ‘floor’ or ‘plateau’ effect. Each vaccine schedule, may, in the long term, decay to a baseline level – it is not evident whether this would be an undetectable level or a higher one; nor is it clear whether each vaccine schedule will have the same baseline. As the schedules appear to be decaying asymptotically towards a baseline, the schedules which are proportionally closer to their own baseline will wane even more slowly sooner; therefore, this effect will disproportionately affect the less immunogenic schedules. As follow-up of these participants was curtailed by the rolling out of the UK government ‘3rd dose’ booster programme, we are unable to investigate this more definitively, but further work on immunological persistence markers is underway. This plateau effect is supported by results from the related 3rd dose COV-Boost trial,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> where other less immunogenic schedules (including those who received a control Men ACWY vaccine as their 3rd dose) also had slower rates of decay in comparison to a 3rd dose of BNT, after homologous ChAd/ChAd or homologous BNT/BNT priming schedules. However, it should be noted that in the related COV-Boost study, which investigated the immunogenicity of third vaccine doses, BNT/BNT-primed participants, who received an adenoviral vectored vaccine as their third dose such as ChAd or Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S) were not initially as immunogenic as the BNT-boosted schedule, but the rate of decay of the adenoviral vector boosted schedules was sufficiently slower, that by 3 months, the total amount of antibody was greater in recipients of Ad26 than in recipients of 3rd dose BNT. This suggest that the incorporation of an adenoviral-vectored vaccine as part of three-dose vaccine regimen improves immune persistence.</p>
              <p id="p0155">In contrast, in this study, Com-COV2, the rank order of schedules was unaffected by decay up to six months post-second dose, although the differences between schedules did reduce over time.</p>
              <p id="p0160">Evidence that repeated doses of vaccines increase protection against symptomatic infection exists, reducing deaths for those who are co-morbid or physiologically frail, for whom a physiological stressor such as an upper respiratory viral tract infection may cause decompensation and hospitalisation. There is also evidence that there may be some mild loss of efficacy against severe COVID lower respiratory tract infection after two doses of vaccine over time. The extent of this wane is difficult to assess given the subsequent booster programs, but available<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> evidence suggests that this wane plateaus. This picture is further complicated by the changes of circulating variants with variable pathogenicity, as well as the effect of hybrid immunity. It is not yet clear what aspect of the vaccine-induced immune response mediates protection against severe SARS-CoV2 infection, even though high levels of binding and neutralising antibody do appear to be associated with protection against symptomatic infection. Evaluation of memory and immunological persistence markers remain key in determining which schedules might provide ongoing protection against both symptomatic infection and severe disease as immune responses wane.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p id="p0165">Analyses were conducted separately between schedules with different primes, as prime doses were not randomised and there were differences between baseline populations. such that co-morbidity was greater in BNT-primed participants. This was, by definition, a more at-risk population who were targeted for early vaccination with the BNT vaccine, which was licensed earlier than ChAd. The three BNT-primed schedules cannot therefore be directly compared to the three ChAd-primed schedules. Additionally, follow-up beyond 6 months post-second dose is not possible due to the roll out of the government 3rd dose booster programme.</p>
              <p id="p0170">The mixed effects models used were conducted by prime dose and therefore it is not possible to ascribe whether any of the apparently statistically significant co-variates have more of an impact on one schedule or another. Individual models per schedule lack power to demonstrate statistical significance and further modelling work is required to ascertain how relevant these co-variates are to the immune response and what the underlying immunological mechanisms may be. Given the large number of exploratory analyses on covariates, no statistical tests were performed to confirm the trends described, and the trends mentioned need further confirmation and investigation. The ranges covered by some of the covariates, such as age and dosing interval were not comprehensive, looking only at 50–70 year olds and intervals of 56–84 days only respectively. Given that only 10% of participants were non-white and that this group is highly heterogeneous in itself, it is unlikely that this subgroup analysis will be informative.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0175">In conclusion, the differences in waning and the changes in these waning rates over time are likely due to a combination of a floor/plateau effect for less immunogenic schedules as well as, likely, an innate difference in how memory responses are laid down by mixing different vaccine platforms. Even so, up until 6-month follow-up, there was no change in the ordering of schedules for peak antibody level, which were still higher than levels pre-second dose. It is not clear, yet, whether one combination of vaccine platforms may hold clinically significant advantages over any other combination. However, heterologous priming schedules might be considered, to ease logistical constraints, as a viable option sooner in future pandemics.</p>
