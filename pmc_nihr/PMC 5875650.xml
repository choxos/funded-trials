              <abstract>
                <p>Musculoskeletal shoulder problems are common after breast cancer treatment. Early postoperative exercises targeting the upper limb may improve shoulder function. This protocol describes a National Institute for Health Research-funded randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an early supervised structured exercise programme compared with usual care, for women at high risk of developing shoulder problems after breast cancer surgery.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This pragmatic two-armed, multicentre RCT is underway within secondary care in the UK. PRevention Of Shoulder ProblEms tRial (PROSPER) aims to recruit 350 women from approximately 15 UK centres with follow-up at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Recruitment processes and intervention development were optimised through qualitative research during a 6-month internal pilot phase. Participants are randomised to the PROSPER intervention or best practice usual care only. The PROSPER intervention is delivered by physiotherapists and incorporates three main components: shoulder-specific exercises targeting range of movement and strength; general physical activity and behavioural strategies to encourage adherence and support exercise behaviour. The primary outcome is upper arm function assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at 12 months postrandomisation. Secondary outcomes include DASH subscales, acute and chronic pain, complications, health-related quality of life and healthcare resource use. We will interview a subsample of 20 participants to explore their experiences of the trial interventions.</p>

                  <p>The PROSPER study is the first multicentre UK clinical trial to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of supported exercise in the prevention of shoulder problems in high-risk women undergoing breast cancer surgery. The findings will inform future clinical practice and provide valuable insight into the role of physiotherapy-supported exercise in breast cancer rehabilitation.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the UK with a 30% increase in incidence since the early 1970s.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Due to advances in screening and treatment, the survival rate has progressively risen and now two-thirds of women will survive for 20 years beyond their breast cancer diagnosis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The mainstay treatment is surgery to the breast and axilla, supplemented with chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT) and endocrine therapy, depending on tumour stage and other clinical criteria. As a consequence of these treatments, upper limb problems such as decreased shoulder range of movement (ROM), impaired strength, chronic pain, sensory disturbances and lymphoedema are common adverse treatment effects.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Studies suggest that up to 67% of women have arm or shoulder symptoms up to 3 years after treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Persistent upper limb dysfunction and pain are debilitating, have a negative impact on sleep, quality of life, physical functioning and emotional well-being. Given successes in increasing survival, it is timely to identify strategies to improve the health-related quality of life of women after breast cancer treatment.</p>
              <p>Several risk factors for shoulder and upper body problems after breast cancer treatment have been identified, including treatment-related factors, such as type of axillary surgery and RT, and patient factors such as age, body mass index (BMI) and pre-existing shoulder problems.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Women undergoing mastectomy compared with breast conserving surgery are at greater risk of postoperative shoulder restrictions (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.03 to 31.2).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Additionally, those undergoing axillary lymph node clearance (ANC) are at greater risk of postoperative arm complaints compared with those having sentinel lymph node biopsy (OR 9.8; 95% CI 3.5 to 27.5).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> RT, particularly to the axilla or chest wall, increases the odds of shoulder restriction (pooled OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9) and lymphoedema (pooled OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8) compared with women treated without adjuvant RT.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Women reporting problems in the upper body and shoulder region before surgery are also at increased risk of chronic postoperative pain.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7</xref> BMI at time of surgery has been shown to have an independent negative effect on shoulder external rotation up to 7 years after breast cancer treatment, and increased BMI is a risk factor for chronic postoperative pain and arm lymphoedema.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> It is important that the UK National Health Service (NHS) provides optimal care for these women at high risk of developing shoulder problems to ensure recovery and return to usual activities after cancer treatment.</p>
              <p>A Cochrane review identified 24 studies (2132 participants) investigating exercise following breast cancer surgery.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Six studies (n=354), conducted outside of the UK, found that structured postoperative exercise significantly improved shoulder ROM in the short term and long term when compared with usual care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Ten studies (n=1304) have evaluated timing of exercise delivery; programmes initiated immediately postoperatively (1–3 days) versus delayed exercise suggest that early postoperative exercise does significantly improve long-term shoulder ROM. However, some studies reported an increased risk of wound-related complications with early exercise, such as seroma and surgical site infection.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The largest UK trial to date (n=116 patients), published after the Cochrane review, found that participants were less likely to develop lymphoedema when exercises were limited to 90° of shoulder elevation during the first postoperative week compared with those performing unrestricted exercises.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These previous trials investigating the efficacy of exercise following breast cancer surgery have been criticised for being of poor methodological quality and for omitting important patient-reported outcomes such as function and health-related quality of life.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Furthermore, there is ongoing uncertainty around the optimal type, dose and timing of exercise after breast cancer treatment. Moreover, none of the trials conducted to date has investigated the cost-effectiveness of structured exercise programmes after breast cancer treatment.</p>
              <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Rationale for a trial</title>
                <p>To date, no large-scale, high-quality, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the clinical effectiveness of a structured physiotherapy intervention compared with usual care for women undergoing breast cancer surgery has been conducted. Given the lack of knowledge regarding the intensity and duration of exercise interventions after breast cancer surgery, this trial will provide evidence on whether a rigorously designed physiotherapy-led intervention, incorporating behaviour change theory, improves postoperative function and related outcomes, and whether this is cost-effective to deliver in the NHS setting.</p>

                <p>Women are eligible to participate in PROSPER if they are: diagnosed with histologically confirmed invasive or non-invasive primary breast cancer scheduled for surgical excision; aged 18 years or over; can comply with the protocol; willing to provide written informed consent and considered as being at high risk of developing postoperative shoulder problems (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). This is a pragmatic trial and it is important that inclusion criteria reflect contemporary clinical practice. Therefore, women are also eligible where a later decision is made for postoperative RT to the axilla and/or supraclavicular region, thus changing their risk status from low to high. ‘Late entry’ women are eligible for the trial if the decision for postoperative RT is made within 6 weeks of surgery. Women who have had previous breast surgery (such as excision of a benign tumour or breast cyst) and those women who have had previous contralateral (opposite side) mastectomy, are eligible for invitation providing they fulfil high-risk criteria for shoulder problems. Women having immediate reconstruction or bilateral breast surgery are ineligible as the usual NHS postoperative care pathway often includes routine postoperative physiotherapy.

                <title>Allocation sequence generation and randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation is based on a computer-generated algorithm held and controlled centrally by the Warwick Clinical Trials Unit (WCTU) programming team, independent from the PROSPER team. The WCTU telephone randomisation service is used whereby randomisation occurs after eligibility and informed consent has been obtained. Concealment of allocation is maintained. An automated confirmation email of intervention allocation is generated to the study team. Randomisation is stratified by the following variables: (i) first versus repeat surgery; (ii) centre and (iii) whether informed of the need for RT within 6 weeks of surgery. The first variable adjusts for the requirement for any additional surgery which may change risk status from low to high (eg, second procedure ANC or re-excision of surgical margins). The second stratification variable ensures balanced allocation across each recruitment site. The third variable accounts for late entry to the trial, thus relates to the timing of intervention delivery and whether participants are randomised preoperatively (up to the day of surgery) or within the first 6 weeks postoperatively. Due to the nature of the study intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or treating physiotherapists to treatment allocation. However, receipt and handling of outcome data collection is blinded, thus data entry of returned postal questionnaires, data cleaning and interim statistical analyses are conducted without knowledge of treatment allocation (blinded).</p>

                <p>Participants randomised to the active intervention receive usual care leaflets in addition to the PROSPER intervention: a structured individualised exercise programme, comprising a minimum of three face-to-face and maximum of six sessions or contacts with a physiotherapist. As per Medical Research Council and TiDieR guidance, a more detailed description of the intervention development and final content has been described separately (submitted for publication). We selected exercises and components based on systematic reviews and clinical guidelines. A Cochrane review investigated the effectiveness of exercise interventions in preventing, minimising or improving upper-limb dysfunction due to breast cancer treatment.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This review included 24 trials and classified exercise type as active, active-assisted, passive ROM, manual stretching, active stretching and resistance exercises. We considered these components in relation to evidence of effectiveness on shoulder ROM and strength. This process was also augmented by eliciting opinions from clinical experts in the field of cancer rehabilitation and health psychology. The final PROSPER programme comprises specific exercises targeting shoulder range of motion and upper arm muscle strength, general physical activity and behavioural adherence strategies.</p>
                <sec id="s3b1">
                  <title>Overview of exercise intervention</title>
                  <p>The intervention is predominantly delivered in physiotherapy outpatient departments. The first physiotherapy session is arranged 7–10 days after surgery, for assessment of shoulder ROM, postoperative pain, function, arm swelling, patients’ goals and assessment of confidence to carry out prescribed exercises. Participants are prescribed an individually tailored home exercise programme and provided with guidance on rehabilitation, management of postoperative complications and returning to general physical activity and/or work. The intervention targets three movement directions using a combination of active-assisted ROM, active ROM and stretches: shoulder flexion (forward), shoulder abduction (side) and abduction with external rotation (open chest). The second appointment is between 4–6 weeks postoperatively to review progress and prescribe shoulder strengthening exercises. The programme is progressed by increasing exercise repetitions, sets and resistance. The third appointment is recommended for between 12 and 16 weeks postoperatively, for further progression to facilitate return to work, sport and hobbies. For women with later entry on the basis of postoperative RT, these timings will be slightly delayed, but the prescribed exercise programme should commence at the earliest opportunity, thus within 6 weeks of surgery.</p>
                  <p>As per development work with patient representatives, and to reflect the pragmatic trial design, three additional physiotherapy consultations are available on request. The timing and delivery of additional appointments, either via telephone or face-to-face, are flexible to account for ongoing treatment, physiotherapist judgement and patient preference. Ideally, the intervention will be completed within the first 6 months following surgery, but women can contact their physiotherapist for up to 12 months after randomisation. Thus, any late treatment-related shoulder problems will be dealt with by the trial physiotherapist. Number and method of physiotherapy contacts will be closely monitored during the trial.</p>

Questionnaires are completed at baseline on recruitment, then at 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months after randomisation by post. The primary outcome is upper limb function at 12 months measured using the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We considered other patient-reported outcome measures, including shoulder-specific scales, however selected the DASH because it captures symptoms and function of the upper limb rather than the shoulder joint per se. There is good evidence to suggest that women experience a variety of difficulties and restrictions after breast cancer treatment, affecting the hand, arm and shoulder. Functional impairment to the arm can affect performance of simple daily activities, including writing, opening or closing jars, lifting and/or holding shopping bags.</p>

              <p>PROSPER aims to recruit 350 patients, allocated in a 1:1 ratio. The sample size calculation is based on a Dutch trial of 30 women with breast cancer, randomised to physiotherapy over a 3-month period, reporting a between-group difference of 7 points on the DASH at 6 months.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> At 80% power and P&lt;0.05, this yields a target of 242 participants in total. Accounting for therapist effects, an intracluster coefficient (ICC) of 0.01 (yielding a design effect of 1.05), gives a target of 256 participants. The ICC estimate is based on our previous experience of exercise interventions in a range of musculoskeletal trials. We anticipate loss to follow-up of &lt;10% based on our previous clinical trials however, have inflated this to 25% to cover the possibility that numbers lost to follow-up are greater than anticipated, for example, due to ongoing cancer treatment.</p>
              <p>The study is powered to detect a 7-point difference on the DASH. Studies of rheumatological and orthopaedic populations have suggested that the minimally clinically important difference for the DASH is 10, and that the between-group difference for trials should be set at 10.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, this fails to account for many of the eventualities that occur in pragmatic trials, notably that there is not a ‘no treatment’ control arm, and therefore that some of the control group may be exposed by serendipity to an intervention of similar intensity, particularly in a high-risk population.</p>

The intended sample size for the internal pilot study was 30 participants, approximately 10% of the full sample. Acceptability of the PROSPER intervention was explored through qualitative research involving audio-recorded individual interviews with seven participants. Changes were made to patient-facing materials and to exercise intervention materials. Easy-to-use pocket-sized laminated cards with details of inclusion/exclusion criteria and shoulder screening criteria were produced for recruitment staff. Additional telephone or face-to-face appointments were added to the exercise intervention to allow for flexibility during ongoing cancer treatment. Data from the pilot phase helped to refine recruitment and trial processes. Patients recruited to the pilot phase continue with the follow-up schedule and will be retained in the full trial analysis.

If there is negligible clustering effect, it will be analysed using ordinary linear regression models. In each case, the mean change from baseline (to 6 and 12 months) will be summarised for each of the treatment arms and differences between the interventions using unadjusted and adjusted (for age, type of surgery and RT) estimates. These mean changes and their 95% CIs will be plotted graphically so that change can be assessed over the course of the study. Continuous secondary outcomes will be assessed in a similar way to the primary outcome. Categorical data will be analysed using random effect/ordinary logistic models, depending on the presence of a clustering effect.</p>
                <p>A DASH score cannot be computed if there are more than three missing items. As a sensitivity analysis, the impact of missing data will be assessed using multiple imputation. The impact of non-compliance with the intervention will be examined using the complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> We have reviewed definitions of compliance for CACE analyses used in other therapy trials.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> Complete compliance with the PROSPER intervention is defined as having three or more contacts with the PROSPER therapist; an additional analysis will be undertaken to explore partial compliance, defined as less than three sessions. Analyses and template tables will be reported in a detailed statistical analysis plan for review and approval by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), prior to final statistical analysis of the data. Planned sensitivity analyses include: a) the impact of low/high recruitment centres on clustering effect and b) assessment of differences between date of randomisation and date of surgery across groups, as surgical trials vary in relation to timing of follow-up.</p>

Primary research methods will be used to estimate the costs of delivering the physiotherapy-led exercise programme, including development and training of accredited providers, the cost of delivering the individual sessions and participant monitoring activities. Broader resource utilisation will be captured through three main sources: (i) clinical data extraction forms; (ii) patient postal questionnaires at 6 and 12 months postrandomisation; and if feasible within the trial timeline, (iii) routine health data sources from NHS Digital. Current UK unit costs will be applied to each resource item to estimate costs in each trial arm. Health-related quality of life will be measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months postrandomisation using the generic EQ-5D-5L and SF-12 measures; national tariff sets will be used to generate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–30</xref>

Detailed methods of analysis will be prespecified within a health economics analysis plan approved by the trial team prior to analysis to ensure appropriate methods are used. Results will be presented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves generated via the net-benefit framework. A series of sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the implications of uncertainty on the ICERs and to consider the broader issue of the generalisability of the study results. Due to the known limitations of within-trial economic evaluations,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> a decision-analytical model may be constructed to examine the long-term costs and outcomes beyond the end of the trial. Costs and outcomes beyond the first year will be discounted to present values<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to explore the impact of uncertainty on the ICERs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PROSPER will be the largest UK RCT examining the effectiveness of an early, supervised exercise and behavioural support intervention for women at risk of developing shoulder problems after breast cancer surgery. Previous trials in this field have been criticised for being of poor methodological quality and lacking in important outcome measures, such as patient-reported shoulder function and health-related quality of life. Another challenge encountered in previous clinical trials of this population is low participant recruitment, partly due to the short time frame between diagnosis and surgery and perhaps compounded by reluctance to undertake active exercise when faced with a distressing and potentially life-threatening cancer diagnosis. PROSPER aims to recruit 350 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer to provide empirical data on whether a physiotherapy-led exercise programme is effective for reducing shoulder disability, when delivered in a pragmatic NHS clinical setting. The design and development of this complex intervention was underpinned by multiple stages of work, in line with MRC guidance on the development of complex interventions. A full description of the content of the PROSPER exercise intervention has been submitted elsewhere for publication.</p>
