                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Laboratory studies suggest that eating more ‘attentively’ (e.g. attending to food being eaten and recalling eating episodes) can reduce food intake among participants with both healthy weight and overweight. The aim of this trial was to assess whether a smartphone application that encourages a more attentive eating style reduces energy intake and promotes weight loss.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In an open-label, single centre, parallel groups, individually randomised controlled trial, 107 adults with overweight/obesity in Merseyside, UK used an attentive eating smartphone application along with standard dietary advice (intervention group) or standard dietary advice only (control group) for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were change in body weight at 8 weeks and energy intake at 4 and 8 weeks. Additional outcomes included self-reported eating behaviours measured at 8 weeks. Differences between groups were assessed with linear regression (adjusted) using multiple imputation for missing data. Study protocol registered prospectively at (10.17605/osf.io/btzhw).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">There was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in weight lost at 8 weeks, or change in self-reported 24 h or objective taste-test energy intake at 4 or 8 weeks. Mean weight loss in the intervention group (<italic>n</italic> = 53) was 1.2 kg and 1.1 kg in the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 54), adjusted difference of − 0.10 (− 1.6 to 1.3) kg. Self-reported eating behaviours at 8 weeks also did not differ across groups. The intervention was largely used as intended and a per protocol analysis confined to participants in the intervention group that used the attentive eating smartphone application regularly and as intended also showed no effect on energy intake or weight loss.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">A smartphone based attentive eating intervention and standard dietary advice did not result in reduced energy intake or greater weight loss at 4 or 8 week follow-up than standard dietary advice alone.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par13">Across English-speaking high-income countries, obesity rates currently exceed 30% and this is predicted to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The health problems often associated with obesity, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and several types of cancer are substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Easily implementable interventions that help people reduce their food intake and aid weight loss are therefore needed. Moreover, with approximately 76% of UK adults now owning a smartphone, smartphones may provide a cost effective platform for delivering behavioural interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par14">Eating ‘on the go’ and while distracted may be contributing to overeating. Laboratory studies suggest that eating while distracted can increase concurrent food intake, hunger afterwards, and later snacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] which may occur because failing to attend to food being eaten impairs memory for what has been eaten. In line with this, laboratory studies also indicate that memory for recent eating episodes are factored into subsequent food intake decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For example, increasing awareness of recent eating episodes has been found to reduce later snacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and paying more attention to food as it is being consumed has been found to reduce later snacking in most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], (but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) laboratory studies in participants with healthy weight and overweight. These promising results from the laboratory suggest that an intervention approach that promotes a more ‘attentive’ style of eating by encouraging participants to attend to food being eaten and recall eating episodes may be an effective way of reducing food intake and aiding weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, because such an approach would not rely on conscious and vigilant calorie counting, it may be relatively acceptable to users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">To examine the potential of an attentive eating intervention approach, we previously developed and tested initial feasibility of a smartphone based application that encourages users to eat more attentively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The smartphone application encouraged an attentive eating style by requiring users to photograph their meals and attend to food while eating (utilising present moment awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]). They were also required to review what else they had eaten that day before entering their next meal, with an overall aim of encouraging a more attentive eating style [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Participants with overweight and obesity used the application in a small scale feasibility trial and reported in qualitative interviews that they found the smartphone application easy to use, increased their awareness of what they had been eating and that the frequency of application usage was acceptable. To date, there has been no examination of whether an attentive eating based intervention is effective in reducing energy intake and promoting weight loss. The aim of this randomised control trial was to test initial proof of concept for effectiveness of an attentive eating smartphone application to reduce energy intake and promote weight loss.</p>

Participants were randomly allocated to receive either an attentive eating smartphone application along with a standard dietary advice booklet and the same dietary advice delivered by text message once a week (intervention group), or the dietary advice booklet and weekly text messages only (control group). Assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. The inclusion of basic dietary information and weekly text messages repeating this information in both the control and intervention group ensured that, in line with recommendations of best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], our control group were actively trying to lose weight, but the resources they were provided with were minimal and not expected to promote a large amount of weight loss. In addition, this design ensured that both the control and intervention group were required to use their smartphone during the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par17">A 2 kg difference in weight loss between the two groups across 8 weeks was considered meaningful, with a conservative estimate of the standard deviation of weight loss across conditions of 2.5 kg (based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). To detect this difference in weight loss (alpha level = 0.05, 90% power, GPower 3.1) we required a minimum sample size of <italic>N</italic> = 68. However, due to greater participant interest in the trial than anticipated, we recruited above this number during a 7 week baseline data collection period (see pre-registered protocol).</p>
                <p id="Par18">To be eligibile to take part participants had to be classed as overweight or obese based on their BMI (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and report that they would like to lose weight by changing their dietary behaviour. Participants were also required to have no history of eating disorders or food allergies (self-reported by participant), be aged 18–65 years, be fluent English speakers, not taking medication that affects appetite, not pregnant, not scheduled for weight loss surgery during the trial, own an Android/Apple smartphone (Android operating system versions 4.4–7.1, Apple operating system iOS 8–10) and not currently on a structured weight loss programme. Participants with diabetes were able to take part, providing they were not using insulin or other diabetes medication that affects appetite.</p>

A colleague outside the research team generated this sequence and placed the allocations inside sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes (ensuring allocation concealment). Participants were not blind to condition allocation, neither were staff delivering the intervention and collecting baseline and follow-up measures.</p>

                  <title>Attentive eating application</title>
                  <p id="Par22">The approach to designing the attentive eating smartphone application was described in detail in the feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The attentive eating application was designed to promote attentive eating by encouraging users to photograph food and drink being consumed and then review this information when making dietary decisions throughout the day. Prior to eating/drinking a food or beverage users accessed the camera function of their phone and selected the meal type they wished to record (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, drink, other). Alternatively, users could select a photograph that was already stored on their phone or they could write a description of the food. After an adjustable time period, the application sent a notification reminding users to complete questions about their consumption experience once they had finished the meal. After finishing the meal/drink, users accessed the consumption experience questions and the photograph of the recently consumed food/drink was displayed, with information about the meal type consumed. With this image on the screen, users selected drop down answers to the questions ‘Did you finish it all?’ and ‘How do you feel?’ Once an entry was completed the consumption episode was logged in a food gallery. The food gallery consisted of a chronological slide show of the consumption episodes recorded so far during that day, and presented the meal photograph and all information recorded from the consumption experience questions. Users could navigate forwards and backwards through consumption episodes. Prior to deciding what and how much to eat for a meal during the day, users accessed this gallery to review everything they had eaten/drank so far that day. The application sent a notification reminding users to review the gallery shortly before their usual meal times. Users were able to programme what time they usually had breakfast, lunch and dinner on week days and weekends and were able to customise when the reminders were sent prior to that meal time. These components formed the main functions of the application and they were included in order to increase awareness of what was being consumed, enhance memory for eating episodes during the day and prompt users to think about previous eating episodes when making dietary decisions (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for more detailed information).</p>
                  <p id="Par23">An additional feature of the application that was added for this trial was an audio clip (2.5 min) that users could listen to whilst eating. The audio clip encouraged listeners to pay more attention to what they were eating, specifically by instructing users to pay attention to the smells, textures and tastes of the food whilst they were eating, as well as how full they felt. They were also encouraged to eat slowly, one mouthful at a time, and to periodically think about how much food was on their plate at the beginning and how much they had eaten (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for audio clip transcript). The instructions were based on the audio clip instructions used in previous laboratory studies that have been found to enhance memory of recent eating episodes and reduce later snack intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par24">In order to motivate application usage, users could achieve in application ‘stars’ for reviewing the food gallery before a main meal, listening to the audio clip after taking a photograph of a main meal and completing a diary entry for a main meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner). An entry was considered complete when users took a photograph of the meal, completed the consumption experience questions after eating and the meal was logged in the gallery. Users were awarded a daily achievement badge if they obtained all available application stars during a single day. To further encourage regular use of the application, participants in the intervention group were told they would receive an additional £10 compensation (in addition to the £40 compensation all participants received for their time) for continued use of the application. Participants were told that continued use was recording most meals every day and listening to the audio clip a few times per week. In addition to the smartphone application participants also received a short paper based leaflet that explained the principles of attentive eating and other ways to eat attentively (e.g. avoiding eating whilst distracted).

                  <p id="Par25">Primary outcomes were body weight (kg) at 8 weeks and energy intake (kcal) at 4 and 8 weeks. Weight was measured with the Tanita BC-418 MA body composition analyser (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Two measures of energy intake were taken, self-reported 24 h energy intake and an objective laboratory measure of food intake in a bogus taste-test scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Self-reported 24 h energy intake was measured using MyFood24, an online automated 24 h dietary assessment system developed and validated for use in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Recommendations by the National Cancer Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] suggest that the use of individual 24 h recalls pre and post intervention is a valid instrument to examine intervention effects on energy intake. The bogus taste-test is a laboratory standardised objective measure of food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the bogus taste-test participants were provided with 3 bowls of 50 g each of three biscuits (Maryland chocolate chip cookies ~ 249 kcal, Cadbury’s chocolate fingers ~ 240 kcal and McVities digestives ~ 241 kcal), broken up into small pieces to be comparable with previous laboratory studies. Participants were told that this was a taste perception task and given 10 min to rate the biscuits on 100-point visual analogue scales (anchors ‘not at all’ and ‘extremely’) on a number of features (e.g. crunchiness, flavoursome). Participants were also told that they could eat as many biscuits as they wished. Participants were asked not to eat for 1 h prior to the assessment sessions in order to standardise hunger. As some participants were attending the laboratory quite early (~ 8 am), asking participants not to eat for 1 h prior seemed reasonable. The biscuits were weighed afterwards in order to calculate the amount of biscuits consumed and converted to total kcals.</p>

Demographic information for each participant was collected: age, gender, ethnicity and education level achieved. Physical activity was assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Booth, 2000). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants in the experimental group during the 8 week follow-up visit in order to understand participants’ experiences of the intervention (qualitative analyses using this data are to be reported elsewhere).

                <p id="Par31">After being screened for eligibility via an online survey, participants attended the baseline visit where eligibility was re-confirmed in person (including measuring height and weight to verify BMI). Participants then provided consent to take part in the trial. Baseline measurements of body weight, height, body fat percentage, energy intake (both self-reported 24 h and objective laboratory bogus taste-test energy intake), trait eating behaviour and ideal portion size were then taken, and participants provided demographic information and completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Hunger was measured immediately before the taste-test on a 100-point visual analogue scale (anchors ‘not at all’ and ‘extremely’). Participants were then randomised to condition by the researcher. The researcher (a psychologist with a PhD) then explained the dietary advice booklet and the weekly text tips following a script. Participants in the intervention group were then told that they would also be using an attentive eating smartphone application. The same researcher introduced the concept of attentive eating and downloaded the application onto the participant’s mobile phone. The researcher then showed the participant how to use the different functions of the application, and how to personalise the timings of the in-app reminder notifications. Participants were then told that they would receive additional compensation for continued use of the application and were given the attentive eating take home leaflet. Participants in both groups were asked not to use any other structured (e.g. Weight Watchers) or smartphone based (e.g. My Fitness Pal) weight loss methods and to not take part in any other research during the trial. Participants then completed the intervention efficacy belief questions.</p>

Hunger was again measured immediately before the taste-test. The researcher also asked participants about their use of the study materials. Participants in the intervention group were asked about their usage of the application and the researcher resolved any problems experienced with using the application in order to bolster use of the application for the remaining 4 weeks of the trial.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Missing data for primary and secondary outcomes were imputed using multiple imputation implementing a multivariate imputation by chained equations logarithm. Twenty-two percent of participants had some missing data, and therefore 22 imputations were created. For the full list of variables included in the imputation models, see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par35">The effect of condition on primary and secondary outcomes was examined using regression analyses with 4 and 8 week measurements as the DVs, condition as the IV, controlling for baseline measurement of the DV and baseline BMI (as participants were stratified to condition based on BMI). Pre taste-test hunger was also controlled for in the analyses for objective laboratory measurement of bogus taste-test energy intake. To check the robustness of the multiple imputation results, the pooled results for primary outcomes were compared to two other approaches: last observation carried forward (LOCF) and complete cases only (CC). Results were considered significant if <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for the main analyses.</p>
                <p id="Par36">For the additional outcomes analyses, missing data was imputed using the last observation carried forward method<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> and the data was analysed using the same regression approach as for the primary and secondary outcomes. To account for multiple comparisons in our additional analyses, results were considered statistically significant if <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 for all additional outcome analyses. The two questions measuring intervention efficacy beliefs were correlated at baseline and at the 8 week assessment (both <italic>r’s</italic> = 0.8) and so the average of the two questions was calculated for each assessment session and used in the analysis to reduce multiplicity. In sensitivity analyses, we assessed the impact of protocol violations on the results for primary, secondary and additional outcomes by excluding data from participants who violated the protocol.</p>

Participants who used the application as intended were defined as those who accessed the application on the majority of trial days and recorded 4 diary entries per day on at least half of the trial days. In addition, any participants who routinely completed entries immediately after taking the meal photograph (e.g. less than 1 min), with fewer than 0.5 gallery views per day and did not listen to the audio clip at all during the trial were excluded and not considered to be frequent users.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par46">In the first randomised control trial testing the efficacy of an attentive eating smartphone application, we found no effect of the intervention on energy intake or body weight in adults seeking to lose weight. Sensitivity analyses for loss to follow-up, protocol violations and per protocol analyses did not change the results. There was also no evidence that the intervention affected other aspects of eating behaviour.</p>
              <p id="Par47">One possible explanation for finding that the attentive eating smartphone application did not produce greater reductions in weight or eating habits than the control group is that participants did not use the application enough to promote these changes. However, application usage data indicates that participants tended to use the mobile phone application frequently. Furthermore, although smaller in sample size, analyses comparing participants who used the application as intended vs. the control group did not show any effects of intervention on weight loss and energy intake. The proportion of trial days participants accessed the application also did not predict weight loss. Poor usage of the application appears unlikely to explain the lack of effect. Across both the intervention group and control group participants lost a modest amount of weight by 8 weeks (1.1–1.2 kg) and self-reported 24 h energy intake was lower at 4 and 8 weeks compared to baseline in both groups. This amount of weight loss is similar to that observed among people losing weight without behavioural support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These modest weight losses imply, however, that the lack of effect is not due to ceiling effects i.e. users adhering to such strict dietary regimens that the application had no prospect of effect.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Short-term laboratory studies suggest encouraging an attentive eating style reduces food intake in participant with healthy weight and overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, other recent laboratory research did not replicate these effects or demonstrate any effects of focused attention on memory for recent food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given that the present study was the first to examine the applied relevance of attentive eating outside of the laboratory it is difficult to conclude whether the impact attentive eating has on food intake has been overestimated in laboratory studies or whether other aspects of the present intervention study design explain the lack of effect of attentive eating on energy intake and weight loss. For example, laboratory studies do not tell participants about the value of and aims of eating attentively, but this might be expected to increase not decrease the effectiveness of an intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par49">Understanding why the attentive eating application did not produce significant weight loss may be informative. One possibility is that increased attention to food during active weight loss does not promote further reduced food intake because it reminds individuals that they are eating less than usual. Another possibility is that the application did not have the intended psychological impact. Although we were able to record participant adherence to the intervention we were unable to include a direct measurement of the extent to which the smartphone application increased attention to food during eating and improved memory of food eaten.</p>
              <sec id="Sec25">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par50">Given that this was the first proof-of-concept trial of the effect of attentive eating, energy intake and weight loss were examined at only 4 and 8 week follow up. Although this approach is consistent with other proof-of-concept trials examining the effect of psychologically informed weight loss interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], it prevents us from making conclusions about the longer term effectiveness of attentive eating. However, we know of no intervention that leads to long-term weight loss that does not also lead to short-term weight loss and thus we can be reasonably confident that this intervention is unlikely to be effective in the long-term. A limitation of the current study is that only 25% of the study sample was male, which is not representative of the UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but is similar to other weight loss trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A strength of the present study was the use of an active control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and that our control and intervention group were rated similarly by participants in terms of expected efficacy, as a failure to account for expectancy effects when examining efficacy of behavioural interventions can lead to incorrect conclusions about intervention efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A further strength of the current study was the use of both self-reported and objective measures of food intake, as these measures used in isolation both have their weaknesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The consistent non-significant effect of the intervention on both measures of energy intake supports the robustness of the findings, regardless of the limitations of the individual methods. The robustness of the trial findings is also supported by the consistency of the results across the several methods used to handle missing data and the sensitivity analyses. Further, the dropout rate in the present trial (21%) is similar to that observed in other weight loss trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We were not able to measure whether the attentive eating application improved memory for recent eating during the trial, so although we can conclude the attentive eating application was ineffective in promoting weight loss, it is less clear whether it is a useful tool by which to study the effects of memory for recent eating outside of the laboratory. Future work would benefit from more directly measuring the effect of the application on attention paid to food and memory for recent eating. Further, it is likely that participants did not report all meals and drinks consumed, however adherence to the application was reasonable. Whilst there was a reasonable range of intake in the bogus taste-test, intake was less than observed in laboratory studies that are not weight loss trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], suggesting that there could have been a floor effect on food intake in the bogus taste-test. In addition, we did not measure participants’ history of weight loss attempts or use of dietary mobile phone applications which may be useful to measure in future research for descriptive purposes.</p>
