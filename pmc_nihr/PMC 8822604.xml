            <p id="P6">Current guidelines for cholesterol lowering of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommend the addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies for patients at very high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels remain ≥70 mg/dL on optimized statin treatment (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

            <p id="P7">Among patients with coronary heart disease receiving moderate to intensive statin therapy (eg, simvastatin 40–80 mg/d or atorvastatin 80 mg/d), approximately 50% to 60% achieve LDL-C levels &lt;70 mg/dL (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Of these, approximately 30% have LDL-C levels of 60 to 70 mg/dL (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Whether patients with LDL-C levels close to 70 mg/dL on statin treatment derive incremental benefit from further lipid-lowering therapy is therefore a question that is frequently encountered in clinical practice.</p>
            <p id="P8">Inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) produce large reductions of LDL-C as monotherapy or when added to statins. An additional effect of PCSK9 inhibitors is to reduce lipoprotein(a) concentration by 20% to 25% (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Lipoprotein(a) is a type of low-density lipoprotein particle whose concentration is determined primarily genetically. It is believed to have atherogenic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic properties (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Epidemiologic and genetic studies associate lipoprotein(a) concentration with the risk for incident coronary, peripheral artery, and cerebrovascular disease (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
            <p id="P9">The FOURIER (Further Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) and ODYSSEY Outcomes (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab) trials demonstrated reductions in the risk for MACE with PCSK9 inhibitors in statin-treated patients with established cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated levels of LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), or apolipoprotein B (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P24">The central finding of this analysis of the ODYSSEY Outcomes trial is that patients with recent ACS, LDL-C near 70 mg/dL on optimized statin treatment, and lipoprotein(a) levels that were at least mildly elevated (≥13.7 mg/dL) derived substantial clinical benefit (reduced risk for MACE) from treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitor alirocumab. In contrast, patients with LDL-C near 70 mg/dL and lipoprotein(a) &lt;13.7 mg/dL had no reduction in MACE with alirocumab. Patients with higher LDL-C levels derived consistent clinical benefit from alirocumab treatment irrespective of the level of lipoprotein(a). Findings were similar in a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with blinded, protocol-specified substitution of placebo for alirocumab. Thus, in patients with recent ACS and LDL-C levels considered “controlled” on statin therapy, levels of lipoprotein(a) that are at least mildly elevated may identify an additional group to be considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Notably, a lipoprotein(a) concentration of 13.7 mg/dL is only slightly greater than the median level observed in cohorts without prior cardiovascular events (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Because the present findings were derived from a post hoc analysis, a prospective evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy in patients with nominally controlled LDL-C but elevated lipoprotein(a) is indicated.</p>
              <p id="P25">In patients with baseline LDL-C near 70 mg/dL and lipoprotein(a) at or higher than the median of 13.7 mg/dL, alirocumab produced moderate absolute reductions in both LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) (median 37 and 10.3 mg/dL, respectively), accompanied by an approximately 30% reduction in the risk for MACE. In the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists analysis of statin trials (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), a 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C with statin treatment was associated with a 21% reduction in the incidence of major vascular events, and a 37 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C would have been expected to produce a 20% reduction in events. Importantly, however, few patients in the trials that constituted the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists analysis had baseline LDL-C levels as low as 70 mg/dL. As LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) usually change in parallel under treatment with alirocumab, it is difficult to apportion the benefit of alirocumab on MACE to individual lipoprotein effects or their interaction. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the clinical treatment benefit observed in patients with lower levels of LDL-C but elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) suggests that lipoprotein(a) reduction contributed to the benefit and/or that elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) identify patients with atherosclerotic plaques amenable to stabilization with PCSK9 inhibition. In patients with baseline LDL-C near 70 mg/dL and lipoprotein(a) &lt;13.7 mg/dL, alirocumab produced a similar reduction in LDL-C (median 3g mg/dL), but with minimal change in lipoprotein(a) and no clinical benefit. Moreover, in both the lower and higher LDL-C subgroups, LDL-C levels were similar in the higher versus lower lipoprotein(a) categories. Consequently, corrected LDL-C was lower in the higher lipoprotein(a) category and vice versa. Thus, treatment HRs for alirocumab were more favorable in patients with higher lipoprotein(a) despite lower levels of corrected or “true” LDL-C.</p>
              <p id="P26">Together, these observations suggest that in statin-treated patients with recent ACS and LDL-C levels near 70 mg/dL, lipoprotein(a) levels that are at least mildly elevated are required to achieve a clinical benefit from PCSK9 inhibition. In these patients, the coordinated reduction of both LDL-C and lipoprotein(a) levels may be necessary to reduce the risk for MACE. Lipoprotein(a) is believed to have proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). ACS is associated with heightened inflammation and usually reflects an atherothrombotic event (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Modest reductions in lipoprotein(a) concentration with PCSK9 inhibition in the ODYSSEY Outcomes and FOURIER trials were associated with substantial reductions in the risk for MACE (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A link among these observations may be that lipoprotein(a) particles are the principal carriers of oxidized phospholipids that are proinflammatory and may play a central role in atherothrombotic events (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In this regard, the relationship of lipoprotein(a) concentration to risk for MACE and reduction of that risk with a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody may be stronger in a secondary prevention population with recent ACS than would be predicted from analyses relating lipoprotein(a) concentration to incident cardiovascular disease events in healthy cohorts (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>

                <title>STUDY LIMITATIONS.</title>
                <p id="P27">First, the analysis was conducted on a post hoc basis. Second, patients in ODYSSEY Outcomes with LDL-C levels &lt;70 mg/dL qualified for the trial on the basis of alternative criteria of elevated non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B. The findings of the present analysis cannot necessarily be extended to patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) but levels of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein B less than trial thresholds.</p>
                <p id="P28">Third, lipoprotein(a) concentration was determined using a mass assay. Overall, mass and molar concentrations of lipoprotein(a) are highly correlated, but their ratio varies according to isoform size (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although atherothrombotic risk may be more closely related to the molar concentration of lipoprotein(a) (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), molar concentration is underestimated at high mass concentration and overestimated at low mass concentration (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). To the extent such effects were present, they would have biased our study to the null.</p>
                <p id="P29">Fourth, lipoprotein(a) may be a positive acute-phase reactant after ACS (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). However, patients in ODYSSEY Outcomes were randomized at a minimum of 1 and a median of 2.6 months after the qualifying ACS, and lipoprotein(a) levels did not change significantly between randomization and month 4 in the placebo group (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P30">Fifth, the 3-factor interaction of treatment, LDL-C subgroup, and lipoprotein(a) category on MACE was nonsignificant. This is because patients with higher LDL-C levels, who constituted 77% of the study population, had a relatively consistent treatment benefit irrespective of lipoprotein(a) levels.</p>
                <p id="P31">Finally, some studies have indicated that the relationship between lipoprotein(a) concentration and cardiovascular risk may vary across ethnic groups (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The ODYSSEY Outcomes population was predominantly white, and generalizability of the findings to other populations is uncertain.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p id="P32">Many high-risk patients achieve LDL-C levels of approximately 70 mg/dL on intensive statin treatment with or without ezetimibe (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These patients lie at the cusp of guideline criteria to augment lipid-lowering therapy, but physicians are uncertain whether to take further therapeutic steps. In current clinical practice, few such patients are treated with PCSK9 inhibitors. Determining the concentration of lipoprotein(a) might have utility in identifying a subset of these patients who could derive substantial benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor treatment and similarly identifying a subset for whom benefit is unlikely and added cost and complexity of treatment could be avoided. In patients whose LDL-C remained substantially &gt;70 mg/dL (median g4.0 mg/dL), alirocumab treatment provided consistent benefit irrespective of lipoprotein(a) levels, and therefore determining lipoprotein(a) may not affect therapeutic decision making to the same extent.</p>
