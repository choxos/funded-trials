                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a leading cause of pediatric morbidity, with no approved vaccine. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine candidate in adults and children.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this randomized, double-blind, phase 1/2a, placebo-controlled study, 12 adults (18–50 years) and 36 RSV-seropositive children (12–24 months) were randomized 2:1 to Ad26.RSV.preF (1 × 10<sup>11</sup> viral particles [vp] for adults, 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> vp for children) or placebo, at day 1 and 29, with 6-month immunogenicity and 1-year safety follow-up. Respiratory syncytial virus infection was an exploratory outcome in children.</p>

                <sec id="s3">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In adults, solicited adverse events (AEs) were generally mild to moderate, with no serious AEs. In children, no vaccination-related serious AEs were reported; fever was reported in 14 (58.3%) Ad26.RSV.preF recipients. Baseline pediatric geometric mean titers for RSV A2 neutralization increased from 121 (95% confidence interval [CI], 76–191) to 1608 (95% CI, 730–3544) at day 29, and 2235 (95% CI, 1586–3150) at day 57, remaining elevated over 7 months. Respiratory syncytial virus infection was confirmed in fewer children receiving Ad26.RSV.preF (1, 4.2%) than placebo (5, 41.7%).</p>

          <body>
            <p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of serious acute respiratory illness in infants globally, with an estimated 33.1 million episodes of RSV acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and 3.2 million hospitalizations in children &lt;5 years annually [<xref rid="jiac407-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite this, there is no current licensed vaccine for RSV. An early vaccine developed against RSV in the 1960s, formalin-inactivated-RSV, was associated with enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) and deaths in a study of infants and toddlers [<xref rid="jiac407-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although the mechanisms of ERD are not fully understood, it is thought that formalin-inactivated-RSV failed to induce adequate RSV-neutralizing antibodies and induced a T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) skewed response.</p>
            <p>There are currently several RSV fusion protein (F-protein)-based vaccines targeting older adults and maternal immunization in development; however, there have been many late-stage failures in this field [<xref rid="jiac407-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Until recently, a single neutralizing monoclonal antibody was the only effective prophylaxis available, but high-cost and intensive dosing largely restricted use to high-risk infants. Although advances with antenatal immunization [<xref rid="jiac407-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and a recently licensed extended half-life monoclonal antibody [<xref rid="jiac407-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that may provide seasonal RSV protection through passive immunization show potential, neither approach has been shown to prevent transmission of RSV. In contrast, active immunization has the potential to provide both direct and indirect protection to at-risk groups.</p>
            <p>An efficacious active RSV vaccine is believed to require potent neutralizing antibodies and T-helper cell type 1 (Th1)-skewed cellular immune responses [<xref rid="jiac407-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This type of response has been demonstrated in other vaccines utilizing the Ad26-based platform, including against Ebola virus disease and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<xref rid="jiac407-B9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>]. The RSV F-protein is an attractive vaccine target, because it is essential in the development of infection in its prefusion (pre-F) conformation and is highly conserved across RSV strains [<xref rid="jiac407-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Epitopes specific to the pre-F protein appear to be more potent than those on the postfusion (post-F) conformation of the RSV-F protein [<xref rid="jiac407-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
            <p>The RSV adenovirus 26 vector encoding pre-F vaccine (Ad26.RSV.preF) utilizes the Ad26 platform with RSV F-protein stabilized in the pre-F conformation and has demonstrated immunogenicity, safety, and protection from RSV infection in adult phase 1 and human challenge trials [<xref rid="jiac407-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This vaccine induces a Th1-biased response in neonatal mice, providing reassurance for its further development in infants [<xref rid="jiac407-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
            <p>This study investigated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Ad26.RSV.preF vaccine candidate in RSV-seropositive 12- to 24-month-olds, as a precursor to the use of this vaccine in younger seronegative children (EudraCT 2017:-001345-27). Because this was the first study of Ad26.RSV.preF in a new buffer formulation, a “run-in” cohort of healthy adults aged 18–50 years was vaccinated before children to assess reactogenicity.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1/2a study with vaccination on days 1 and 29, immune follow up through 6 months post second dose, and safety follow up through 1-year after first dose (Clinical Trials Registration: NCT03303625). The study included 2 cohorts: adults aged 18–50 years and RSV-seropositive 12- to 24-month-olds.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted at sites in the United States, Finland, and the United Kingdom, in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and national regulatory requirements and was approved by the institutional review boards and research ethics in relevant countries. All participants or their parents/legal guardians provided written informed consent.</p>
                <p>The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of a 2-dose regimen of Ad26.RSV.preF in adults and RSV-seropositive children. The secondary objective was to assess humoral and cellular immune responses to Ad26.RSV.preF as measured by virus neutralization assay (VNA), F-protein binding antibodies (pre-F and post-F), and intracellular cytokine staining ([ICS] to assess Th1/Th2 phenotype). Exploratory objectives were to further assess (1) humoral and cellular immune responses in all participants and (2) RSV infection rates, symptoms of respiratory illness, and severe RSV-LRTI in children. The original sample size of 12 adults and 48 children was chosen to provide a preliminary safety and immunogenicity assessment; the pediatric sample size was subsequently amended to 36, after an initial safety assessment of the first 24 enrolled participants, which raised no concerns.</p>

                <title>Randomization and Blinding</title>
                <p>Participants were randomized within adult and pediatric cohorts in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 2 single doses of Ad26.RSV.preF or equivalent of placebo. Doses were given at days 1 and 29. Randomization was balanced using randomly permuted blocks. Two sentinel participants in each cohort (1:1, active/placebo) were enrolled for safety monitoring. The remainder of the blocks were filled to overall 2:1 randomization. Placebo recipients were included for blinding and safety purposes and provided additional control specimens for immunogenicity assays.</p>
                <p>Only staff with responsibility for vaccine preparation and dispensing were aware of vaccine allocation. The investigator was not unblinded until the final analysis was performed. Primary and interim analyses were performed on data unblinded at the group level.</p>

                <p>The RSV-B strain cross-neutralization assay was performed for the pediatric cohort.

There was no change from baseline in the placebo group (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>In the adult cohort, Ad26-seropositive participants increased from 2 of 8 (25%) at baseline to 5 of 6 (83.3%) at day 29 in the Ad26.RSV.preF group. In children, Ad26-seropositive participants increased from 2 of 17 (11.8%) at baseline to 10 of 16 (62.5%) at day 29 in the Ad26.RSV.preF group. All participants in placebo groups in both cohorts were Ad26-seronegative at baseline and remained seronegative on day 29.</p>
                <p>Only 1 of 24 children (4.2%) Ad26.RSV.preF recipients had evidence of virologically confirmed RSV-RTI compared with 5 of 12 placebo recipients (41.7%) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The confirmed RSV infection in the Ad26.RSV.preF group was due to RSV-B strain; in the placebo group, 2 participants had RSV-A strain infection, and 3 participants had RSV-B strain. No confirmed RSV-RTI in either group met criteria for LRTI.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrated that administration of Ad26.RSV.preF to RSV-seropositive children aged 12–24 months generated a humoral and cellular immune response and had an acceptable reactogenicity profile. There was also evidence of humoral immunogenicity in adults receiving Ad26.RSV.preF, with an acceptable reactogenicity profile, consistent with the results of prior adult studies [<xref rid="jiac407-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>No safety concerns were raised in adults or children receiving Ad26.RSV.preF. Most local and systemic solicited reactogenicity in adults and children was below grade 3 and of short duration [<xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Transient fevers after vaccination were commonly observed in RSV-seropositive children and adults (58.3% and 50%, respectively). Based on these results, a dose reduction was implemented in an ongoing study of Ad26.RSV.preF in RSV-seronegative children [<xref rid="jiac407-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>Immunization with Ad26.RSV.preF induced humoral immune responses including RSV A2 neutralizing, pre-F-protein, and post-F-protein binding antibodies 28 days after first dose in both adults and children. Immunization with this vaccine also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against the RSV-B strain in children, as seen in the phase 1 trial in adults &gt;60 years, and with other F-protein based vaccines [<xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is encouraging in suggesting potential cross RSV-A and RSV-B protection in RSV pre-exposed individuals. In children, a second vaccination with Ad26.RSV.preF resulted in only a modest increase in humoral immune responses in the short term. Although this raises the possibility of using a single dose in a known seropositive population, pragmatically, distinguishing serostatus before immunization would be challenging. Two children showed no increase in humoral immune responses after first dose, both responded to the second dose; given both were Ad26 seronegative at baseline, the lack of initial response did not appear to be related to antivector immunity.</p>
              <p>Responses appeared durable to at least 6 months after second dose, consistent with previous trials using the Ad26 viral vector—in the phase 1 study of Ad26.RSV.preF, responses were maintained at 2 years, and an Ebola vaccine schedule with Ad26.ZEBOV prime and MVA-BN-Filo boost showed persistent responses 2 and a half years postimmunization [<xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The burden of pediatric RSV is mainly in the first 2 years of life, with peak risk of severe disease in the first 6 months [<xref rid="jiac407-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; a vaccine that can induce protection in infancy and sustain protection over the early years is critical.</p>
              <p>Recent RSV vaccine candidates using F-protein have incorporated the post-F form, delivered variously through protein-adjuvanted, recombinant protein nanoparticle, and adenoviral-vectored platforms [<xref rid="jiac407-B21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>]. These have all been shown to be immunogenic, generating both neutralizing and post-F binding antibodies [<xref rid="jiac407-B21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>]. However, recent data have shown neutralizing activity in human sera to predominantly derive from pre-F binding antibodies [<xref rid="jiac407-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This may account for one of these RSV vaccine candidates failing to provide protection against RSV in adults aged &gt;60, or why another did not meet the primary endpoint for protection of infants via maternal immunization, although it did show protective efficacy against severe disease, particularly in the South African setting [<xref rid="jiac407-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Epitopes exposed on the RSV F-protein stabilized in its pre-F conformation may be critical for developing potent neutralizing antibodies; a potential advantage for this vaccine.</p>
              <p>The potential for ERD is of critical importance in RSV vaccine development for the RSV-naive pediatric population; therefore, it is reassuring that Ad26.RSV.preF generated a predominant Th1 type CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response in both RSV-seropositive adults and children, consistent with prior results [<xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], rather than an ERD-associated Th2-skewed response [<xref rid="jiac407-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly encouraging is direct evidence of protection from a single dose of Ad26.RSV.pre-F against symptomatic RSV infection in a recent human challenge study of intranasal RSV in healthy adults aged 18–50 years [<xref rid="jiac407-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], supported by a promising signal from the exploratory objective in this study suggesting lower rates of RSV in the actively immunized group compared with placebo recipients.</p>
              <p>Within the broader RSV field, there remain significant advantages in continuing to target an active immunization strategy. Until recently, passive immunization through monoclonal antibodies has been limited by cost and the need for 5-weekly dosing during RSV season to high-risk infants in high-income settings [<xref rid="jiac407-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. An extended half-life monoclonal antibody (nirsevimab), given as a single dose before RSV season, has been recently demonstrated to be efficacious in healthy preterm infants, and trials in term infants are ongoing [<xref rid="jiac407-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="jiac407-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and could represent a significant improvement over existing monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. However, this approach is likely to be most useful in infants &lt;6 months of age, whereas active vaccination has the most potential to develop multiseason durable responses in children with more mature immune systems [<xref rid="jiac407-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Older children are often responsible for transmitting RSV to younger, more vulnerable siblings, and an active vaccination strategy in this age-group may provide indirect protection to the most at-risk group who also have the least mature immune responses [<xref rid="jiac407-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>A limitation of this study is that data generated in RSV-seropositive children may not be representative of responses in seronegative infants—the ultimate target population for this vaccine. In addition, assessing the long-term duration of humoral responses is challenging due to limitations in study follow up. Adenoviral-vectored vaccines have been shown to generate robust immune responses; however, questions surrounding antivector immunity and the impact on immunogenicity when used sequentially, for different pathogen targets, remain. In this study, the low number of participants with pre-existing Ad26-neutralizing antibodies limited assessment of the impact of Ad26 seropositivity on vaccine-induced immune responses, although a previous study showed no significant effect [<xref rid="jiac407-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An important question raised is whether there may be potential impact of passively transferred maternal antivector antibodies on infant protection, where an infant is vaccinated with an adenoviral-vectored vaccine. This might be relevant in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic and the use of Ad26-vectored vaccines in immunization programs.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>Respiratory syncytial virus is a longstanding and ongoing blight for young children, a major cause of hospital admission, and a major cause of childhood mortality in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="jiac407-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this study, Ad26.RSV.preF had an acceptable safety profile, was well tolerated, and elicited humoral and cellular immune responses in adults and RSV-seropositive children. Fewer RSV infections were observed in Ad26.RSV.preF recipients compared with placebo recipients. Generating data in vaccine-naive children and infants is a crucial next step for prevention of this ubiquitous viral infection, and further studies in RSV-seronegative children aged 12–24 months are ongoing [<xref rid="jiac407-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
