                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The evidence base for digital interventions for physical and mental health, including severe and enduring mental health difficulties, is increasing. In a feasibility trial, web-based Enhanced Relapse Prevention (ERPonline) for bipolar disorder demonstrated high recruitment and retention rates. Relative to participants in the waitlist control group, those who received ERPonline showed increased monitoring for early warning signs of relapse and had developed more positive illness models.</p>

                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To understand users’ motivations and barriers for taking part in an online/telephone-based trial, and for engagement with ERPonline.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants from the trial who had been allocated to receive ERPonline were purposively sampled to participate in telephone-based, in-depth qualitative interviews about their experiences. Interviews (n<italic toggle="yes">=</italic>19) were analysed using framework analysis to identify themes relevant to study aims.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Participants took part due to the convenient, flexible and rewarding aspects of the trial design, as well as a desire to improve the mental health of themselves and others. Barriers included extensive assessments, practical difficulties and mood. ERPonline was was generally considered to be accessible, relevant and straightforward, but there were individual preferences regarding design, content and who it was for. Several participants reported positive changes, but there was a sense that digital interventions should not replace routine care.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>There are a number of barriers and facilitators to consider when evaluating and implementing digital interventions. Individual preferences and human contact were key factors for both trial design and engagement with an online intervention.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Evidence for feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of web-based mental health interventions is growing rapidly, particularly for conditions like anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Early evidence indicates that online interventions may have similar utility for more severe and enduring conditions, such as bipolar disorder (BD) and psychosis.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Unfortunately, there are insufficient definitive trials to support the scale-up and spread of web-based interventions for people with BD. We know that people with mental health problems may have challenges in engaging with web-based interventions<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and that levels of use are likely to be even lower in real world settings than in research settings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, it is important to examine users’ subjective experiences of emerging web-based interventions to better understand the factors shaping recruitment, retention and engagement. By identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators to each stage, we can increase the likelihood of people engaging with the programme within and outside trial settings.</p>
              <p>For this purpose we built in a nested qualitative study into an online feasibility trial of Enhanced Relapse Prevention (ERPonline) for BD (trial registration number: <ext-link xlink:href="56908625" ext-link-type="isrctn">ISRCTN56908625</ext-link>).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Participants who received ERPonline were invited to interview, as they were able to provide feedback on multiple aspects of the feasibility trial; both user views of the intervention, and the research process. ERPonline is a self-directed web-based intervention to help people develop a coherent working model of their mood changes, recognise and manage triggers and early warning signs (EWS), and develop effective coping strategies (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Although ERPonline is an unsupported intervention, participants were able to submit technical support queries and potential contributions to a ‘frequently asked questions’ page via the website. The main study was a single blind randomised-controlled trial (RCT). Participants (n<italic toggle="yes">=</italic>96) were randomly allocated to receive access to ERPonline for 12 months, or to a waitlist control (WLC) arm. Both arms received treatment as usual throughout, and the WLCs were given access to ERPonline when the trial ended. Observer-rated assessments were conducted by research assistants via telephone every 12 weeks from baseline to 48 weeks, with additional online self-report questionnaires every 24 weeks. Participants were also contacted by an unblinded member of the team 2 weeks prior to each follow-up assessment being due, to facilitate retention and allow participants to raise any questions or concerns they had about the trial.

                <p>In the trial, inclusion criteria were (1) research diagnosis of BD 1 or 2 assessed using the Structured Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID);<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> (2) telephone and internet access, (3) ability to understand written and spoken English, (4) at least three lifetime relapses, one within the previous 2 years, and (5) aged 18 years or over. During online consent for the trial, all participants in the intervention arm (n=46) were invited to take part in a qualitative interview about their experiences. Purposive sampling of those who agreed was used to capture a balance of gender, age and amount of time spent on the ERPonline website. Nineteen people were interviewed.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>A member of the research team (MG) conducted all the topic-guided qualitative interviews by telephone. The topic guide<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was created by the research team with support from the service user reference group (SURG), who also helped refine the phrasing and flow of questions and prompts through pilot interviews. The topic guide provided structure to the interviews, while allowing some flexibility to manage the flow of the interview and raise new issues where appropriate. Interviews covered the following: participation in research; barriers and facilitators to using ERPonline; and reflections on using online support. Participants were given a £10 shopping voucher as a thank you.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed using indexing and charting methods inspired by framework analysis, chosen for its structured approach to reordering and analysing data as the study was nested in an evaluation of a novel intervention, with specific issues to explore.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Initially, all transcripts were independently read by the interviewer (MG) and a second member of the research team in order to develop a tentative coding frame with thematic headings. The themes were a blend of a priori research interests (related to the direction provided by the topic guide) and thoughts/ideas that had arisen in the interviews. Preliminary codes were tested on a small number of transcripts and were then were checked by SURG to help establish the validity of the teams’ interpretation of the transcript.</p>
                <p>After addressing feedback from SURG, the coding frame and themes were agreed and the team began applying it to the transcripts. Data were summarised into individual thematic tables, helping the team to focus on key information and patterns in the data. Where necessary, themes were refined as the analysis proceeded and divergent data were captured.</p>

              <title>Findings</title>
              <p>Interviews lasted between 22 min and 88 min. Our findings are structured around the following key themes: the experiences of taking part in the research—in particular the barriers and facilitators to both recruitment and retention; engagement with the ERPonline website; who ERPonline should be aimed at; the likely positive changes that may come from using the site, and the role such an online intervention can have in broader mental health services. These themes are elaborated in detail below.</p>

                  <title>Retention</title>
                  <p>Key facilitators for high retention were positive human contact from researchers, and trusting that the intervention and trial protocol had been developed by people with relevant expertise and lived experience.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This human contact would not have featured in a completely online trial using only self-report measures, and should not be underestimated as it may explain higher retention rates compared with online trials without researcher contact.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Facilitators are elaborated in more depth here.</p>
                  <p>Intrinsic motivators included commitment to continuing the process and a sense of ERPonline potentially being helpful for themselves and others.</p>

                  <p>Reward was another facilitator. While several participants said they were pleased to have been allocated to the treatment arm, many acknowledged this did not matter as the WLC design ensured they would have access afterwards anyway (notably, retention was higher in the WLC arm in the trial).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Participants also appreciated the shopping vouchers given after follow-up assessments.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>While acknowledging vouchers were pleasant, convenience and flexibility appeared to be more important facilitators. Researchers arranged follow-up assessments in the evenings where necessary. User-centred arrangements allowed people to integrate participation into their daily routines with relative ease.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">There were no problems as such because the interviews were timed to my, you know, when it was convenient for me[…]having both e-mail and telephone communication was good it meant that I could say when I was free.’ </italic>(Participant 7).</p>

                  <p>Three people commented that telephone interviews were preferable to face-to-face due to ease of setting up, and feeling more comfortable answering sensitive questions without an interviewer physically present. Many participants felt the interviews were routine due to having a long history of being ‘out’ as bipolar and of divulging personal experiences to research and/or to mental health professionals.</p>
                  <p>For some, interviews could be seen as helpful:</p>

                    <p><italic toggle="yes">‘…I find every time I do an interview like that or a questionnaire it does help me focus which is usually quite helpful and just summarise for myself, right this is how I’ve been the last few months, this is how I am now.

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>However, there were comments about extensive, repetitive and time-consuming data collection. Past experience with clinical and research assessments may have made this less of a barrier. This raises the question of whether the trial design suited those who had been more recently diagnosed and had less experience of research.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>One participant reported difficulty remembering mood experiences between follow-ups, and three forgot appointments. Reminder emails and general communication were practical and appreciated.</p>

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Mood was a barrier to engaging with follow-up assessments. Three participants found assessments challenging or ‘emotionally draining’.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p><italic toggle="yes"><italic toggle="yes">‘</italic>It was a little uncomfortable at times but that’s because they’re uncomfortable experiences really.

                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>While it did not jeopardise their ongoing participation, one participant questioned whether it may prove difficult for people who find it triggering to revisit experiences, or were having significant mood symptoms. As such, it is important to bear in mind the sensitive nature of assessments about mood that can seem routine for some, but triggering for others, in all trials.</p>

                  <p>Participants typically had a long clinical history. Most had not used an online intervention before, but had used the internet for finding information and forums. The majority felt that ERPonline offered a more tailored, comprehensive and interactive approach by comparison.</p>

                  <p>Many people mentioned having had previous psychological therapy and felt that these approaches were helpful. ERPonline was perceived as maintaining and reinforcing usual care, and participants recognised that it could be easily integrated. A key finding reported elsewhere<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> was that online should not replace face-to-face support; this concern has been raised with other digital interventions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, four participants expressed preference for aspects of ERPonline; personal control of the frequency and timing of engagement, and not contending with interpersonal dynamics, waiting lists or large case loads. Three participants specifically said they had shared ERPonline with their psychiatrist or care coordinator. Others were prompted to seek treatment due to using the website, raising an important question about whether service use increases by using online interventions, or whether services are accessed more quickly, reducing further usage down the line:</p>

                <title>Recruitment, retention and engagement</title>
                <p>Participants in this study were describing their experiences of taking part in the ERPonline trial and generally spoke favourably about the trial design, which was conducted via telephone and internet.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Online trials offer low cost evaluation of interventions, but it is important to consider both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators for participating. For this group, who were generally high functioning and recruited mostly outside of mental health services despite reporting high past usage, these were convenience and flexibility, reward, improving mental health, and a desire to help others and to be part of a community. Human contact as part of the experience was crucial. Barriers were extensive follow-up assessments, forgetting appointments, difficulties remembering past mood and current mood.</p>
                <p>Perceived strengths of the ERPonline website design included ease of navigation and use, interactivity, and relevant, comprehensive content. The opportunity to develop individualised staying well plans and mood charts, and specific focus on bipolar, supported the feeling of personal relevance.</p>
                <p>Perceived lack of technical and emotional support was a barrier, again highlighting the need for human contact. Appearance and content were not universally liked. Some found the depth of information superficial and lacking novelty, while many participants found it useful and enlightening. There was some discrepancy over whether ERPonline was purely an information source versus an interactive, personalised intervention. This highlights the range of mixed perspectives and preferences.</p>
                <p>Opinion also differed on when ERPonline should be offered, to whom and alongside what. Different views and ways of using ERPonline emphasise the importance of personalisation and choice in online interventions to meet diverse needs and preferences. Needs are likely to be different depending on stage of illness. Also, developers should make the targets of the intervention more transparent.</p>

                <title>What did ERPonline change?</title>
                <p>ERPonline resulted in more positive models of BD and EWS monitoring,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> highlighting that trials should evaluate impact on mechanisms as well as outcomes. These outcomes were elaborated here. Many participants reported that ERPonline brought about a sense of well-being through feeling less isolated, increased confidence, being proactive about engaging in self-management and seeking treatment. Enhanced well-being and self-efficacy, and decreased internalised stigma, are potentially important outcomes for future trials. Participants noted overlap with existing coping strategies and care planning, and potential for integration with routine services, meaning interventions like this may be good for reinforcing existing support.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Participants from the WLC arm were not interviewed, although questionnaire data collected online and reported elsewhere showed similar views regarding online trial designs and the need for web interventions to enhance rather than replace face-to-face services.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p>
                <p>The current sample was mostly recruited online, had low relapse throughout,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and none of the participants had dropped out of the trial when they were interviewed, although at least four had used the website very little or not at all (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). It is likely that, as in the Bipolar Education Programme trial,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> non-adherence will be higher in those recruited from a clinical setting or experiencing more severe mood disruption.</p>
                <p>As this was purposeful qualitative research within the context of a feasibility trial, not an exploration of an undefined or unknown experience, framework analysis was used. This can be seen as constraining the data. However, interviews were topic guided, allowing the researchers to explore emerging ideas (which would not be achieved from a survey).</p>

              <title>Clinical implications</title>
              <p>These findings are from a feasibility trial of one web-based intervention for BD, yet in line with a systematic review of barriers and facilitators to using mental health interventions online,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> this study highlighted several important factors to bear in mind when designing online interventions and the trials to evaluate them.</p>
              <p>There were individual preferences in look and feel, and strong indications that online interventions need to be interactive, trustworthy and embedded in a broader social relationship. A diversity of approach is required to give people choice and a range of options to allow them to meet their own needs. Given heterogeneity about what people want and when they want it, and evidence that people can view digital interventions as irrelevant to their individual needs,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> digital interventions could offer personalised pathways. Meaningful co-production would help with this, as well as alleviate issues of trust.</p>
              <p>It is vital to ensure that web interventions are appropriately resourced. Technical and non-technical support is important to uphold accessibility, motivate people to engage and ensure use is part of a broader support package. This could be done by involving healthcare professionals or engaging peer supporters, as is being done in the online Relatives Education And Coping Toolkit trial.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p>
              <p>It is difficult to track and encourage usage of online interventions, where there is no expectation to attend face-to-face sessions. It is unclear if motivation to engage would be present without human contact, and there is already evidence that people are using online interventions for less time in the real world.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It may be that people are more likely to stop using web interventions if expectations are disappointed. The importance of investigating ‘hypothetical acceptability’ prior to use has been highlighted and is an important consideration for future trials.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

                <title>Future directions</title>
                <p>These findings have broad implications for how to develop, evaluate and implement digital interventions. Future research needs to address several important questions. What is the best way to present information to maximise acceptability and accessibility for a broad range of people? What level of usage is most effective and how can users be supported to engage at that level? How can professionals and other supporters be involved in supporting digital interventions, and where do these fit into healthcare? These questions are important given the growing number of digital interventions for mental health conditions that are currently under development.</p>
