                  <p>To determine whether the Growth Assessment Protocol (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content>), as implemented in the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">DESiGN</styled-content> trial, is cost‐effective in terms of antenatal detection of small‐for‐gestational‐age (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content>) neonate, when compared with standard care.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was an incremental cost‐effectiveness analysis undertaken from the perspective of a <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">UK</styled-content> National Health Service hospital provider. Thirteen maternity units from England, <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">UK</styled-content>, were recruited to the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">DESiGN</styled-content> (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">DEtection</styled-content> of Small for <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GestatioNal</styled-content> age fetus) trial, a cluster randomized controlled trial. Singleton, non‐anomalous pregnancies which delivered after 24 + 0 gestational weeks between November 2015 and February 2019 were analyzed. Probabilistic decision modeling using clinical trial data was undertaken. The main outcomes of the study were the expected incremental cost, the additional number of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content> neonates identified antenatally and the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">ICER</styled-content>) (cost per additional <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content> neonate identified) of implementing <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content>. Secondary analysis focused on the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">ICER</styled-content> per infant quality‐adjusted life year (<styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">QALY</styled-content>) gained.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The expected incremental cost (including hospital care and implementation costs) of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> over standard care was £34 559 per 1000 births, with a 68% probability that implementation of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> would be associated with increased costs to sustain program delivery. <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> identified an additional 1.77 <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content> neonates per 1000 births (55% probability of it being more clinically effective). The <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">ICER</styled-content> for <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> was £19 525 per additional <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content> neonate identified, with a 44% probability that <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> would both increase cost and identify more <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content> neonates compared with standard care. The probability of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> being the dominant clinical strategy was low (11%). The expected incremental cost per infant <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">QALY</styled-content> gained ranged from £68 242 to £545 940, depending on assumptions regarding the <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">QALY</styled-content> value of detection of <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">SGA</styled-content>.</p>

                  <p>The economic case for replacing standard care with <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GAP</styled-content> is weak based on the analysis reported in our study.

                <p>The Growth Assessment Protocol (GAP), as implemented in the DESiGN (DEtection of Small for GestatioNal age fetus) trial, is expected to cost an additional £34 559 per 1000 births. In terms of cost‐effectiveness, it is most likely that GAP is both more clinically effective and more costly than standard care (44% probability), while the chances of it being both more clinically effective and less costly are low.</p>

                  <bold>What are the clinical implications of this work?</bold>
                </p>
                <p>When implemented as it was in sites recruited to the DESiGN trial, the economic case for replacing standard care with GAP to improve antenatal detection of small‐for‐gestational age and stillbirth is weak.</p>

                <title>Resource utilization</title>
                <p>Data for all significant antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal activities were collected from the EPRs (Appendix <xref rid="uog26022-supitem-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Costs were calculated by multiplying units of activity by the unit cost. The costs were then summed to obtain antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal and neonatal subtotals and a total cost for each birth was calculated.</p>
                <p>For estimating resource use during the antenatal period, data from ultrasound scans and antenatal inpatient admissions were generally available. Data from antenatal appointments and unscheduled outpatient attendances were missing either completely or partially (but systematically) for five of the six standard‐care sites. To maximize the number of clusters available for antenatal cost analysis, these resource items were excluded from the base‐case analysis. This pragmatic decision was guided by the hypothesis that the main cost impact of GAP would most likely arise from an increased number of scans. The effect of excluding these data was explored further by sensitivity analysis. The primary economic analysis was subsequently carried out using nine cluster sites for antenatal costs (standard care, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 5; intervention, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4), as one site in each trial arm did not contribute data on antenatal hospital admissions. Unlike antenatal care costs, subsequent costs were expected to vary according to screening outcome but not treatment arm. They were, therefore, included without stratification according to treatment arm, and all 13 sites contributed data to calculate intrapartum costs. Due to the limited availability of data, only nine sites were used to calculate postnatal costs (standard care, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3; intervention, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6) and 11 sites were used to calculate neonatal costs (standard care, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4; intervention, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 7).</p>
                <p>Data on activities relevant to GAP implementation were also collected. Information on the number and type of staff members employed was collected from the clinical leads at each site. The number of staff members from each professional group (doctors, midwives and sonographers) who attended the site‐wide training launches was obtained from the intervention provider. The time taken to complete each training type was estimated as the median time reported by participants in semi‐structured interviews conducted during the trial process evaluation<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. The fee charged by the GAP provider, including a one‐off set‐up cost of £500 and an annual cost that differed according to the expected annual birth rate at each site, was also included (Appendix <xref rid="uog26022-supitem-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). No evidence was found during interviews that the generation or use of GAP fetal growth charts had changed the expected antenatal clinic appointment duration (midwives or sonographers were still expected to see the same number of women during a session, even if this incurred a loss of rest breaks). Therefore, the costs for these activities were not included.</p>

These outputs were then used to evaluate the probability of four possible conclusions regarding the data: (1) GAP is associated with lower cost of care and more true‐positive cases of SGA (GAP is the ‘dominant’ clinical strategy); (2) GAP is associated with higher cost and more true‐positive SGA cases (a trade‐off); (3) GAP is associated with higher cost and fewer true‐positive SGA cases (standard care is ‘dominant’); or (4) GAP is associated with lower cost and fewer true‐positive SGA cases (a trade‐off). If the second conclusion held true, we planned to estimate the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) for GAP, i.e. the expected incremental cost per additional true‐positive SGA neonate identified.</p>

Cluster summary values for the proportion of births expected to be SGA and non‐SGA were based on the unadjusted mean value for site clusters.</p>
                <p>For input parameters that are potentially subject to a treatment effect of GAP (proportion of SGA or non‐SGA births in which SGA was detected antenatally and antenatal costs according to screening outcome), the two sites allocated to GAP that did not attempt implementation (as per the main trial analysis<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>) were excluded. Linear regression models were fitted to cluster summary values and used to generate probability distributions for each treatment allocation; for screening outcomes expressed as cluster‐level proportions, a linear regression model was fitted to the logit transformation of the observed outcome, with a retransformation to obtain the predicted proportion in order to avoid deriving predictions with implausible values. Linear predictions according to treatment allocation were also adjusted for trial baseline outcomes (derived from births during the pre‐implementation phase) for each site cluster and a trial stratification variable. Monte‐Carlo simulation was used to obtain 10 000 random draws from a multivariate normal distribution of linear predictions according to treatment allocation with adjustments made to predictions using the Cholesky decomposition method to account for correlation between regression parameters<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>.</p>

Probability distributions were parameterized using the relevant cluster summary data. In all cases, the selection of an appropriate distribution was guided by the need to generate a plausible range of parameter values (i.e. cost per birth constrained to be ≥ 0 and SGA/non‐SGA proportions bounded by the values 0 and 1).</p>

                <p>To aid interpretation of our findings, a secondary analysis was performed to recalibrate the antenatal detection of SGA births into neonate quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) gains arising from prevention of stillbirth. QALYs are the accepted outcome metric for establishing whether new healthcare technologies are a cost‐effective use of NHS resources<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>. These values were combined with our existing model to determine whether the incremental cost and QALY implications associated with GAP satisfied the cost‐effectiveness criteria currently used by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to guide NHS resource allocation.

                <p>Clinical trial data were used to determine the baseline incidence of stillbirth among SGA births in which SGA was not detected antenatally. Previous studies have suggested that 50% of stillbirths occurring among cases with undetected SGA could be avoided if SGA were detected<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>, <xref rid="uog26022-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>, <xref rid="uog26022-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>. NICE estimate that prevention of one stillbirth gains 23.73 (range, 15–30) discounted QALYs (applying a discount rate of 3.5%). Combining this evidence, three estimates of the QALY benefit per SGA birth detected antenatally were derived and applied in our secondary analysis: a ‘central’ estimate (assuming that 50% of stillbirths linked to undetected SGA are prevented with 23.73 QALYs gained per stillbirth avoided); a ‘high’ (and highly optimistic) estimate (all stillbirths prevented, 30 QALYs gained); and a ‘low’ estimate (25% of stillbirths prevented, 15 QALYs gained).</p>
                <p>As an extension of our secondary analysis, a conditional incremental net benefit (INB) analysis was also performed<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>. This was used to assess whether a cost‐effective rate of antenatal detection of SGA under GAP is likely to be achievable given a plausible distribution of values for this parameter extracted from the trial data. The analysis was repeated under the varying assumptions regarding the QALY value of detecting a SGA birth antenatally, as described above. To implement the conditional INB analysis, the QALY benefit of early detection was monetized and assessed according to the NICE cost‐effectiveness threshold. Subtracting incremental monetized benefits from the incremental costs gave the INB of GAP. If INB &gt; 0, then GAP was considered cost‐effective at the chosen threshold level, which was the lower value of £20 000 per QALY gained, preferred by NICE. The INB was estimated at varying levels of the SGA detection rate corresponding to the deciles within the distribution for this parameter. All other parameters were varied probabilistically (as described earlier).</p>

              <p>The expected clinical benefit of GAP in terms of antenatal detection of SGA, as observed in the DESiGN trial, was marginal. An additional 1.77 SGA cases were detected per 1000 births (55% probability that GAP would increase antenatal detection compared with standard care). The ICER for GAP using the primary SGA definition was £19 525 per additional SGA neonate identified, with a 44% probability that GAP would increase the total cost of care and be clinically beneficial compared with standard care. There was only an 11% probability that GAP would be superior to standard practice in terms of cost‐effectiveness, a 24% probability that standard care would be dominant and a 21% probability that GAP would reduce the total cost but would detect fewer SGA cases antenatally (Figure <xref rid="uog26022-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

                <p>The use of the secondary definition of SGA (SGA defined by customized centiles in GAP implementing clusters and by population centiles in standard‐care clusters) led to a reduction in the total incremental cost of GAP, to £30 861 per 1000 births, and a small increase in the expected number of additional SGA babies identified antenatally, to 2.52 per 1000 births. The ICER for GAP using the secondary SGA definition was £12 246 per additional case identified. Probability values were close to those observed in the primary analysis, with a 45% probability that GAP would increase the total cost of care but would be clinically beneficial, a 10% probability that GAP would be dominant, a 20% probability that standard care would be dominant and a 25% probability that GAP would reduce the total cost but would detect fewer SGA cases antenatally.</p>
                <p>An uplift applied separately for antenatal appointments and unscheduled attendance costs had little impact on the total incremental cost of GAP (Appendix <xref rid="uog26022-supitem-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>).</p>

QALY‐based ICERs ranged from £68 242 to £545 940 per QALY gained, depending on the assumptions adopted. Using the primary definition of SGA, GAP achieved a cost‐effective rate of antenatal detection only when adopting the high‐level assumptions regarding the QALY value of antenatal detection and only when the rate of detection exceeded 41.5% under GAP, which was on the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile within the distribution for this parameter (Figure <xref rid="uog26022-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

Deciles from the expected distribution of SGA detection rate are represented by circles. Cost‐effectiveness, defined by INB, was determined using the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence cost‐effectiveness threshold, based on low (<inline-graphic xlink:href="UOG-60-620-g005.jpg" xlink:title="image"/>), central (<inline-graphic xlink:href="UOG-60-620-g003.jpg" xlink:title="image"/>) and high (<inline-graphic xlink:href="UOG-60-620-g001.jpg" xlink:title="image"/>) estimates of quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. INB &gt; 0 implies that the gains in QALY from improved SGA detection outweigh the additional cost associated with GAP (i.e. GAP is cost‐effective compared with standard care), while INB &lt; 0 implies that GAP offers poor value for money compared with standard care. The graph illustrates the rate of SGA detection that GAP would need to achieve to be a cost‐effective alternative to standard care and the statistical likelihood of such a rate. Overall, it suggests that the rate of SGA detection required to generate a cost‐effective outcome for GAP (INB &gt; 0) is unlikely.</p>

              <sec id="uog26022-sec-0027">
                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>This cost‐effectiveness analysis, based on data from sites recruited into the DESiGN trial, suggests that the adoption of GAP in place of standard care would (on average) increase costs to NHS providers while offering only marginal clinical benefit. After full consideration of the margins of uncertainty around economic and clinical parameters of relevance, the expected incremental cost of GAP was estimated to be £34 559 per 1000 births, although some uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of this effect (68% probability that the incremental cost of GAP would be positive and 32% probability that GAP would reduce the costs). Overall, 31% of the expected incremental cost of GAP was attributable to implementation of the program. Compared with other estimated resource effects, these costs are least affected by sampling uncertainty inherent to a clinical trial. There was no convincing evidence that GAP was the dominant clinical strategy in terms of cost‐effectiveness (11% probability that it would reduce costs while also increasing the rate of SGA detection). Taking into account sampling error in the trial data, GAP allowed only marginal expected clinical gains, at an additional cost, at the NHS sites that participated in the trial. A secondary analysis revealed no convincing evidence that GAP provided a cost‐effective alternative to standard care within participating clusters when applying to our findings a cost‐effectiveness threshold routinely adopted by the NHS.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The main strength of our study is that the evaluation was based on resource‐use data recorded routinely during clinical practice. It is therefore likely to offer a reliable assessment of the impact of GAP implementation on hospital resources within the study sites randomized to the program. GAP was compared with current standard practice, rather than with absence of care. Therefore, the findings reflect the expected increase in cost associated with implementing GAP compared with current practice (analysis method recommended by NICE)<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>.</p>
                <p>One limitation of our study is the adopted time horizon. Estimates of cost were restricted to those incurred by the NHS provider until the end of the care episode that included birth. We did not account for infant and adult healthcare costs due to morbidity associated with preterm or early term birth that may follow SGA detection or intermediate and long‐term health or social costs associated with prevention of stillbirth, including any costs of litigation (estimates have been published previously)<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>.</p>
                <p>We were also limited by the availability and quality of data collected from some clusters. One site implementing GAP was excluded from some analyses because it could not provide data on true‐negative and false‐positive SGA diagnoses. Hospital administrative data were missing entirely or could not be used for two sites allocated to standard care and were missing partially (but systematically) for some resource items at three of the remaining standard‐care clusters. Exclusion of scheduled and unscheduled antenatal hospital appointments or day attendances because of these missing data had only a small effect on ICER, as shown by the sensitivity analysis. In all clusters, we were unable to distinguish between women who had absence of an activity recorded because it had occurred elsewhere, those who had not undergone the activity anywhere and those who underwent the activity, but without it being recorded. We introduced assumptions to which plausible limits were applied to deal with this issue.</p>
                <p>Another limitation is the choice of primary SGA definition based on both population and customized weight charts. Using this definition, false‐positive screening outcomes were defined in approximately 5% of babies<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> that met criteria for SGA at birth according to either the customized or the population chart, but not according to both chart types. A sensitivity analysis that adopted an SGA definition that would be more likely to be applied in routine clinical settings (SGA defined by customized centiles in GAP clusters and by population centiles in standard‐care clusters) produced a lower ICER (£12 246 per SGA baby detected correctly) with comparable estimates of uncertainty around observing alternative cost‐effectiveness outcomes. As also demonstrated in the analysis using the primary SGA definition, application of the secondary SGA definition showed that GAP would have delivered a cost‐effective outcome when judged against a routinely applied cost‐effectiveness threshold used in NHS decision‐making only if an unlikely combination of assumptions was built into the analysis.</p>
                <p>Finally, the findings and implications of this economic evaluation are applicable only to healthcare systems that have similar resource availability and national protocols to those of the clusters included within the DESiGN
trial.</p>

                <title>Interpretation</title>
                <p>The cost‐effectiveness of GAP has not been studied previously. The GAP provider conducted a cost‐benefit analysis in which the effect of increasing the frequency of fetal growth scans for women at high risk of SGA was studied<xref rid="uog26022-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>. Based on estimates regarding the relationship between SGA detection and infant outcome (prevention of one stillbirth per 1000 births, £20 000 per 1000 births saved due to reduced neonatal admissions, £25 000 per 1000 births saved due to reduction in the rate of cerebral palsy and £70 000 per 1000 births saved due to reduced litigation rate), this analysis predicted cost savings of £120 000 per 1000 births, which was attributed to fewer neonatal admissions and lower rates of perinatal morbidity, mortality, cerebral palsy and litigation. Our analysis differed in scope, as we did not consider costs of litigation or long‐term outcomes and drew on data generated from a ‘gold‐standard’ research design linked directly to the implementation of GAP within NHS maternity settings. These differences between their analysis and ours may explain the discrepancies in findings. Whilst we acknowledge that improved SGA detection is expected to reduce both stillbirth and long‐term disability related to fetal brain injury, the DESiGN trial found only marginal differences in rates of SGA detection with GAP implementation, and these differences were not statistically significant.</p>
                <p>Our economic evaluation is not supportive of GAP providing a cost‐effective improvement to care processes aimed at prevention of stillbirth. The expectation based on evidence from this evaluation is that it will increase the costs of hospital care and require an ongoing resource commitment in terms of staff training and software licensing. These additional costs need to be balanced against the small expected incremental clinical benefit that GAP may offer compared with standard care. We estimated that, even with highly optimistic (and arguably unrealistic) assumptions regarding preventable numbers of stillborn infants arising from early detection, the QALY value of stillbirth prevention linked to these small clinical gains would be of insufficient magnitude to justify the costs when judged against cost‐effectiveness thresholds used in NHS decision‐making. It is likely that this conclusion would have been strengthened if our analysis had included long‐term NHS costs and impact on QALYs arising from stillbirth prevention and iatrogenic preterm birth. Other long‐term cost‐ and QALY‐related benefits that it has been claimed are linked to the early detection of SGA birth (e.g. prevention of litigation costs, perinatal morbidity and long‐term developmental disorders) would need to be substantial to offset our core findings. This seems unlikely, given the low additional rates of antenatal detection observed using GAP in this study.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>The economic case for replacing standard care with GAP is weak based on the analysis and evidence reported herein. This conclusion should be viewed taking into account that cost‐effectiveness analyses are always limited by the assumptions made, and our study is no different.</p>
