              <abstract id="Abs1">
                <p id="Par1">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodelling. Measuring this activity provides an opportunity to develop tools capable of identifying individuals at-risk of progression. Longitudinal change in markers of ECM synthesis was assessed in 145 newly-diagnosed individuals with IPF.</p>
                <p id="Par2">Serum levels of collagen synthesis neoepitopes, PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 (collagen type 3 and 6), were elevated in IPF compared with controls at baseline, and progressive disease versus stable disease during follow up, (PRO-C3 <italic>p</italic>Â &lt;â€‰0.001; PRO-C6 <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.029). Assessment of rate of change in neoepitope levels from baseline to 3â€‰months (defined as â€˜slope to month 3â€™: HIGH slope, slopeâ€‰&gt;â€‰0 vs. LOW slope, slopeâ€‰&lt;â€‰=0) demonstrated no relationship with mortality for these markers (PRO-C3 (HR 1.62, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.080); PINP (HR 0.76, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.309); PRO-C6 (HR 1.14, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.628)). As previously reported, rising concentrations of collagen degradation markers C1M, C3M, C6M and CRPM were associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (HRâ€‰=â€‰1.84, CI 1.03â€“3.27, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.038, HRâ€‰=â€‰2.44, CI 1.39â€“4.31, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.002; HRâ€‰=â€‰2.19, CI 1.25â€“3.82, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.006; HRâ€‰=â€‰2.13 CI 1.21â€“3.75, <italic>p</italic>Â =â€‰0.009 respectively).</p>
                <p id="Par3">Elevated levels of PRO-C3 and PRO-C6 associate with IPF disease progression. Collagen synthesis and degradation biomarkers have the potential to enhance clinical trials in IPF and may inform prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision making in the clinic.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par23">Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal condition with a dismal untreated prognosis and despite the approval of two anti-fibrotic therapies remains a major clinical challenge. At present there are no available measures for stratifying individuals with IPF to specific therapies nor, importantly, to determine response to therapy. Furthermore, although forced vital capacity (FVC) is accepted as a regulatory end-point in clinical trials, the relative insensitivity of physiological measures to change in fibrosis necessitates studies with a minimum duration of 52â€‰weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers for various aspects of disease behaviour in IPF; particularly those that detect individuals at greater risk of progression and which stratify individuals into better defined endotypes (as a path to enabling effective targeting of therapies to individuals most likely to benefit).</p>
              <p id="Par24">Excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is central to the pathogenesis of IPF. The production, deposition and remodelling of collagen, a major component of ECM, is a dynamic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In healthy lung, there is a balance between degradation and synthesis of collagen and other ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which is disturbed in the lungs of individuals with fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During collagen turnover, distinct peptides are generated as by-products of both collagen breakdown and synthesis. The pro-peptide of pro-collagen is cleaved before collagen is incorporated into the matrix. This results in the release of unique fragments for each individual form of collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similarly, during degradation, specific metalloproteases (MMPs) cleave collagen fibres revealing distinct neo-epitopes. Both synthesis peptides and cleavage neo-epitopes are released into the circulation and can be detected in the blood.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We have previously demonstrated, in subjects recruited to the PROFILE (Prospective Observation of Fibrosis in the Lung Clinical Endpoints) study, that serum levels of neoepitopes are higher in individuals with IPF when compared with healthy age-matched controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that longitudinal changes in serum concentrations of several neo-epitopes track with progression of fibrosis and, by three months, can predict mortality in individuals with IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the current study, we assessed collagen formation markers for their prognostic utility in IPF in a separate cohort of individuals recruited into the PROFILE study. We also compared these synthesis markers to their collagen-equivalent degradation neo-epitopes thus enabling assessment of the relationship between synthesis and degradation during IPF progression.</p>

                <p id="Par26">As previously described, the PROFILE study is a prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study that recruited individuals with IPF and fibrotic NSIP from two co-ordinating UK centres; Nottingham and Royal Brompton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Participants were enrolled if they had an incident diagnosis confirmed at multidisciplinary discussion according to international consensus guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The cohort of individuals used in the current study represents a sub-group of 145 participants from PROFILE; none of whom were included in the previous PROFILE study on neo-epitopes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and all of whom had at least 1â€‰year of follow up at the time neoepitope analyses were performed. A total of 50 physician-verified control participants without history of respiratory disease were recruited from primary care clinics. Samples from 20 of these subjects were used in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. All participants provided written informed consent. The PROFILE study is registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, numbers NCT01134822 and NCT01110694. For survival analyses, a censoring date of 1st March 2016 was used.</p>

                  <p id="Par27">Serum samples collected from study participants at baseline, 1, 3, and 6â€‰months, and a single serum sample from controls were stored at âˆ’â€‰80â€‰Â°C until assayed. Study-specific operating procedures for collection of the serum were used to ensure standardisation across both centres. Briefly, blood was collected with anticoagulant free, serum separation tubes, with coated silica as the clot activator (Becton Dickinson, Winnersh, UK). All samples were processed within 2â€‰h of collection. Samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 30â€‰min and serum was then isolated through centrifugation, and aliquoted before freezing.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par30">As previously described, â€˜progressive diseaseâ€™ was defined as â‰¥10% decline in FVC and/or death within 12â€‰months. Missing lung function data were not imputed. Where no lung function data beyond baseline was available and the subject had not died within the relevant period, progression status was adjudicated by the responsible physician, after case note review and blinded to biomarker data at the time of adjudication. A total of 9 subjects were adjudicated for progression: 1 subject was adjudicated to have progressed and 8 were adjudicated as stable.</p>
                <p id="Par31">In cases where biomarker data were below the lower limit of detection, values were imputed to be half the lower limit of detection. Values above the upper limit were conservatively imputed as the upper limit of detection. Imputation rates ranged between 0.9% to below 10% for all markers except C3M that had approximately 19% imputation. Before statistical analysis all biomarkers were transformed (log<sub>10</sub> transformed where the biomarker is treated as response and log<sub>2</sub> where the biomarker is treated as a covariate).</p>
                <p id="Par32">A linear regression model adjusted for gender and age was used to evaluate the association between patient group (healthy controls and IPF subjects) and biomarker values at baseline. Adjusted estimates of group means, 95% CIs and <italic>p</italic>-values of the estimated mean difference are reported. For serial biomarker data, change from baseline for each participant is represented by a gradient on a linear model where the single explanatory variable is the number of months between the baseline visit and subsequent visits using the recorded visit date. We used a linear mixed-effects model (Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM)) to investigate associations between repeated continuous biomarker response and progression status (progression vs stable), visit, visit by progression status (controls are not included in the model). This analysis was adjusted for age, site, gender and smoking status. Unstructured covariance was assumed for all repeated biomarker response values within a participant. Adjusted estimates of biomarker means (95% CIs) by progression status at each visit and <italic>p</italic>-values of the test of mean differences between progression vs. stable at each visit are reported. Apart from biomarker data above or below the limits of quantification, all other missing biomarker data was not imputed and was assumed Missing at Random (MAR) implying that after adjusting for important covariates in the model the missing data was independent of the observed data.</p>
                <p id="Par33">Univariate analysis was conducted to examine the effect of baseline biomarker measures on overall survival. Two separate procedures were used; the Kaplan-Meier method for survival curves and a proportional hazards model to derive Hazard Ratios.</p>
                <p id="Par34">A proportional hazards model was used to evaluate association between time to event (overall survival) as response and continuous biomarker value as a covariate. Similarly, in a separate model, baseline % predicted FVC and separately % predicted DLco were included as covariates. A proportional hazards model was used to evaluate association between time to event (overall survival) as response and biomarker slope as a factor (defined as â€˜slope to month 3â€™: HIGH (rising concentrations, slopeâ€‰&gt;â€‰0) versus LOW (stable or falling concentrations, slopeâ€‰&lt;â€‰=0). Hazard ratios represent either risk of mortality for a 2-fold increase in the biomarker value or risk of mortality in participants with rising neoepitope concentrations relative to those with stable or falling concentrations.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Associations between explanatory variables and endpoints were deemed to be significant at the 5% level. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS (version 9.3) and were independently quality controlled by a second statistician.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par43">Remodelling of extracellular matrix is pivotal to the development and progression of IPF and results in distinct alterations in collagen turnover. In the current study, we measured synthesis markers of three collagens important in the development of IPF; namely collagen type-1 (P1NP), âˆ’â€‰3 (PRO-C3) andâ€‰âˆ’â€‰6 (PRO-C6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given that fibrogenesis in IPF likely reflects an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of collagen, we also measured paired markers of degradation for the same collagens: type-1 (C1M), âˆ’â€‰3 (C3M) andâ€‰âˆ’â€‰6 (C6M). For comparison with our prior observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we also measured degradation of the matrix molecule biglycan (BGM) and C reactive protein (CRPM). Our data demonstrate that synthesis markers for type-3 (PRO-C3) and-6 (PRO-C6) collagen are elevated in subjects with IPF compared with healthy controls and distinguish individuals with progressive disease, suggesting that these biomarkers may reflect underlying pathophysiology driving disease activity in IPF.</p>
              <p id="Par44">Collagen type-3, a fibrillar collagen, forms a major component of the lung interstitial extracellular matrix and is synthesised by activated fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Our findings support earlier studies demonstrating that synthesis of collagen type-3 is increased in IPF, with high levels of type-3 pro-collagen peptide reported in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and lavage fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the case of collagen type-3, the synthesis neoepitope, PRO-C3, appears to be a better biomarker of progressive disease than the paired degradation biomarker, C3M. Interestingly, in subjects with more stable disease, the ratio of PRO-C3 to C3M is significantly lower; supporting the idea that synthesis, and increased turnover in general, may be reflective of active remodelling and disease progression.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Alongside collagen type-3, our data suggest that changes in collagen type-6 are also informative of disease behaviour in IPF and may be an important driver of fibrosis. Collagen type-6 filaments are an integral component found at the interface between the basement membrane and interstitial matrix of the lung, and act as an important network for attachment of basement membranes, collagen fibres and cells. Our results support the importance of this collagen in the development of fibrosis. Previous research suggests that collagen type-6 fragments have signalling properties during wound healing and fibrogenesis and may drive poorer outcomes in fibrotic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Compared with other collagens, type-6 collagen has been shown to be a potent inducer of the differentiation and activation of fibroblasts to highly synthetic myofibroblasts; a key pathway leading to the production of collagen and ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, increased levels of serum collagen type-6 markers have been demonstrated to act as an early predictor of fibrosis in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This evidence, coupled with data from the current study, suggest that collagen type-6 may in itself be a driver of the fibrotic process, which in turn serves as a useful marker of IPF progression.</p>
              <p id="Par46">Intriguingly, whilst increases in collagen type-1 production are associated with TGFÎ²- activation of IPF fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and have been observed in IPF lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], we did not find elevated levels of collagen type 1 synthesis neoeptiopes in the serum of IPF subjects. However, collagen type-1 is also the predominant collagen found in bone and it has been estimated that 90% of the synthesis of this collagen measurable in serum is bone derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This may explain why there was no difference observed in P1NP, the measured marker of collagen type-1 synthesis, between IPF subjects and health controls and why differences were not seen between stable and progressive disease. In contrast to P1NP, the serum degradation marker of collagen type-1, C1M, does not measure bone-derived degradation as the epitope is denatured in bone by osteoclast-released cathepsin K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This disparity in the pools of collagen type-1 being measured may account for the differences observed between this pair of synthesis and degradation neoepitopes.</p>
              <p id="Par47">Consistent with our previous study, baseline levels of C1M, C3M, C6M and CRPM were elevated in subjects with IPF compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, consistent with our prior observations, elevated CRPM distinguished progressive from stable disease from as early as one month after recruitment. In our previous study BGM, C1M, C3M and C6M were also different between individuals with stable and progressive IPF, but these differences only became significant at 6â€‰months. Interestingly, in the current study, the levels of C1M and C6M were significantly higher from 1â€‰month onwards.</p>
              <p id="Par48">Rising levels over 3â€‰months of matrix synthesis markers were not predictive of mortality. This is in distinct contrast with changing levels of the degradation markers CRPM, C1M, C3M and C6M; for each of these markers rising levels over 3â€‰months identified subjects with an increased risk of death. The predictive value of these markers, as shown by the hazard ratios, was consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A changing ratio over 3â€‰months of synthesis and degradation markers for type 6 collagen, PRO-C6:C6M, was also predictive of mortality albeit less strongly than C6M alone especially after adjustment for baseline lung function. It is possible that the different characteristics of the synthesis and degradation markers may reflect the specific location of individual collagens within the fibrotic lung and their susceptibility to degradation as fibrosis progresses. Alternatively, as is likely to be the case for P1NP, other anatomical pools of collagen turnover, including bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], may dilute the serum signal for individual neoepitopes thus limiting their suitability as markers of IPF severity or disease progression.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The absence of reliable and validated short-term measurements that predict disease progression, survival and response to treatment represent a major obstacle in the management of IPF. Physiological measurements, particularly FVC, remain the primary method for monitoring IPF disease progression in both registration clinical trials and clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Whilst changes in lung function are likely to remain a gold standard for assessing IPF progression, there are several short-comings of these measurements. Firstly, they are relatively insensitive to subtle changes in disease severity necessitating measurement over longer timeframes (52â€‰weeks in clinical trials) before disease progression can be reliably determined. Although a recent study has demonstrated that daily home spirometry is predictive of disease progression within 3â€‰months, there are some potential limitations with this method, particularly long-term compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Secondly, current treatments only slow decline in FVC making determination of treatment response in individuals almost impossible. Serum biomarkers, such as those measured in the current study, have the potential to overcome some of these challenges, by providing a minimally invasive, short-term readout that could supplement FVC measurements to give a more reliable assessment of disease progression and response to anti-fibrotic therapy.</p>
              <p id="Par50">We have shown that neoepitopes reflecting collagen synthesis and degradation in IPF are informative of prognosis, are able to distinguish progressive from non-progressive disease and provide a 3-month read out of change in disease severity. The utility of these observations is currently being tested in a randomised placebo control trial of nintedanib in individuals with IPF and preserved lung function (NCT02788474) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. If neo-epitopes can be shown to change with therapy, then these markers may be of use in shortening future clinical trials and for determining response to therapy in the clinic.</p>
              <p id="Par51">A major strength of our study is the prospective longitudinal design, which enabled blood sampling to be standardised and enabled collection of robust outcome data. Furthermore, the PROFILE cohort is representative of real-world patients with IPF and includes many subjects who would not have been enrolled in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As such our findings are more translatable to clinical practice than insights derived from clinical trial cohorts. Furthermore, recruitment of the PROFILE cohort commenced before effective therapy for IPF became available. As such, none of the cohort described in this manuscript were on antifibrotic therapy during the first 12â€‰months of follow up.</p>
              <p id="Par52">The major weakness of this current study is that we undertook analysis of synthesis neoepitopes in a single cohort and did not adhere to a discovery-validation design. However, as PROFILE is the only longitudinal, real-world study that includes treatment-naive patients with multiple biological samples, and without the limitations posed by clinical trial cohorts, that we are aware of, external replication of this study is not currently possible. We feel that this limitation is partially offset by our demonstration that degradation neo-epitopes behave consistently with our previous observations, which were performed in discovery, and validation sample sets. As such we believe that this confirmation of the usefulness of collagen degradation biomarkers provides indirect validation of our findings and supports our conclusions regarding the potential utility of collagen synthesis biomarkers. However, we hope that others will, in future be able to validate the relationships which we have observed between synthesis biomarkers and disease activity and confirm the relevance of ratios of paired collagen synthesis and degradation markers.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par53">This study demonstrates that collagen type-3 and -6 synthesis biomarkers are elevated in individuals with IPF compared with controls and differ in levels between stable and progressive disease. In addition, this study re-confirms the value of a panel of ECM degradation biomarkers that are predictive of disease progression and survival in IPF. This panel of biomarkers provides informative insights into matrix turnover and underlying pathophysiology driving disease progression, which may assist in the development of precision approaches to IPF treatment. Furthermore, the predictive prognostic value of change in these biomarkers is discernible within 3â€‰months, providing much needed short-term measurements to assist the identification of at-risk IPF patients, which could be used to supplement physiological assessment to allow for better disease management through targeted and earlier therapeutic intervention strategies. Further validation of these findings is required in additional real-world cohorts of individuals with IPF and other fibrosing lung diseases.</p>
