                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Return of gastrointestinal (GI) function is fundamental to patient recovery after colorectal surgery and is required before patients can be discharged from hospital safely. Up to 40% of patients suffer delayed return of GI function after colorectal surgery, causing nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, resulting in longer hospital stay. Small, randomised studies have suggested perioperative intravenous (IV) lidocaine, which has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, may accelerate return of GI function after colorectal surgery. The ALLEGRO trial is a pragmatic effectiveness study to assess the benefit of perioperative IV lidocaine in improving return of GI function after elective minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) colorectal surgery.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">United Kingdom (UK) multi-centre double blind placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial in 562 patients undergoing elective minimally invasive colorectal resection. IV lidocaine or placebo will be infused for 6â12âh commencing at the start of surgery as an adjunct to usual analgesic/anaesthetic technique. The primary outcome will be return of GI function.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">A 6â12-h perioperative intravenous infusion of 2% lidocaine is a cheap addition to usual anaesthetic/analgesic practice in elective colorectal surgery with a low incidence of adverse side-effects. If successful in achieving quicker return of gut function for more patients, it would reduce the rate of postoperative ileus and reduce the duration of inpatient recovery, resulting in reduced pain and discomfort with faster recovery and discharge from hospital. Since colorectal surgery is a common procedure undertaken in every acute hospital in the UK, a reduced length of stay and reduced rate of postoperative ileus would accrue significant cost savings for the National Health Service (NHS).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par51">Approximately 30,000 patients per year undergo colonic surgery in the UK. Discharge from hospital after colectomy is inextricably linked to recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function. Surgery to remove part of the colon and/or rectum causes unavoidable interruption of normal gut propulsive contraction, and almost no patients are discharged from hospital before GI function recovers. With modern care, most patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy are independently mobile, requiring no or minimal analgesia, and free from intravenous fluids and invasive monitoring (e.g. urinary catheters) within 48â72âh. However, less than half will have regained GI function by this time point, and 10â20% will go on to suffer substantial delay to return of GI function (aka postoperative ileus) characterised by nausea, vomiting, complete constipation and abdominal distension. This pathophysiology is complex and involves interaction of endogenous factors (including pain pathways, host endocrine- and inflammation-mediated stress responses, exaggerated sympathetic autonomic activity and endogenous opioids) and exogenous factors (bowel handling during surgery, opioid analgesics, anaesthetic agents, immobility). Usually self-limiting, it prolongs hospital stay by a few days in most cases but can last up to 10âdays if severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Affected patients cannot tolerate oral intake due to nausea and vomiting and require inpatient support with intravenous fluids and ongoing opioid analgesia. Although GI transit is absent, digestive fluid continues to be secreted but not absorbed (bile, gastric acid, pancreatic enzymes) causing vomiting, dehydration and progressive abdominal distension. Many patients require decompression of the fluid-distended gut by insertion of a nasogastric tube, a very uncomfortable experience that some patients rate the worst part of their postoperative recovery. Furthermore, in an increasingly elderly and frail population, postoperative ileus can contribute to development of other major complications including pulmonary aspiration, pneumonia and acute kidney impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the previous era of open colorectal surgery, many surgeons regarded delayed return of gut function as a ânormalâ part of a prolonged post-operative recovery. Accordingly, the true prevalence was seldom recorded; best estimates suggest it affected up to 40% of cases. However, in the last decade, minimally invasive surgical techniques (laparoscopic and robotic âkey-holeâ surgery) and evidence-based âEnhanced Recoveryâ perioperative management care pathways have reduced average length of hospital stay from 9âdays to 4â6âdays and have of themselves reduced the prevalence of delayed return of gut function. The success of these techniques in accelerating recovery has highlighted that delayed return of GI function has become the main barrier to discharge for a significant proportion of minimally invasive colectomy patients.</p>
                <p id="Par52">There is no specific therapy for postoperative ileus; treatment is supportive until GI function returns spontaneously. Alvimopan (EnteregÂ®) is a selective Î¼-opioid receptor antagonist evaluated in a number of North American randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where it has been shown to be of benefit in reducing incidence of postoperative ileus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, it has not gained widespread use due to cost and concerns regarding its cardiac side-effect profile and is not licensed for use in the UK.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Lidocaine, familiar as a local anaesthetic, has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects when administered systemically by intravenous (IV) infusion and hence has been repurposed as an anaesthetic adjunct in abdominal surgery. Studies in various surgical procedures have shown reduced early postoperative pain scores and reduced opioid analgesia requirements. There also seems to be a consistent benefit on measures of GI function recovery, including time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, postoperative nausea and risk of postoperative ileus. However, the limitation of meta-analysis in this area is the considerable heterogeneity of studies included: a variety of surgical procedures, a mix of open and laparoscopic techniques, inconsistent lidocaine dose/treatment duration, inconsistent perioperative management protocols and study endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are only three published RCTs of intravenous lidocaine in laparoscopic colectomy, comprising a total of 181 patients. Two were conducted in Europe and reported length of stay consistent with modern NHS practice (3 to 5 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Both studies reported reduced analgesic requirements, faster return of gut function and a 1-day reduction in median length of stay. The third study was conducted in South Korea and found a trend towards faster GI recovery but no statistically significant benefit. However, perioperative management practices were not consistent with NHS norms and the excessive median length of stay of 9 days makes this study difficult to interpret [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par54">There is some controversy in the use of perioperative IV lidocaine. Although it has many advocates in the anaesthetic community, there is a risk of fatal toxicity in overdose. The dose and duration of IV lidocaine used in ALLEGRO is at the lower threshold of the known therapeutic range; the greatest risk of toxicity is from human error in drug administration. Although guidelines for use of IV lidocaine were published recently (subsequent to the start of the ALLEGRO study), an accompanying editorial was not supportive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As emphasised in the ensuing journal correspondence, there is scant randomised evidence from large trials, and ALLEGRO is the only adequately powered trial of IV lidocaine currently recruiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">Intravenous lidocaine is cheap, familiar and easy to administer within existing NHS perioperative practice. If effective in improving return of GI function postoperatively it would achieve faster recovery and shorter hospital stay for patients undergoing colorectal surgery, resulting in a major cost saving for the NHS from a common (and resource-intensive) surgical intervention.</p>

                  <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                  <p id="Par92">Intravenous lidocaine used in this setting is an adjunct to usual anaesthetic and perioperative analgesic practice. There is no alternative medication against which to test the intervention; hence, the comparator is a placebo of physiological (isotonic) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) which looks identical to lidocaine.</p>

                <sec id="Sec17">
                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par93">In the intervention arm, an intravenous bolus of 2% lidocaine at induction of anaesthesia (1.5âmg/kg ideal body weight) infused over 20âmin is followed by intravenous infusion of 1.5âmg/kg/h ideal body weight with a maximum rate of 120âmg/h for a minimum of 6 h up to a maximum of 12âh. Ideal body weight rather than actual body weight is used to prevent the possibility of toxicity by exceeding the upper therapeutic threshold of lidocaine in very overweight patients.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">The bolus and intravenous infusion rate of the placebo are the same as the investigational medicinal product (IMP).</p>
                  <p id="Par95">Continuous cardiac monitoring during the period of IMP/placebo infusion is required as systemic toxicity can provoke cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
                  <p id="Par96">The planned duration of infusion will be determined pre-operatively by the participating unitâs normal postoperative availability of continuous cardiac monitoring. Units where normal postoperative disposal is to the standard inpatient ward, where facility for cardiac monitoring is not available, will aim to administer the infusion for a minimum of 6 h (operating time plus theatre recovery suite time). Before the patient is moved to the ward, the infusion will be stopped. This means that (i) if the operating time plus theatre recovery suite time is less than 6 h, the duration of the infusion will also be less than 6 h, and (ii) if the operating time plus theatre recovery time is 6 h or more, the duration of the infusion will be more than 6 h but will be stopped before 12âh.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Units where normal postoperative disposal is to HDU, or other clinical area where cardiac monitoring is available, will aim to administer the infusion for up to 12âh. If the patient is moved to a ward without cardiac monitoring facilities before the 12-h period has been completed, the infusion will be stopped.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par120">In a feasibility study in laparoscopic colectomy conducted under real-world NHS conditions with NHS patients typical of the recruitment cohort proposed in this application, 22 of a total of 50 patients (44%) failed to achieve return of GI function (GI-3 endpoint) by the third postoperative day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Ten patients (20%) went on to develop prolonged postoperative ileus (PPOI). Interpretation of data from other healthcare systems is made complex by reporting of various univariate endpoints, but control arm data support this event rate. Effect size in published reports ranges from 15 to 40% relative reduction in GI dysfunction rate, again using a variety of univariate endpoints.</p>
                <p id="Par121">Therefore, with a sample size of 562 randomised 1:1 to IV lidocaine or placebo the study will have 90% power at a two-sided 5% level of significance to detect a relative reduction of 33% from 40 to 26.8% (absolute reduction of 13.2%) in non-return of gut function at 3 days post-operatively (or if the event rate is lower, the same power to detect a 40% relative reduction from 30% to 18% (a 12% absolute reduction)). Given the primary endpoint is measured in hospital, there should be no appreciable loss to follow-up (the perioperative death rate is ~â1% for the whole duration of hospital stay and the very few discharged before 3 days can be assumed to have achieved return of GI function). This size of study would also give similar power to detect a difference of 10% (from 20% to 10%) in the important secondary outcome of PPOI.</p>

                  <p id="Par146">Adverse events (AEs) will be identified and recorded from the time a participant signs the consent form to take part in the study until the 30th post-operative day. They will be asked about AEs daily during their admission, and during the 7- and 30-day telephone calls. When an AE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator, or another suitably qualified physician in the research team to review documentation related to the event. Relevant information will be recorded on the AE log and a serious adverse event (SAE) form if requiredâthe specific requirements for recording events in ALLEGRO are described in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> below.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par158">Colorectal surgery is a core part of general surgery and undertaken in every acute NHS hospital from small district generals to university teaching institutions. Approximately 30,000 colectomies per year are undertaken in the UK alone; hence, a large number of patients could stand to benefit from an intervention that improves functional GI recovery. Data from small trials suggest a beneficial effect from intravenous perioperative lidocaine on this key determinant of recovery from colorectal surgery. ALLEGRO aims to be the definitive trial of perioperative IV lidocaine infusion in colorectal surgery within an NHS setting.</p>
              <p id="Par159">There is variation in anaesthetic and perioperative techniques across the UK, although the dissemination of Enhanced Recovery principles has increased consistency of perioperative practice between and within units. As ALLEGRO is a trial of a perioperative adjunct to normal care, we judged it impracticable to enforce a single strict anaesthetic/perioperative protocol. If found to be effective in this setting, it would provide evidence of external validity/applicability suggesting it could also be a useful adjunct in other gastrointestinal/abdominal surgery.</p>
              <p id="Par160">The majority of elective colorectal surgery in the UK is now undertaken using minimally invasive techniques (laparoscopic or robotic), but there remains a role for open surgery in some cases (dictated by various factors including case selection and surgeon preference). Initially, ALLEGRO included a separate exploratory study, with separate randomisation, for planned open cases. This study was deliberately exploratory and contained no estimate of sample size, as we were uncertain as to the rate of elective open surgery in recruiting centres and whether clinicians would accept equipoise given that many anaesthetists prefer epidural anaesthesia for these cases. By early 2020, only 12 participants had been recruited to the exploratory study for open cases (most in the CIs site), in comparison to 201 participants in the main laparoscopic trial, suggesting an absence of equipoise. With approval from the funder, the exploratory study for planned open cases was closed as part of protocol version 5 (8 September 2020), by which time 16 participants had been recruited into the exploratory study.</p>
              <p id="Par161">In common with many studies, recruitment to ALLEGRO was halted by the COVID pandemic. However, the essential nature of the surgery (predominantly for cancer) meant that eligible cases restarted relatively quickly, and the original design of the study, which had aimed to integrate trial processes with existing hospital contact points in the surgical patient pathway (outpatient clinics, preassessment appointments) meant that no change of trial design was required to meet COVID restrictions. However, we did alter some processes around consent and giving patient information to allow research teams to have a consent discussion by telephone with participants subsequently returning the completed consent form by post.</p>
              <p id="Par162">The need to randomise participants before date of operation in order to have the trial drug dispensed from clinical trial pharmacies ready for the start of surgery has resulted in unanticipated issues in some cases resulting in a relatively high number of post-randomisation exclusions. The main reasons for these are change in planned type of surgery (particularly open rather than minimally invasive technique; a preoperative decision to make a new stoma) or change in anaesthetic technique (particularly decision to use an epidural) made on the morning of surgery. This is a challenging area for trial teams: it can be difficult to know which surgical/anaesthetic staff are undertaking an operating list until relatively late, there may be nuances about the planned operation known only to the operating surgeon and not always stated on the operating theatre list and there is varying integration of research nurses within the participating surgical/anaesthetic teams. At the current rate, we anticipate approximately 20â25 post randomisation exclusions; the appropriate number of cases will be added to the study to achieve the target sample size of 562 cases.</p>
