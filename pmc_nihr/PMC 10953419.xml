                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. People experiencing psychosis are at increased risk of death by suicide. Talking therapies can alleviate suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Therapies need to also be acceptable to recipients. The aim of this study was to investigate the views on psychological therapy for people experiencing psychosis and suicidality using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants were recruited from a randomised controlled trial comparing suicide prevention psychological therapy with treatment as usual. Individuals had a diagnosis of non‚Äêaffective psychosis and experience¬†of suicidal thoughts, plans and/or attempts. To assess the acceptability of the therapy, semi‚Äêstructured interviews were conducted with 20 participants randomised to receive therapy.

                  <p>Talking about suicide was difficult and, at times, distressing, but it was perceived to be useful for understanding experiences. To be acceptable, it is important for therapists to ensure that clients' understanding of therapy aligns with expectations of effectiveness and to invest in building strong therapeutic alliances. Future research will benefit from examining therapists' experiences of delivering therapy through different modes (e.g. online, telephone).</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Over 700,000 people die by suicide every year globally (World Health Organization,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0166" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In 2019, there were 5691 deaths by suicide in the UK (Office for National Statistics,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). People with mental health problems are most vulnerable to suicidal experiences (Hawton &amp; van Heeringen,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0027" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; O'Connor et al., <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0067" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Individuals experiencing psychosis are at a particularly high risk of suicide death (Hawton et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Saha et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0055" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Tarrier et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with a 13‚Äêfold risk of suicide compared to the general population (Too et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0064" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A sixfold increase in suicide deaths in people with diagnoses on the schizophrenia spectrum, including non‚Äêaffective psychosis, compared to people experiencing affective mental health problems was reported in a meta‚Äêanalysis (Chapman et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Around half of the people with psychosis think about and/or attempt suicide in their lifetime (Aydin et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Hawton et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviours, social isolation, and feeling hopeless, defeated, and trapped can increase the risk of suicide death (Bornheimer et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Harris et al., <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Owen et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Panagioti et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pinikahana et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0049" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Stravynski &amp; Boyer,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Furthermore, living with psychosis can be immensely distressing and suicide can be perceived as a way to escape distress (Harris et al., <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>There is growing evidence that psychological interventions which target suicidality can reduce suicidal thoughts, acts, and urges (Hawton et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been a recommended approach for helping people who experience suicidal thoughts and behaviours (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Interventions need to be effective, but also acceptable, to recipients and those delivering them (Medical Research Council,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Sekhon et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Over the last decade, CBT‚Äêbased suicide interventions have been developed and studies have confirmed the interventions' potential in terms of effectiveness and acceptability in individuals in inpatient wards (Awenat et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Awenat, Peters, et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Awenat, Shaw‚ÄêN√∫√±ez, et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Haddock et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), prisons (Pratt et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and the community (Tarrier et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Given the elevated risk of suicide in individuals with psychosis, it is important to investigate the acceptability of interventions that specifically target suicidal experiences in the context of psychosis (Gooding et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>The acceptability concept has been poorly operationalised within the literature (Sekhon et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Sidani et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Staniszewska et al., <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0069" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), leaving researchers without a common language or means of assessing treatment acceptability. To address this, Sekhon et al.¬†(<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) developed the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) which defines acceptability as the extent to which a healthcare intervention is considered appropriate for individuals who receive and deliver it. Most studies using the TFA have focused on physical health problems and health behaviour change (Brookfield,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Gossage‚ÄêWorrall et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Griffin et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kurniawati et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Murphy &amp; Gardner,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Nadarzynski et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Palsola et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rockliffe et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The TFA is yet to be applied to psychological interventions targeting suicidal thoughts and behaviours in the context of psychosis. Examining the acceptability of therapy for such complex experiences is important for understanding issues of accessibility, engagement, and uptake, and ultimately, for reducing suicidal experiences.</p>
              <p>The primary aim of this study was to utilise the TFA to investigate participants' views on the acceptability of a suicide‚Äêfocused CBT for people experiencing non‚Äêaffective psychosis (i.e.,¬†CBSPp) in the context of a randomised controlled trial (RCT; Gooding et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). CBSPp is a one‚Äêto‚Äêone therapy offered in 24, 50‚Äêmin sessions with a therapist trained in CBT and CBSPp. It is underpinned by the general principles employed when using more generic CBT for people with psychosis. However, CBSPp aimed to ensure that the formulation and intervention focused specifically on understanding how those concepts believed to underpin suicidality as highlighted by the Schematic Appraisal Model of Suicide (SAMS, Johnson et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) were incorporated into the formulation and intervention (see Tarrier et al.¬†(<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) for a thorough description of the CBSP approach). This study aimed to address the following research questions:

              <title>METHODS</title>
              <p>Semi‚Äêstructured interviews were conducted with 20 participants randomly allocated to receive CBSPp as part of a multi‚Äêsite RCT investigating the efficacy of the intervention (i.e., Cognitive AppRoaches to coMbatting Suicidality (CARMS); Gooding et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Participants for the trial were recruited from community and inpatient settings across four NHS trusts in North‚ÄêWest England and were randomised to either CBSPp plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Ethical approval was granted by an NHS Research Ethics Committee (17/NW/0089).</p>

                <p>Participants for this qualitative study were recruited following therapy completion as part of an RCT investigating the efficacy of a novel psychological therapy for suicidality in people experiencing non‚Äêaffective psychosis (CBSPp; Gooding et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Participants were identified through purposive sampling to ensure maximum variance in views and experiences, such as age, ethnicity, suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and length of time being under the care of mental health teams (Kelly,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Palinkas et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Patton,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). All participants were under the care of a community mental health team at the time of the study. For up‚Äêto‚Äêdate risk information, the participant's care coordinator was contacted in advance of interviews. An information sheet was sent to those interested and participants were given at least 24‚Äâhours to consider whether they would like to take part. Participants were given ¬£10 as a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô for participating in the interview.</p>
                <p>The mean age of the participants in this study was 38‚Äâyears (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>¬†=¬†13.68), 65% identified as female, 90% were White British, 5% were Asian and 5% were Mixed Race. The most common diagnosis was schizophrenia (65%), followed by unspecified nonorganic psychosis (15%), schizoaffective disorder (10%), other non‚Äêorganic psychotic disorder (5%), and persistent delusional disorder (5%). These data were collected as part of the CARMS¬†RCT. On average, participants attended 17 therapy sessions (<italic toggle="yes">SD</italic>¬†=¬†6.21; range 0‚Äì24). Of note, due to social restrictions during the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic, therapy sessions with seven participants were conducted remotely (i.e., by telephone or online platform) with their consent.</p>

                <p>Interviews were conducted by LC, YA, PM and KH between March 2018 and June 2021. A flexible topic guide was developed from previous literature and experience of designing and piloting the intervention by the research team. The topic guide was designed to examine therapy acceptability and applied to the TFA. Initial interviews were conducted face‚Äêto‚Äêface at either participants' homes or clinical settings (e.g. GP surgery).

These were then coded line by line in NVivo using a coding manual based on the TFA (Sekhon et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In addition, through inductive coding of initial transcripts, a scoping review of the existing literature on the acceptability of mental health interventions, and previous studies that have used the TFA (Brookfield,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Gossage‚ÄêWorrall et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Kurniawati et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Murphy &amp; Gardner,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Palsola et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rockliffe et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0053" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), the coding manual was updated to fit with the experiences of people receiving CBSPp.

Therefore, meetings were held with the research team where the coding of incoming data and the coding manual were discussed and further refined to ensure clarity and cohesiveness. The coding manual was then deductively applied to the full dataset by LC, KH and SP. To ensure the reliability of the coding process, 20 codes were selected, and an independent rater allocated them to the TFA themes. The per cent agreement was 80.</p>

                <title>Theme 1: Affective attitude</title>
                <p>This theme describes how people felt about the CBSPp intervention. Affective attitude is characterised by any expression of thoughts and feelings about the therapy, capturing both positive and negative attitudes of talking about suicide during therapy.</p>
                <sec id="papt12456-sec-0016">
                  <title>Perceptions of therapy</title>
                  <p>The participants in this study had a positive view of CBSPp and found it useful and worthwhile. They described feeling ‚Äòover the moon‚Äô (ID 14) with being allocated to the therapy condition because it met a therapeutic need: ‚ÄòI was like, oh, CBT, I've heard of that. That could be useful.‚Äô ‚ÄòCos I've always wanted to access, like, long‚Äêterm speaking therapy.‚Äô (ID 11). Specific aspects demonstrated a positive outlook, such as feeling supported, involved, and in control of an intervention that was tailored to individuals' needs: ‚Äòit felt like I was being supported, it did not feel like they [the¬†therapist]¬†were the one in control‚Äô (ID 08). Exploring and learning about mood changes were particularly useful for people: ‚Äòit was just useful to see what my mood was when I started. And then each session revisiting where it was as opposed to the previous session.‚Äô (ID 15).</p>
                  <p>Opening up about problems and having someone to talk to who listens and understands were examples of positive attitudes towards CBSPp. Although talking to someone is helpful, there can be a level of uncertainty because of the potential consequences that ensue as a result of opening up:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0002"><p>'To talk is very important [‚Ä¶] But when you do not feel in control of it, you do not know what's coming out. Because I'm hearing such badness sometimes, I'm thinking, have I said any of that? [‚Ä¶] I do not feel in control, so, I'm worried that something wrong comes out.' <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 04).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>Conversely, there were negative views of CBSPp for three reasons. First, some participants did not like talking about suicidal experiences. This resulted in low expectations of the effectiveness of CBSPp. For others, talking about such experiences was extremely overwhelming and distressing:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0003"><p>we dug into the past [‚Ä¶] but it was too much [‚Ä¶] I'd had like three nights with nightmares of things that had happened, or things I could have done different.¬†<named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 04).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>Participants also worried about being judged and nervous about meeting someone new. Despite those fears, people reported being willing to go through with the therapy because of the potential to receive help. Second, there were concerns expressed about managing well‚Äêbeing after the end of therapy but participants understood that therapy was going to end at a specified time:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0004"><p>I was a little bit worried thinking how I would cope after the therapy, but I was okay [‚Ä¶]. The therapist told me what happens after that, like how I can cope in case I'm not feeling too good. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 21).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>The third type of negative view was that the number of therapy sessions received whilst in the trial was insufficient. Furthermore, some participants felt that therapy ended abruptly and at a time when they had more issues to discuss: ‚ÄòI've learnt from hearing voices, it's come from childhood experiences. I wish I could have explored it a bit more, but we did not have time.‚Äô (ID 01). However, this was offset by others who felt like therapy ended at the right time: 'It felt it was alright ‚Äì it did not feel like I was just sort of thrown, like, right here you go and that's it now, [‚Ä¶] it felt that I was ready‚Ä¶' (ID 13). Several participants did not have any expectations and were open to trying a new intervention regardless: 'I had no expectations besides the fact that, oh, they are trying something new [‚Ä¶] let us see how it goes.' (ID 21).</p>

                  <title>Talking about suicidal experiences during therapy</title>
                  <p>Most participants welcomed the idea of opening up about their suicidal experience during therapy and felt that it was worthwhile and helped reduce suicidal experiences: ‚ÄòI think it's very, very helpful, um, certainly if they can prevent people committing suicide‚Äô (ID 019). Talking about suicide was challenging but a worthwhile endeavour which ultimately had a positive effect on suicidal experiences and mental wellbeing: ‚ÄòHaving to sit there and go through everything and relive everything, it was the hardest thing. But I did it. [‚Ä¶] I thought I achieved a lot doing that.‚Äô (ID 05).</p>
                  <p>Some people had concerns about the consequences of talking about suicidality: ‚ÄòI just panic that I'll get locked up [laughs]. That's a big fear because I was in hospital such a long time.‚Äô (ID 10). Other concerns related to anticipated exacerbation of distress and suicidal experiences: ‚ÄòWell, I know when I talk about suicide it can cause me to feel a bit suicidal, that's just the way it is.‚Äô (ID 19). Therefore, it was perceived as scary and not something they talked about. This was due to the potential need to want to protect significant others from this burden and the emotional impact of discussing traumatic and distressing experiences which sometimes led to low mood. It is important to note that these were anticipated and transient, rather than experienced, effects of therapy, as one participant explained: ‚ÄòIt was transient, it was fleeting, it just passed, and I had negative moods when I spoke about suicide, but it did not last.‚Äô (ID 19).</p>
                  <p>Participants liked that the therapy focused on suicidality as this was a pertinent problem that they wanted to address, and reported a decrease in self‚Äêharm and suicidal experiences during and in the months following CBSPp: ‚Äòsince the therapy, I'm not saying I've not self‚Äêharmed but, it's not been as much.‚Äô (ID 18). Overall, participants' experiences of CBSPp were positive, despite the challenges associated with talking about suicidality: ‚Äòeverybody I spoke to was very kind, very friendly, non‚Äêjudgemental. [‚Ä¶] it's really lovely people to work with.‚Äô (ID 08).</p>

                  <p>Talking about suicidal experiences during therapy was described as effortful and, at times, distressing. This experience was counterbalanced by the perceived benefits of the intervention for participants' well‚Äêbeing. Establishing a connection with the therapist counteracted the emotional burden:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0005"><p>I had to [‚Ä¶] challenge myself into doing something because I knew that you had to go through difficult stuff to get through the other end. But it's like, um, having the therapy sometimes made me feel worse. And there were a couple of times when I did not want to do it, but I pushed myself through that barrier and completed it.

</p>
                  <p>A technical burden related to the paperwork and homework tasks (e.g., daily activity diary) that participants were invited to do during therapy.

                  <title>Impact of different modes of therapy delivery</title>
                  <p>At the start of the pandemic, the CBSPp therapy team had to adapt to effective ways of delivering sessions over the telephone and/or online through live voice calls. For some people, receiving a telephone intervention was burdensome: ‚ÄòI was a bit scared at first because [‚Ä¶] I just could not get talking on the phone, talking on the phone I were really ‚Äì I do not know, weird.‚Äô (ID 14). However, many participants preferred telephone therapy for practical reasons, such as not having to get dressed and travel to an appointment. Others felt more able to talk about suicidality over the phone:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0007"><p>I think it's easier on the phone because if I'm face‚Äêto‚Äêface with someone and they're asking about suicide, how I plan it out and how I just feel like throwing myself in front of a train when I'm that low, and I can't really say that to someone face‚Äêto‚Äêface. I feel embarrassed. It's not easy to open up, whereas on the phone it's like talking to yourself. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 17).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>Having shorter sessions and receiving therapy at home, by telephone or online were tangible ways to relieve burden, though some participants did not have a preference for a particular mode of therapy:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0008"><p>I didn't mind, to be honest, like, I don't think I would mind either.

                <title>Theme 3: Alliance</title>
                <p>Building trust in the client‚Äêtherapist relationship was an important aspect of therapy which had implications for establishing a therapeutic alliance and increasing acceptability. Most participants felt that they established a trusting relationship with their therapist which allowed them to discuss sensitive issues safely:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0009"><p>the safety is that you're telling someone who has this knowledge. And someone who has this kind of understanding and have been around people like me. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 08).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                <p>However, some found this relationship difficult to develop at the start of therapy. This was for two reasons, firstly, due to participants' mistrust and anxiety about meeting new people. The second related to the challenges of talking about sensitive issues, such as suicidality, over the phone:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0010"><p>it took us a couple of months for me to be so forthcoming and that's because I was just a bit uncomfortable at first with the over the phone, cos it was like, I couldn't wrap my head around that you don't know who the person is on the other end. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 20).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                <p>Having someone who was friendly and easy to talk to facilitated building trust. Conversely, building a trusting relationship was difficult for one participant who did not feel listened to by their therapist. This was in the context of the therapist asking the participant to think of three nice things to do the following week, but the participant felt unable to do that, which made them not trust the therapist:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0011"><p>And then he [the therapist] said, ‚ÄòCan we do three nice things next week or can you think of three?‚Äô, and I just felt like, ‚Äòboom‚Äô, my whole world fell apart. [‚Ä¶] I thought I trusted him and then I couldn't trust him anymore, and that was it, that was the end. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 03).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                <p>An important aspect of therapy was having a mutual understanding that client and therapist can sometimes disagree about therapeutic approaches and accepting it as part of the therapeutic relationship with this leading to therapy adapting to client's preference: ‚ÄòAnd just an acceptance that we did not agree on this and that was it really. There were no arguments about it.‚Äô (ID 06).</p>

                <p>Participants understood the purpose of the between‚Äêsession tasks and liked the therapy resources. Some aspects that participants worked on in sessions included focusing on positive memories and problem‚Äêsolving. In addition to those techniques, participants were provided with a staying well plan towards the end of therapy. Although most thought it contained useful information, some participants were unsure how to utilise it:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0013"><p>[The¬†therapist] gave me a lot of pieces of paper with flow charts and everything.

</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                <p>Of note, one participant appeared to have had a different understanding of the purpose of CBSPp which resulted in great disappointment. They had sought help with obtaining justice for personal issues, which did not directly fit with the intervention's focus on suicidality:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0014"><p>to me it was a wet flannel. It was going through the old thing over again after all these years, and then I thought I'll trust him [the¬†therapist]¬†and it all fell through, and it devastated me. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 03).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                <p>Four participants thought that their experiences of suicide did not warrant an intervention targeting suicidality and felt they did not fit the intervention inclusion criteria because their suicidal experiences were not severe enough. This could have been a result of varied understanding of what constitutes ‚Äòsuicidal experiences‚Äô:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0015"><p>I didn't really feel that I was perhaps the right person to be receiving this.

</p>
                <p>Despite this belief, three participants found the focus of CBSPp on suicidality and psychosis useful: ‚ÄòIt did help me to [‚Ä¶] realise probably why I was, kind of, thinking those thoughts and why I found them so distressing.‚Äô (ID 15).</p>

In relation to mental health experiences, participants reported a reduction in psychological distress and suicidality: ‚ÄòI did not have a panic attack, and [‚Ä¶] did not have a self‚Äêharm episode.‚Äô (ID 08). Not only did people notice a reduction in suicidal thoughts and behaviours, but they also noticed a positive change in the ways they perceived and coped with these experiences: ‚Äòwhen I feel suicidal, I feel more positive about the outcome.

                  <p>In relation to social interactions, people identified improvements in social activities, building connections with others, and feeling ‚Äòmore relaxed around people‚Äô (ID 21). These changes were noticed by significant others: ‚ÄòAnd just everyone, like family and friends have kind of obviously noticed a massive difference in kind of how I am since I've had the therapy.‚Äô (ID 15). An important benefit of therapy was feeling more able to engage with family and friends and talk to them about problems:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0016"><p>Talking to my partner, I like talking to my mum. [‚Ä¶] get to talk about whatever it is that's bothering me, or making me feel this way, or what set me off and they'll try and like rationalise it and help me get through it. <named-content content-type="attribution">(ID 17).</named-content>
</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>In terms of well‚Äêbeing, a better understanding of self and suicidal experiences was highlighted as a positive outcome of therapy. Additionally, some people reported that therapy had made them realise that they had reasons to live which, in turn, made them feel more in control of their voices and self‚Äêharm urges:<disp-quote content-type="quotation" id="papt12456-blkfxd-0017"><p>even though I have voices in my head, it's knowing that I'm in control because nobody can hurt me, only me.

</p></disp-quote>
</p>
                  <p>These changes in well‚Äêbeing had a lasting impact on people's lives: ‚ÄòI think it just feels like it's embedded now, where I do not really need to kind of really work hard to use it.‚Äô (ID 15). Conversely, one participant reported that CBSPp only helped in the short term: ‚Äòthe therapy really helped me. [‚Ä¶] but it does not help forever.‚Äô (ID 05). It was considered important to continue to apply the knowledge and skills learned in therapy to experience the positive effects of the intervention in the long term: ‚ÄòI thought to myself that it's in my best interests to take this seriously and to make an effort.‚Äô (ID 21). Four participants were open‚Äêminded about the potential effects of therapy, did not know what to expect from therapy or had no expectations at all: ‚ÄòI had no idea really, I had no preconceived ideas.‚Äô (ID 19).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This study aimed to address two research questions relating to people's experiences of CBSPp and how their experiences mapped onto the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA; Sekhon et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). CBSPp was perceived as being acceptable, useful and beneficial for well‚Äêbeing and understanding experiences of suicidality and psychosis. There are three key findings related to CBSPp's acceptability.</p>
              <p>First, talking about suicidal experiences during therapy was unequivocally difficult and emotionally challenging, which corroborates the findings of previous research in the field (Harris et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Littlewood et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Peters et al., <xref rid="papt12456-bib-0068" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>; Richards et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). There seemed to be a ‚Äòleap of faith‚Äô in some participant reports where they had to overcome initial concerns and place their trust in the therapeutic process. It is important to draw attention to the contrast between participants' apprehensions about the emotional impact of therapy and the reality of their experience of attending sessions. As illustrated in the Results, participants perceived a reduction in suicidal experiences and success in building a therapeutic relationship despite initial concerns. Therefore, it is important to clearly explain to potential recipients the likely contrast between the anticipated and experienced impact of receiving the intervention when considering if they should commence therapy.</p>
              <p>Second, the homework tasks and paperwork involved in participating in therapy were experienced as burdensome by some participants. Homework tasks are arguably an essential practice in CBT but can be accompanied with certain challenges, such as perceived inability to complete the task due to concerns about its content or difficulty, practical obstacles, or not having a clear understanding of the purpose of the task, which can impact the therapy outcome (Helbig &amp; Fehm,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kazantzis &amp; Miller,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). This suggests a need to explore problems with homework task completion with clients and modify the tasks to alleviate clients' concerns, if necessary. Negative experiences relating to homework completion in our study were negated by the usefulness of CBSPp for understanding self and developing coping skills and strategies which had a positive impact on well‚Äêbeing. People discussed the value of taking part in the intervention which was a balance of perceived burden and experienced effectiveness. The burden was perceived to lessen as useful therapeutic benefits were becoming more apparent to participants. As reported in the Results, there was a notion that individuals needed to do the hard work that comes with the initial stages of the therapy and continue to apply the learned skills in order to experience the benefits associated with CBSPp in the longer term.</p>
              <p>Third, four participants felt like they were not ‚Äòsuicidal enough‚Äô to have CBSPp. Having an unclear understanding of the rationale and purposes of therapy can have a potentially negative impact on clients' experiences of the intervention (Brooks et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Crawford et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Therapists and professionals referring clients for CBSPp need to highlight that this type of intervention focuses on various suicidal experiences, such as thoughts, urges, plans, attempts and self‚Äêharm with and/or without wish to die, in the presence or the absence of a suicidal crisis. This may help ensure that no individuals are omitted and feel that the intervention is inapplicable to their experiences, and also raises a question about who is most likely to benefit from the intervention and when.</p>
              <p>The original TFA (Sekhon et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) fitted with the acceptability data obtained in this study with two exceptions. There was no evidence of costs associated with taking part in the intervention (i.e. Theme 5 in the original TFA). This theme describes benefits that were given up (e.g., opportunities for other therapeutic activities), and any financial (e.g., travel, public transport, parking) and time‚Äêrelated costs to receiving an intervention. It is important to note that the nature of the intervention being delivered in a research setting may have resulted in no incurred costs or lost opportunities. Treatment as usual in this study did not usually include therapy. Therefore, people reported a benefit of taking part in the intervention, rather than loss of opportunities.</p>
              <p>The second exception was the newly developed alliance theme (Theme 3 in the adapted TFA) which reflected the importance of building trust in the client‚Äêtherapist relationship. This theme is specific to talking interventions as it has implications for establishing a therapeutic alliance in ensuring intervention acceptability.</p>
              <sec id="papt12456-sec-0029">
                <title>Limitations and strengths</title>
                <p>This study has at least two limitations which need to be considered. First, participants were recruited from an RCT investigating the efficacy of a novel psychological therapy for suicidality and psychosis. Participants in such a trial are likely to indicate some acceptability of the concept of the intervention or, at least, a willingness to engage with the intervention and motivation to complete assessments and interviews as part of the project. As such, the data collected may hold a positive bias (Borkovec &amp; Sibrava,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Button &amp; Munafo,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This has implications for the TFA in relation to the opportunity costs and ethicality domains which were not present in the study. For example, those not wanting to take part in the project may have perceived issues around the costs of taking part which meant they did not take part.</p>
                <p>Second, due to the impact of the COVID‚Äê19 pandemic, the intervention was conducted over the telephone and/or video‚Äêconferencing¬†(e.g. Attend Anywhere, Microsoft Teams) for seven participants. This could limit the findings of the current study, as we were unable to evaluate the acceptability of a full face‚Äêto‚Äêface intervention for a number of participants. However, we can offer a nuanced perspective on the acceptability of different modes of CBSPp which could provide a basis for further research into the efficacy of remote CBSPp. Furthermore, participants did not feel that receiving therapy over the telephone affected the quality, acceptability, or effectiveness of CBSPp. They reported better perceived anonymity (e.g., feeling embarrassed about showing their emotions to the therapist) and increased accessibility (Bee et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Turner et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0065" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This is important for people who cannot attend face‚Äêto‚Äêface appointments due to personal circumstances or health, financial, time, and logistical challenges (Cavanagh et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Mohr et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Delivery of therapy remotely to meet growing public demands is increasing (Rushton et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic on remote service provision. Recent studies have shown that remote therapy can be a trustworthy and feasible alternative to face‚Äêto‚Äêface therapy (Murphy et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Rushton et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Stefan et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Tang et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). A qualitative study by Rushton et al.¬†(<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) exploring people's views on telephone psychological interventions found that, despite initial reservations about treatment efficacy and anticipated communication barriers, on reflection, people reported a positive effect at the end of therapy, suggesting that telephone therapy can be effective. These results align with the experiences of some of our participants who had face‚Äêto‚Äêface and telephone therapy and did not feel that telephone intervention was inferior to face‚Äêto‚Äêface therapy.</p>

                <title>Recommendations for research and clinical practice</title>
                <p>It would be useful to learn about therapists' perceptions and experiences of providing CBSPp during the pandemic and using different modes of delivery. Therapists may have certain reservations and expectations about delivering therapy remotely (Humer et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; McBeath et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). For example, being unable to meet with the client in person can impact the quality of the therapeutic alliance (Connolly et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Ertelt et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Moreover, disclosing sensitive information and managing risk issues during remote therapy may be daunting and stressful for therapists and clients alike. Therefore, adopting a fully flexible approach to therapy delivery that offers different modes, frequencies and durations, is essential for therapy inclusivity and acceptability. The next step in the investigation of the acceptability of CBSPp is to include therapists' views and experiences of delivery using the TFA. This type of investigation is currently missing in the literature.</p>
                <p>A key finding was the importance of the alliance between clients and therapists. A stronger alliance has a positive effect on therapy outcomes for people experiencing psychosis and/or suicidality (Browne et al.,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Awareness and management of the sensitivity around the potential of therapy to make people feel worse if they felt unable to complete tasks are paramount for ensuring alliance and therapy acceptability. Some participants felt that the¬†therapy resources were too complex and overwhelming which made them difficult to refer to. Therefore, resources can be simplified in a way that would be helpful for people to use with¬†the view to increasing therapy acceptability and effectiveness. For example, it would be useful to include specific guidance on how to implement the staying well plan following cessation of therapy. This may help participants feel better prepared to use the plan when needed.</p>
                <p>Clients' understanding of the nature and aims of an intervention is essential for ethical therapy research (Mishara &amp; Weisstub,¬†<xref rid="papt12456-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Our findings highlight the importance of providing clear information about the essence of CBSPp, since the understanding of what constitutes suicidal experiences can vary and suggest amendments to the type of information given to potential participants. It is important to understand discrepancies between people's anticipated and experienced acceptability or effectiveness of an intervention prior to and after receiving therapy.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSION</title>
              <p>The TFA provided a useful framework to understand people's experiences of CBSPp. Participants described a range of ways in which CBSPp was perceived to be acceptable and beneficial. Talking about suicide was difficult but with a trusting relationship with therapists, it was perceived to be useful for understanding psychosis and suicidal experiences. It is important for therapists to ensure that clients' understanding of the CBSPp's aims is clear and aligns with their expectations of effectiveness, and to invest in building strong therapeutic alliances. Offering flexible modes of CBSPp delivery can enhance intervention acceptability and engagement. Future research will benefit from examining therapists' experiences and perceptions of delivering CBSPp.</p>
