                  <p id="Par1">The number and proportion of older people globally is growing faster than that of any other age group. At the same time the number of people retaining some of their own teeth is rising. There significant differences between those living in care and their community dwelling peers, with evidence showing those in care having fewer teeth and significantly higher levels of dental decay. There are numerous Cochrane reviews linking the use of fluoride to a reduction in dental decay, however, the majority of research on effectiveness has been conducted on children and consequently, children and adolescents tend to be the main recipients of fluoride interventions. There are to date no studies comparing the effectiveness of fluoride interventions in older people in care homes in the UK. However, prior to developing an appropriate protocol for full-scale trial comparing clinical effectiveness of fluoride interventions, there are a number of trial feasibility and statistical parameters that need to be clarified.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This trial is a single centre, multi-site randomised controlled assessor blind parallel group (three groups) trial, with the primary objective of establishing the feasibility, practicability and compliance of fluoride interventions to prevent dental decay in care homes. Secondary and tertiary objectives will aim to explore the acceptability of the interventions from resident, care home and dental services perspectives, and estimate the efficacy of the three different fluoride treatments.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This feasibility trial will produce new knowledge and add value to a landscape that is under researched. Although the efficacy of fluoride interventions is proven, the feasibility of dental research and prevention in this vulnerable group and in the complex care home setting is novel. This work will not only add to our understanding of the interface of dental care and social care but will also contribute to our broader understanding on undertaking research in care home settings. Dental care for older people has been a longstanding issue, and the events of this past year has shone a light on the vulnerabilities of those residing in care homes and so this research is landing at a pivotal time.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par6">Increased life expectancy and reduced mortality, coupled with a falling birth rate mean that the proportion of older people is growing faster than that of any other age group globally. As a greater proportion of the population survives to very old ages, the public health impact of the burden of disease, disability and related utilisation of medical care and the need for supportive and long-term care has become an important concern. As the population profile changes, it is predicted that the number of people in care will also rise.</p>
              <p id="Par7">As well as the number and proportion of older people increasing, at the same time the number of people retaining some of their own teeth is rising. In the UK 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey, 53% of people surveyed over the age of 85 years had natural teeth, with an average of 14 teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is leading to a shift in oral health from an older population, which was largely edentulous (i.e. had no natural teeth) to one, which is dentate and so can benefit from prevention, restoration and maintenance of the dentition.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Poor oral health impacts an individual’s ability to eat, type of diet, weight, speech, appearance and social interaction. Restriction of diet related to issues with chewing or swallowing, dry mouth and pain can cause malnourishment and nutritional deficiencies in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Evidence shows that nutritional deficiencies in older people is linked with excess winter deaths, cardiovascular disease and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and so oral health in older people is important. Evidence has also shown an association between the presence of oral bacteria and pneumonia in older people in care homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Older people perceive oral health as being important to their quality of life in a number of different ways, including function, general health socialising and confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">The combination of frequent sugar intake, poor oral care and medications that affect salivary flow, means that older people in care homes are at a significantly higher risk of dental decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of root and coronal decay increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and that older adults are at higher risk of decay than children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">Steele and Walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed significant differences between institutionalized and free living older people, with those in care having fewer teeth and significantly higher levels of dental decay. A study undertaken in Avon, found that 63% of residents in nursing care had root decay at the time of examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, high levels of unmet needs have been found internationally with residents requiring extensive dental treatment due to poor oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">The poor oral condition is exacerbated by a lack of access to dental services and treatment options. Most homes access dental care only when the resident has a problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, when a need for dental treatment is identified, in many cases the complex challenges that present in these patients such as medical complications, limited mobility and compliance, means the range of dental treatments deliverable is restricted.</p>
              <p id="Par12">These factors dictate a need for prevention of dental disease in this population. Dental prevention should be targeted at susceptible tooth surfaces in the most vulnerable members of the population. There is a strong body of evidence linking the use of fluoride to a reduction in dental decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The majority of research on effectiveness has been conducted on children and consequently, children and adolescents tend to be the main recipients of fluoride interventions. However, more recently studies have shown fluoride to be effective in reducing dental decay in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">There are many modes of fluoride delivery available, however considering the complex challenges that present in older people in care, the two most appropriate technologies in the care home setting would be professionally administered fluoride varnish and high dose fluoride toothpaste. These would be the safest modes of fluoride delivery as a controlled dose can be administered.</p>
              <p id="Par14">A review of the evidence pertaining to the use of fluoride supplements in older people in care homes concluded there is good evidence of dental decay reduction with 22,000 ppm fluoride varnish professionally applied 3–4 times per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A randomized control trial undertaken in care homes in Hong Kong showed 3 monthly applications of fluoride varnish by a dental professional to be more effective in reducing root caries than with oral care training of care staff alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Fluoride delivery through regular brushing is a simple and effective decay preventive intervention, and is part of the ‘activities of daily living’ within care home standards. There is a dose related response to decay rates with fluoride, and commonly people deemed ‘high risk’ of dental decay are advised to use a high dose fluoridated toothpaste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Over the counter toothpastes contain a fluoride does of between 1000 and 1450 ppm. There are 2 commercially available high dose toothpastes available in the UK, with fluoride doses of 2800 ppm and 5000 ppm. A resident level randomized control trial undertaken in care homes with older people showed a significant reduction in root decay in participants using 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste compared to 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste over an 8-month period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This study was undertaken in Denmark, where the 2800 ppm fluoride toothpaste is not available.</p>
              <p id="Par16">In their literature review of fluoride interventions in older people in residential care homes, Innes and Evans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] concluded that although 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste is effective in reducing dental decay in elderly people in care homes, older people may swallow more toothpaste than a younger person due to lack of supervision, poor oral function or confusion it would seem prudent to recommend 2800 ppm toothpaste to avoid any risk of fluoride overdose. However, no studies comparing the effectiveness of 2800 ppm to usual care (1450 ppm toothpaste) in a care home setting have been carried out to determine the extent of impact on dental decay, although studies in children and adults have demonstrated effectiveness.</p>
              <p id="Par17">There are to date, no studies comparing the effectiveness of fluoride interventions in older people in care homes in the UK. However, prior to developing an appropriate protocol for full-scale trial comparing clinical effectiveness of fluoride interventions, there are a number of trial feasibility and statistical parameters that need to be clarified.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Dental decay in older people in care homes poses a significant impact on the National Health Service and society and yet is entirely preventable. Development and implementation of a fit for purpose fluoride intervention as part of routine care for older people in care could impact significant public health benefits by improving the oral health of residents in care homes and consequently their general health and quality of life. However, decision making on which intervention would be most suitable is hindered by the limited research undertaken in care homes on the effectiveness of 2800 ppm fluoride toothpaste, its comparison to professionally administered fluoride varnish. Consequently, this research is of great importance to health improvement and policy setting.</p>

                <title>Trial design and setting</title>
                <p id="Par30">This feasibility study will be a single centre, multi-site cluster randomised controlled assessor blind parallel group (3 groups) trial, with a nested qualitative component.</p>
                <p id="Par31">A flow diagram for the trial is provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Intervention delivery and follow up will be over 12 months and will be conducted in six London care homes housing between 60 and 80 residents. The sample will be stratified to attain balance in each arm between nursing and residential care.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>FInCH trial flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2021_1650_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par32">Within this, the nested qualitative component of the trial will gain views from care home managers, carers, residents and family members as well as the dental team. These views are vital in assessing the acceptability objective of the study.</p>

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p id="Par33">The ethical considerations around this trial have been carefully thought through. Undertaking a clinical trial with a vulnerable population, who may not be able to consent in many cases requires careful planning and a considered approach to ensure residents are protected at all times. Informed written consent to participate in the trial from the resident or legal power of attorney will be sought for all eligible residents following extensive consultation with the care home, residents and family.</p>
                <p id="Par34">In considering risk relating to the investigational medicinal product (Duraphat® 2800 ppm and varnish) risks to participants would be no higher than that of standard medical care (classified a type A based on MRC/DH/MHRA Joint Project 2011). The licensed medicinal products being used will be used for their licensed range of indications (prevention of dental decay), dosage and form in this study, and so this has been determined as a Type A low-risk trial.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Favourable ethical approval for the FInCH trial was granted in February 2018 by the East of England—Cambridge South Social Care Research Ethics Committee (reference 17/EE/0475).</p>
                <p id="Par36">Monitoring of this trial will be to ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice and scientific integrity will be managed and oversight retained, by the King’s College Hospital Clinical Trials Quality Team. As per the regulations, annual progress reports, notification of End of Trial, and a final report at the conclusion of the trial will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) and to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>

                <p id="Par38">A programme of engagement will be undertaken with each home and with the support of the local authority care homes team.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Carers and management staff will be invited to interviews and focus groups and the approved information leaflet and consent forms will be presented at staff meetings.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The study will be introduced to all care home residents via posters and presentations at family care home meetings. If the resident is unable to consent, their legal representative will be approached for recruitment, be that a family or friend with the residents power of attorney, or the care home. All relevant and approved documentation including the patient information leaflet, family information letters and written consent forms will be provided to the participant, and their legal representative so an informed decision to participate can be made. Opportunities for discussion will be provided.</p>

                  <p id="Par60">The control group will be subject to usual care practices with staff training. This will include using an over the counter fluoride toothpaste. To ensure consistency of dosage in the control group, the control group will be provided with Colgate Total 1450ppm (0.32%), which they will be advised to brush their teeth with a 1cm line of the toothpaste twice daily which equates to a fluoride dose of 1.16mg per application.</p>

                  <p id="Par61">Duraphat® 2800ppm (0.619%) fluoride toothpaste has been chosen as it is commonly prescribed high dose toothpaste in the UK and has been used in previous clinical trials. As per the manufacturers recommendations, a 1cm line is to be used twice daily instead of the normal toothpaste, which equates to 2.24 g fluoride per application. Each tube will be labelled with directions of use and the patients details. Staff will be trained with these recommendations and advised to cease use if any adverse effect occurs, and report this to the research lead immediately.</p>

                  <p id="Par62">The varnish used will be Duraphat® 50 mg/ml dental suspension, produced by Colgate-Palmolive Ltd. This varnish has been chosen as it is the most commonly available and used fluoride varnish in the UK and has been used in previous clinical trials.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">The fluoride dose in the varnish is equivalent to 22,600 ppm. As per manufacturer recommendation, before applying Duraphat®, excess debris will be removed from the tooth surface and the teeth dried. The varnish will be applied as a thin layer to the most susceptible areas of dentition using a brush. The dose administered will not exceed 0.75/ml (= 16.95/mg Fluoride). As the residents are deemed high risk, this will be repeated every 3 months for the duration of the study (within 2 weeks of baseline examinations, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months).</p>
                  <p id="Par64">A suitable trained and qualified dental hygienist will administer the varnish. Treatment record forms will be used to document date, batch number, patient identification number and number of teeth varnish was placed on.</p>

                <title>Prescribing of medicinal products</title>
                <p id="Par66">Duraphat® toothpaste and varnish are licensed, prescription only products in the United Kingdom. Both products are licensed for use for the prevention of dental decay, which is the purpose it will be used for in this study. Experienced, qualified clinicians will be administering/recommending the interventions in this study, which are relatively low risk.</p>
                <p id="Par67">As this is a community intervention, the Community Dental Service Clinical Director/Dental Public Health Consultant, will put a patient group directive in place for all identified residents, in accordance with current regulation and practice. This is the route followed for dental community based interventions, and so will be reproduced in this study.</p>
                <p id="Par68">Under this overall care home prescription, a visiting dental care professional place fluoride varnish to those consented, and record this in the treatment record form. As the fluoride varnish in this trial is a marketed products to be administered in accordance to the indication specified by the marketing authorisation interpretation of Regulation 46 of Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 10 1 suggests that the labelling requirements of Article 15 of Commission Directive 003/94/EC(ar) does not apply in this case, and so varnish tubes will be not need to be individually labelled.</p>
                <p id="Par69">For the toothpastes, dispensing will be as per standard of care and therefore the study drugs will not require labelling in line with annex 13. The IMP and comparators will be managed as per standard of care and will not require special labelling, accountability or storage. We anticipate each resident will need a maximum of a tube per month of whichever toothpaste they are allocated, as this is the suggested amount for a fully dentate individual. Following the clinical examination and checking of the medical history, the dentist will give a one-month supply of toothpaste labelled with the resident’s name and date of birth to the corresponding resident or carer. Each month the researcher will visit the home and weigh the tubes to assess compliance to use of the IMP, and give additional supplies as needed. As randomisation is at the care home level, it is not felt that blinding of toothpaste tubes is needed, nor is it possible for the varnish arm of the trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par97">This is a feasibility study where the primary objective is to assess and estimate the magnitude of feasibility parameters. Consequently, no formal sample size is required for the feasibility parameters. However, assuming a change from baseline to 12 months in the active to arrested mean number of lesions of 0.28 for the control group and a pooled standard deviation of 0.65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and further assuming the experimental interventions are likely to yield at least 50% of the effect of that observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for the intervention group (i.e. about 0.68 lesions per tooth), based on a reduced concentration (2800  ppm) being used in this study (5000 ppm), the sample size required is 60 per group (180 in total) to achieve at least 84% power to detect a difference (in the change from baseline) of at least 0.4 lesions. For a cluster randomized trial this assumes 3 clusters (2 care homes per group), with an average of 30 subjects per care home, an intra cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of at least 0.01 and a 2-sided type I error of 5%. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.</p>

                <p id="Par124">Research in care homes is limited, and in addition very few clinical trials have been conducted in this setting with vulnerable groups. The findings from this study will hold value not only academically, but also to key stakeholder groups including residents, families, care staff, care home and patient representative organisations, dental healthcare providers and commissioners locally and nationally as well as regulators of social care and broader public health landscape.</p>
                <p id="Par125">The working group have developed a dissemination strategy as the trial progresses. The outputs will be based on three broad areas, academic, stakeholder and policy.</p>
                <p id="Par126">The principal outputs for the project will be peer review publications, posters and presentations at regional, national and international conferences, such as European Association for Dental Public Health and International Association for Dental Research.</p>
                <p id="Par127">We will present at meetings and local events with stakeholders, including NHS and Local Authority colleagues to raise the importance of the agenda. We will also send a summary report through a newsletter to all stakeholders involved in the programme, including each care home that has taken part.</p>
                <p id="Par128">It is important that this work is presented at a broader level with a view to inform policy. We will therefore actively seek opportunities to present and publish the work at Public Health England, Chief Dental Officer and NHS meetings and conferences and meetings.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par129">This trial will produce new knowledge and add value to a landscape that is under researched.</p>
              <p id="Par130">Although the efficacy of fluoride interventions is proven, the feasibility of dental research and prevention in this vulnerable group and in the complex care home setting is novel. This work will not only add to our understanding of the interface of dental care and social care but will also contribute to our broader understanding on undertaking research in care home settings. In addition, although the work is set in care homes, there is also applicability of this research to those living in their own homes.</p>
              <p id="Par131">One of the challenges already highlighted in setting up the study is the lack of a coherent structured clear process for setting such trials up. Care home residents not being deemed NHS patients if the research is delivered in their ‘home’ sets up a unnecessary barrier to research in this setting. Equally challenging, is the necessary ethical approval process, that seeks to protect the participant, but can also hinder the value of including all participants in research.</p>
              <p id="Par132">Delivering interventions for vulnerable care home residents, with complex medical and behavioural challenges and high levels of both personal and dental care needs, although clinically beneficial, may not be feasible. The complexities of ethics, consent, capacity and acceptability need to be carefully thought out as to ensure benefit to the residents in their ‘real life’ environment, so that public health programme development is based not only in the science but in the application.</p>
              <p id="Par133">Dental care for older people has been a longstanding issue, and the events of this past year has shone a light on the vulnerabilities of those residing in care homes. In addition, there is a focus on preventative public health and with the fact that dental health and general health are intrinsically linked, this research is landing at a pivotal time.</p>
