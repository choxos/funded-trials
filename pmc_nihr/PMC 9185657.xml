                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>People who sustain a hip fracture are typically elderly, frail and require urgent surgery. Hip fracture and the urgent surgery is associated with acute blood loss, compounding patients’ pre-existing comorbidities including anaemia. Approximately 30% of patients require a donor blood transfusion in the perioperative period. Donor blood transfusions are associated with increased rates of infections, allergic reactions and longer lengths of stay. Furthermore, there is a substantial cost associated with the use of donor blood. Cell salvage and autotransfusion is a technique that recovers, washes and transfuses blood lost during surgery back to the patient. The objective of this study is to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of intraoperative cell salvage, compared with standard care, in improving health related quality-of-life of patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Multicentre, parallel group, two-arm, randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 60 years and older with a hip fracture treated with surgery are eligible. Participants will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to either undergo cell salvage and autotransfusion or they will follow the standard care pathway. Otherwise, all care will be in accordance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. A minimum of 1128 patients will be recruited to obtain 90% power to detect a 0.075-point difference in the primary endpoint: EuroQol-5D-5L HRQoL at 4 months post injury. Secondary outcomes will include complications, postoperative delirium, residential status, mobility, allogenic blood use, mortality and resource use.</p>

              <p>Sixty-five thousand patients break their hip every year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Globally, the annual incidence was estimated as 1.26 million in 1990 and hip fractures were associated with 740 000 deaths.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Almost all patients with a hip fracture require operative treatment; either internal fixation or arthroplasty in equal numbers.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Despite efforts to rehabilitate these patients, outcomes following surgery are poor; 30-day mortality was 6.5% in 2016, with 1-year mortality estimated to be 30%; furthermore, patients reported a 25% reduction in health-related quality-of-life at 4 months, disability similar to that seen following a stroke.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 4</xref></p>
              <p>Patients admitted with a hip fracture are typically elderly, frail and have multiple medical comorbidities, including prefracture anaemia.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> As a consequence of the fracture and urgent surgery required, patients sustain acute blood loss, compounding this pre-existing anaemia.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Postoperative anaemia is associated with increased disability, reduced muscle strength and reduced physical performance.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 10</xref> Beyond the perioperative period, anaemia is associated with an increased risk of falls, hospitalisation and mortality.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 11</xref> In this elderly and frail population perioperative allogenic (blood from a donor) blood transfusion is often required.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Allogenic blood transfusions do not come without risks to patients. They cause an increased rate of local (eg, wound) and systemic (eg, pneumonia) infections in postoperative patients.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is attributable to the immunomodulatory effect of allogenic blood on the recipient.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As well as causing infections allogenic blood use is independently associated with increased length of hospital stay in orthopaedic surgery.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Rarer direct complications of allogenic blood use include death and major morbidity.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>The cost to the NHS of blood replacement products is high; the first unit of red cell concentrates costs £170 with subsequent units costing £162.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> At a single major trauma centre, the costs of allogenic blood transfusions for patients with a hip fracture are £62 272 per year (unpublished data). This extrapolates to a direct national cost of approximately £7.28 million. This estimate excludes the costs associated with an increased length of stay and treating infections and other complications of transfusion.</p>
              <p>Concerns regarding patient safety and the costs of allogenic blood have driven efforts to reduce transfusion rates.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Intraoperative cell salvage is a method of collecting blood lost during surgery with an option of transfusing it back to the patient. The cell salvage device filters, washes and centrifuges blood lost during surgery, to separate the red blood cells from non-cellular matter prior to intraoperative autotransfusion. Complications as a result of cell salvage are rare.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>In order to reduce the use of allogenic blood, the NICE guidelines (Blood Transfusion NG24 2015) recommended the use of cell salvage and tranexamic acid where surgical blood loss is expected to be greater than 500mls.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>The direct intraoperative blood loss reported across studies of hip fracture surgery is variable.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–21</xref> Several randomised controlled trials report a mean intraoperative blood loss greater than 500 mL in patients undergoing different types of surgery for a fractured hip.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–25</xref> When intraoperative losses are added to blood lost as a direct result of the fracture, the total blood loss is estimated to be between 550 ml-1300mL.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>When considering whether to use cell salvage, patients with a hip fracture present a unique population. They have a high mortality, high transfusion rates and high degrees of pre-existing morbidity including anaemia. These considerations mean that there are large potential benefits of using cell salvage in this population. Using cell salvage to reduce the use of allogenic blood has the potential benefit to patients of improving their outcomes from hip fracture surgery, by reducing infections, length of stay and levels of anaemia.</p>
              <p>It is currently routine practice to use a restrictive transfusion policy in hip fracture surgery, but the use of cell salvage has not become embedded in this patient group. We propose evaluating the clinical and cost effectiveness of cell salvage and autotransfusion in hip fracture surgery.</p>

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>Patients with a hip fracture are a clinical priority for urgent operative care. All patients with a fracture of the hip are in pain and will have received opiate analgesia. It is therefore understandable that the majority of patients find the initial period of their treatment in hospital confusing and disorientating. Similarly, patients’ next of kin, carers and friends are often anxious at this time and may have difficulty in absorbing the large amounts of information that they are given about the injury and plan for treatment. In this emergency situation, the focus is on obtaining consent for surgery (where possible) and on informing the patient and any next of kin about immediate clinical care. It is often not possible for the patient, relative or carer (consultee) to review trial documentation, consider the information and communicate an informed decision about whether they would wish to participate in the study. The consent procedure for this trial will reflect that of the surgery, with the clinical team assessing capacity before taking consent for the surgical procedure, and this capacity assessment then being used to guide the proper approach to consenting to the research. An appropriate method, in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the code of Practice 2007, and approved by the National Research Ethics Committee, will be used to gain either prospective or retrospective consent form the patient or appropriate consultee by a Good Clinical Practice (GCP)-trained, appropriately delegated member of the research team.</p>

                <title>Postrandomisation withdrawals and exclusion</title>
                <p>Participants/consultees may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice. In addition, the investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary. Throughout the study, screening logs will be kept to determine the number of patients assessed for eligibility and reasons for any exclusion.</p>
                <p>If the participant/consultee withdraws from the study completely, data collected from the participant or recorded in the medical record up until the point of withdrawal will be included in the final analysis. Since randomisation will occur just prior to surgery, data regarding the operation received and autotransfusion blood volume (where deemed possible) will be recorded as a minimum for all participants. Participants who decline to continue to take part once they have regained capacity will be given the opportunity to discuss/inform the research team of the reasoning behind their decision not to take part.</p>
                <p>Similarly, data from participants who die before consent to continue participating can be obtained, will be included in the final analysis. For those participants who lack capacity, and die before advice can be obtained from the participant’s relatives/next of kin, it is our intention not to contact relatives of participants to inform them of the participant’s initial inclusion in the study to avoid distressing the relatives unnecessarily.</p>

                <p>The allocation sequence will be generated by the trial statistician. The treatment allocation will be on a 1:1 basis and will be stratified by fracture type (extracapsular vs intracapsular) and by trial centre, to ensure that any clustering effects within centres are evenly distributed between the treatment groups. The allocation will be administered using secure, online randomisation via a distant computer at Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit (OCTRU), University of Oxford, using RRAMP software. Participants will be randomised preoperatively. The research associate will inform the surgeon and the operating theatre staff of the allocation in the immediate preoperative period.</p>
                <p>In order to negate bias in the self-reported HRQoL outcome measures participants will be blinded to treatment allocation. The operating surgeon cannot be blinded to the allocation but they will not be involved in the assessment of outcomes. Participants will be blinded until the completion of the trial when the blinding will be broken if requested by the participants.</p>

Appropriate preparation, positioning and fracture reduction will be left to the discretion of the operating surgeon, as per their normal clinical practice.

This will typically involve restrictive transfusion thresholds where asymptomatic patients with a haemoglobin concentration of less than 70 g/L are offered allogenic blood. This threshold may be higher, typically a haemoglobin concentration of less than 80 g/L in those with symptomatic anaemia or coexisting cardiorespiratory disease.</p>

They will enquire about hospital contacts related to the index fracture with hospitals other than the index treating sites, rehabilitation units and other care settings. Questions will also ask about the use of equipment and changes to the home, private expenses with rehabilitation services, informal care and loss of productivity.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample size for this study is 1128 participants. This full trial sample size is based on the SD of the EQ-5D-5L at 4 months post surgery of 0.3 points<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and a minimal clinically important difference of 0.075<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> with 2-sided significance of 5% requiring 506 with the primary outcome for 80% power or 676 with the primary outcome for 90% power.</p>
                <p>In this population, we expect considerable loss to follow-up. Previous WHiTE trials have indicated that these losses are due mainly to patients declining consent to further follow-up, incapacity, and death.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40 41</xref> We are able to account for participants who have died in our primary outcome measure and have assumed that only 60% of recruited study participants will be available at the definitive endpoint at 4 months.</p>
                <p>With a significance level of 5%, this inflates the sample size to 844 for 80% power and 1128 for 90% power. Conservatively, we aim to randomise 1128 in order to ensure a minimum of 676 participants with the primary outcome which will ensure 90% power based on these assumptions.</p>
                <p>Similar sample size calculations have been used in existing clinical trials in this patient population (ISRCTN92825709, ISRCTN18393176).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>A full, detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be drafted early in the trial and will be finalised following the recruitment review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and Trial Steering Committee (TSC), and prior to the primary analysis data lock. Any subsequent changes to the SAP will be fully justified in the final report.</p>
                <p>Baseline demographic data will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms. Standard statistical summaries and graphical plots will be presented for the primary outcome measure and all secondary outcome measures.</p>
                <p>The study analysis will use generalised mixed-effect regression models, with all analyses adjusting for important baseline covariates to improve precision in estimation of the treatment effect. The principal analyses will be conducted on the intention-to-treat population. Differences between intervention arms for the primary outcome measure, EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> scores at 4 months post surgery, will be analysed by calculating an adjusted treatment effect using a mixed-effect linear regression. A zero value will be imputed for participants who have died prior to this time point. Models will adjust for age, sex, fracture type and cognitive impairment (as fixed effects) and recruitment centre as a random effect to take account of the heterogeneity in the response between centres. The treatment difference will be estimated from the fitted model, together with 95% CIs, with significance set at 5% (2-sided) for comparative tests.</p>
                <p>A sensitivity analysis will be performed on a per-protocol (as treated) basis. Further sensitivity analysis of EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> at 4 months with additional adjustment for the retrospective preinjury baseline EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> will be carried out to enable the influence of this factor to be evaluated.</p>
                <p>Secondary clinical outcomes will be similarly analysed with logistic mixed-effect regression being used for binary data and linear mixed-effect regression for continuous data.</p>
                <p>Adverse events will be explored to assess if they differ between groups.</p>
                <p>Stata (StatCorp, LP) or other appropriate validated statistical software will be used for all analysis.</p>

                <p>A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from the UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> in the base case analysis. Resource utilisation involving cost of the cell salvage and autotransfusion if applicable will be obtained from case report forms (CRFs) that will be completed by the local research teams. Broader resource utilisation will be captured through CRFs and patient questionnaires administered at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months post surgery. Unit costs for health and social care resources will largely be derived from the latest available local and national sources and estimated in line with best practice. Costs will be standardised to current prices where appropriate. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, will be performed. Results will be presented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, net monetary benefit, and cost effectiveness acceptability curves generated via non-parametric bootstrapping. Multiple imputation methods will be used to impute missing data and avoid biases associated with complete case analysis. Sensitivity analyses involving economic analysis from the societal perspective and extending the time frame from 4 months to 1 year will also be conducted.</p>
