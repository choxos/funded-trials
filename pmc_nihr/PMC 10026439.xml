Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients in the ctDNA-guided arm who are ctDNA negative post-operatively and receive de-escalated ACT compared to the standard arm, the difference in overall survival (OS), neurotoxicity and quality of life between the arms, and the cost-effectiveness of ctDNA-guided therapy compared to SOC treatment. We hypothesise that using a ctDNA-guided approach to ACT decisions is non-inferior to SOC.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par28">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most prevalent cancer in the UK accounting for more than 11% of all new cancer diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with 42,900 patients being diagnosed every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. More than 60% of these patients have early stage disease (stage I, II or III) which is potentially curable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The mainstay of treatment for patients with early colon cancer is surgery, plus adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) in those whose tumours demonstrate high risk histopathological features for recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Early rectal tumours may be managed with surgery alone, or with neo-adjuvant radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy, followed by surgery in those with high risk features. This may be followed by ACT if patients have not received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the context of total neo-adjuvant treatment (TNT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">The 5 year disease free survival (DFS) for patients with stage II and III colon cancer treated with surgery without ACT is 81.4% and 49.0% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with the risk of recurrence being highest in the first 2 years following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ACT aims to help reduce the risk of future recurrence by targeting potential micrometastatic disease. Current standard management of patients with resected high risk stage II and stage III CRC is 3 to 6 months of fluoropyrimidine (FP)-based ACT. ACT treatment decisions are made based on the stage and histopathological features of the resected tumour together with consideration of the patient’s clinical situation including performance status (PS). Accordingly, patients may receive 3 to 6 months of FP chemotherapy in combination with oxaliplatin; oral capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles or infusional 5-fluorauracil plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. Alternatively, those with a poorer PS and/or lower risk histopathological features may receive 6 months of FP monotherapy, either capecitabine or 5-fluorauracil.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In stage III disease, treatment with a FP reduces the risk of cancer recurrence by 41% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with a further 6.9% absolute improvement in 3 year DFS from the addition of oxaliplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Oxaliplatin-based treatment comes at a cost, however. In one study of 346 patients, 89% of patients experienced at least one symptom of acute neuropathy (e.g., sensitivity to the cold) with the first cycle of oxaliplatin. After 18 months, only 19% patients reported more than 30% reduction in symptoms according to the Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20) sensory scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In stage II disease, ACT with FP improves survival by 3.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] with oxaliplatin offering a 5% absolute improvement in 3 year DFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">The UK SCOT study established that reducing ACT duration with CAPOX from 6 to 3 months did not compromise 3 year DFS and reduced the toxicity burden of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These results were later pooled with other global randomised trials in the International Duration of Adjuvant Therapy (IDEA) collaboration which reported a 0.4% difference in 5 year OS, concluding 3 months of CAPOX was non-inferior to 6 months. As a result, 89.5% clinicians changed practice to offer 3 months of chemotherapy for some patients, continuing to preference 6 months of treatment in high risk stage III patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This is now widely considered the standard of care (SOC) ACT regimen for patients with fully resected CRC. Despite this evidence, it is likely that we are still over treating many patients with ACT, who may be cured with surgery alone.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Currently considerations regarding the need for ACT include histopathological features of the resected tumour and other patient factors such as age, comorbidities, PS and patient preference, leading to shared decision making. ctDNA has emerged as a biomarker for minimal residual disease (MRD) and can predict early relapse, offering a tailored approach to individual decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Stage II patients who are ctDNA negative post-operatively have been shown to have a 3 year recurrence free survival (RFS) of 90% compared to 0% in those who are ctDNA positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Similarly in stage III disease 3 year RFS is 76% and 47% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent data from an observational registry, suggests that ACT in patients who are ctDNA negative makes little difference to DFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is potentially exposing patients to unnecessary toxicity which could be safely avoided. By reducing or omitting needless treatment in post-operative ctDNA negative patients, they may be spared the short and long-term side effects of treatment, multiple hospital visits, as well as the potential psychological impact of treatment. Should this study be positive and adopted into standard practice, there could be huge cost-saving implications for the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
              <p id="Par33">We hypothesise that ACT decisions guided by the post-operative ctDNA result will enable biomarker driven selection of patients who would and would not benefit from ACT, and thereby reduce the proportion of patients receiving ACT without compromising DFS. The primary objective is to demonstrate that a de-escalation strategy of ctDNA guided adjuvant chemotherapy is non-inferior to SOC chemotherapy as measured by 3 year DFS in patients with high risk stage II or stage III resected CRC with no evidence of MRD (i.e., those who are ctDNA negative post-operatively).</p>

Patients with rectal cancer who have undergone neo-adjuvant radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy (but not TNT) are also eligible. A list of participating sites is available at Tracking Mutations in Cell Free Tumour DNA to Predict Relapse in Early Colorectal Cancer—Full Text View—ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive either ctDNA guided ACT (intervention; Arm A) or SOC chemotherapy (comparator; Arm B) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Randomisation in a 1:1 ratio is performed centrally at the Institute of Cancer Research – Clinical Trials and Statistical Unit (ICR-CTSU), by random permuted blocks, with results communicated by telephone. The randomisation will be stratified by the following factors: high risk stage II versus stage III, and site of primary tumour (right colon versus left colon versus rectum).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study schema for TRACC Part C</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12885_2023_10699_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

The Guardant Reveal assay is the first and only blood-based tumour-naïve ctDNA assay to detect MRD in early CRC. It leverages several technical advances in ctDNA detection to improve assay sensitivity without requiring a priori knowledge of the tumour genotype. The technique combines genomic and methylation features with independent analyses occurring in parallel to increase sensitivity. It has a turnaround time of 7–14 days for results processed in real time for clinical use. It is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2021, and is already in use in three global interventional clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

As per the statistical design, 1621 patient are required to be recruited and randomised (approximately 810 per arm). Accrual will take place over 4 years across approximately 50 UK sites. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will meet regularly to review the data, and particularly with regards to safety and futility. Any decision by the IDMC to discontinue the trial due to lack of efficacy will endorsed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC).</p>

                <title>Planned recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par52">With a target recruitment of 1621 patients and recruitment ongoing for 4 years, at least 34 patients will need to be recruited per month. We plan to activate up to 50 UK sites, many of which are already participating in our TRACC Part B observational study. Therefore, at least 1–2 patients would need to be recruited at each site per month on average, once all sites are open. We anticipate this recruitment target is achievable given the prevalence of this tumour type and stage in the UK.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par53">We describe the protocol of the multi-centre, prospective, randomised trial designed to compare the 3 year DFS in patients with high risk stage II and stage III fully resected colon and rectal cancers treated with ctDNA guided ACT versus SOC chemotherapy, sponsored by the Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London. The study builds on the results from TRACC Part B; the observational, prospective, translational research study involving serial blood sampling for ctDNA pre- and post-operatively, which demonstrated an improved 12 and 24 month RFS in patients who were ctDNA negative post-operatively.</p>
              <p id="Par54">TRACC Part C is the only ctDNA-guided study of ACT in CRC running in the UK and addresses a research question with significant health economic importance. The DYNAMIC II study is the only reported study in this space to date globally, which provided evidence to support the de-escalation of ACT in patients with resected stage II colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We anticipate that the results of this study, together with the DYNAMIC II study and similar ongoing studies across the world will generate the evidence to support the clinical utility of ctDNA in the MRD de-escalation setting, generating support for a change to standard practice. In doing so, it may spare patients unnecessary chemotherapy and its associated toxicities and saeg the health service significant costs, redirecting resources elsewhere. The use of chemotherapy in this setting may halve.</p>
              <p id="Par55">TRACC Part C is one of the only ctDNA-guided studies using a plasma-only tumour-naïve ctDNA assay for MRD detection in CRC globally. Utilising a blood-only assay with a turnaround time of 7-14 days, where analysis of tumour tissue is not required, lends itself to a more streamlined approach to recruitment within the study, as well as smooth potential future implication into standard clinical practice. The inbuilt patient reported outcomes (PROs), health economic analysis and process evaluation will provide a route to effective implementation in SOC clinical practice within the NHS and elsewhere in the future.</p>
