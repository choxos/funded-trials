                  <p>PERFECT-ER, a multicomponent intervention designed to enhance the recovery of patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment was implemented for 18 months. PERFECT-ER was implemented at ward level ensuring that multiple new and existing practices were undertaken consistently, on the assumption that collectively, small individual advances would improve care delivery for patients.</p>

                  <p>Implementation of the PERFECT-ER intervention examined through regular intervention scores, service improvement staff reports and action plans, and semi-structured interviews and focus groups.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The process evaluation identified points of implementation vulnerability and strength. All wards implemented some elements of PERFECT-ER. Implementation was fragile when ward pressures were high and when ward staff perceived the relative priority of intervention practices to be low. Adaptations to the implementation process may have reduced whole-ward staff engagement with implementation. However, strategical enlistment of senior ward influencers (such as ward managers, orthogeriatricians) combined with service improvement lead in-ward peer pressure tactics facilitated implementation processes.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Our study suggests that implementation was expediated when senior staff were on board as opinion leaders and formally appointed internal implementation leaders exerted their power. Within hierarchical settings such as acute wards, key individuals appeared to influence implementation through endorsement and sometimes enforcement. This indicates that whole-ward interventions may not always require cognitive engagement from all ward staff to implement changes. Future ward-level implementation studies could consider how best to engage staff and most importantly, which staff to best target.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The increasing incidence of dementia is a worldwide public health challenge, requiring multiple strategies including action to improve the quality of healthcare services.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Providing acute care for patients with cognitive impairment (including those with either diagnosed or assumed dementia and/or delirium) is challenging for hospital staff.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Patients with cognitive impairment have complex needs related to delirium, behaviours that challenge, incontinence, dehydration and communication difficulties. These make necessary medical, nursing and rehabilitation processes more difficult for staff to undertake.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4–7</xref></p>
              <p>In acute settings, over 40% of the people with a hip fracture have cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Usual biomedical approaches<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and limited evidence for rehabilitation for these patients<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> create further difficulties for staff. Consequently, patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment have increased risk of unfavourable outcomes,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–16</xref> impaired rehabilitation and recovery,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 17</xref> with a worse prognosis than patients without cognitive impairment.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 18</xref> Hospital staff need to manage these complexities and complex multifaceted interventions to improve quality in healthcare delivery, and outcomes are increasingly required.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>
              <p>The PERFECTED research programme was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), UK, to develop and test an intervention to enhance the recovery of patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment on acute wards. PERFECT-ER is a complex multicomponent service improvement intervention which aims to enhance recovery using multiple marginal gains in the quality of care.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–23</xref> Marginal gains include the implementation of new practices, standardisation of existing practices, ensuring consistency and cultivating a whole-ward ‘in-it-together’ ethos.</p>
              <p>The PERFECT-ER intervention comprises a structured checklist,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Service Improvement Lead (SIL), Process Lead (PL) and implementation manual using a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA) approach to facilitate behaviour change<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> (see logic model, <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). PERFECT-ER is a whole ward approach involving all staff delivering patient care. The PERFECT-ER checklist has 68 practice items (including clinical, functional, psychosocial and cognitive elements), which span admission, preoperative, postoperative, rehabilitation and discharge periods and 15 organisational items, which highlight the policies behind current practices in the hospital. Checklists have been used before to improve the quality of care,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27 28</xref> however such lists rarely change practice unless combined with mechanisms for change within the socio-practice contexts of hospital settings.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> For example, much relational work in hospitals relies on individual staff members and supportive organisational structures.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p>

              <p>PERFECT-ER is implemented by an SIL, a formally appointed internal implementation lead, a qualified healthcare professional, based day-to-day on the selected ward. They attend a 3-day induction training in intervention delivery. They were supported by a senior doctor acting as a PL to facilitate implementation across the organisation. The checklist, designed to overlay current hip fracture pathways, identifies areas of strength and weaknesses in current practice. It is used to score a sample of patients’ notes (documentary evidence) to determine current practice and identify areas for improvement. Scores are shared with staff at action-planning meetings, where discussions create shared action plans to address lower scoring items. The Plan (action plan), Do (implementation), Study (fill in checklist and assess scores), Act (engage ward staff) cycle then recommences.</p>
              <p>As part of the wider PERFECTED programme of research, we conducted a process evaluation of the PERFECT-ER feasibility trial.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref> The aim of this process evaluation was to determine how and under what circumstances the PERFECT-ER intervention was implemented in acute hospital wards and impacted on staff practices and perceptions (for published protocol, see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 32–34</xref></p>

              <p>Qualitative data from process evaluations of trials are widely used to generate understandings of intervention implementation<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> and can be of critical importance.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, there is limited qualitative evidence about the implementation of complex interventions to enhance recovery in hospital settings.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Therefore, to examine implementation in acute wards in detail, we used a mixed methods approach incorporating qualitative data.</p>
              <p>The process evaluation took place in five different acute National Health Service hospital wards in five separate geographical areas across England and Scotland where the PERFECT-ER intervention was being implemented. Resource use and patient and relative outcomes are reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We used the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33 38–41</xref> for the evaluation and the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p>
              <p>Process evaluation data were gathered between August 2016 and March 2018 over seven PDSA cycles (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref> for data collected from each ward). We collected PERFECT-ER checklist scores, SIL-generated reflective reports of implementation activities and action plans and semi-structured interview and focus group data from each ward. PERFECT-ER checklist scores were obtained from patient notes by the SILs. At each ward there were eight checklist time points: 3 months pre-trial, 1.5 months pre-trial, trial baseline, 4 months, 7 months, 10 months, 13 months and end of trial (15 months).</p>

              <p>We undertook: semi-structured face-to-face or telephone interviews with hospital staff and relatives of patients; focus groups with hospital staff; and face-to-face interviews with patients. We purposively sampled ward-based staff (up to 15 from each ward) who had been in contact with the intervention. Interviews and focus groups with staff investigated their knowledge of, and engagement with, the intervention and implementation processes. These were undertaken after trial processes finished to prevent interviews impacting on implementation. Patients and relatives were offered the opportunity to take part in interviews by a research nurse during a follow-up visit for the trial. Interviews were designed to explore patients and relatives’ experiences of the intervention ward. All had capacity to consent. Patients and relatives’ interviews took place in their home or in a private room at the hospital according to their wishes. Interviews and focus groups were conducted by academic researchers not collecting data or consent for the feasibility trial (SPH, TB and VM-T).</p>

PPI representatives provided feedback on participant information materials and the study protocol, and had roles on the Trial Steering Committee, Data Monitoring Ethics Committee and Advisory Groups. For the process evaluation, PPI carer representatives co-interviewed, with researchers, in six interviews with relatives. They received training and support to facilitate this.</p>

                <p>All interviews and focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Identifying features were removed to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. Qualitative analysis was iterative throughout the data collection and thematic, focusing on implementation processes informed by the MRC Process Evaluations of Complex Interventions<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref> including dose, reach, fidelity, adaptations, mechanisms of impact and context and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> in regard to aspects of the inner setting (hospital ward), characteristics of individuals and process. NVivo software was used to manage the data. TB generated initial codes from repeated reading of data, identifying tentative themes, before multiple analysis meetings with the study team (JLC, SPH, FP, VM-T and CF), which refined and developed these analyses both across sites and within individual sites. Quantitative data from PERFECT-ER checklist scores, collected from five patients at each of the five sites at eight time points, were analysed descriptively by ward and implementation cycle.</p>

All wards implemented some elements of PERFECT-ER. Dose varied across wards. Availability of resources appeared to help or hinder implementation. Wards B and C implemented well (PERFECT-ER scores increasing 22% and 12%, respectively, over the study). Wards B and C had dedicated SIL time and clear ward processes which could be used for implementation. Wards A (PERFECT-ER scores increasing 8%), D (PERFECT-ER scores decreasing 7%) and E (PERFECT-ER scores decreasing 9%) struggled with severe ward pressures, including staff shortages, affecting implementation. Wards D and E also had difficulties providing dedicated SIL time and the implementation climate reflected a lack of consistent support from ward staff. Ward D had a different SIL to obtain the baseline data from the rest of the cycles. Average dose delivered was 68%. PERFECT-ER practice items least implemented were: (1) carers given the opportunity to accompany the patient in the recovery room, and (2) pain assessed daily using a pain scale specific to patients with cognitive impairment.</p>

                <p>Ward pressures impacted on staff and their ability to get together as a team as part of implementation.

                <title>Mechanisms of impact</title>
                <p>Multiple mechanisms of impact were identified. A major strategy was peer pressure within the ward environment from SILs who enacted spot checks and audits of whether new or existing intervention practices were carried out, often followed up with reminders, ‘nagging’ and/or education.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>Staff are aware that these need updating regularly and these are now part of the weekly ward audits to establish compliance. (SIL Report, Ward A)</p>

                <p>These actions suggest that SILs, as formally appointed internal implementation leaders, believed in their own self-efficacy in driving and accomplishing implementation goals.</p>
                <p>Networks and communication were key to implementation work. SILs created and used networks; cascading and acquiring information via email correspondence, meetings, presentations to staff members, noticeboard use, education sessions and ongoing informal communication.</p>

                <title>Contextual factors</title>
                <p>The study took place within the context of multiple pressures in all wards. Staffing issues were common. Ward A had extra beds on the ward, low staffing levels, and a lack of senior staff due to the ward manager’s long-term sickness:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>This leaves the ward unsafe and staff are struggling to carry out their required duties never mind embrace change and add to their workload (SIL, Ward A)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>This created barriers to implementing PERFECT-ER. Staff changes meant SILs needed to constantly engage with and inform new colleagues about PERFECT-ER practices on the ward.</p>
                <p>The implementation climate in the inner setting involved a lack of interest from some staff members and resistance to change, which reflected points of implementation vulnerability.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>…at times [it] would demotivate me seeing the lack of engagement from the other staff. (SIL Report, Ward D)</p>

                <p>These quotes reflect the relative low priority of PERFECT-ER among staff.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>PERFECT-ER was developed with the aim of enhancing recovery for people with hip fracture and cognitive impairment by making multiple marginal gains in the quality and consistency of care.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> This process evaluation shows that under certain conditions multiple changes can be implemented leading to multiple marginal gains in quality and consistency and changes in ward ethos. Implementing PERFECT-ER appeared to encourage standardised practices and potentially improved consistency of care for this patient group. Key enablers for implementation were found to be: having dedicated person/s with protected time to drive implementation forward; tapping into existing practices; gaining support from opinion leaders on the ward, using networks and in-ward peer pressure. However, implementation vulnerability occurred when ward pressures were considerable, SILs had limited time and ward staff support was lacking, with marginal gains in care delivery appearing unattainable under these conditions. Overcoming barriers in gaining dedicated SIL time may be a prime way to enhance future consistency in implementation. Staff availability has been identified as a factor in other process evaluations related to hip fracture patients.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 45</xref></p>
              <p>Where ward pressures were high and resources for SILs were low, dose suffered. The process evaluation findings suggest that although the intervention was standardised, implementation fluctuated across wards and over time and therefore was not optimal. Consistent with other observations, findings indicate the importance of ward context in implementation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29–31 46</xref> Ward pressures and inadequate SIL resources contributed to adaptations to the implementation process and sometimes to lack of fidelity in implementation. In response to ward pressures all SILs adapted the implementation process by not conducting ward-level action planning meetings as part of the PDSA cycles. Instead, SILs targeted opinion leaders, using power structures on the wards as mechanisms of impact which may have been stronger to facilitate changes since this approach enabled a successful and streamlined implementation process. Ward staff engagement can be variable even if intervention processes are standardised.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> This adaptation is likely to have created further losses in ward team engagement, staff reflective practices and commitment and explains why reach was limited in some wards with staff desiring greater involvement with PERFECT-ER implementation. Moving forward, mechanisms for planned staff engagement work should be considered carefully in relation to how and who to engage.</p>
              <p>Ongoing interprofessional staff communication in hospitals can take time<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and relies on individual staff members and supportive organisational structures.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In our data, communication work reflected SIL perceptions of self-efficacy through networking with key staff to drive implementation and their employment of peer pressure mechanisms within the ward setting working to obtain compliance. Peer pressure is a component of the CFIR,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> but in relation to competitiveness with other organisations outside of the inner-ward setting. Our data showed a different type of peer pressure, enacted to maximise compliance within the ward setting using power mechanisms provided by the status of the SIL role itself.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>Our study benefits from multiple sources of data collected from a variety of stakeholders to examine implementation. Data collection involved PPI acting as co-interviewers. Data encompassed several cycles of implementation, obtaining a comprehensive view of the changes over time, processes of implementation, network usage and the role of contextual factors in implementation. Considering the challenges involved when caring for patients with hip fracture and cognitive impairment and the consequent variability in the quality of care,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 4–7 10–12</xref> our finding that implementing an enhanced recovery checklist appears to encourage standardised practices for this population is promising. Although the findings examined here only relate to five implementation wards, key themes were demonstrated across these and provide a useful starting point for implementation of future complex interventions in acute ward settings and further use of PERFECT-ER.</p>
                <p>Limitations to this study include its reliance on SIL-generated data and most patients and carers being unable to compare usual and ‘enhanced’ care. Patient recruitment for interviews was difficult due to the levels of cognitive impairment, resulting in few patient participants. Most relatives interviewed were one generation younger than the patients, consequently their opinions regarding hospital care may differ. Additionally, staff members who participated in interviews or focus groups may have been those more open to the intervention and to change. The PERFECT-ER intervention required SILs to complete the checklist from individual patient documentary evidence to which researchers did not have access, to provide validation or incorporate assessments of inter-rater reliability. There may have also been inconsistency in intervention scoring. Although participants reported improved standardisation of practices, we cannot ascertain if the indicated implementation reflected change in care delivery, documentation practices or, in some cases, SIL self-implementation. Lastly, this evaluation was of a feasibility, not efficacy trial,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 23</xref> and it is not yet known whether the changes influence patient outcomes. This may have reduced the motivation of hospital ward staff to implement PERFECT-ER.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Establishing the conditions under which PERFECT-ER was implemented has made visible potential sources of implementation vulnerability such as staffs’ perceived priority of the intervention being low, ward pressures and limited improvement lead resources. Our study suggests that due to pressures, most ward staff were not optimally engaged in implementation processes. Rather key senior staff were enlisted as opinion leaders and improvement leads employed peer pressure to further implementation. That key individuals successfully endorsed and enforced implementation indicates that whole-ward interventions may not always require cognitive engagement from all ward staff to implement changes. Future ward-level implementation studies could consider how best to engage staff and which staff groups to target.</p>
