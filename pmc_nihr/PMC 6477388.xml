                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Foot ulceration is a multifactorial complication of diabetes. Therapeutic insoles and footwear are frequently used to reduce elevated tissue pressures associated with risk of foot ulceration. A novel protocol using in-shoe pressure measurement technology to provide an instant optimised insole and house shoe solution has been developed, with the aim of reducing foot ulceration.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study is a participant and assessor blinded, randomised, multicentre parallel group feasibility trial with embedded qualitative study. Seventy-six participants will be recruited from three podiatry clinics and randomised to an optimised insole plus usual care (intervention group) or standard insole plus usual care (control group) using a minimisation by randomisation procedure by study centre and previous ulcer status. Assessment visits and data collection will be at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Feasibility and acceptability of the trial procedures will be determined in terms of recruitment and retention rates, data completion rates, intervention adherence and effectiveness of the blinding.</p>
                  <p>Assessment of the appropriateness and performance of outcome measures will inform selection of the primary and secondary outcomes and sample size estimate for the anticipated definitive randomised controlled trial. Clinical outcomes include incidence of plantar foot ulceration and change in peak plantar pressure. Twelve participants (four from each centre) and three treating podiatrists (one from each centre) will be interviewed to explore their experiences of receiving and delivering the intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Foot ulceration is a devastating multifactorial complication of diabetes. It is expected that 25% of people with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer at some point.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Foot ulceration is a limb and life-threatening condition known to precede 80% of all diabetic lower limb amputations.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>It is estimated that 30% of people with diabetes have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a primary risk factor for the development of foot ulceration.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The forefoot region is most susceptible to foot ulceration, particularly in neuropathic feet absent of protective sensation, where plantar loads and tissue stress are increased.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Therapeutic footwear and insoles are provided to offload and reduce harmful tissue stresses in people with diabetes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Guidelines for foot care for people with diabetes recommend the use of therapeutic footwear and insoles in the preventative management of those at risk of foot ulceration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>The efficacy of offloading the diabetic, neuropathic foot through the use of therapeutic footwear and insoles varies considerably.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9–12</xref> This variability may be explained by different study designs, and a lack of consensus in prescriptions for therapeutic footwear and insoles between clinicians, clinics and services which are largely based on expert opinion and clinical experience.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There are no studies or protocols to indicate the optimal features or efficiency of the different devices designed to improve outcomes.</p>
              <p>The use of an objective approach to guide footwear and insole design to improve clinical outcomes has been suggested. The use of pedobarography to identify vulnerable areas and influence the position and type of footwear and insole modifications may offer a more optimised approach and improve offloading outcomes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Arts <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Waaijman <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> introduced modifications to therapeutic footwear and insoles guided by in-shoe pressure technology, both noting reductions in peak pressure of 6.7%–24% and 15%–23%, respectively, compared with premodification. Lin <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> used in-shoe technology to guide the defined removal of ‘plugs’ at sites of interest out of the insole and achieved 32% peak pressure reduction. However current protocols focus only on altering the distribution of pressure across the weight-bearing foot. As yet, no consideration has been given to the temporal aspect of gait. Specifically, that total contact area between foot to floor (and therefore insole function) is dependent on the phase of gait and gait style.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first protocol that uses pedobarography to categorise the temporal loading pattern of the foot according to gait style, combined with information from pressure patterns. This information informs the design of insoles to optimally reduce in-shoe pressure through the implementation of a simple standardised algorithm. The insole is manufactured and issued at the same appointment, avoiding detrimental delays. This protocol describes a feasibility study to assess the implementation of a novel insole design algorithm aimed at producing insoles which optimally reduce in-shoe peak pressure and subsequent ulceration risk in people with diabetes and neuropathy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess if a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) using a novel protocol is feasible.</p>
              <p>Following recommendations from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) collaboration<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> this feasibility trial will allow operational experience to inform the conduct and final design of a definitive trial so that it can be successfully delivered with confidence.</p>

                <p>The Insoles to Ease Pressure (INSTEP) Study is a participant and assessor blinded, randomised, multicentre parallel group feasibility trial with an embedded qualitative study. A CONSORT Study flow chart is presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) which outlines the flow of participants through the trial. Seventy-six participants will be randomised (allocation ratio 1:1) to receive an optimised insole plus usual care (intervention) or standard insole plus usual care (control). We will generate and implement the minimisation by randomisation procedure through a web-based system. This will ensure equal numbers of participants in the two groups by location, study centres and by previous ulceration status. Intervention group allocation (in a 1:1 ratio) will be revealed to the treatment podiatrist after the collection of baseline data. Insole and footwear will be issued by the same podiatrist immediately after randomisation. The allocated insole will be worn for 12 months. After initial baseline assessment, outcome measures will be attained at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postrandomisation.</p>

                <p>A subsample of 12 trial participants (4 from each centre) and three treating podiatrists (one from each centre) will be purposely selected. Semistructured interviews will be used to qualitatively explore their experiences of receiving/delivering the intervention. In addition, a further six participants will complete a daily journal with a 1-week account of their experiences at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.</p>
                <p>Trial centres are three community hospitals located in the south-west of England: Torbay (Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust), Exeter (Royal Devon and Exeter Foundation NHS Trust) and Solent (Solent NHS Trust).</p>

                <p>People with diabetes and neuropathy will be identified and initially screened for eligibility by the usual podiatry clinical team, while attending for a routine foot care appointment located within the hospital-based multidisciplinary diabetic team foot clinic or podiatry community clinic. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Potential participants will be given a brief verbal explanation of the trial by their treating podiatrist and provided with written information. They will have at least 24 hours to review this information and ask any further questions before volunteering to participate. Potential participants will be telephoned to confirm their continued willingness to participate and offered an appointment for baseline measurement. Written informed consent will be obtained by a Good Clinical Practice trained nurse or podiatrist at the baseline visit.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Two different insoles will be evaluated for feasibility and acceptability in this trial: instant optimised insole (intervention) and cushioned inlay insole (control). Both insoles will be custom-made to foot size and constructed using materials commonly used in the manufacture of insoles for people with diabetes. Each insole will be fitted into a Pulman house shoe, which will be measured to fit the participants’ foot. In addition, both insoles will have an activated data logger (Orthotimer, Algeos, Liverpool, UK) embedded into the insole to measure adherence.</p>

                  <title>Optimised insole</title>
                  <p>The instant optimised insole will be designed and optimised using the F-scan in-shoe pressure analysis system (Tekscan, Boston, Massachusetts, USA). A novel algorithm based on walking gait style (Mr Wobbly, Mr Stompee, Mr Propulsive) has been developed. The design and modification(s) will be informed by the treatment algorithm (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary material 1</xref>). The optimised insole will consist of a preconstructed base (slim-flex, full-length, low-density, Shore A30, Algeos, UK). Regions of interest (ROIs) therein may be further formed to accommodate for prominent areas, with the addition of modifications that are designed to offload pressures from bony prominences in specific regions. These will be used to reduce peak plantar pressure values in conjunction with real-time pressure data from the F-scan system in the specific ROIs.</p>

In addition, clinical information will be obtained from the patient and their medical notes including demographics (gender, age, height, weight, smoker/non-smoker, ethnicity), medical history (type 1 or type 2 diabetes, time since diabetes diagnosis, history of previous foot ulceration, current foot ulceration, other medical conditions), blood glycated haemoglobin levels and glomerular filtration rate.

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Participants will perform in-shoe measurement tests with the treating podiatrist. The F-Scan in-shoe pressure measurement system (Tekscan, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) is capable of reliable and repeatable data collection.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref> The F-scan system sensors are connected to a computer via a cuff unit and a 9.14 m long cable. Data are collected at a sampling rate of 50 Hz for 4 s. The TekScan software identifies pressures from 960 sensing locations on the plantar foot. Plantar pressures can be identified from individual samples or peak pressures can be identified over a total stance phase.</p>
                <p>To optimise the accuracy and repeatability of the data collected within this study the following precautions will be incorporated within the data collection protocol. New sensors will be provided for each participant for each individual foot, labelled and used to collect data from that foot throughout the duration of the study. Participants will put on standard socks (20 denier stockings) and will be fitted with a standard house shoe (Markell Shoe Company, Yonkers, New York, USA). Any callus on the foot will be removed prior to fitting the socks and footwear, and prior to any recording.</p>
                <p>Using a standardised protocol, participants will then be asked to undertake two test walks between chairs.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> This will allow the determination of usual gait velocity and for acclimatisation of the sensors. Between the chairs a premarked 5 m walkway with a little extra at each end to allow for deceleration and acceleration of gait will be used to determine gait velocity (m/s). This will be calculated by stopwatch recording of the time taken to pass between the marks. The walks will allow for the sensors to bed in and the temperature to reach equilibrium. Before each data collection session each patient will be weighed and each pair of insoles calibrated against body weight. Following calibration, if sensor saturation pressure exceeds 2000 kPa the sensor will be discarded. Calibration will be checked for within-foot and between-foot repeatability, and if excessive variation of ±10% is observed, the sensor will be recalibrated.</p>
                <p>The test will consist of two runs initially. However, extra runs may be required if gait velocity is not consistent (a maximum of 5% deviation will be allowed). From each run, a minimum of three steps per foot is required to be analysed (excluding first and last steps of each run).</p>
                <p>Using recorded F-Scan data, a maximum of three ‘Regions of Interest’ can be identified for each participant, where <italic>ROI=mean peak pressure &gt;350 kPa and/or is a recently healed ulcer site(s) or callus/corn formation.</italic> In addition, identification of type of gait style (Mr Wobbly, Mr Stompee, Mr Propulsive) by analysis of the recorded F-scan pressure time curve and force time curve will occur.</p>

In-shoe pressure measurement testing, described in the baseline visit, will be repeated. Outcome measures will be collected at each visit. Participants who cease involvement in the study prior to the visits will be invited to report the reason. This will be optional.</p>

                <p>As this is a feasibility trial the sample size is pragmatic and a power calculation is neither relevant nor possible. In this feasibility trial, while centres are likely to start recruitment in a staggered fashion, our overall target recruitment will be 2 per month per centre up to a total of 76 participants (38 per group). A CI approach has been used to establish feasible adherence rates. Based on an estimated completion rate of 75%, at least 75 patients are required. This is based on obtaining a 95% CI for a single proportion with a specified lower bound of the CI of 0.70 and a marginal error of 0.05. Data collected on proposed secondary outcomes will provide data on which sample size calculations can be performed in the future RCT.</p>

In cases of prolongation of hospitalisation, death or significant clinical sequelae, these events are defined as serious AEs (SAEs), the occurrence of which will be informed to the study sponsor and the TSC at short notice. During protocol treatment, all deaths, all SAEs that are life-threatening and any unexpected SAE must be reported to the chief investigator using the SAE form within 48 hours of the initial observation of the event. In this trial, only those non-serious AEs associated with the lower limb, foot and mobility need to be reported. Safety aspects of the study will be monitored by the TSC, which will receive unblinded data for its judgement.</p>
                <p>To standardise and optimise implementation of the intervention, and to further ensure the safety and well-being of research participants, all participants will be provided with standardised information on footwear and insole usage, how to increase wear time of the insoles, foot self-inspection and what to do in the event of a ‘foot attack’. This information will be reiterated at each appointment by the treating podiatrist. Participants will be advised to contact the treating podiatrist should any problems occur, in order that they can advise remanagement of these issues.</p>

              <p>Current trends in the provision of insoles and therapeutic footwear are diverse for people with diabetes and neuropathy at risk of foot ulceration.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> A scarcity of evidence base for the appropriate design, modification and manufacture results in a lack of clear guidance for clinicians. As healthcare systems are also moving towards personalised medicine, the use of an in-shoe pressure measurement system and insole paradigm that will guide and personalise insoles and therapeutic footwear with no manufacturing delays has been developed.</p>
              <p>The main limitations of the study are those characteristic of feasibility studies, the lack of power to present a statistically significant difference in outcomes. It may have a high dropout rate, so predictors of discontinuation should be assessed comparing characteristics of compliant patients with those who were lost to follow-up.</p>
              <p>However, and despite the aforementioned limitations, the findings and outputs from the proposed feasibility study will take us closer to designing a future cost-effective trial in people with diabetes and neuropathy at risk of foot ulceration.</p>
