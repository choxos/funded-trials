                <p><bold><italic>Background.</italic></bold> The need for a highly efficacious vaccine against <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> remains pressing. In this controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study, we assessed the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of a schedule combining 2 distinct vaccine types in a staggered immunization regimen: one inducing high-titer antibodies to circumsporozoite protein (RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub>) and the other inducing potent T-cell responses to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) by using a viral vector.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Method.</italic></bold> Thirty-seven healthy malaria-naive adults were vaccinated with either a chimpanzee adenovirus 63 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara–vectored vaccine expressing a multiepitope string fused to TRAP and 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> (group 1; n = 20) or 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> alone (group 2; n = 17). CHMI was delivered by mosquito bites to 33 vaccinated subjects at week 12 after the first vaccination and to 6 unvaccinated controls.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold> No suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or severe adverse events related to vaccination were reported. Protective vaccine efficacy was observed in 14 of 17 subjects (82.4%) in group 1 and 12 of 16 subjects (75%) in group 2. All control subjects received a diagnosis of blood-stage malaria parasite infection. Both vaccination regimens were immunogenic. Fourteen protected subjects underwent repeat CHMI 6 months after initial CHMI; 7 of 8 (87.5%) in group 1 and 5 of 6 (83.3%) in group 2 remained protected.</p>
                <p><bold><italic>Conclusions.</italic></bold> The high level of sterile efficacy observed in this trial is encouraging for further evaluation of combination approaches using these vaccine types.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Malaria remains one of the leading causes of mortality globally [<xref rid="JIW244C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and there is urgent need for a vaccine. The majority of deaths are in children &lt;5 years old, with this age group accounting for approximately 306 000 deaths in 2015. The enormous economic and social consequences of malaria have been well documented [<xref rid="JIW244C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Efforts to develop effective vaccines are complicated by the complex immunology of malaria parasite infection, and no reliable natural model of complete immunity exists. Despite this, a small number of candidate vaccines have shown partial efficacy against experimental and natural human infection, with the current leading vaccine being the recombinant protein in adjuvant, RTS,S/AS01. RTS,S targets circumsporozoite protein (CS), which is expressed by the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sporozoite at the preerythrocytic stage and was the first subunit vaccine to show high rates of sterile efficacy, typically 50%, in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a large African phase 3 trial, this vaccine had an efficacy against clinical malaria of 55.8% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 50.6%–60.4%) in children aged 5–17 months and 31.3% (23.6%–38.3%) in infants aged 6–12 weeks over the first year after vaccination [<xref rid="JIW244C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Vaccine efficacy wanes over time but can be enhanced by a fourth dose [<xref rid="JIW244C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Analysis of the immunological correlates of efficacy of this vaccine suggest that vaccine-induced antibodies targeting CS are the most important mediators of RTS,S-induced protection against malaria [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], although no antibody level threshold has been shown to be predictive of efficacy. The rate at which anti-CS antibodies wane is similar to the rate at which efficacy declines [<xref rid="JIW244C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], suggesting that anti-CS antibodies may also be associated with the duration of protection. A number of factors, including age at vaccination, human immunodeficiency virus status, and high baseline anti-CS antibody titers influence anti-CS antibody titers after vaccination with RTS,S [<xref rid="JIW244C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
            <p>The preerythrocytic stage of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection presents an attractive target for an efficacious human vaccine because sufficient reduction in the number of viable merozoites reaching the blood from the liver will prevent parasitization of red blood cells and initiation of the symptomatic blood stage of infection. Anti-CS antibodies can target sporozoites for destruction prior to hepatocyte invasion. Because sporozoites travel from the skin to liver within minutes, it may be difficult for a vaccine to achieve complete protection against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> based solely on antibodies to sporozoites. The liver stage of infection provides a longer window of opportunity for cell-mediated immunity to recognize and destroy infected hepatocytes. Chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) with a multiepitope string fused to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP) insert and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) with the ME-TRAP insert are viral-vectored vaccines, and when they are administered in a prime-boost sequence at an 8-week interval, they are a leading candidate vaccine strategy targeting the liver stage of infection [<xref rid="JIW244C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The ChAd63 and MVA viral vectors deliver the recombinant ME-TRAP insert, which generates a potent cellular immune response against the liver-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigen, TRAP, of greater magnitude than the cellular response induced by RTS,S/AS01. This strategy showed durable partial efficacy in 2 phase 2a sporozoite challenge trials in the United Kingdom [<xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], using the 3D7 parasite as a challenge strain. The viral vector–encoded <italic>P. falciparum</italic> TRAP allele is from the heterologous T9/96 strain, and induced T-cell responses correlate with efficacy [<xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, these are effectively heterologous strain CHMI studies. Interestingly, a higher level of efficacy of 67% (95% CI, 33%–83%) against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was observed in a phase 2b trial in Kenyan adults [<xref rid="JIW244C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Again, T cells to TRAP peptides correlated with vaccine efficacy, but the short duration of malaria transmission and follow-up at this trial site precluded analysis of the durability of vaccine-induced protection [<xref rid="JIW244C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This heterologous prime-boost strategy showed potent cellular immunogenicity in adults in the United Kingdom [<xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], as well as adults and infants in malaria-endemic areas [<xref rid="JIW244C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="JIW244C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (Ewer et al, unpublished data) and has an excellent track record of safety and tolerability in these populations. Analysis of the potential utility of combining antisporozoite and anti–liver-stage vaccines have suggested a likely additive or synergistic effect [<xref rid="JIW244C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], in keeping with findings from preclinical studies [<xref rid="JIW244C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
            <p>In this phase 1/2a, open-labeled, CHMI study, we assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a vaccine schedule combining these 2 distinct candidate vaccine types in a staggered immunization regimen: one that induces very high titer antibodies to CS, using RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub>, and another that induces potent T-cell responses to TRAP, using viral vectors.</p>

The CHMI procedure was performed as previously described [<xref rid="JIW244C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] at Imperial College, London, using 5 infectious bites from <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain 3D7. All subjects were infected with a single batch of mosquitoes at the initial CHMI and with a second single batch at the repeat CHMI. Infected mosquitoes were supplied by the Department of Entomology, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (Washington D.C.). Healthy, malaria-naive males and nonpregnant females aged 18–45 years were invited to participate in the study. All volunteers gave written informed consent prior to participation, and the study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP).</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>This phase 2a, open-labeled, partially randomized challenge trial consisted of 4 cohorts. Allocation to study group occurred at screening and was based on subject preference. Any subjects without a preference were randomly assigned to vaccine group 1 or vaccine group 2. Group 1 (n = 20) received 5 vaccinations (RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> 50 µg at 0, 4, and 8 weeks, ChAd63 ME-TRAP 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles at 2 weeks, and MVA ME-TRAP 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units at 10 weeks); group 2 (n = 20) received 3 vaccinations (RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> 50 µg at 0, 4, and 8 weeks); and group 3 (n = 6) received no vaccinations. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid region of the arm. In each volunteer, all RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> injections were given in one arm, and all viral vector injections were given in the contralateral arm. All subjects underwent initial CHMI by mosquito bite at the same time (week 12 after first vaccination for vaccinated subjects). Following CHMI, a diagnosis of blood-stage malaria parasite infection was made in subjects with symptoms suggestive of malaria and positive findings of thick film microscopy or, if either thick film was negative or symptoms were absent, in subjects with a qPCR result of &gt;500 parasites/mL [<xref rid="JIW244C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Vaccinated subjects who had not developed blood-stage malaria by day 21 after CHMI were deemed to exhibit sterile protection and were invited to undergo repeat CHMI 6 months later, for which an additional control group (group 4) was recruited.</p>

                <p>Eighty subjects were screened for eligibility, and 48 subjects were identified as eligible. Twenty subjects were allocated to group 1 to receive RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> and viral vectors encoding ME-TRAP. Seventeen subjects were allocated to group 2 to receive RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> only. Six unvaccinated controls were recruited to group 3 for the initial CHMI, and 5 subjects were allocated to group 4 for the repeat CHMI. Vaccinations took place between 2 September 2013 and 13 November 2013. Prior to CHMI, 3 subjects withdrew from group 1, and 1 subject withdrew from group 2. There were no withdrawals due to safety concerns, and no predefined study stopping or holding rules were activated. CHMI was performed on 25 and 26 November 2013, and repeat CHMI was performed on 13 May 2014 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIW244F1">1</xref>).

                <title>Protective Efficacy Against CHMI</title>
                <p>A total of 39 subjects participated in the initial CHMI (17 subjects from group 1, 16 subjects from group 2, and 6 subjects from group 3), which was conducted over 2 days. Three subjects in group 1 and 4 subjects in group 2 received a diagnosis of malaria before day 21 after challenge, resulting in a sterile efficacy of 82.4% (95% CI, 64%–100%) and 75% (95% CI, 54–96), respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIW244F2">2</xref>). The median time to diagnosis was 14.5 days in group 1 and 13.25 days in group 2. All 6 control subjects received a diagnosis of malaria, with a median time to diagnosis of 12.25 days (range, 11–13 days; SD, 0.7 days). Both vaccine regimens demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of malaria parasite infection over controls in the per protocol analysis (group 1 hazard ratio [HR], 0.065; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001; group 2 HR, 0.12; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001 for group 2), but there was no significant difference in efficacy between vaccine regimen (HR, 0.65; <italic>P</italic> .57). Eight protected subjects from group 1 and 6 protected subjects from group 2 agreed to undergo repeat CHMI. A single subject each from group 1 and group 2 received a diagnosis of malaria, on day 17 and day 14.5, respectively, and all 5 control subjects developed malaria, with a mean time to diagnosis of 12.4 days (median, 12.5 days; range, 11.5–13.5 days; SD, 0.8 days).

T-cell responses against ME-TRAP were well maintained over time, with a median of 464 SFCs per million PBMCs (IQR, 231–933 SFCs per million PBMCs) 90 days after initial challenge and 342 SFCs per million PBMCs (IQR, 143–815 SFCs per million PBMCs) in participating subjects the day before repeat CHMI.

                <p>Flow cytometry using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) was performed for CS and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) on day 42 after the first vaccination and on the day before challenge, using cryopreserved PBMCs.

                <p>Ex vivo IFN-γ ELISPOT analysis revealed a trend toward higher responses to CS peptides in group 1 as compared to group 2 (<italic>P</italic> = .0517, by the Mann–Whitney test on combined groups); when assessed by peptide pool, a significant trend toward higher responses was observed in pool 1 (<italic>P</italic> = .0380, by the Mann–Whitney test). This is likely due to CS epitope(s) present in the ME string of ChAd63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP. Ex vivo IFN-γ data suggest that this epitope lies toward the N-terminus of CS, as identified by a significantly higher group 1 response to peptide pool 1. The ME string contains 2 epitopes present in pool 1: CD8 epitope cp26 KPKDELDY and CD4 epitope DPNANPN, as part of a longer ME sequence, DPNANPNNVDPNANPNV (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIW244TB1">1</xref>). As the main differences in ICS-determined IFN-γ production were in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell compartment, epitope DPNANPN could be responsible for the enhanced CS responses in group 1. This epitope is not present in RTS,S, so it was solely induced by ChAd63.MVA ME-TRAP prime boost vaccination.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Both RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> and ChAd63-MVA encoding ME-TRAP have previously demonstrated partial efficacy in CHMI trials [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but this is the first study in which RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> and ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP have been given to subjects in the same vaccine regimen. In this study, we have shown that administering these vaccines sequentially is safe, with no SUSARs and no vaccine-related serious AEs. The reactogenicity profile observed in the subjects who received the combined vaccine regimen (group 1) was similar to that observed when RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> or ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP were given alone in a malaria-naive adult population [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these vaccine candidates remain immunogenic when the regimens are combined. Anti-CS antibodies were not significantly different between group 1 and group 2 on the day before challenge, and peak numbers of TRAP-specific T cells in group 1 were similar to those observed with ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP administered alone in a previous study [<xref rid="JIW244C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. GMTs of anti-CS antibodies were significantly higher in protected subjects on the day before challenge, but there was no correlation between any TRAP- or CS-specific T cell counts or TRAP-specific IgG and protection.</p>
              <p>In this study, we observed a high level of protective efficacy in both vaccine arms. A higher proportion of subjects in group 1 remained protected following CHMI than in group 2 (82.4% vs 75%), although this difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .57). This high level of vaccine efficacy was also seen to be durable at 6 months, with 87.5% and 83.3% of initially protected subjects who underwent repeat CHMI remaining protected in groups 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, a higher proportion of subjects in group 1 reached the secondary efficacy end points of delayed time to malaria diagnosis and delayed time to PCR-confirmed parasitemia, compared with group 2. The trends observed in this study for initial challenge, rechallenge, and effects on the prepatent period are encouraging for further evaluation of the group 1 regimen, but the numbers in this study are small, and the differences observed not statistically significant. In 2013, a CHMI study of the cryopreserved whole sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine reported sterile efficacy of 100% in the high-dose regimen, consisting of 5 doses of 1.35 × 10<sup>5</sup> parasites [<xref rid="JIW244C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the vaccinee numbers in the high-dose group were small (n = 6), and only 5 of 6 unvaccinated controls (83.3%) developed blood-stage infection, raising concerns over the infectivity of the parasites used in that CHMI. The results observed in the trial we present in this article therefore are amongst the highest published sterile vaccine efficacy in any CHMI study in which all control subjects were infected.</p>
              <p>The level of protective efficacy observed in the RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> alone group (75%) is higher than has been reported in most prior CHMI studies of this vaccine regimen [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIW244C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mean time to patency in the control group of 12.2 days indicates that this was not an unusually weak challenge, and the vaccination and CHMI methods used in this trial are largely comparable to those in other CHMI studies of this dosing schedule of RTS,S/AS01 [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Practical limitations on study size are a factor for both this study and prior CHMI studies of RTS,S, resulting in a relatively small historical data set. In light of this, it is possible that the higher efficacy seen in the RTS,S alone group in this trial is a chance finding due in part to small numbers, or that further CHMI studies of RTS,S/AS01 in malaria-naive subjects, including further evaluation of differing dosing regimens and schedules, would further clarify the efficacy of the vaccine in this setting. The study was designed to have 84% power to detect a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) increase in sterile efficacy in group 1 to 90% and 69% power to detect a significant increase to 85%, compared with group 2. This power calculation assumed an expected 50% sterile efficacy in group 2 [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The increase in efficacy to 82.4% in group 1 from 75% in group 2 observed in this trial was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .69), but the power to detect a statistically significant improvement was very limited. Practical limitations of CHMI trials makes conducting large studies difficult, and designing future studies with sufficient power would be complicated, assuming an efficacy of 75% in an RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> alone group. One alternative approach is to wait longer after immunization, to allow vaccine efficacy to wane and thereby provide greater power to detect additive or synergist effects of combination vaccines. Further consideration of this issue and of the practical limitations of CHMI studies with challenge 3–4 weeks after the last vaccination in future trial designs is warranted.</p>
              <p>We undertook a rechallenge of protected subjects 6 months after the initial CHMI, and 7 of 8 group 1 subjects (87.5%) and 5 of 6 group 2 subjects (83.3%) remained protected. By simply calculating the product of the percentage efficacies in the 2 CHMIs, one can estimate vaccine efficacy at 6–7 months after the immunizations as a measure of durable sterile protection. For group 1, this is 72% [(14/17) ×( 7/8) × 100], and for group 2, it is 62.5% [(12/16) × (5/6) × 100)]. Again, the durable protection rate at this time point in group 2 appears higher than in previous rechallenge trials with RTS,S/AS01<sub>B</sub> administered 3 times [<xref rid="JIW244C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and the group 1 protection rate is even higher. This durability at 6 months is also encouraging for continued investigation of combination vaccine approaches and supports the consideration of delayed CHMI as an approach to evaluating improvements in efficacy provided by vaccines that confer substantial short-term efficacy.</p>
              <p>In this trial, we present data from a combined vaccine regimen in which subjects received 5 vaccinations over a 10-week period. A priority for future studies should be to evaluate the effect of simplifying the vaccination schedule. A study evaluating the concomitant administration of RTS,S with viral vectors expressing ME-TRAP, thereby reducing the total number of vaccinations in a more practical schedule for potential deployment, is currently underway. These results are encouraging for further evaluation of malaria vaccine regimens that combine viral vectors with protein subunits and also vaccine regimens that target multiple stages of the malaria parasite life cycle.</p>
