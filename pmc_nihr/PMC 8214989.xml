                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is an urgent need to idenfy treatments for COVID-19 that reduce illness duration and hospital admission in those at higher risk of a longer illness course and complications.</p>

                  <p>The Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older peoPLE trial is an open-label, multiarm, prospective, adaptive platform, randomised clinical trial to evaluate potential treatments for COVID-19 in the community. A master protocol governs the addition of new interventions as they become available, as well as the inclusion and cessation of existing intervention arms via frequent interim analyses. The first three interventions are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline. Eligible participants must be symptomatic in the community with possible or confirmed COVID-19 that started in the preceding 14 days and either (1) aged 65 years and over or (2) aged 50–64 years with comorbidities. Recruitment is through general practice, health service helplines, COVID-19 ‘hot hubs’ and directly through the trial website. Participants are randomised to receive either usual care or a study drug plus usual care, and outcomes are collected via daily online symptom diary for 28 days from randomisation. The research team contacts participants and/or their study partner following days 7, 14 and 28 if the online diary is not completed. The trial has two coprimary endpoints: time to first self-report of feeling recovered from possible COVID-19 and hospital admission or death from possible COVID-19 infection, both within 28 days from randomisation. Prespecified interim analyses assess efficacy or futility of interventions and to modify randomisation probabilities that allocate more participants to interventions with better outcomes.</p>

              <p>The SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has now infected over 98 million people globally, with over 2 million deaths.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As of 23 January 2021, 3 583 907 confirmed cases and 95 981 deaths had been reported in the UK.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is an urgent need to identify interventions against COVID-19 suitable for wide use in the community that have been proven to be effective in reducing symptom duration or hospitalisation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We urgently need to know whether potential COVID-19 treatments that are available for rapid pragmatic evaluation might modify the course of COVID-19 infections, particularly among those who are at higher risk of complications, such as those aged 50 years and over with comorbidity and those aged 65 years and over.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref></p>
              <p>The majority of reported trials have been conducted in hospital settings, and there is little evidence from community settings, where most people with COVID-19 receive care and where deployment of effective early treatment could speed time to recovery and reduce complications.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 9</xref></p>
              <p>We established a multiarm, adaptive platform, randomised controlled trial for community treatment of COVID-19 syndromic illness in people at higher risk of an adverse illness course.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>The Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older peoPLE (PRINCIPLE) study is an open-label, multiarm, prospective, adaptive platform, randomised clinical trial in community care. A ‘platform trial’ is an adaptive clinical trial in which multiple treatments for the same disease are tested simultaneously. The platform trial design allows further interventions to be added while the trial is in progress and for futile interventions to be dropped via frequent interim analyses.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–12</xref> In addition, response adaptive randomisation is used to allocate more participants to interventions resulting in better outcomes, potentially leading to more rapid and efficient discovery of beneficial interventions.</p>
                <p>Participants are randomised to either usual care or usual care plus a study drug. Usual care is not specified or mandated in the protocol but refers to the care that participants receive, decided on by the responsible treating clinician. The first three interventions included are hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and doxycycline. A master protocol<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> defines prospective decision criteria to allow for dropping a treatment for futility, declaring a treatment superior, or adding a new treatment to be tested. If at any point, usual care plus a study drug is deemed superior to usual care alone for both the recovery and hospitalisation coprimary endpoints (see further), the superior treatment will be incorporated into usual care as the new standard of care. Because the process of dropping and adding treatments may be ongoing for an indefinite period of time, platform trials may be better conceived of as a process rather than a single clinical trial.</p>

                <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                <p>All participants provide informed consent, online or by telephone, before participation. An independent Data Monitoring and Safety Committee (DMSC) reviews emerging data from the Statistical Analysis Commitee (SAC) and communicates key decisions to the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), who advises the Trial Management Group (TMG) and also provides oversight of the trial. Manuscripts with the results of the primary outcomes will be published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Five women and two men in our target recruitment age group with an interest in diagnosis and management of infections reviewed the patient-facing materials, including outcomes, and trial delivery plans. They were very supportive of including a nominated support person to help the recruited patients with trial participation. They suggested edits for clarity to the patient information sheet and daily diary. They were keen to document their strong support of work to evaluate possible treatments for COVID-19 in community settings. Two public contributors serve on the TSC and have reviewed patient-facing materials and commented on study design and dissemination.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>To facilitate early intervention, and in keeping with the changing situations in primary care, the trial enrols participants with possible COVID-19 irrespective of whether they have had confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing. Possible COVID-19 is determined using the United Kingdom NHS definition of high temperature and/or a new, continuous cough and/or a change in sense of smell or taste. Patients with other symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test are also eligible. Symptoms must have started within the previous 14 days and be ongoing at the time of enrolment. To target patients at high risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the trial enrols people aged 65 years and over or 50–64 years with comorbidities (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Patients with contraindications to a trial drug are excluded from enrolment into that particular intervention arm but remain eligible for randomisation into other arms. Patients must be eligible for the usual care arm and at least one intervention arm in order to take part in the trial.</p>

                  <p>The trial is low burden for participants and those recruiting into the trial. All health and social care professionals and members of the public are able to refer potential participants to the study website, or suggest they contact the trial team directly by telephone or email. They may also send a text message or letter to patients who are potentially eligible to let them know that if they have, or should they develop, symptoms, they may be eligible for the trial, and are given a link to the trial website and freephone number. Participants may also hear about the trial through media and can self-refer via the study website and freephone number.</p>

                  <title>Screening, informed consent and enrolment</title>
                  <p>An online screening, eligibility and consent procedure is used. Patients without internet access or requiring help with the online procedures can be assisted by a clinician or the trial team by telephone. Interested patients can access the patient information leaflet on the trial website or by telephoning the trial team. The patient information leaflet is available in English and nine other commonly spoken languages in the UK. After reading the patient information leaflet, potential participants are screened through an eligibility questionnaire and asked to complete an online consent form. The trial team is then notified electronically and assess the participant’s eligibility using information from the participant’s medical records. If they are unable to access the participant’s medical records, the participant’s GP is contacted for further information. Healthcare providers can also choose to fully confirm eligibility before referring the patient to the trial team.</p>
                  <p>In addition, participants can be screened and enrolled by their GP at participating primary care practices. The participant and GP can use the online screening, consent and randomisation procedures, with the GP confirming eligibility using the patient’s medical record.</p>
                  <p>Participants are asked to nominate and include contact details for a study partner (eg, family member) who may provide assistance in completing trial procedures and in providing follow up information. Nominating a study partner is not a requirement of participation.</p>

                  <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                  <p>After informed consent is obtained and eligibility has been confirmed, participants are randomised using a rapid, secure, web-based randomisation system called Sortition (Oxford University Innovation). The participant, specific members of the trial team and participant’s GP are notified electronically regarding treatment allocation. The trial started by using randomisation proportions but subsequently uses response adaptive randomisation via interim analyses to allocate more subjects to the interventions with better outcomes (see Statistical methods).</p>
                  <p>This is an open-label trial. Participants and recruiting clinicians know the participant’s allocation. Therefore, no unblinding or code breaking is required. However, those managing the data are blind to participant allocation, and the trial team and recruiters are blinded to emerging results. Only those on the DMSC and the unblinding statisticians have access to the unblinded interim analysis results. Any changes made in the allocation probability are blind to the trial team apart from the programmer who needs to implement this to the randomisation system.</p>

Please rate how you are feeling now using a scale of 1–10, where 1 is the worst you can imagine, and 10 is feeling the best you can imagine’); trial medication adherence; presence of individual symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, generally feeling unwell, all rated as ‘no problem’, ‘mild problem’, ‘moderate problem’ or ‘severe problem’); use of other medicines to control symptoms, contacts with health services; and new infections in the household. In addition, at days 14 and 28, the WHO-5 questionnaire is administered for follow-up. Participants and/or their study partner who have not entered data online are contacted by telephone on days 7, 14 and 28 to obtain information about hospital admission, recovery, presence and severity of symptoms, and healthcare utilisation.</p>
                  <p>We also obtain consent from participants to ascertain relevant outcome data from general practice and hospital records about hospital assessments, COVID-19 related admissions, oxygen use, intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and longer term outcomes relevant to COVID-19. Trial implementation began through the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Network, which has the capacity to extract patient information from the clinical records and provide a trial observatory to report on trial progress and a dashboard to flag the number of potentially eligible patients in each practice (<ext-link xlink:href="https://clininf.eu/index.php/principle" ext-link-type="uri">https://clininf.eu/index.php/principle</ext-link>).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> GP surgeries outside this network may also be contacted separately by the trial team to request specific data from participants’ primary care medical records.</p>

                  <p>We endeavour to provide participants with a self-sampling kits for evidence of SARS-Cov-2 through their practice, the trial team, Public Health England or other central service to be taken at baseline. However, this depends on swab availability. If swabbing kits are unavailable, patients may still participate in the trial and are included in the intention-to-treat analysis. We also seek optional consent from participants to be contacted about providing a sample for serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection during convalescence.</p>

                <p>There are two coprimary endpoints. The first is time to recovery from possible COVID-19 infection within 28 days from randomisation, with time to recovery defined as the first instance that a participant reports feeling recovered. Although a number of secondary outcomes also evaluate recovery, self-report of feeling recovered was chosen for the primary outcome as the most direct measure of patient experience. The second is hospital admission or death within 28 days of randomisation. Decision to hospitalise is made by clinicians independent of the trial.

                  <title>Coprimary outcomes analysis</title>
                  <p>Full statistical methods are detailed in a master statistical analysis plan. In brief, the first coprimary analysis is a Bayesian piecewise exponential of time to recovery regressed on treatment and stratification covariates (age, comorbidity or high risk). The second coprimary analysis is a Bayesian logistic regression model of hospitalisation/death regressed on treatment and stratification covariates. The coprimary outcomes are evaluated using a ‘gate-keeping’ strategy. For a given treatment, the hypothesis for the time to recovery endpoint is evaluated first, and if the recovery null hypothesis is rejected, the hypothesis for the second coprimary endpoint of hospitalisation/death is evaluated. This gate-keeping strategy preserves the overall type I error of the primary endpoints without additional adjustments for multiple hypotheses.</p>
                  <p>The prespecified design allows adaptations to the trial based on the observed data. These adaptations include the declaration of success or futility of an intervention at an interim analysis, the addition or removal of treatment arms and changes in the randomisation probabilities. At each interim analysis, all enrolled intervention arms will be evaluated for success or futility using the Bayesian primary analysis. If the Bayesian posterior probability of superiority of a given intervention over usual care is greater than or equal to 0.99 for the recovery endpoint and greater than or equal to 0.975 for the hospitalisation endpoint, superiority versus usual care will be declared on both endpoints, in which case the superior arm will replace the usual care arm as the new standard of care. The superiority thresholds of 0.99 and 0.975 for the first and second coprimary hypotheses, respectively, were determined a priori via simulation in order to control the one-sided type I error of the study at approximately 0.025.</p>
                  <p>If the Bayesian posterior probability of a clinically meaningful treatment effect (≥1.5 days) on time to recovery is sufficiently small (&lt;0.05), the intervention arm will be dropped from the study for futility. If there are no other intervention arms available, the trial will be suspended; otherwise accrual continues to the remaining treatment arms.</p>

                  <title>Response adaptive randomisation</title>
                  <p>Prior to the first interim analysis, allocation will be equal among all treatment arms, with randomisation stratified by age (&lt;65 or ≥65) and comorbidity. Response adaptive randomisation is activated at the time of the first interim analysis if there are at least two active interventions in the trial. When response adaptive randomisation is activated, the usual care arm will continue to receive a fixed allocation of 1/<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>, where <italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> is the total number of treatment arms in the study. The remaining (<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic>-1)/<italic toggle="yes">Z</italic> allocation probability will be divided among the intervention arms based on interim response adaptive randomisation probabilities. This is done by fitting the primary analysis model for time to recovery at an interim analysis and defining new randomisation probabilities proportional to the probability that each intervention is optimal with respect to the first coprimary endpoint. The purpose of implementing response adaptive randomisation is to allocate more participants to the intervention arms with the better observed outcomes (relative to usual care).</p>

                  <p>Given the open, ‘perpetual’ trial structure, the trial does not have a finite ending based on sample size. We estimate that approximately 400 participants per arm (800 participants total if only a single intervention vs usual care) will be required to provide 90% power for detecting an approximate difference of 2 days in median recovery time. We estimate that approximately 1500 participants per arm (3000 participants total if only a single intervention vs usual care) will be required to provide 90% power for detecting a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation and/or death. A key feature of the adaptive design is the ability to adapt the sample size to the observed data, thus addressing the primary hypothesis as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</p>

                  <p>Because of the adaptive platform trial structure, there exists no simple formula(e) to calculate power and type I error (false positive rate). Hence, virtual trial simulations are used to fully characterise and quantify the power and type I error of the design. These simulations include a comprehensive evaluation of trial performance across a wide range of assumptions (eg, underlying distribution of outcome in control arm, treatment effect, accrual rates, etc). This includes summaries regarding the number of subjects required to make a success or futility conclusion for each intervention. For example, we quantify the probability of claiming superiority at the first and each of the subsequent interim analyses. Details of the simulations are provided in an Adaptive Design Report.</p>

Treatments under investigation have included lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon-beta-1a and an interleukin-1 receptor antatgonist.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The RECOVERY trial (ISRCTN50189673) is focusing on hospital inpatients, and investigatory treatments have included lopinavir/ritonavir, dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with usual hospital care.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Together, these trials are assessing COVID-19 interventions across a range of clinical and community settings. Trials of community use of hydroxychloroquine in the community have been reported,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> but there are few other recruiting platform trials of community-based treatments for COVID-19 capable of evalauting multiple intervetions in an ongoing way.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>A major strength of PRINCIPLE is its community care focus, positioning it to test interventions for COVID-19 at earlier and milder stages of illness. As an ‘in-pandemic’ trial, we have designed PRINCIPLE to minimise the burden on existing healthcare services that are often already under strain and have removed the requirement for face-to-face contact for the purposes of the trial to minimise the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The trial is potentially open to anyone in a participating jurisdiction who meets eligibility requirements. Furthermore, the use of routinely collected data from electronic health records may complement the capture of trial outcomes and safety monitoring. The adaptive design allows flexibility as the pandemic evolves, providing the capability to rapidly test new interventions as they become available. Interventions suitable for pragmatic evaluation in the PRINCIPLE trial have a favourable safety profile and may be suitable for widespread deployment in primary care settings. Therefore, if an intervention proves effective, rapid scale up should be achievable within the UK NHS and potentially also other settings.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
                <p>A potential weakness is the inclusion of patients with possible COVID-19, rather than laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this reflects clinical practice during the time the participants were recruited, where some were managed on the basis of their clinical syndrome, in the absence of immediate confirmatory swab result as swab testing has not always been available during the conduct of the trial. Our eligibility criteria are based on the UK case definition for primary care,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and we will use swab test results, where available, to identify positive SARS-CoV-2 cases for relevant secondary and exploratory analyses in the SARS-CoV-2 positive subgroup.</p>
                <p>We deliberately chose to conduct a pragmatic, open-label trial in the context of everyday practice becasue the study hypothesises that the addtion of a medication being investigated will imporve outocmes over an above routine ususal care without that medication, and usual care does not involve provision of a placebo medication. Effect sizes identified by placebo-controlled, efficacy studies with tight inclusion criteria might not be reproduced in routine care,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 30 31</xref> and it was not feasible to rapidly produce placebo for multiple drug interventions in this ‘in-pandemic’ platform trial. This pragmatic, open trial design makes our findings more likely to reflect real-world effects in community care, because knowledge of the medication one is taking could affect subsequent help seeking, including presentation at hospitals. Capturing the effect of an intervention on help seeking is an important element in evaluating the consequences of its use. However, the design does not allow us to determine mechanisms of action, for example, how much of the observed effect can be attributed to the biological effects of the drug treatment or to a placebo effect. Meta-analyses of placebo controlled trials of oseltamivir for influenza-like illness found an average benefit of about a day reduction in symptoms.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> This is similar to the estimate of average benefit obtained in a large, open multinational trial of oseltamivir for infleunza-like illness.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The lack of placebo is unlikely to significantly affect ‘harder’ outcomes such as hospitalisation and death, which form part of the PRINCIPLE trial coprimary outcome. In pragmatic trials, the implementation of treatment strategies should resemble clinical practice as closely as possible.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 34</xref></p>
