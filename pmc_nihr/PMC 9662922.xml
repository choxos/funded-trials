                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>To conduct an updated exploratory analysis of overall survival (OS) with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 months and evaluate the prognostic value of molecular analysis by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).</p>

                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>Patients with hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup>) advanced breast cancer (ABC) were randomized 2:1 to receive palbociclib (125 mg orally/day; 3/1 week schedule) and fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly) or placebo and fulvestrant. This OS analysis was performed when 75% of enrolled patients died (393 events in 521 randomized patients). ctDNA analysis was performed among patients who provided consent.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>At the data cutoff (August 17, 2020), 258 and 135 deaths occurred in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. The median OS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 34.8 months (28.8–39.9) in the palbociclib group and 28.0 months (23.5–33.8) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–0.99). The 6-year OS rate (95% CI) was 19.1% (14.9–23.7) and 12.9% (8.0–19.1) in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. Favorable OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant was observed in most subgroups, particularly in patients with endocrine-sensitive disease, no prior chemotherapy for ABC and low circulating tumor fraction and regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1, PIK3CA</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation status. No new safety signals were identified.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>The clinically meaningful improvement in OS associated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant was maintained with &gt;6 years of follow-up in patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC, supporting palbociclib plus fulvestrant as a standard of care in these patients.</p>

              <p>The long-term effect of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibition plus endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer (ABC) is an important area of research, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may provide valuable prognostic information. In PALOMA-3, palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved median overall survival (OS) versus placebo plus fulvestrant after 44.8 months of follow-up. In this updated exploratory analysis of the PALOMA-3 clinical trial, a continued improvement in median OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant was observed (34.8 vs. 28.0 months). Favorable OS in the palbociclib group was also observed across most subgroups regardless of ESR1, PIK3CA, or TP53 mutation status. These findings support the palbociclib plus fulvestrant regimen as a standard of care in patients with hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative ABC and show that ctDNA analysis can provide prognostic information.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Palbociclib is a first-in-class orally active cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor–positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup>) advanced breast cancer (ABC; ref. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Findings from the PALOMA-3 study in women with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC showed that palbociclib plus fulvestrant significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo plus fulvestrant [11.2 vs. 4.6 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40–0.62]; one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2, 3</xref>). At a median follow-up of 44.8 months, the final protocol-specified overall survival (OS) analysis demonstrated a longer OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant that was not statistically significant [34.9 vs. 28.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.64–1.03); one-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0429] (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Moreover, sensitivity to prior endocrine therapy, nonvisceral disease, no prior chemotherapy for ABC, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 were identified as significant positive prognostic factors for OS. Patients without prior chemotherapy for ABC had longer median OS in the palbociclib arm versus placebo arm, while patients with prior chemotherapy for ABC had a similar OS among treatment arms (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p>
              <p>With CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy now considered a standard of care for the treatment of HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a clinical need exists to identify patients who may be at risk of progressing early while receiving palbociclib plus endocrine therapy. Other than estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expression, no clinical biomarkers presently exist for palbociclib treatment sensitivity or resistance (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, there is limited information regarding associations between genetic mutations and clinical outcome in ABC (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly being incorporated in the clinical setting and during medication development as a preferred liquid biopsy diagnostic to analyze the genetic features of tumors (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>).</p>
              <p>This updated exploratory analysis reports OS results from PALOMA-3 with a longer median follow-up of 73.3 months and evaluated the prognostic value of genomic abnormalities identified by ctDNA.</p>

                <p>Detailed methodology of the PALOMA-3 clinical study has been described previously (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Briefly, PALOMA-3 is a double-blind, multicenter, phase III study that included premenopausal or postmenopausal women with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC whose disease had progressed on endocrine therapy. Patients were allowed up to one prior line of chemotherapy for ABC. Patients were excluded if they had active, uncontrolled, or symptomatic brain metastases or symptomatic visceral spread or were at risk for life-threatening complications. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each study center, and conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, with monitoring by an academic steering committee.</p>

                <title>Randomization and masking</title>
                <p>Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive palbociclib (125 mg orally per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off) and fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscularly every 14 days for the first three injections followed by every 28 days) or matching placebo and fulvestrant. Patients were randomly assigned by the investigator or research staff via a centralized interactive web- and voice-based randomization system, which also generated the random allocation sequence. For each stratification level, random assignments to the treatments were made in a block size of six. Patients were assigned on the basis of three stratification factors: sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status, and presence of visceral metastases. The patients, investigators, and research staff were all blinded to treatment group assignment.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>Investigator-assessed PFS was the primary endpoint of the study, and OS was a key secondary endpoint. OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored to the last date the patient was known to be alive. Here we report the final unplanned exploratory OS analysis with 393 events in 521 randomized patients (75% of the total study population; data cut-off date: August 17, 2020) with a median follow-up of 73.3 months. The median OS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method; 95% CIs and hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.</p>
                <p>Plasma samples were collected and stored for ctDNA analyses at baseline and the end of treatment. A custom, amplicon error–corrected sequencing approach was used for ctDNA analyses, as reported previously (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8, 12</xref>). The targeted panel of 17 targetable driver and CDK4/6-related genes included all exons (<italic toggle="yes">RB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDK4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDK6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN1A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CDKN1B</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">NF1;</italic> exons 5–8 of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic>) and hotspots (<italic toggle="yes">ERBB2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FGFR3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">KRAS</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HRAS</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic>). The allele fraction cutoff for calling gene mutations as positive was 0.5% allele frequency for whole genes and 0.3% for hotspots. PFS and OS rates were assessed among treatment arms in patients with circulating tumor fraction above or below a cutoff of 10% (high and low purity), as reported previously (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p>
                <p>Adverse events (AE) were reported and severity was graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0. Safety findings were summarized descriptively.</p>

              <p>A total of 521 patients were randomized into the study (347 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 174 patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant group). As reported previously (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), patient demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were generally similar between the treatment groups. As of the data cut-off date of August 17, 2020, 393 deaths had occurred; 258 deaths in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 135 deaths in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. The median duration of follow-up was 73.3 months (95% CI, 73.0–74.0). A total of 18 patients remained on study treatment, including 15 patients (4.3%) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 3 patients (1.7%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group (Supplementary Fig. S1).</p>
              <p>The median OS was 34.8 months (95% CI, 28.8–39.9) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 28.0 months (95% CI, 23.5–33.8) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group [stratified HR, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65–0.99); <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>]. The 5-year OS rate (95% CI) was 23.3% (18.7–28.2) in the palbociclib group versus 16.7% (11.2–23.3) in the placebo group; the 6-year OS rate was 19.1% (14.9–23.7) versus 12.9% (8.0–19.1) in the palbociclib and placebo groups, respectively. In the subgroup of patients who had not received prior chemotherapy for ABC (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 344), the median OS was 39.3 months (95% CI, 34.5–44.4) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 29.7 months (95% CI, 23.8–35.5) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group [hazard ratio, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55–0.94); Supplementary Fig. S2A]. In the subgroup of patients who had received prior chemotherapy for ABC (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 177), the median OS was 24.6 months (95% CI, 21.3–30.0) in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group and 24.3 months (95% CI, 18.9–36.3) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group [hazard ratio, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.69–1.36); Supplementary Fig. S2B]. Favorable OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant was observed in most of the subgroups evaluated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

              <p>Survival analyses by mutational burden demonstrated that a low-circulating tumor fraction (&lt;10%) was associated with longer PFS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant group [median PFS (95% CI), 13.6 months (11.3–16.6) vs. 5.5 months (3.7–9.1); hazard ratio, 0.46 (95% CI, 0.33–0.64); Supplementary Fig. S3A].

              <p>Neutropenia was the most frequently reported AE in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group, as reported previously (palbociclib vs. placebo: any grade, 84.3% vs. 3.5%; grade 3, 57.7% vs. 0; grade 4, 11.9% vs. 0; Supplementary Table S2; refs. <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4, 11</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>With over 6 years of median follow-up in the PALOMA-3 trial, this analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in OS of 6.8 months with palbociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC who progressed on prior endocrine therapy. The prolonged OS benefit was particularly evident in patients with no prior chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic disease setting. The lack of difference in OS among patients with prior chemotherapy may be due to patients with prior chemotherapy having tumors with a higher frequency of <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations and less endocrine sensitivity. In addition, PFS and OS were generally more favorable with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant across subgroups, including patients with low circulating tumor fraction and regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1, PIK3CA</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation status as detected by ctDNA. However, although a PFS and OS benefit was observed regardless of mutation status, patients without the mutations had a better prognosis and outcome. Moreover, no new safety signals were identified. These findings support the continued benefit of palbociclib plus fulvestrant as a standard of care in patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC, regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1, PIK3CA</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation status.</p>
              <p>The current median OS of 34.8 months in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group compared with 28.0 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant group [stratified hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.65–0.99)] are consistent with the results from the previous final protocol-specified OS analysis, which also demonstrated a trend toward improved OS with palbociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant [34.9 vs. 28.0 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.64–1.03)] (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC, it is often difficult for treatments to demonstrate a significant OS improvement in clinical studies. Adequate power for the statistical analysis of OS is challenging to achieve when evaluating diseases associated with long postprogression survival (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Moreover, clinical studies often allow patients in the placebo group to cross over to receive active treatments after disease progression, confounding the interpretation of OS results (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p>
              <p>However, OS findings from abemaciclib (interim) and ribociclib phase III studies of patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC who did not receive prior chemotherapy for ABC are available (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15, 16</xref>). In the MONARCH 2 study, at a median follow-up duration of 47.7 months, abemaciclib plus fulvestrant improved median OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant [46.7 vs. 37.3 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61–0.95)] (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the MONALEESA-3 study, at a median follow-up duration of 56.3 months, the median OS was 53.7 months with ribociclib plus fulvestrant and 41.5 months with placebo plus fulvestrant [hazard ratio, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59–0.90)] (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Each of these study results were statistically significant. Moreover, while some survival data were still immature, an FDA pooled analysis of CDK4/6 inhibitors for HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67–0.89) for OS between pooled CDK4/6 inhibitors plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant groups from PALOMA-3, MONARCH 2, and MONALEESA-3 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Together, these findings suggest CDK4/6 inhibitors provide a survival benefit for patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC.</p>
              <p>Previous analyses using ctDNA data from patients in the PALOMA-3 study have demonstrated that high-circulating tumor fraction of &gt;10% is associated with a shorter median PFS compared with circulating tumor factor ≤10% in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant group [9.2 vs. 13.6 months; hazard ratio, 1.62 (95% CI, 1.17–2.24)] (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The current analysis of PALOMA-3 further suggests a most significant benefit in patients with a low mutational burden (≤10%) who were treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant compared with placebo plus fulvestrant. <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutations and <italic toggle="yes">FGFR1</italic> amplification were also associated with a shorter PFS [hazard ratio, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.27–2.65) and hazard ratio, 2.91 (95% CI, 1.61–5.25), respectively] (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, previous analyses have shown that approximately 31% of patients receiving palbociclib plus fulvestrant acquire mutations in growth factor receptors and signal transduction pathways, including 6% of patients acquiring <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutations and 9% acquiring <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, the current analysis is the first CDK4/6 inhibitor study to our knowledge to evaluate the effect of tumor mutation profiles using ctDNA analyses on OS.</p>
              <p>In the current analysis, regardless of mutation status, palbociclib plus fulvestrant prolonged OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant. Moreover, palbociclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation status. Overall, findings were similar whether mutations were analyzed at day 1, at end of treatment, or at day 1 and end of treatment combined. These findings are consistent with results from a previous analysis that demonstrated that palbociclib plus fulvestrant prolonged median PFS versus placebo plus fulvestrant both in patients with <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations [9.4 vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.25–0.74)] and without <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations [9.5 vs. 5.4 months; hazard ratio, 0.49 (95% CI, 0.35–0.70)] (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Our findings are also consistent with results from the MONARCH 2 study in which abemaciclib plus fulvestrant improved PFS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic> mutation status (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the current analysis, patients with <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> mutations gained a greater benefit from palbociclib plus fulvestrant measured by both PFS and OS. Future research is warranted to further characterize genomic features that may affect the efficacy of palbociclib plus fulvestrant.</p>
              <p>Limitations of this study include that it is an exploratory analysis. This study is also limited by the small numbers of patients included in some of the subgroups analyzed. Nevertheless, with &gt;6 years of median follow-up in patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2<sup>−</sup> ABC, palbociclib plus fulvestrant demonstrated longer OS compared with placebo plus fulvestrant, including in most of the subgroups assessed and regardless of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, or <italic toggle="yes">TP53</italic> mutation status.</p>
