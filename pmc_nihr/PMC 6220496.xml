                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Anogenital warts are the second most common sexually transmitted infection diagnosed in sexual health services in England. About 90% of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 or 11, and half of episodes diagnosed are recurrences. The best and most cost-effective treatment for patients with anogenital warts is unknown. The commonly used treatments are self-administered topical agents, podophyllotoxin (0.15% cream) or imiquimod (5% cream), or cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen. Quadrivalent HPV (qHPV) vaccination is effective in preventing infection, and disease, but whether it has any therapeutic effect is not known.</p>

                  <title>Methods and design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">To investigate the efficacy of clearance and prevention of recurrence of external anogenital warts by topical treatments, podophyllotoxin 0.15% cream or imiquimod 5% cream, in combination with a three-dose regimen of qHPV or control vaccination. 500 adult patients presenting with external anogenital warts with either a first or subsequent episode of anogenital warts will be entered into this randomised, controlled partially blinded 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ2 factorial trial.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The trial is expected to provide the first high-quality evidence of the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the two topical treatments in current use, as well as investigate the potential benefit of HPV vaccination, in the management of anogenital warts.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par15">The most effective and cost-effective treatment for patients with anogenital warts is unknown. Genital warts are benign lesions which present as lumps or raised plaques in the skin of the anogenital area. Usually painless, but occasionally causing irritation or bleeding, they can be emotionally distressing, and often require prolonged, time consuming and uncomfortable treatment. Relapse after apparently successful treatment occurs frequently. Surgery may be required in persistent cases. About 90% of genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 or 11, which are sexually transmitted.</p>
              <p id="Par16">There were 122,068 episodes of new or recurrent genital warts treated in sexual health services in England in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], of which 49% were recurrent episodes. First episode genital warts accounted for 15% of new sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed, making it the second most common condition after chlamydia. The cost to the NHS of treating anogenital warts in 2016 is estimated at almost ¬£14 million per year, of which about ¬£6 million is for recurrent episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is frequently used to treat anogenital warts, although this treatment requires equipment and facilities usually only available in hospital or specialist community settings, and appropriately trained staff. Effective treatment may be achieved with a single application, but more often requires repeated clinic attendance. Consequently, most cases of warts are now treated with self-administered topical agents, of which podophyllotoxin is the most common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Podophyllotoxin has a chemotherapeutic action believed to be based on prevention of tubulin polymerisation required for microtubule assembly and inhibition of nucleoside transport through the cell membrane, leading to inhibition of growth of virally infected cells. It is available as a solution or a cream and has been studied in a number of randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The cream (Warticon¬Æ, Glaxo SmithKline) includes the active agent at a lower concentration than the solution (0.15% versus 0.5%) but is generally considered to be easier to apply, better tolerated, and have similar efficacy. An alternative topical treatment is imiquimod, but this is more expensive, so usually reserved for second-line therapy. Imiquimod is available as a 5% cream (Aldara¬Æ, Meda). Some studies have suggested that imiquimod is associated with less recurrence as a result of its mode of action as an immune response modifier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is a toll-like receptor 7 agonist, and stimulates tissue macrophages to release interferon-alpha and other cytokines which trigger a local cell-mediated response. Imiquimod has no direct antiviral activity. The treatment response may be slower than podophyllotoxin. It is licensed for a treatment duration of up to 16¬†weeks; most patients will have responded by 8¬†weeks. The efficacy has been investigated in a number of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par18">The efficacies of podophyllotoxin and imiquimod as initial therapy for anogenital warts have never been compared in an adequately-powered trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The only randomised trial comparing the two topical agents was under-powered (<italic>n</italic>¬†=‚Äâ51) and did not report recurrence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There were similar clearance rates (75% vs. 72%, 95% confidence interval 53‚Äì98% and 52‚Äì86% respectively). A systematic review of wart treatment undertaken for the European guidelines for the treatment of genital warts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], suggested that podophyllotoxin has a similar rate of initial clearance (43‚Äì70% at 4¬†weeks, compared to 55‚Äì81% clearance at 16¬†weeks for imiquimod), but recurrence rates may be lower with imiquimod (6‚Äì26% at 6¬†months for imiquimod, compared to 6‚Äì55% at 8‚Äì12¬†weeks for podophyllotoxin). The wide variation between reported studies is also likely related to differences in study design, including the outcome measures and timing. The review found no evidence of any single therapy being superior overall, largely due to the lack of high-quality comparative studies, with those reported being heterogeneous in design, and with high loss to follow-up. Until this comparison is resolved in randomised studies of sufficient size and robust design it remains impossible to firmly recommend one treatment over the other. UK national guidelines recommend that the choice of first line therapy be based on patient preference and morphology and distribution of lesions, with a clinic treatment algorithm to guide treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par19">It is not known whether the clearance or recurrence rate of anogenital warts can be improved by vaccination against HPV 6 and 11, initiated at the same time as topical therapy. HPV vaccines are currently licensed to prevent HPV-associated anogenital warts and cancers; quadrivalent HPV vaccine (qHPV; Gardasil¬Æ, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme) protects against genotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18, and from September 2012 has been the vaccine used in the national vaccination programme in the UK for girls aged 12‚Äì13¬†years. The potential role of the vaccine as therapy or secondary prevention for anogenital warts (or indeed any HPV-associated disease) has yet to be determined. While no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence exists, evidence that vaccination against HPV may offer a therapeutic or secondary preventative strategy comes from several sources. Firstly, there are case reports that clearance of anogenital warts may be enhanced by qHPV vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Secondly, patients with anogenital warts or genital intraepithelial neoplasia (cervical [CIN], vulval [VIN] or vaginal [VaIN]) are at risk of re-infection with the same or different HPV types, or relapse of existing infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thirdly, limited evidence from placebo-controlled vaccine trials appears to show that women who are HPV seropositive, but DNA-negative for at least one HPV type at trial entry were protected against subsequent disease related to the HPV type to which they were previously exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Also, women with genital lesions treated surgically while in the vaccine trial were less likely to develop recurrent or progressive disease if they were in the vaccine arm of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Fourthly, preliminary evidence suggests that the qHPV vaccine may reduce recurrences of respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], both conditions caused by vaccine-type HPVs. Finally, vaccine antibody responses are much stronger than those induced by natural infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], so a strategy of priming or boosting anti-HPV 6/11 responses with qHPV vaccine could influence the persistence of HPV 6/11 infection and therefore the rate of disease recurrence.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Studies of the treatment cost and quality of life impact of genital warts, as well as economic analyses of vaccinating against warts have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These studies have documented significant negative impacts on quality of life and substantial health care service costs. The cost of imiquimod remains higher than that of podophyllotoxin. If the effectiveness of imiquimod proves superior, then an economic analysis would allow an assessment of the maximum cost difference that would warrant its use as first line therapy. All available treatments have significant failure and recurrence rates. By maximising initial response rates and reducing recurrence rates using first-line self-administered treatment, a randomised controlled trial has the capacity to reduce this health and quality of life burden for patients and improve cost effectiveness, now and in the future. Vaccination would add to the cost of treatment of patients with anogenital warts. If efficacy is demonstrated, then an economic analysis could determine at what level the increased treatment costs would be justified by reduced future healthcare costs and improved quality of life related to persistent or recurrent disease.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The proposed trial will assess the comparative efficacy of the two main topical treatments in current use, podophyllotoxin 0.15% cream and imiquimod 5% cream, and will investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of the qHPV vaccine in the management of patients with anogenital warts. The trial will also evaluate the relative costs of the two topical treatments, as well as of the novel use of qHPV vaccination for both treatment and secondary prevention. The adoption of a pragmatic trial design with broad entry criteria for the comparison of the two topical therapies means that the results can be generalised to the large number of health care settings where anogenital warts are treated. The topical therapies assessed and the potential (within the protocol) to use supplementary cryotherapy are closely aligned with current clinical practice.</p>

                <p id="Par23">The trial is run at selected sexual health clinics in England and Wales (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Participating sites); about 80% of cases of genital warts treated in the NHS are treated in sexual health clinics.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Study population</title>
                <p id="Par24">Those eligible to participate are adults aged 18 or over presenting to participating sexual health clinics with external anogenital warts which, in the opinion of the investigator, could be appropriately treated with either self-administered imiquimod or podophyllotoxin cream. Patients with either first episode or repeat episode anogenital warts are eligible.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The main exclusion criteria are those who have had treatment for warts in the past 3¬†months, and those who have previous qHPV vaccine; previous bivalent HPV vaccine is not an exclusion. Other exclusion criteria relate to contraindications to any of the products, including previous intolerance, pregnancy, lactation, and a total wart area in excess of 4¬†cm<sup>2</sup>, which would require treatment under medical supervision. Patients requiring topical steroids applied to the affected area, or on systemic immunosuppressive agents were also excluded.</p>
                <p id="Par26">Initially, participants with known HIV infection were excluded but in December 2015 the entry criteria were modified to allow their inclusion. The change in criteria allows the inclusion of the majority of HIV-positive individuals, but still excludes those with more severe immunosuppression, who may be less likely to respond to topical treatment or to HPV vaccine. Current evidence is that those HIV-positive individuals stable on antiretroviral treatment with a CD4 count above 350, and those not on treatment with CD4 count above 500, mount good responses to vaccines, and have similar responses to treatment for some other chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It was concluded that HIV-positive individuals fulfilling these criteria should not be excluded. This would allow an estimated 80% of HIV-positive patients with warts to be eligible. It would also be of benefit to observe if the response to the trial interventions was comparable in those with and without HIV infection, although it is acknowledged that the power to detect any such effect would be limited. As a precaution, HIV status was added as a stratification variable.</p>

The maximum diameter of the largest wart is recorded, measured against a size gauge. A symptom-directed general physical examination is performed if appropriate. A blood sample (for serum) and a swab of the lesions (for HPV DNA) are taken and stored, for future methodological studies. Randomised treatments are prescribed or administered and participants are supplied with information on their use, risks and side-effects. Participants are offered safer sex advice, and access to other sexual and reproductive health services as per routine care. For women of child bearing potential a pregnancy test is performed. Simple diary cards are provided for the participant to use as a reminder of when the treatment should be applied, record its use, record if, and when, warts have cleared and record symptom scores related to the topical treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par40">Presence of warts is determined on examination by a member of the trial clinical team at each study visit to confirm clearance/recurrence. Participants are asked to return to the clinic early if they notice a recurrence so that this can be documented (and the date of recurrence recorded) and further treatment offered according to standard of care.

Careful consideration should be given to delaying cryotherapy beyond 4¬†weeks where a response to topical treatment is observed in the interest of preserving the integrity of the randomised comparison. If a participant is unable to tolerate the allocated treatment, after dose modifications as appropriate, alternative treatment can be administered at the discretion of the investigator. For the purposes of the trial, early use (within 4¬†weeks of the start of randomised treatment) of alternative treatments and topical treatment switch to the opposite arm before 16¬†weeks is considered a topical treatment failure.

An end of trial blood sample is collected at week 48, and a lesion swab, to be stored for later HPV DNA detection is collected in the event of wart recurrence. Additional visits are arranged in the event of recurrences or other indications for additional treatment or review in line with routine clinical practice, or if significant adverse events occur that require medical assessment. In order to reduce the loss to follow-up rate, a small financial incentive is provided to those participants who attend the week 16 and week 48 visits.</p>

                <title>Statistical considerations</title>
                <sec id="Sec14">
                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p id="Par62">The trial was originally designed with a sample size of 1000 participants with equal numbers randomised to each of the two topical cream arms and each of the two vaccine groups in a 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ2 factorial design, so that allowing for 20% loss to follow-up 800 participants would contribute primary outcome data. The anticipated proportion achieving the primary endpoint in the less favourable topical treatment group was 35%, assuming a wart clearance rate of 50% within 16¬†weeks and a 30% subsequent recurrence rate. This sample size provided 80% power (at the 5% significance level) to detect an increase to 45% with the better treatment. It also provided 80% power to detect an increase from 35 to 45% in the primary endpoint from vaccination, as would arise if vaccination reduces the recurrence rate from 30 to 10% whilst leaving the wart clearance rate unchanged at 50%.</p>
                  <p id="Par63">Owing to a lack of feasibility to achieve the proposed recruitment target of 1000, a revised sample size of 500 participants was proposed in February 2016. With 15% loss to follow-up, this would provide 52% power (at the 5% significance level) to detect the pre-specified difference in the combined primary endpoint.</p>
                  <p id="Par64">It was expected that the main effect of the topical treatment would be on wart clearance, and the main effect of vaccination would be on wart recurrence. The power of the study to detect a clinically important difference in each of these secondary outcomes was therefore calculated in proposing the reduced trial size.</p>
                  <p id="Par65">The revised sample size will provide 80% power at the 5% significance level, assuming 15% loss to follow up, to evaluate each of the two components of the primary outcome: 1) Proportion wart-free at 16¬†weeks; 2) Proportion remaining wart-free at 48¬†weeks among participants who are wart-free at 16¬†weeks. For the 16¬†week topical treatment outcome, a difference of 14% between topical arms (57% versus 43%) could be detected; for the 48¬†week vaccine outcome, a difference of 16% between vaccine arms (12% versus 28%) could be detected. These differences are considered to be clinically important and may influence management guidelines. A 5% significance level has been used for both calculations as there is a different outcome for each of the two factors to answer two independent questions.</p>

                <sec id="Sec15">
                  <title>Statistical methods</title>
                  <p id="Par66">Analysis will be by intention-to-treat (where participants are analysed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomised), and will include all participants for whom an outcome is obtained. The primary analysis for both factors (podophyllotoxin vs. imiquimod, and qHPV vs. placebo vaccine) will be based on comparisons at the margins of the 2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ2 table (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), meaning all participants randomised to podophyllotoxin will be compared with all participants randomised to imiquimod, and all participants randomised to qHPV vaccine will be compared with all participants randomised to saline placebo.</p>
                  <p id="Par67">We do not anticipate a substantial interaction between topical treatment and vaccination. However, as a secondary analysis, we will perform an interaction test between the two factors, and present results from a four-arm analysis (where each of the four treatment groups is regarded as a separate treatment arm), as is recommended for factorial trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par68">The primary outcome (the composite endpoint of wart clearance 16¬†weeks after starting treatment and remaining wart-free between 16 and 48¬†weeks) and its two components (wart clearance at 16¬†weeks, and no wart recurrence by 48¬†weeks in those with wart clearance at 16¬†weeks) will be analysed using a logistic regression model, and will be adjusted for gender, previous occurrence of warts, HIV status and site as stratification factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and will include both treatment factors (topical treatment and vaccination) as covariates. Treatment effect estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and two-sided <italic>p</italic>-values will be reported for each outcome measure. Multiple imputation using chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] will be used to impute data for missing follow-up visits; the imputation model and number of imputations will be fully specified in the statistical analysis plan. Participants who do not attend any follow-up visits will be excluded from the analysis. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written prior to final analysis and will include the planned analyses for the primary outcome and all secondary outcomes, subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.</p>

                  <title>Economic evaluations</title>
                  <p id="Par69">Economic outcomes will be collected in the same way as previous studies by the investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5¬†L. Information on types of treatments given and number of visits made will be collected. These will be combined with unit costs from standard NHS sources as well as costs and treatment patterns from a previous economic study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to evaluate treatment costs. As the previous study was conducted in 2009‚Äì10, a panel of clinicians will be consulted to see if typical treatment patterns have changed since that time. Clinical, quality of life and cost data will be used to assess the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment options, with or without vaccination. Cost-effectiveness analyses will be conducted according to the reference case used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to ensure comparability with other economic evaluations.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par70">Anogenital warts are the second most common sexually transmitted infection seen in patients presenting to sexual health services in the UK. Although benign, they can cause troublesome symptoms and distress. Treatment can be slow, time-consuming and uncomfortable, and recurrence is common. Since 2012, the HPV vaccine programme in 12‚Äì13¬†year-old girls has used the quadrivalent vaccine which is effective against HPV 6 and 11, in addition to the high-risk HPV16/18 types which cause most genital cancer. While the incidence of anogenital warts in young adults is beginning to fall, the current programme is not predicted to result in elimination and effective treatment for warts will continue to be required. The best first line topical treatment for anogenital warts has not been established in clinical trials, so that treatment guidelines lack a firm basis for their recommendations. The HPV vaccine is indicated to prevent infection; a therapeutic effect, although suggested, has not been established in a clinical trial.</p>
              <p id="Par71">The trial design is pragmatic, intended to allow as wide a range of participants as possible, to enable the results to be generalised. Both patients with a first presentation of warts, and those with a previous history are included. Those with warts that have been treated recently (within the last 3¬†months) are excluded, on the grounds that we are not investigating the efficacy in warts resistant to standard treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par72">The study does not have a placebo topical treatment arm to be able to detect an effect of vaccine on clearance in the absence of any topical treatment. While of scientific interest, this would have increased the size of the study, and make it harder to recruit given the current standard of care.</p>
              <p id="Par73">No change of topical treatment before 16¬†weeks is allowed as this is the primary endpoint for the topical treatment effect, even though the licensed duration of treatment differs for the two products. The addition of cryotherapy after week 4 is permitted because of current practice in the UK. A failure of response after 4¬†weeks of podophyllotoxin, which is the licensed duration of treatment, would currently prompt consideration of alternative treatment. In order to retain participants in the study, continuation of podophyllotoxin up to 16¬†weeks is therefore permitted within the protocol. Use of cryotherapy after 4¬†weeks is at the discretion of the investigator; cryotherapy use is recorded. A cryotherapy-alone arm was not included as being beyond the remit of this study, and because of the implications for the size of the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par74">Two limitations arose during the implementation of the study. It was intended that the vaccine would be blinded, with matching syringes containing a saline placebo. However, the vaccine is supplied in a bespoke pre-filled syringe and we were unable to source un-filled syringes to make a matching placebo. In order to minimise the risk of un-blinding, the vaccine is supplied in an opaque, sealed pouch contained within an outer carton. The vaccine or placebo is administered by a health care worker who is not involved in participant recruitment or follow up assessments, under instructions to avoid showing the vaccine syringe to either the participant or the trial team.</p>
              <p id="Par75">The study was designed with a sample size of 1000 participants. However, identifying trial sites in the UK with the resources and infrastructure to recruit participants proved to be very difficult. In order to complete the trial within the agreed timelines set by the funder, even with a no-cost extension, it was agreed that a reduced sample size would have to be accepted. The trial will therefore be underpowered for the combined primary endpoint. However, the power will be better for the two most important secondary endpoints, the rate of clearance at week 16 and the rate of recurrence at week 48, in those who have cleared warts by week 16.</p>
              <p id="Par76">The trial will provide the first high-quality evidence of the comparative efficacy of the two main topical treatments in current use, as well as the first randomised trial to investigate the potential therapeutic benefit of an HPV vaccine in the management of patients with anogenital warts.</p>
