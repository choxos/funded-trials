                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common, with 50 000 new cases per year in the UK. MPE causes disabling breathlessness and indicates advanced disease with a poor prognosis. Treatment approaches focus on symptom relief and optimising quality of life (QoL). Patients who newly present with MPE commonly require procedural intervention for both diagnosis and therapeutic benefit.</p>
                  <p>Thoracoscopic pleural biopsies are highly sensitive in diagnosing pleural malignancy. Talc poudrage may be delivered at thoracoscopy (TTP) to prevent effusion recurrence by effecting pleurodesis. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) offer an alternative strategy for fluid control, enabling outpatient management and are often used as ‘rescue’ therapy following pleurodesis failure or in cases of ‘trapped lung’. It is unknown whether combining a TTP with IPC insertion will improve patient symptoms or reduce time spent in the hospital.</p>
                  <p>The randomised thoracoscopic talc poudrage + indwelling pleural catheters versus thoracoscopic talc poudrage only in malignant pleural effusion trial (TACTIC) is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the benefit of a combined TTP and IPC procedure, evaluating cost-effectiveness and patient-centred outcomes such as symptoms and QoL. The study remains in active recruitment and has the potential to radically transform the pathway for all patients presenting with MPE.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>TACTIC is an unblinded, multicentre, RCT comparing the combination of TTP with an IPC to TTP alone. Co-primary outcomes are time spent in the hospital and mean breathlessness score over 4 weeks postprocedure. The study will recruit 124 patients and aims to define the optimal pathway for patients presenting with symptomatic MPE.</p>

                    <p>The TACTIC trial is a multicentre RCT with the potential to radically affect how patients with MPE are treated. By streamlining both diagnostic and therapeutic pathways into a single ambulatory procedure, a positive trial outcome is likely to result in this approach being widely adopted by healthcare systems.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) occurs when cancer metastasises to the pleura (most commonly from lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women) or in mesothelioma, when the pleura itself is the primary site of malignancy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> It is common, with 50 000 new cases per year in the UK<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and incidence is likely to rise as global cancer rates increase.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> MPE causes disabling breathlessness and indicates advanced disease, with a median survival of 3–12 months.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Treatment focuses on symptom control and optimising quality of life (QoL).</p>
              <p>For most patients who newly present with a potential MPE, there is both a diagnostic and therapeutic need. An initial thoracocentesis to obtain pleural fluid (PF) for analysis and to relieve breathlessness is the first step in the standard care pathway, with cytology diagnostic in 46% (95% CI 42% to 58%).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> When MPE is suspected but PF is non-diagnostic, pleural biopsies are required and obtained via thoracoscopy or image guided techniques. Diagnostic sensitivity of biopsies obtained at medical thoracoscopy is &gt;93%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>The majority of patients will experience fluid re-accumulation following initial drainage, with associated symptom recurrence. Definitive intervention to provide long-term symptom relief is therefore advised.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 4</xref> This may take the form of pleurodesis, a procedure where the lung is adhered to the chest wall using talc as a chemical sclerosant to prevent fluid recurrence. Talc may be delivered at thoracoscopy (‘talc poudrage’) or as talc ‘slurry’ by chest tube following fluid drainage, with no difference in pleurodesis efficacy between these methods (36/161 (22%) pleurodesis failures vs 38/159 (24%), respectively).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> While thoracoscopy and talc poudrage (TTP) allows the operator to offer pleurodesis in the same sitting as tissue biopsy (combining diagnosis and treatment in a single procedure) both TTP and talc slurry pleurodesis typically confer an inpatient hospital stay of up to 7 days.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> In addition to the resource pressures of modern-day healthcare systems, elective hospital admission in the context of poor estimated survival may be unacceptable to the patient for a variety of reasons.</p>
              <p>Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are an alternative method for definitive fluid management, offering comparable breathlessness control to talc pleurodesis and improved QoL.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> IPCs are tunnelled catheters, which are inserted as a day-case procedure and can remain in situ long term, allowing PF drainage to be conducted at home. They can be used where pleurodesis has failed and are also an option for patients who have ‘trapped lung’ (where the lung is unable to expand when fluid is drained), which occurs in 15% of patients with MPE.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 8</xref></p>

                <title>Rationale for the study</title>
                <p>The current standard care patient pathway and protocol for the randomised thoracoscopic talc poudrage + indwelling pleural catheters versus thoracoscopic talc poudrage only in malignant pleural effusion trial (TACTIC) are highlighted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.</p>

                </fig>
                <p>A procedure combining medical thoracoscopy, talc poudrage and IPC insertion (TTP and IPC) may overcome the usual requirements for an inpatient admission following talc pleurodesis. A combined procedure can mitigate the risk of pleurodesis failure following TTP (including as a result of ‘trapped lung’), as patients can continue to drain their effusion using the IPC and effectively control their symptoms without the need for further invasive interventions. TTP with IPC insertion may therefore also provide more effective symptom control, better QoL and cost savings to the healthcare system.</p>
                <p>Two observational series have examined TTP and IPC insertion as a combined procedure, suggesting high pleurodesis rates (92%) at 1 month, median time to IPC removal of &lt;14 days, no significant safety concerns and the ability to deliver the procedure in the outpatient setting.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> However, these studies were uncontrolled and did not assess QoL or patient reported symptoms. No randomised controlled trial (RCT) has yet compared a combined TTP and IPC procedure early in the patient pathway against standard care (TTP) using patient-reported outcome measures validated for use in the MPE population<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and qualitative methods to evaluate and characterise the impact of this intervention on patients and carers.</p>

Written informed consent will be received. Patients with suspected malignancy who are undergoing thoracoscopy for both diagnosis and symptom control will be advised that if pleural appearances during the procedure are not consistent with frank cancerous change, they will not be randomised and will not therefore continue with trial participation. Participants will be informed that they have a right to withdraw from the trial at any time, without having to give a reason and that this will not affect their future care.</p>
                <p>Patients will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive the trial procedure (TTP+IPC) or standard care (TTP alone) using a web-based randomisation system. Patients with an established diagnosis of MPE may be randomised on the day of their procedure, or up to 48 hours in advance. Where a diagnosis of MPE is not established but findings at thoracoscopy are consistent with malignant disease, randomisation will occur during the procedure. Only patients with findings at thoracoscopy consistent with frank malignant change will be randomised. Patients will not be entered into the trial if there is diagnostic doubt.</p>

                <p>All patients will undergo a TTP. Those randomised to the intervention arm will have an IPC inserted in addition. TACTIC will provide sites with IPCs (Rocket medical) but sites may choose to use alternative equivalent devices. If talc poudrage at time of thoracoscopy is not possible, for example, due to patient discomfort, it is possible for patients to proceed within the trial if talc slurry is administered within 24 hours of the thoracoscopy. These patients should continue to receive their allocated treatment (IPC or standard care). If patients in either arm do not receive either a talc poudrage or talc slurry (within 24 hours), this would be considered a treatment failure. If an IPC is not sited for patients in the intervention arm, this would also be considered a treatment failure. In cases of treatment failure, clinical care should continue as per usual practice, a protocol deviation should be completed with the appropriate case report form (CRF) and patients should continue with trial follow-up and assessments.</p>
                <p>Medical thoracoscopy will be performed according to local practice, but consistent with the British Thoracic Society guideline.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Specific to TACTIC participation, sites are advised to insert the IPC prior to talc poudrage (if the patient is allocated to the intervention arm) to avoid potential difficulty placing the IPC if the patient experiences discomfort post-poudrage. It is advised that the IPC should be inserted through a separate entry to the thoracoscopy port and all patients should have a large bore drain (16–24 Fr) inserted via the port site. Talc poudrage or slurry should be administered with 3–4 g sterile graded talc.</p>
                <p>TTP participants will be admitted to hospital postprocedure as per standard care and discharged at the discretion of the treating clinician. TTP+IPC participants will be assessed for discharge on the same day as the intervention but may be admitted if clinically required. For patients who remain an inpatient the trial team will record the day on which suggested discharge criteria (outlined in a trial specific procedure) were met and the day on which discharge occurred.</p>
                <p>For intervention arm participants, IPC drainages will be performed by a trained healthcare professional, a minimum of 5 times per week until the first clinic review at 14 days. Participants will be advised to report to the local trial team if PF drains &lt;50 mL on three consecutive drainages. Following this, a clinical review within 7 days will be arranged to consider repeat imaging and IPC removal, which should take place any time up to 14 days after this point. Any patient who has their IPC removed will continue to undergo planned follow-up for the full 12 weeks.</p>
                <p>All participants will be given patient diaries to capture visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for breathlessness and chest pain, recorded two times a week over 4 weeks post procedure. Diaries will also capture interaction with healthcare providers. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will record IPC drainage volumes. An extract of the patient diary is included in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix B</xref>.</p>
                <p>All concomitant medications (other than other intrapleural pleurodesis agents) are permitted in this trial. Use of medications which are thought to reduce pleurodesis success (such as steroids) are permitted but will be recorded on CRFs. There are no trial restrictions, and participants can take part in other (non-pleural interventional) studies if the other trial protocols permit this. Participants in the non-IPC arm are permitted use of IPCs during the post pleurodesis phase if PF becomes recurrent, and this will be recorded on the CRFs. All other forms of pleurodesis (including via the IPC if present) are not permitted during the first month of follow-up.</p>

                <p>Our primary research question is:</p>
                <p>‘In symptomatic patients with suspected or established MPE, does a combined TTP and IPC result in a reduction in time in hospital and an improvement in dyspnoea, when compared with TTP alone?’</p>
                <p>Two co-primary outcomes were chosen to reflect patient priorities in the treatment of MPE, based on patient and public involvement (PPI) feedback. Specifically, these co-primary outcomes will measure total length of stay in hospital (including re-admissions) and average breathlessness scores over 4 weeks postprocedure.</p>
                <p>Time spent in hospital will be calculated in whole days, with an overnight admission or continuous period in hospital of &gt;12 hours constituting 1 day. Mean breathlessness scores will be assessed using a 100 mm VAS for dyspnoea.

                <title>Safety reporting</title>
                <p>Both study arms entail procedures which are standard of care and have associated recognised risks. The population of patients involved in TACTIC is one in which a high number of AEs are expected. Many of these will not be causally related to the investigational intervention, but rather a direct consequence of the patient’s underlying malignancy (which is an entry criteria).</p>
                <p>The trial intervention is the combination of an IPC with TTP, therefore only AEs related to this IPC require expedited reporting. For participants in the standard care arm, serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reportable if related to the trial intervention and not a recognised procedural risk. To support assessment of relatedness and causality, a clearly defined list of anticipated events is included in the protocol.</p>

                <p>The statistical analysis plan is included in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix C</xref>.</p>
                <p>Separate sample size calculations were undertaken for both co-primary outcomes. Using data on hospital length of stay from previous literature,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> to detect a difference of 2 days over 4 weeks, with 90% power, a 5% significance level and 5% loss to follow-up, we would require 124 participants. Previous RCTs have demonstrated that mean VAS dyspnoea scores in patients post treatment over 6 weeks is 25 mm (SD 26 mm) when treated with either talc or IPC.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The minimal clinically importance difference (MCID) for VAS dyspnoea is 19 mm.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To detect a smaller difference than the MCID of 16 mm, with 90% power, a 5% significance level and 5% loss to follow-up, we would require a total of 116 participants. The planned sample size of 124 participants will therefore be over-powered for this outcome.</p>
                <p>The co-primary outcomes will be initially compared between groups (raw analysis) on an intention to treat basis<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> using independent t-tests for normally distributed data and non-parametric methods (or correction if skewed) for non-normally distributed data. Adjusted analysis using regression for baseline imbalance and the minimisation factors will then be conducted to increase statistical power and certainty.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Pre-hoc subgroup analyses include referral pathway (cytology confirmation or visual confirmation) and the presence of trapped lung. Missing data will be minimised but major remaining missing data (eg, primary outcome) will be dealt with using imputation and sensitivity analyses.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
                <p>A full statistical analysis plan will be written and signed off by the TSC before the end of trial recruitment and prior to the analysis of any primary or secondary outcome.</p>
                <p>Healthcare costs will be compared between treatment groups over 12 weeks from procedure and valued using NHS reference costs. Cost-effectiveness will be measured using an economic evaluation adherent to guidelines for good practice. A within-trial cost utility analysis will explore incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained of TTP+IPC compared with TTP alone.</p>
                <p>Qualitative data will be analysed thematically. Up to 24 patient and carer dyads will be interviewed (12 from each treatment arm), however the final sample size will depend on when data saturation is reached, such that further interviews provide no new data.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>ORTU and the Bristol Academic Respiratory Unit have established PPI mechanisms specific to respiratory and pleural disease. Through these contacts, a patient with personal experience of MPE assessed the funding application and commented positively on the research idea, design and lay summary.</p>
                <p>This study was designed after discussion with the ORTU patient group, a local patient support group for Mesothelioma and Lung Cancer (the Sunflower Club) and after a survey of 30 patients with MPE who underwent IPC and thoracoscopic treatments. The identified priority of reducing time in hospital has been used to determine the primary outcome measure, with specific comments from patients suggesting that reducing time in hospital would ‘improve quality of life’. When asked about priorities in care, examples were (free text) ‘reducing time in hospital’, ‘to be able to breathe, to be as mobile as I can’ and ‘ease of breathing, support at home’. The study design has been discussed, and all surveyed would have been amenable to participation.</p>
                <p>To ensure ongoing relevance of the study to patients, two PPI members sit on the TSC. All patient facing material has been reviewed by patients recruited from the North Bristol NHS Trust pleural clinic. For the purposes of the qualitative interview, a topic guide was developed in conjunction with the study’s PPI members and will be used to guide questions during the interview. This will be tested in two pilot interviews and revised following discussion with the participants and other members of the study team.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The TACTIC trial is a multicentre RCT with the potential to radically affect how patients with malignant pleural disease are treated. It builds on work recently published within the field of pleural medicine. Both TTP and talc slurry via chest drain were shown to offer effective pleurodesis by Bhatnagar <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The IPC-PLUS trial demonstrated that delivering talc slurry via an IPC did not lead to significant AEs such as drain blockage or septations, but offered more moderate pleurodesis success than hypothesised.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>TACTIC hypothesises that IPC insertion in the same procedure as TTP should combine the advantages of both approaches. A TTP will provide pleurodesis, immediately at time of thoracoscopy and allows for highly sensitive diagnostic biopsies to be taken in the same intervention. Addition of an IPC may allow the conversion of a TTP into a day case procedure and provide a ‘safety-net’ for ongoing fluid management in case of pleurodesis failure. Therefore, a combined procedure may provide more effective symptom control, better QoL and a reduction in healthcare utilisation.</p>
              <p>While observational series have demonstrated encouraging findings from this approach, TACTIC will be the first trial to robustly challenge this hypothesis and importantly the first to assess outcomes prioritised by patients such as symptoms and QoL. By streamlining diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for MPE into a single ambulatory procedure, a positive trial outcome is likely to result in this approach being widely adopted by healthcare systems that are currently facing unprecedented strain.</p>
