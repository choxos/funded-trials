                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Metacarpal shaft fractures (MSF) are common traumatic hand injuries that usually affect young people of working age. They place a significant burden on healthcare resources and society; however, there is a lack of evidence to guide their treatment. Identifying the most beneficial and cost-efficient treatment will ensure optimisation of care and provide economic value for the National Health Service. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial comparing surgical and non-surgical treatment for MSF in adults.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre prospective cohort study, with a nested qualitative study consisting of patient interviews and focus groups, and an embedded factorial randomised substudy evaluating the use of text messages to maximise data collection and participant retention. The outcomes of interest include eligibility, recruitment and retention rates, completion of follow-up, evaluation of primary outcome measures, calculation of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for selected outcome measures and establishing the feasibility of data collection methods and appropriate time-points for use in a future trial. Data will be captured using a secure online data management system. Data analyses will be descriptive and a thematic inductive analysis will be used for qualitative data. Minimum clinically important effects for each patient-reported outcome measure will be estimated using anchor-based responsiveness statistics and distribution-based methods.</p>

                  <p>This study has received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee and the Health Research Authority (REC reference 20/EE/0124). Results will be made available to patients, clinicians, researchers and the funder via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Social media platforms, local media and feedback from the Patient Advisory Group will be used to maximise circulation of findings to patients and the public.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Metacarpal shaft fractures (MSF) are common traumatic hand injuries reported to represent 18%–31% of hand fractures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> They usually affect young adult males, often in the third decade of life,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 5</xref> with the fourth and fifth metacarpal most commonly injured.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref></p>
              <p>In 2016, there were 23.5 million accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department attendances in the UK with fractures being the second most common reason for presentation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As hand fractures make up 25% of all A&amp;E attendances<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and MSF comprise 18%–31% of hand fractures,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> MSF therefore place a significant burden on healthcare resources.</p>
              <p>MSF predominantly affect those of working age<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4 8 9</xref> and are thus associated with significant cumulative morbidity.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Missed time off work significantly increases the economic burden of MSF.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, there is no UK-specific data on the healthcare-associated costs, socioeconomic, or societal costs of these injuries.</p>
              <p>There is wide variability in the management of MSF. MSF can be managed non-surgically with appropriate reduction and immobilisation,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> or surgically using a variety of different techniques, including Kirschner-wires (K-wires), intraosseous wires, interfragmentary compression screws, plates or external fixators.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p>A systematic review undertaken in 2019 of treatment interventions for MSF identified 699 records and no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical to non-surgical treatments.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The only retrospective cohort study had several key limitations including small patient numbers, low follow-up rate (17%) and lack of use of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) validated in MSF.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A search of the WHO ISCTRP portal also revealed no ongoing or registered trials worldwide.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Rationale for study</title>
                <p>There is a lack of good quality, large comparative trials to guide the treatment of MSF. There are no published or ongoing RCTs or cohort studies comparing surgical versus non-surgical treatment for MSF. In addition, though the use of PROMs in both the clinical and research setting has increased in recent years, there is no evidence of reliability, validity and responsiveness of PROMs in MSF.</p>
                <p>There are several gaps in the literature:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>No consensus on acceptable parameters of deformity or displacement, leading to widespread variation in treatment</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>No core outcome sets for hand trauma, so we do not know which outcome measures are best suited for the study of MSF</p>
                  </list-item>

                <p>The lack of existing evidence supports the need for a well-designed, pragmatic, multicentre RCT to identify the most beneficial and cost-efficient treatment for MSF in adults. This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability and practicality of such a trial by providing information about study design, number of eligible patients, recruitment, completion of follow-up, selection of appropriate outcome measures, assessment of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for selected outcome measures, costs of treatments and measures to optimise recruitment, engagement and retention in a future trial.</p>

                <p>FACTS is an observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. Treatments will not be randomly allocated; patient care will be determined in the usual way as per the treating clinician.</p>
                <p>Patients who meet the eligibility criteria (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>) will be recruited from hand fracture clinics at participating National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Where participants have multiple MSF with potentially variable fracture patterns, a single digit will be selected as the ‘study finger’. Participants with additional hand or upper limb injuries will be included and the latter recorded. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants by an appropriately trained research associate prior to entering the study. Thereafter, participants will be reviewed in a face-to-face clinic visit at 6 weeks and remotely at 3 and 6 months. This was supported by previous studies of MSF reporting full range of motion in almost all patients by 6 months.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, previous studies in similar patient cohorts with follow-up of 12 months or longer suffered high drop-rates or struggled to recruit adequate numbers of participants. A participant pathway flowchart is illustrated in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>A detailed cost evaluation to establish the costs of treatments for MSF through representative micro-costing will be undertaken. Resource use directly linked to the MSF and its sequela and/or complications over the 6 months of follow-up will be recorded for each participant.

                <p>Participants will be invited to attend a research clinic at 6 weeks following injury. During this visit, clinical assessments of their hand including range of movement, grip strength and presence of rotational deformity or extensor lag will be recorded. Radiographs taken as part of routine clinical care will also be reviewed. The location, fracture morphology, amount of shortening, angulation and presence of step-off deformity on initial radiographs at presentation will be recorded. Complications will be identified by review of the patients’ healthcare records at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Cosmesis will be assessed from question 10 of the Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM), at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. Participant-reported complications will be recorded at the 6-week research clinic visit.</p>
                <p>The following PROMs were selected for use following discussions between clinicians, patients, therapists and researchers at the MSF consensus workshop.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They were prioritised due to their ease of use and validity and will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.</p>

Duration of each procedure, theatre staffing, consumables, imaging, supplementary devices, postoperative recovery time and rehabilitation inputs will be recorded from primary sources, such as theatre log systems and patients’ electronic and paper clinical records. Standard unit costs will be used to estimate NHS costs of care in the 6-month post-treatment.

                <p>Patients and the public have played a central role in selecting the management of MSF as a key research priority and developing the proposed study. The Hand Surgery Research Prioritisation workshop, attended by clinicians, therapists and patients, recommended the management of MSF as a key research priority.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This was ratified by the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership on Common Conditions Affecting the Hand and Wrist.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This joint collaboration with the BSSH involved 261 individuals, of which 41% were patients/carers and 59% were clinicians.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>Furthermore, a MSF Consensus Workshop was held in Nottingham in 2018, bringing together patients with MSF, clinicians, therapists and researchers to share their experiences and develop the PICO framework for a future multicentre trial.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Group discussions informed the eligibility criteria and identified areas of focus for the feasibility work. Selection of patient-centred outcome measures, timing of assessments and follow-up for the proposed study were discussed. A variety of outcome measures were reviewed and the QuickDASH and PROMIS-UE were subsequently added. One clinic visit in addition to virtual follow-up was included and follow-up was adjusted to 3 and 6 months following patient discussions. Feedback from patients who attended the workshop has informed all aspects of the research including research design, choice of outcome measures and length and location of follow-up.</p>
                <p>The study protocol, participant information sheets and consent forms have been reviewed by PPI members, with feedback provided to optimise their utility. We have set up a Metacarpal Shaft Fracture Patient Advisory Group to inform the design, delivery and output of the research. An electronic PPI platform has been created on the Centre for Evidence Based Hand Surgery (CEBHS) website to encourage regular input from patients/public.</p>
                <p>Feedback from the Metacarpal Shaft Fracture Patient Advisory Group will guide distribution of findings to the public. This will include, but not be limited to, newsletters, local media outlets, events and plain English summaries of all published journal articles.</p>
