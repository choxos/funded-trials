                  <p>Data on vaccine immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 are needed for the 40 million people globally living with HIV who might have less functional immunity and more associated comorbidities than the general population.

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this single-arm open-label vaccination substudy within the protocol of the larger phase 2/3 trial COV002, adults aged 18–55 years with HIV were enrolled at two HIV clinics in London, UK. Eligible participants were required to be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with undetectable plasma HIV viral loads (&lt;50 copies per mL), and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL. A prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses was given 4–6 weeks apart. The primary outcomes for this substudy were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine, as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions. Humoral responses were measured by anti-spike IgG ELISA and antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated immune responses were measured by ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation. All outcomes were compared with an HIV-uninfected group from the main COV002 study within the same age group and dosing strategy and are reported until day 56 after prime vaccination. Outcomes were analysed in all participants who received both doses and with available samples. The COV002 study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04400838" id="interrefs20">NCT04400838</ext-link>, and is ongoing.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Nov 5 and Nov 24, 2020, 54 participants with HIV (all male, median age 42·5 years [IQR 37·2–49·8]) were enrolled and received two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Median CD4 count at enrolment was 694·0 cells per μL (IQR 573·5–859·5). No serious adverse events occurred. Local and systemic reactions occurring during the first 7 days after prime vaccination included pain at the injection site (26 [49%] of 53 participants with available data), fatigue (25 [47%]), headache (25 [47%]), malaise (18 [34%]), chills (12 [23%]), muscle ache (19 [36%]), joint pain (five [9%]), and nausea (four [8%]), the frequencies of which were similar to the HIV-negative participants. Anti-spike IgG responses by ELISA peaked at day 42 (median 1440 ELISA units [EUs; IQR 704–2728]; n=50) and were sustained until day 56 (median 941 EUs [531–1445]; n=49). We found no correlation between the magnitude of the anti-spike IgG response at day 56 and CD4 cell count (p=0·93) or age (p=0·48). ELISpot and T-cell proliferative responses peaked at day 14 and 28 after prime dose and were sustained to day 56. Compared with participants without HIV, we found no difference in magnitude or persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral or cellular responses (p&gt;0·05 for all analyses).</p>

              <p id="para10">SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a zoonotic virus late in 2019, is the causative agent of COVID-19, and, as of June 17, 2021, has been responsible for over 176 million confirmed cases and over 3 million <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu" id="interrefs30">deaths</ext-link>. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be brought under control only by a combination of public health interventions and effective vaccination. There are increasing data on the efficacy of different vaccines; however, most evidence for protection derives from studies of adults who are not immunocompromised.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although some countries are already reporting a beneficial effect of vaccination on COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> many are concerned that individuals with less functional immune systems (eg, those with cancer or recovering from organ transplantation) might have more severe disease<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and respond less well to vaccination.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>

                  <p id="para40">Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 reduces morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine is safe, immunogenic, and efficacious; however, most data relating to vaccine outcomes have been derived from populations who are not immunocompromised, and responses for those with impaired immunity might not be as high and less well sustained. HIV infection might affect both the magnitude and durability of outcomes after vaccination and some people with HIV might require additional vaccine doses or adjusted regimens. We searched PubMed for studies published in English from database inception up to May 13, 2021, that assessed outcomes for people with HIV after vaccination against COVID-19 using the search terms “HIV” AND “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2” AND “vaccine” OR “vaccination”. We found no studies specifically reporting vaccine responses against SARS-CoV-2 for people with HIV.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Our data are the first to show humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV in a well characterised UK cohort with well suppressed viraemia and good CD4 cell counts. These data provide evidence that the vaccine is immunogenic in people with HIV on ART during early follow-up, but further data are needed to test durability of this response and in those who are viraemic or have low CD4 cell counts.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>

                  <p id="para80">These data add to the evidence that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is likely to be protective and efficacious against COVID-19 for people with HIV, and reinforce the message that this population should be supported to receive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

              <p id="para100">Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, no evidence existed that people living with HIV were at greater risk of infection or severe disease than those without HIV.

                <p id="para170">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, Cambridge, UK). PBMCs were collected and washed twice with pre-warmed R10 medium: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (also known as RPMI) 1640 medium (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; Sigma), 1 mM penicillin-streptomycin solution (Sigma), and 2 mM L-glutamine solution (Sigma). After the second centrifugation, cells were resuspended in R10 and counted using the Guava ViaCoun assay (Guava Technologies Hayward, CA, USA) on the Muse Cell Analyzer (Luminex Cooperation). T-cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) assays were done on freshly isolated PBMCs, and CellTrace Violet (CTV; Life Technologies) cell proliferation assays (CTV; ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, USA) were done on frozen samples.</p>
                <p id="para180">Humoral responses at baseline and after vaccination were assessed using a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as described previously.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Briefly, Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well ELISA plates (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) were coated with 2 μg/mL of full-length trimerised SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and stored at 4°C overnight for at least 16 h. After coating, plates were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0·05% Tween (Merck Life Science UK, Dorset, UK) and blocked with casein for 1 h at room temperature. Thawed samples were treated with 10% Triton X-100 (Merck Life Science UK, Dorset, UK) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently diluted in casein and plated in triplicate for incubation for 2 h at room temperature alongside two internal positive controls (controls 1 and 2) to measure plate-to-plate variation. Control 1 was a dilution of convalescent plasma sample and control 2 was a research reagent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody (code 20/130 supplied by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Herts, UK). The standard pool was used in a two-fold serial dilution to produce ten standard points that were assigned arbitrary ELISA units (EUs). Goat anti-human IgG (γ-chain specific) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as secondary antibody and plates were developed by adding 4-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine substrate buffer (Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, UK). An ELx808 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments; Winooski, VT, USA) was used to provide optical density measurement of the plates at 405 mm. Standardised EUs were determined from a single dilution of each sample against the standard curve, which was plotted using the 4-Parameter logistic model (Gen5 version 3.09; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). Each assay plate consisted of samples and controls plated in triplicate, with ten standard points in duplicate and four blank wells.</p>
                <p id="para190">Antibody neutralisation was measured in a randomly selected subset of participants by use of a focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT), as described previously,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> where the reduction in the number of the infected foci is compared with a no antibody negative control well. Briefly, serially diluted antibody or plasma was mixed with the SARS-CoV-2/human/AUS/VIC01/2020 strain and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The mixtures were then transferred to a 96-well, cell culture-treated, flat-bottom microplate containing confluent Vero cell monolayers in duplicate and incubated for further 2 h at 37°C, followed by the addition of 1·5% semi-solid carboxymethyl cellulose overlay medium to each well to limit virus diffusion. A focus forming assay was then done by staining Vero cells with human anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies (mAb206) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (A0170; Sigma). Finally, the foci (infected cells), approximately 100 per well in the absence of antibodies, were visualised by adding TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (SeraCare, Milford, MA, USA; #5510-0030). Virus-infected cell foci were counted on an Autoimmun Diagnostika (AID) ELISpot Reader System using AID ELISpot software 7.0 (AID Autoimmun Diagnostika; Straßberg, Germany). The proportion of focus reduction was calculated and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50; reported as FRNT50) was determined using the probit program from the IBM SPSS Statistics 27 package.</p>

Assays were done using Multiscreen IP ELISpot plates (Merck Millipore, Watford, UK) coated with 10 μg/mL of human anti-IFN-γ antibody and developed using streptavidin alkaline phosphatase antibody conjugate kits (Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) and BCIP NBT-plus chromogenic substrate (Moss, Pasadena, MA, USA). PBMCs were separated from whole blood with lithium heparin by density centrifugation within 4 h of venepuncture. Cells were incubated for 18–20 h in RPMI (Sigma) containing 1000 units per mL penicillin, 1 mg/mL streptomycin solution, and 10% heat-inactivated, sterile-filtered FCS, previously screened for low reactivity (Labtech International, Healthfield, East Sussex, UK) with a final concentration of 10 μg/mL of each peptide. A total of 253 synthetic peptides (15mers overlapping by ten amino acids) spanning the entire vaccine insert, including the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence, were used to stimulate PBMCs (ProImmune, Oxford UK). Peptides were pooled into 12 pools for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein containing 18–24 peptides, plus a single pool of five peptides for the tPA leader. Peptides were tested in triplicate, with 2·5 × 10<sup>5</sup> PBMCs added to each well of the ELISpot plate in a final volume of 100 μL. Results are expressed as spot forming cells (SFCs) per million PBMCs, calculated by subtracting the mean negative control response from the mean of each peptide pool response and then summing the response for the 12 peptide pools spanning S1 and S2. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (0·02 μg/mL) and phytohaemagglutinin-L (10 μg/mL) were pooled and used as a positive control. Plates were counted using an AID automated ELISpot counter (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, algorithm C) using identical settings for all plates, and counts were adjusted only to remove artifacts. A lower limit of detection of 48 SFCs per million PBMCs was determined on the basis of the minimum number of spots that could be detected. To define a positive response for categorical analyses, a definition of greater than 221 SFCs per million PBMCs was used.</p>

                <p id="para230">The primary outcomes for the cohort of people living with HIV were safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine as determined by serious adverse events and solicited local and systemic reactions recorded in electronic diaries. As per the protocol, serious adverse events occurring throughout the study period, solicited local and systemic reactions occurring within 7 days of each dose, and unsolicited adverse events occurring within 28 days of each dose were recorded. The secondary outcome of interest in this cohort was the immunogenicity profile of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in people living with HIV. Here, we present antibody responses (serology and neutralisation) and T-cell responses (ELISpot and CTV) as well as T-cell activation and exhaustion data up to 56 days after prime vaccination.

              <p id="para320">All participants were screened for evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection using the anti-nucleoprotein immunoassay and excluded if positive. We identified six individuals who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at screening but had high baseline anti-spike serological responses (≥20 EU) and had a strong responses to vaccination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A, B</xref>). To determine whether these individuals might have undiagnosed previous infection, we explored the ELISpot data to see whether there was evidence of T-cell immunity pre-vaccine.

              <p id="para330">Chronic immune activation in HIV-positive individuals might affect vaccine responses.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para340">These preliminary data show that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine given as prime-boost dosing given 4–6 weeks apart was well tolerated and produced equivalent immune responses in people living with HIV who are well controlled on ART compared with a similar adult population without HIV. These findings suggest that no dose adjustment in the vaccine is needed for people with HIV on ART with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL. Although this study was too small to report protection from infection, the measured immunological responses are similar to those seen in larger studies of HIV-negative participants for whom there is increasing evidence that vaccination leads to a reduction in symptomatic cases and hospital admissions,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> including to variants of concern such as B.1.1.7.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para350">As of June 17, 2021, vaccine roll-out against SARS-CoV-2 is continuing in all countries, and although there are concerns over the potential impact of new variants, there are clear beneficial impacts on hospital admissions and deaths related to COVID-19.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> However, individuals with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies are a population of particular concern because they have increased rates of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality and might respond less well to vaccination. For people with HIV, the relative risk of disease progression, admission to hospital, or death related to COVID-19 is not clear, with several observational studies reporting different results.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This is likely partly related to the heterogeneity of outcomes for individuals with HIV, contingent on access to effective suppressive ART. We studied participants at two major UK NHS centres for HIV care, all of whom were on long-term ART with undetectable viraemia and CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL.</p>
              <p id="para360">Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had a favourable safety profile with no serious adverse events, and symptoms that were reported within 7 days of vaccination were generally mild or moderate. The pattern of reactogenicity was very similar to a population without HIV who received the same vaccine schedule. Although some solicited symptoms appeared to be less frequent for people living with HIV, the comparator group without HIV were an earlier cohort of participants who had been vaccinated in the context of a single-blind randomised study<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and were not advised to take paracetamol if symptomatic after vaccination. Additionally, the HIV-positive cohort were all male, compared with only 52% being male in the HIV-negative cohort, so the findings might have been affected by sex differences in reactogenicity profiles.</p>
              <p id="para370">The participants in this study had both serological and cell-mediated immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein after vaccination and we found no significant difference in responses in our HIV-positive cohort compared with HIV-negative individuals. However, data were available to compare only the anti-spike ELISA and T-cell ELISpot responses with this control group, and do not include details of T-cell polyfunctionality. Additional supportive evidence was provided by the neutralisation assays (done on a subset of participants by use of antibody-mediated live virus neutralisation<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>) and T-cell proliferation assays (done on all available samples), which together supported a rapid response to vaccination that was sustained up to 56 days.</p>
              <p id="para380">Our study had several limitations. First, these are preliminary data reporting results up to 56 days after vaccination. Further follow-up will take place after 6 and 12 months to determine how the vaccine responses are sustained in people with HIV, which is of importance in light of evidence of shorter-lived responses to some vaccines in this population.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> However, in view of concerns regarding the potential for worse outcomes with COVID-19 for people with HIV combined with anxiety over less effective immune responses to vaccination, these preliminary data showing good early immunity are reassuring. Second, this was an open-label study without randomisation and there was no parallel recruitment of adults without HIV at the same centres. Instead, we used data from adults without HIV recruited to the COV002 trial using the same vaccine protocol. Although there was an imbalance in the sex distribution of the people with HIV study group, the cohorts were otherwise similarly matched for age and ethnicity. We have previously found equivalent responses in males and females using this vaccine protocol,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and a South African study in which 69% of a cohort of individuals with HIV receiving vaccination were female showed similar results.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Accordingly, we do not think the sex difference in this study had a substantial effect on the outcome.</p>
              <p id="para390">Extrapolation of the data in our study to all people with HIV regardless of CD4 cell count, gender, ethnicity, and ART status should be done with caution. Our cohort comprised predominantly White European men with access to long-term ART and high CD4 cell counts. Encouragingly, interim data from South Africa also suggest favourable safety and immunogenicity data for vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for people with HIV.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> One might argue that in a population without ART who were viraemic or had CD4 counts below 350 cells per μL the results might have been different. More data are needed in these groups to support our findings in individuals who might be considered to have optimal HIV management, and to factor in data on comorbidities, duration of HIV infection, ART history, and CD4/CD8 ratios. Regardless, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 should continue to be offered and encouraged for all those living with HIV.</p>
              <p id="para400">In this study, we focused on responses to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, so we cannot comment on potential responses among people living with HIV to other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, or to other vaccine interval durations. Other studies have shown that vaccines that induce similar immunological responses to those we document here provide protection from both infection and disease progression.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Further studies are needed in people with HIV and other groups whose immune responses to vaccination might be suboptimal. However, our findings of robust immune responses to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, irrespective of HIV status, are encouraging, and reinforce the message that people living with HIV should be supported to receive vaccination.</p>
