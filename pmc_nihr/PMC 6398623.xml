                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Black British communities are disproportionately burdened by type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications. Tackling these inequalities is a priority for healthcare providers and patients. Culturally tailored diabetes education provides long-term benefits superior to standard care, but to date, such programmes have only been developed in the USA. The current programme of research aims to develop the Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles for Diabetes (HEAL-D) culturally tailored T2D self-management programme for black British communities and to evaluate its delivery, acceptability and the feasibility of conducting a future effectiveness trial of HEAL-D.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Informed by Medical Research Council Complex Interventions guidance, this research will rigorously develop and evaluate the implementation of the HEAL-D intervention to understand the feasibility of conducting a full-scale effectiveness trial. In phase 1, the intervention will be developed. The intervention curriculum will be based on existing evidence-based T2D guidelines for diet and lifestyle management; codesign methods will be used to foster community engagement, identify the intervention’s underpinning theory, identify the optimal structure, format and delivery methods, ascertain adaptations that are needed to ensure cultural sensitivity and understand issues of implementation. In phase 2, the intervention will be delivered and compared with usual care in a feasibility trial. Process evaluation methods will evaluate the delivery and acceptability of HEAL-D. The effect size of potential primary outcomes, such as HbA1c and body weight, will be estimated. The feasibility of conducting a future effectiveness trial will also be evaluated, particularly feasibility of randomisation, recruitment, retention and contamination.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects approximately 3 million people in England and consumes around 10% of the National Health Service (NHS) budget, estimated at almost £9 billion in 2011 and predicted to rise to 17% of the NHS budget by 2035.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Diabetes and its associated complications place an illness burden on patients and carers, which disproportionately affects those from ethnic minority backgrounds.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The estimated prevalence of T2D is up to three times higher for black British communities compared with white Europeans.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> T2D occurs, on average, 10 years earlier in black British people, the mean age of diagnosis is 48 years and approximately 25% of patients are under the age of 40 years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, glycaemic control is worse at the time of diagnosis and requires greater medical management, and poorer outcomes are evident.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> The reasons for these disparities are not fully understood; while biological factors are involved, it is understood that a range of behavioural, lifestyle and health system factors play a role. Tackling these inequalities is a healthcare priority.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref>
</p>
              <p>Individuals of black British ethnicity form the second largest ethnic minority population in the UK; around 4% of the population self-identify from this ethnic background.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Around half of individuals are of black African ancestry and a third of black Caribbean ancestry.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Growth in the black British communities is relatively recent, beginning mainly in response post-Second World War appeals to citizens of the Commonwealth regions to assist with gaps in its labour market. This prompted a large influx of migrants in the 1950s from the Caribbean islands, particularly Jamaica. Migration from the African continent has been more recent, peaking around the 1980s; migrants from African nations currently form the largest growing ethnic minority group in the UK population.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In some regions, such as London, black British communities may represent 30%–40% of the local population and are therefore a ‘majority-minority’ community. Other demographic patterns are recognised; the age distribution of the black African and black Caribbean communities differs, with a larger proportion of black Caribbeans being aged 65 years and over, while in the black African population, a greater proportion are children and young adults. High rates of unemployment are evident, averaging around 12% compared with 4% in the white British population.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>Poor access to diabetes healthcare is a significant issue for minority ethnic groups.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the UK, the NHS provides care to all UK residents that is free at the point of delivery. First-line diabetes management is situated in primary care and aims to promote patient involvement and self-management,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> enabling patients to adopt a healthy lifestyle and to manage their diabetes through support and education.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> To achieve this, UK T2D management guidelines recommend that all patients attend a structured education course to teach them the principals of T2D self-management and that this be offered annually from the time of diagnosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Courses are recommended to use a group structure; typically they use face-to-face delivery by a diabetes specialist nurse or dietitian, with lay educator codelivery in some cases.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Referral to such courses is audited and incentivised through the Quality Outcomes Framework.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Ethnic minority groups report finding it more difficult to access primary care services<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and are more likely to report that they have not had the opportunity to attend a diabetes education course than white populations.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Specifically, African-Caribbean (AfC) communities often report a distrust of medical advice and a desire for natural, non-pharmacological therapies.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Furthermore, healthcare professionals are perceived as lacking cultural understanding<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and their advice as lacking cultural relevance<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> or being poorly adapted to culture and needs,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> despite their intentions; these issues may contribute to the poorer diabetes outcomes and increased morbidity experienced by AfC patients.</p>
              <p>Culturally tailored healthcare is proposed to be one of the main ways in which healthcare disparities can be addressed<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref> and is identified as a priority by patients.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Culturally tailored diabetes education has demonstrated greater improvements in diabetes control and knowledge than usual care, and the benefits are maintained long term.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 24</xref> Culture is a concept that is notoriously difficult to define, but generally, within healthcare, it is thought of as ‘a set of attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviours shared by a group of people, communicated from one generation to the next’.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In their model for understanding cultural sensitivity in healthcare, Resnicow <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> described two dimensions in culture: surface and deep structures. Tailoring interventions to surface structures involves matching materials and messages to observable, ‘superficial’ characteristics of a target population, for example, language and food, familiar to, and preferred by, the target audience. Deep structure involves incorporating the cultural, social, historical, environmental and psychological forces that influence the target health behaviours in the proposed target population. Whereas surface structure generally increases the ‘receptivity’ or ‘acceptance’ of messages, deep structure conveys salience.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Culture is ever evolving for any group, and it is important to recognise the diversity that exists within any one ‘cultural group’, which is particularly evident in migrant populations where second/third generations may have undergone significant acculturation. To date, culturally tailored interventions for the African diaspora have largely been based in the USA and may not translate to UK healthcare structures or UK AfC communities whose cultural needs may be different.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p>
              <p>A two-phase programme of research is proposed in which a culturally tailored, evidence-based self-management programme for T2D in African and Caribbean communities, called Healthy Eating &amp; Active Lifestyles for Diabetes (HEAL-D), is developed, followed by a feasibility trial. The intervention curriculum will be based on existing evidence-based guidelines for T2D<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 27</xref> to enable it to have potential to be embedded into clinical practice; codesign methods will be used to identify the optimal structure, format and methods of delivery and to ascertain appropriate adaptations that are needed to ensure cultural sensitivity of the content.

                <p>Second, it will draw on key themes reported in published literature relating to methodologies for adapting health promotion interventions for ethnic minority groups. These have been evaluated in a number of recent systematic reviews; aside from acknowledging the lack of UK-based studies, these reviews make several recommendations. The powerful influence of social networks on health beliefs and behaviours should be acknowledged,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and a focus on community-level interventions should be taken; delivering care in a social context promotes engagement and has been shown to be more effective than traditional individual-centred behavioural approaches.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Community engagement should be promoted to overcome issues of deep-rooted, historical distrust of medical advice and settings, to develop and nurture trust between the researchers and community and to nurture the strong sense of collectivism and kinship networks that are evident among AfC communities. Participatory methods (eg, patient involvement in intervention design, lay-led delivery of interventions) should be employed as they are highly effective at improving health behaviours and self-efficacy across a number of conditions.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Using community gathering places (eg, faith institutions) as intervention settings offers the benefit of cultural relevancy and may reach populations who would not normally access self-management education.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>

                <title>Identifying the intervention’s theoretical basis</title>
                <p>Behavioural interventions should have a theoretical underpinning<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 32</xref> so that the changes that are expected, and how these will be achieved, can be predicted from consideration of known behaviour change techniques. While there have been a number of interventions tailored to support diet and lifestyle behaviour change in AfC communities,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> their theoretical underpinning has rarely been drawn out or clearly presented. The theoretical underpinning of HEAL-D will be developed through a combination of key themes from the published literature and new primary research.</p>
                <p>In the literature, collectivism and the importance of social interaction for people of AfC ancestry is well reported,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the provision of a social support group, or inclusion of a family member, has been shown to be particularly effective in lifestyle interventions in African-American communities.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> These findings suggest social learning theory, which focuses on promoting behaviour change through social interaction, role modelling and social comparison, may be a relevant behaviour change theory for our intervention. Notably, much of literature that identifies the drivers of health behaviours in AfC communities and may, therefore, inform the theoretical basis of an intervention comes from the USA, and it is not known to what extent these findings apply to AfC in other regions. One of the reasons we will use codesign methods will be to understand the relevance of these existing themes to the UK context and enable us to identify themes that are important to black British communities.</p>

                  <p>Semistructured interviews will be conducted with 8–10 healthcare providers, including general practitioners, practice nurses, diabetes specialist nurses, diabetes specialist dietitians and commissioners. The interviews will cover issues relating to healthcare needs and engagement of AfC patients, experiences of delivering healthcare to AfC patients and barriers and facilitators to working in partnership with community groups to deliver care for AfC communities (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>).

                  <p>Community leaders representing faith and non-faith institutions (n=4–6) will be invited to participate in semistructured interviews. Leaders will be identified initially through existing networks, for example, Diabetes UK Community Champions initiative. Word-of-mouth and ‘snow-balling’ techniques that are highly effective within these communities will be used to recruit a wider network. The interviews will cover issues relating to the role of community networks in promoting health of AfC communities, sustaining health among community members and opportunities for greater impact (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="B1">box 1</xref>).</p>

                  <title>Analysis</title>
                  <p>The focus groups and interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data will be analysed using the framework approach in NVivo (QSR International), theoretically driven by socioecological theory to identify themes relating to issues at the individual, family, community and healthcare delivery levels and how these influence self-efficacy and behaviour change. Our analysis will identify priority behaviours of focus for the intervention, key barriers and facilitators to behaviour change and healthcare engagement, favoured settings and a rudimentary draft of the cultural adaptations. Deviant case analysis, which is consideration of cases that do not fit the general picture, will be undertaken, though our primary interest is in the commonalities as this is a community-level intervention. Primary coding and development of a coding scheme will be carried out by a single researcher; a second researcher will independently use this coding scheme to code 20% of the data for cross-comparison to improve dependability. This will provide methodological rigour required for confidence in the analysis of the qualitative data. The themes will be fed back and discussed with a service user group (SUG), which will consist of representatives of patients, healthcare providers and community leaders. The SUG will be set up to inform and guide each stage of the research plan and will be a forum through which the research team can seek the opinion of key stakeholders, in this case particularly relating to interpretation of the qualitative data and to ensure trustworthiness of conceptualisations. The SUG will also review research documents, such as patient information sheets and questionnaires, and provide feedback on their content and suitability for the communities of focus.</p>
                  <p>We will divide our data into behavioural ‘barriers’ and ‘facilitators’ where possible. To ascertain appropriate behaviour change techniques for our intervention,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> we will map our analysis onto the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) framework from the Behaviour Change Wheel<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>), and then in each case, consider the outcome behaviours that our intervention will aim to achieve; a worked example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref>. We will use the COM-B framework to identify appropriate <italic>functions</italic> of our intervention to optimise facilitators and overcome barriers to achievement of planned outcomes, for example, ‘education’ for capability barriers, ‘modelling’ for opportunity and motivation barriers. Finally, we will select specific behaviour change techniques, for example, education and goal setting, that focus on the specific functions we have identified. We will also look to identify other themes that arise from the data, which might not map clearly onto the COM-B framework (eg, contextual themes relating to the health system) but which may inform our intervention theory as well as help us to understand issues of implementation (eg, favoured settings and timings). Through this analysis, we will identify our intervention theory that we will draw on for the next stage of the study, as documented through a logic diagram.</p>

                <p>Following evaluation of the focus groups and interviews, our stakeholders, 12–15 patients, healthcare providers, commissioners and community leaders will be invited to participate in a series of 2–3 half-day workshops, held in community locations. The workshops will seek to gain stakeholder involvement in developing the details of the interventions. This will include determining the setting, the media channels, structure and delivery, as well as steering the research team to understand and respond to literacy and numeracy needs. The workshops will endeavour to reach a consensus opinion from attendees, but where stakeholders have different needs and a consensus cannot be reached, the research team will consult with the SUG to make decisions on the way forward and consider where there is scope for the intervention to be structured to meet these different needs, for example, delivery in a range of settings. In the first workshop, the research team will feed back the findings of the focus groups and interviews; anonymised interview extracts will be presented to illustrate the key themes and issues that were identified. The stakeholders will be asked to discuss the themes and behavioural targets in small groups, using directed tasks/questions to facilitate the discussions. Following the small group discussions, the researchers will facilitate discussion as a whole to clarify/confirm interpretation; open discussion/debate will be encouraged to examine the themes in depth and for all stakeholders to agree a mutual understanding.</p>
                <p>In the second workshop, elements of the proposed intervention will be presented for comment, refining and development. Using scenarios, the stakeholders will be asked to brainstorm, in small groups, key issues relating to the scenarios. For example, the moderator will present scenarios relating to the intervention setting and the attendees will be asked to discuss and identify the pros and cons of each, and then feed back their discussions to the other attendees. The attendees will be asked to review existing educational/support materials, for example, leaflets and videos, and provide feedback on, for example, language/phrasing, content, pitch and understanding. The research team will then facilitate cross-discussion between groups to develop the conclusions and a consensus.</p>
                <p>In the final workshop, draft intervention materials, developed from workshops 1 and 2, will be presented. For example, media channels that could be used to promote behaviour change such as testimonials, storytelling and cooking demonstrations. The stakeholders will be divided into small groups to discuss and provide feedback on the acceptability of the components of the intervention and identify potential barriers to engagement. Following the small group discussions, the researchers will facilitate feedback and encourage discussion as a whole to clarify/confirm the researcher’s interpretation. The intervention template may be further refined and will be developed into the detailed programme.</p>

In addition, there will be a cohort of phase 1 codesign patients who will be allocated to the intervention arm (not randomised) because their involvement in the intervention design phase would contaminate the control arm.

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p>Participants will principally be recruited from general practice in the London Boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark through screening of referrals for structured education and letters of invitation to patients with established T2D. In addition, participants from the phase 1 codesign study will be invited to participate, and self-referral methods will also be used, for example, posters and advertisements in community locations.</p>
                <p>Patients with diagnosed T2D who are of African or Caribbean ethnicity and with capacity to provide fully informed consent to participation in research will be eligible to participate in the trial. Ethnicity will be self-declared using the standard NHS ethnicity categorisation questionnaire. Patients who are unable to communicate in English and patients with complex therapeutic dietary needs may be ineligible to participate if their individual needs are deemed incompatible with the aims of the intervention. This is because the intervention will provide general diet and lifestyle advice for the self-management of T2D in a group setting; in cases of patients with certain comorbidities, for example, advanced renal disease, the intervention may be inappropriate for the individual, and the group nature of the intervention will prevent their individual needs from being addressed.</p>
                <p>A pragmatic sample size of 120 patients is anticipated to be sufficient to evaluate the programme, allowing for 20% dropout/non-completion; 80 patients will be randomised, 40 in each arm, and a further cohort of patients (n=40) from phase 1 will be allocated to the intervention arm without randomisation. As this is a feasibility trial, it will not be powered to detect statistically significant intervention effects. A primary objective of the study is to provide estimates of key parameters such as potential effect sizes, recruitment and retention rates of the trial and participation rates of the programme to enable the optimal design of a full-scale trial to be determined.</p>

The descriptive data will provide stable estimates of the variability of continuous outcomes by group and provide estimates of differences between the groups in means and proportions for the key outcomes. The SD of the mean change in HbA1c will be estimated by arms and used to derive the sample size calculation for a subsequent trial.</p>

                  <p>A range of quantitative and qualitative data will be collected, as detailed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Attendance records, observation checklists, session/programme evaluation forms completed by patients and records of session activities completed by educators will provide quantitative data and will be used to evaluate a number of process domains, as indicated in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. Our process evaluation will mainly focus on qualitative evaluations, with which we will use inductive reasoning to determine whether the intervention requires further development and adaptation. Patient interviews and focus groups, and interviews with educators, healthcare professionals and commissioners, and session observation notes will provide qualitative data for the evaluation of a number of process domains, as detailed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>.</p>

              <p>This paper presents the protocol for the design and feasibility testing of HEAL-D, a culturally tailored T2D self-management programme for UK African and Caribbean communities. This study will employ rigorous complex intervention methodology to develop and evaluate the implementation of a culturally tailored T2D self-management intervention. The intervention’s curriculum will be based on existing evidence-based guidelines for diet and lifestyle management of T2D; participatory codesign methods will be employed to foster community engagement and partnership. We will use a ‘bottom-up’ approach to identify the cultural adaptations of our intervention and identify its theoretical basis through thematic analysis and the COM-B change framework. The feasibility study will provide us with key information about the feasibility of running a full-scale trial of HEAL-D, and process evaluation methods will enable us to understand how and why the intervention is effective or ineffective.</p>
              <p>To date there have been no tailored education programmes for black British communities. Indeed, it is not known to what extent culturally tailored care is needed for black British communities as little work has been undertaken with these communities. Our codesign work is intended to explore the sociocultural barriers and facilitators to behaviour change and structure HEAL-D accordingly. We acknowledge that we are likely to find huge diversity within our black British communities and <italic>culture</italic> will likely be only one of many important factors that affects their health behaviours. However, our codesign work will provide a more comprehensive theoretical underpinning for the content of our programme than that which currently exists and will provide us with a framework on which to evaluate the effectiveness of our programme. This work will provide essential information and evaluation to inform the design of a future definitive trial.</p>
