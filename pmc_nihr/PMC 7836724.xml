                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection carries a substantial risk of severe and prolonged illness; treatment options are currently limited. We assessed the efficacy and safety of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events for 28 days. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2020-001023-14) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04385095" id="interrefs20">NCT04385095</ext-link>); the pilot trial of inpatients with COVID-19 is now completed.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between March 30 and May 30, 2020, 101 patients were randomly assigned to SNG001 (n=50) or placebo (n=51). 48 received SNG001 and 50 received placebo and were included in the intention-to-treat population. 66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group. Patients receiving SNG001 had greater odds of improvement on the OSCI scale (odds ratio 2Â·32 [95% CI 1Â·07â€“5Â·04]; p=0Â·033) on day 15 or 16 and were more likely than those receiving placebo to recover to an OSCI score of 1 (no limitation of activities) during treatment (hazard ratio 2Â·19 [95% CI 1Â·03â€“4Â·69]; p=0Â·043). SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Patients who received SNG001 had greater odds of improvement and recovered more rapidly from SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients who received placebo, providing a strong rationale for further trials.</p>

              <p id="para10">COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leads to a spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening illness.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> More severe disease is characterised by infection of the lower respiratory tract, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, which results in death in about 0Â·5% of confirmed cases.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para20">In view of the rapid and relentless spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world, there is a pressing need to develop new treatments. Evidence-based therapy is currently limited to remdesivir, an antiviral agent that has shown benefits in the hospital discharge rate,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and dexamethasone, a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory drug offering benefit in patients already requiring respiratory support.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para30">In all viral infections, especially those caused by novel strains where there is little to no established adaptive immunity to the pathogen, the infected host is dependent on innate immune responses to limit the severity of illness once infection occurs. Essential to this innate response is the action of interferons, key orchestrators of the antiviral immune response with both potent antiviral and immunomodulatory functions.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The type I interferon (interferon-Î²) is one of the first cytokines induced by viral infection of a cell and is a primary driver of innate immune responses in the human lung.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> SARS-CoV-2 directly suppresses the release of interferon-Î² in vitro,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and a recent clinical study of patients with COVID-19 showed significantly decreased interferon activity in patients who developed more severe disease.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> At-risk groups, such as those with comorbidities, older people, and recipients of immunosuppressive medication, produce less interferon-Î², which contributes to the risk of more severe lung disease.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Interferons are cytokines that modulate immune responses to viral infection. The type I interferons (interferon-Î± and interferon-Î²) have been tested against coronavirus infections in vitro, with encouraging results. Antiviral responses mediated by interferon-Î² have been shown to be compromised in people susceptible to COVID-19, such as older people or those with chronic airway diseases. Furthermore, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suppresses cellular interferon production, thus limiting the strength of the initial innate immune response. Exogenous use of inhaled interferon beta-1a in patients with asthma and respiratory viral infections has previously been shown to improve antiviral responses and improve lung function. These properties might facilitate improvement or recovery in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infectionâ€”a severe, viral, respiratory disease where the need for an effective therapeutic intervention is paramount. We aimed to evaluate the potential effects of an inhaled interferon beta-1a formulation (SNG001) in patients admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre pilot trial in 98 patients, SNG001 increased the odds of improvement in clinical status (based on the 9-point WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement [OSCI]) and enhanced the likelihood of recovery to a score of 1 on the OSCI (no limitation of activities). SNG001 was also well tolerated compared with placebo.</p>
                  <p id="para90">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">The present study serves as a proof of concept that inhaled interferon beta-1a could attenuate the clinical consequences of COVID-19. Larger studies in patients with COVID-19 are needed to further investigate the therapeutic potential of SNG001 in this setting.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para110">SNG001 is a formulation of recombinant interferon beta for inhaled delivery by nebuliser that is in development for the treatment of virus-induced lower respiratory tract illnesses. The route of delivery was selected with the aim of achieving sufficiently high concentrations of interferon-Î² in the lungs that would result in a robust local antiviral response while limiting systemic exposure to interferon-Î², which is associated with flu-like symptoms.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Inhaled SNG001 has been well tolerated in clinical studies to date involving 230 patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or both.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In these patients, SNG001 has been shown to boost lung antiviral defences, as assessed by sputum cell antiviral biomarkers, in patients with and without respiratory viral infections.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In two phase 2 trials, SNG001 had a significantly greater beneficial effect on lung function than placebo in patients with asthma who had symptoms of respiratory viral infection.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para120">The existing clinical data for inhaled SNG001, coupled with the known suppression of interferon-Î² by SARS-CoV-2, provided the rationale for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial to determine whether inhaled SNG001 has the potential to reduce the severity of lower respiratory tract illness and accelerate recovery in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The design of this trial was based on the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> issued in February, 2020.</p>

                <p id="para130">This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 2, pilot clinical trial was done in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared SNG001 and placebo given once daily for up to 14 days, with post-treatment follow-up for a maximum of 28 days.</p>
                <p id="para140">The trial was done at nine UK sites in accordance with the protocol (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>) and all applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the International Council for Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, the standards set out by the Research Governance Framework, the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided either written or verbal informed consent. Safety data were reviewed and monitored by an independent data safety monitoring committee. The trial protocol was reviewed and approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and an independent ethical committee and site hospital boards where the trial was done (Research Ethics Committee reference number 20/NW/0168).</p>
                <p id="para150">Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms. All eligible participants had to have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test result in a UK National Health Service (NHS) diagnostic, qualitative RT-PCR assay or a positive point-of-care test (FebriDx, Lumos Diagnostics, Sarasota, FL, USA) within the previous 24 h.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Patients were required to understand the information provided in the consenting process and to be willing to give consent. Exclusion criteria included inability to use a nebuliser with a mouthpiece (eg, ventilated patients and patients in intensive care); and pregnancy or intention to become pregnant and breastfeeding (a complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 2â€“3</xref>). During the trial, in version 3 of the protocol, the inclusion criteria were amended on April 16, 2020, to allow additional inclusion based on a positive point-of-care viral infection test in the presence of a strong clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This change was made to prevent a delay in patient enrolment while waiting for RT-PCR results.</p>

                <p id="para160">After eligibility was confirmed and consent obtained, patients were allocated a unique patient identification number (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>) and assigned to one of two treatment groups according to a double-blind randomisation (1:1) schedule: active treatment (SNG001) or placebo, administered along with local standard-of-care treatment. Simple randomisation was done manually by use of sealed envelopes, with trained clinical research staff assigning the patient the next available randomisation number on the randomisation list. Study investigators, all research and analysis teams, and patients were masked to treatment allocation.</p>

During the 14-day treatment period and while patients were in hospital, vital signs and levels of consciousness or evidence of confusion or agitation, or both, were recorded twice daily. Additionally, assessments for pneumonia by chest auscultation (and other forms of physical examination if deemed necessary by the investigator), and OSCI and BCSS were done daily. OSCI assessments, blood sampling, and 12-lead electrocardiogram assessments (and chest x-rays, if required) were done 24 h (Â±1 day) after the patient's last dose. The use of concomitant medications was recorded throughout the study. Patients were also regularly assessed for signs or symptoms that might be considered adverse events related to the investigational medicinal product. If a patient was discharged from hospital during the study, the assessments were done by telephone or video link or by email, where feasible. Patients underwent a final outcome assessment 14 days (Â±3 days) after the last dose of SNG001 or placebo.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The primary outcome, as defined in the protocol, was the change in clinical condition on the OSCI (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes included the change in BCSS score and the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug. The full set of objectives and endpoints are provided in the protocol in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 16)</xref>. Throughout the study period, patients frequently underwent non-suggestive questioning about their wellbeing and any adverse events they experienced were noted.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para210">The sample size of 100 patients (50 per group) in this pilot study was based on WHO recommendations that a pilot phase with 100 patients would be sufficient to inform follow-on clinical research.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> No formal power calculations were done. Analysis followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan on an intention-to-treat basis (ie, including all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug); informal hypothesis testing was done at the 5% Î±-level with 95% CIs presented in all analyses. As no previous clinical data had been collected with the OSCI in the study population, the most appropriate way of analysing and interpreting the OSCI was unknown. It was therefore considered inappropriate to select a single primary analysis method for this pilot study. Multiple analyses were done to explore death from disease, worsening of disease, improvement and recovery from disease, both at fixed timepoints and over the dosing period, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate statistical method for future clinical trials. There was no hierarchy across analyses and no adjustments were made for multiplicity.</p>
                <p id="para220">All analyses described below were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, OSCI score at baseline (categorised as â‰¤3 or â‰¥4), race (categorised as White or non-White) and duration of previous symptoms (categorised as &lt;10 days or â‰¥10 days). Analyses of OSCI data were done over the treatment period or at each individual visit, as appropriate. For OSCI, the treatment period was defined as 16 days, which included the 14-day dosing period and an end-of-treatment visit on day 15 or day 16.</p>
                <p id="para230">Analysis of improvement on the OSCI scale was done with an ordered logistic regression model assuming proportional odds.</p>
                <p id="para240">Severe disease or death (OSCI â‰¥5), intubation or death (OSCI â‰¥6), and death (OSCI=8) were analysed with logistic regression models. Post-hoc analyses of these endpoints with Firth logistic regression were also done, due to data separation issues observed after study unblinding. Time to first severe disease or death, time to first intubation or death, and time to death were analysed with Cox proportional hazards models. Time to OSCI recovery (defined as OSCI â‰¤1 without rebound) and time to hospital discharge (defined as OSCI â‰¤2 without rebound) were analysed with Fine and Gray's sub-distribution hazard model fitted with death as a competing event. Sustained recovery and sustained hospital discharge were also analysed with logistic regression models.</p>
                <p id="para250">A last-observation-carried-forward approach was used to impute missing data for analyses of sustained recovery, sustained hospital discharge, and improvement.</p>
                <p id="para260">Breathlessness and cough scores and total BCSS score were analysed with mixed models for repeated measures. Data from the follow-up visits or early withdrawal visits after day 16 were not included in the analysis. Missing breathlessness symptom scores were imputed as 4 (severe) for patients who were intubated or who received non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen (OSCI â‰¥5). Analysis of sputum scores was not planned because COVID-19 is characterised by a dry, non-productive cough.</p>
                <p id="para270">Safety endpoints were described as frequencies (%). Due to the exploratory nature of this phase of the study, statistical determinations of p values and confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple testing. All analyses were done with SAS, version 9.4.</p>

              <p id="para430">This study was a randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre, phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of inhaled SNG001, an interferon beta-1a nebuliser solution, in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The results of this pilot trial have shown that SNG001, given as a daily inhaled dose of 6 MIU via nebuliser for 14 days, was associated with greater odds of improvement versus placebo on the WHO OSCI and more rapid recovery to a point where patients were no longer limited in their activity, with a greater proportion of patients recovering during the 28-day study period. There was a non-significant reduction in the odds of progression to severe disease or death in the intention-to-treat population that became significant in the per-protocol population. Secondary outcome analysis of symptoms revealed a greater improvement in breathlessness and total BCSS over the treatment period with SNG001 than with placebo.</p>
              <p id="para440">In keeping with previous observations in patients with asthma<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and COPD,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> nebulised SNG001 was well tolerated. More patients had serious adverse events in the placebo group than in the SNG001 group. The most common serious adverse events in both treatment groups were related to COVID-19. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event in the SNG001 group was headache. Treatment-emergent adverse events considered to be related to treatment were infrequent, with cough being the only treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse event in the SNG001 group that occurred in more than one (two) patients. Three patients died in the placebo group; there were no deaths in the SNG001 group.</p>
              <p id="para450">The findings of this trial suggest the potential utility of SNG001 in treating patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, although SNG001 should be explored further in a phase 3 trial. Currently, treatment options for COVID-19 remain limited, with the only evidence-based therapies being remdesivir and dexamethasone.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite the use of these therapies, clinical outcomes remain poor. Dexamethasone is only indicated in patients who already require respiratory support (oxygen with or without mechanical ventilation), with a numerically poorer outcome seen in patients with less severe disease.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> In the ACTT-1 trial, remdesivir shortened the time to hospital discharge by 5 days and increased the odds of improvement in clinical status, assessed with the OSCI.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> By contrast, remdesivir had little or no effect on patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in the WHO SOLIDARITY trial, as assessed by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, or duration of hospital stay.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> There is clearly a need for additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19 and the results presented here suggest that inhaled interferon-Î² might be effective in this setting, although our results require further investigation in future trials.</p>
              <p id="para460">Injectable drug products containing interferon-Î± and interferon-Î² have been used in the clinic for many years. In the context of highly pathogenic coronavirus strains including SARS-CoV-2, interferon-Î² has been shown to be more potent than interferon-Î±.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Two forms of recombinant interferon beta are available. SNG001 contains interferon beta-1a, which is produced in mammalian cells, shares the same amino acid sequence as naturally occurring interferon-Î², and has a higher specific activity than interferon beta-1b, which is produced in non-mammalian cells.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> SNG001 is formulated at pH 6Â·5 (as low pH is known to cause cough) and does not contain excipients (such as mannitol, human serum albumin, and arginine) present in injectable forms of interferon beta. SNG001 is inhaled via a mesh nebuliser, which maintains drug activity after aerosolisation.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The rationale for this route of administration is to enable maximal delivery of the active drug to the biological focus of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the respiratory epithelium.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Pragmatic studies<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and ongoing randomised controlled trials are seeking to explore the effects of injected type I interferons in COVID-19. The REMAP-Cap study, focusing on patients in the intensive care setting,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and the SOLIDARITY<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and DisCoVeRy trials<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> in patients admitted to hospital are evaluating injected interferon beta-1a, but have yet to show whether and to what extent systemic delivery is effective and well tolerated. Data from the SOLIDARITY study appear to indicate that injected interferon beta is ineffective and given the greater bioavailability of inhaled drugs at the lung epithelium, such concentrations could be matched only by giving extremely high doses of the injected drug with the risk of unacceptable intolerability, suggesting that the inhaled route is likely to provide better antiviral outcomes. Such an approach was taken in a recent analysis of an uncontrolled exploratory study of nebulised interferon alfa-2b, reported in a hospital setting in Wuhan, China, indicating a positive effect on viral load and the inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, although there was an imbalance in age between treated patients and controls.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> More recently, a similar, pragmatic, open-label study reported clinical benefits with aerosol inhalation of interferon kappa plus trefoil factor 2, showing reductions in viral shedding and duration of symptoms and hospital stay in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Taken together with our study, these results suggest a potential antiviral benefit of aerosolised interferon therapy in COVID-19. The value of this approach might be driven, in part, by the evasive nature of SARS-CoV-2 on natural type I interferon production, which is more profound than with other comparable respiratory pathogens.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The optimal route and specific type of interferon might depend on the stage of disease, the spread of viral infection beyond the lung, and the ease of administration in different clinical settings.</p>
              <p id="para470">The timing of interferon treatment for COVID-19 has been the subject of considerable debate, with concerns being raised that later interferon treatment might cause or exacerbate the cytokine storm observed in the later stages of severe disease. For example, to avoid concerns over potential pro-inflammatory effects of interferon, in an open-label study of injected interferon beta-1b in a triple combination with lopinavirâ€“ritonavir and ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19, investigators limited treatment with interferon to within 7 days of onset of symptoms.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> It was concluded that triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to the lopinavirâ€“ritonavir combination in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. In our study, patients had a median duration of symptoms of 10 days at recruitment and SNG001 was given daily for 14 days. Importantly, we found that SNG001 was well tolerated and showed clinical benefit, suggesting that there is a substantially greater window for effective treatment.</p>
              <p id="para480">Further trials in different clinical settings, including in ventilated patients or in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 not requiring treatment in hospital, are warranted or underway.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> With the second wave of COVID-19 coinciding with the winter incidence of cold and influenza in the northern hemisphere, the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents, such as interferon-Î², that boost local lung defences rather than targeting specific viral mechanisms, might carry substantial additional benefits to patients and to overburdened health-care systems alike; this will also require investigation.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para490">Our clinical trial had a number of limitations. As a pilot study of a relatively novel treatment in an inpatient population, the sample size was limited, making the generalisability of the findings to wider populations and health-care systems, where standard of care might vary, challenging. The OSCI at the time of the study was a new tool and its performance in randomised controlled trials of COVID-19 was uncertain. In this pilot study, we elected to assess this outcome in multiple statistical analyses and to report them without hierarchy. This approach enabled exploration of this new tool with the aim of identifying the most appropriate statistical method for future clinical trials. However, this approach introduces the issue of repeat analyses of this outcome, which requires consideration in the interpretation of the results and highlights the need for larger-scale, formal testing of a selected approach in the next phase of development. The nebuliser used in this study is not suitable for use in patients requiring ventilation; further studies of SNG001 with alternative delivery devices to include these critically ill patients are warranted. In any pilot study, not all factors can be evenly balanced during randomisation. In this study, SNG001 and placebo groups were well matched for age, sex, and overall comorbidities, but were less well matched for disease severity at recruitment and for specific comorbid conditionsâ€”particularly diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. However, these factors were considered in the statistical model used and beneficial signals for therapy were enhanced when a priori adjustments were made. Phase 3 trials will address these issues through randomisation of larger and more heterogeneous groups. Due to an urgency to deliver a trial result in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, patient follow-up was completed at 28 days, a timepoint at which, interestingly, some of the greatest treatment effects of SNG001 on recovery were observed. Recent evidence suggests that the long-term sequelae of severe COVID-19 are significant,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> so it will be important to track the effects of SNG001 on the prevention and resolution of these symptoms in future trials. Additional sampling beyond core safety parameters was limited by the increased acute care burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional capture of exploratory inflammatory and virological endpoints could have provided useful information about the mechanism of therapeutic response but were not feasible in this setting. Future studies in different clinical settings will enable these analyses to be done.</p>
              <p id="para500">Five patients withdrew consent in the placebo group, as did six in the SNG001 group. Although there was no indication that the treatment was associated with differential withdrawal, since similar numbers of patients withdrew in both groups, it is important to understand for future studies that substantial withdrawal rates might occur in the setting of acute COVID-19 care, perhaps due to associated complexities of care and uncertainties in outcome.</p>
              <p id="para510">In conclusion, SNG001, a treatment already studied and shown to be well tolerated in patients with asthma and COPD, seems to also be well tolerated in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, with a range of clinical outcomes displaying a beneficial pattern of response to SNG001 therapy. These encouraging data provide a strong rationale for larger, international studies in the context of the ongoing clinical burden of COVID-19. In addition to a phase 3 trial of SNG001 in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 requiring no more than supplementary oxygen, it might be appropriate to also assess the safety and efficacy of SNG001 in ventilated, critically ill patients with COVID-19 who have evidence of active viral infection in the lungs. In view of the broad antiviral effects of interferon-Î², the results of this pilot trial suggest that the efficacy of SNG001 should also be assessed in the hospital setting against other seasonal respiratory viruses, which cause considerable morbidity and mortality every year, including cases of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, which could overwhelm health-care systems during the coming months in the northern hemisphere.</p>
