                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">People with psychosis have high rates of trauma, with a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence rate of approximately 15%, which exacerbates psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Pilot studies have shown that trauma-focused (TF) psychological therapies can be safe and effective in such individuals. This trial, the largest to date, will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a TF therapy integrated with cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp) on post-traumatic stress symptoms in people with psychosis. The secondary aims are to compare groups on cost-effectiveness; ascertain whether TF-CBTp impacts on a range of other meaningful outcomes; determine whether therapy effects endure; and determine acceptability of the therapy in participants and therapists.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Rater-blind, parallel arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing TF-CBTp + treatment as usual (TAU) to TAU only. Adults (<italic>N</italic> = 300) with distressing post-traumatic stress and psychosis symptoms from five mental health Trusts (60 per site) will be randomised to the two groups. Therapy will be manualised, lasting 9 months (m) with trained therapists. We will assess PTSD symptom severity (primary outcome); percentage who show loss of PTSD diagnosis and clinically significant change; psychosis symptoms; emotional well-being; substance use; suicidal ideation; psychological recovery; social functioning; health-related quality of life; service use, a total of four times: before randomisation; 4 m (mid-therapy); 9 m (end of therapy; primary end point); 24 m (15 m after end of therapy) post-randomisation. Four 3-monthly phone calls will be made between 9 m and 24 m assessment points, to collect service use over the previous 3 months. Therapy acceptability will be assessed through qualitative interviews with participants (<italic>N</italic> = 35) and therapists (<italic>N</italic> = 5–10). An internal pilot will ensure integrity of trial recruitment and outcome data, as well as therapy protocol safety and adherence. Data will be analysed following intention-to-treat principles using generalised linear mixed models and reported according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Social and Psychological Interventions Statement.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The proposed intervention has the potential to provide significant patient benefit in terms of reductions in distressing symptoms of post-traumatic stress, psychosis, and emotional problems; enable clinicians to implement trauma-focused therapy confidently in this population; and be cost-effective compared to TAU through reduced service use.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par78">People with psychosis report high rates of adversity and trauma, particularly interpersonal victimisation (e.g. emotional, physical, and sexual abuse/assaults) both in childhood and adulthood, with the majority having experienced multiple traumas (75–98% of those reporting trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]). The prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population is approximately 15%, which is up to five times the general population rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PTSD is characterised by intrusive memories of the trauma, such as ‘flashbacks’, hyperarousal, and avoidance of trauma reminders. Post-traumatic symptoms are frequently intertwined with psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in clinical practice PTSD is overlooked in many people with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A single diagnosis often means that the psychosis is treated pharmacologically, but not the psychological effects of traumatic events. Such individuals have a poorer response to antipsychotic medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and increased substance-abuse, self-harm, suicide behaviour, and psychiatric and medical hospitalisation than those with psychosis alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par79">Cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is recommended for people with psychosis, as an adjunctive therapy to medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CBTp is a ‘trauma-informed’ therapy, in that it involves making sense of how trauma has shaped a person’s difficulties, and learning strategies for managing trauma-related distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, it does not focus directly on the key psychological mechanism in the development and maintenance of PTSD—vivid, sensory trauma memories that are poorly contextualised in autobiographical memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Trauma-focused CBT (TF-CBT) is recommended for PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which includes ‘trauma memory reprocessing’, i.e. targeting trauma memories directly, through imaginal exposure, in vivo exposure, and experiential and cognitive techniques to modify their associated meanings. These techniques elaborate and contextualise trauma memories in autobiographical memory so that they become less distressing and less likely to intrude involuntarily (e.g. as flashbacks or nightmares). However, therapists can be reluctant to address PTSD symptoms directly in people with psychosis as they fear the memory reprocessing procedures may exacerbate psychotic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These concerns have excluded people displaying psychotic symptoms from all prominent PTSD trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par80">Three systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have all concluded there is emerging evidence from open and pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and case-series studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] that treating PTSD can be safe and efficacious in psychosis. The largest RCT was carried out in The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and recruited adults with a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis and meeting full diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Compared to the waiting list group, trauma-focused therapies led to improvements in PTSD symptoms with large between-group Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] effect sizes (ES) (0.78; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, in the Prolonged Exposure arm; 0.65; <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, in the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) arm) as assessed with a continuous measure of PTSD symptoms (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). Furthermore, 57% in the Prolonged Exposure group (<italic>N</italic> = 53), and 60% in the EMDR condition (<italic>N</italic> = 55), achieved a loss of PTSD diagnosis, compared to 28% of the waiting list group (<italic>N</italic> = 47). End of therapy effects were maintained at both 6 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and 12 m [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] follow-up time points, with similar results obtained on secondary outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, the 12-m follow-up analyses were within group only (comparing the 6 to 12 m outcomes), and further research is needed to ascertain between-group long-term effects.</p>
                <p id="Par81">There have been four recent UK studies (one RCT and three case-series studies) in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Steel and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] also showed that psychological therapy was safe and feasible in a small RCT with people diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (<italic>N</italic> = 61). However, no difference was found between therapy and treatment-as-usual (TAU) groups on PTSD symptoms on the CAPS-S (CAPS for Schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; either at the 6 m (end of therapy; ES = 0.26; <italic>p</italic> = 0.39) or 12 m (ES = 0.29; <italic>p</italic> = 0.39) follow-up time points, with both groups improving. There are two potential reasons for the discrepant results between the UK and Dutch trials. First, the therapy protocol in the Steel et al. trial involved cognitive restructuring only, without the exposure element, unlike the Dutch study. Second, participants did not meet full PTSD diagnostic criteria in the UK trial. As a result, participants presented with less severe, and potentially less stable, PTSD symptoms compared to other trials, potentially leading to some degree of spontaneous recovery occurring in both arms.</p>
                <p id="Par82">The proposed trial will address the limitations of the previous trials in several ways. First, our proposed intervention, TF-CBTp, includes trauma memory exposure, which is hypothesised to be central to effective trauma-focused therapy for PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This standard PTSD therapy will be integrated with the standard therapy for psychosis, CBTp, according to our previous theoretical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], practice recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and case-series of TF-CBTp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Second, all participants will meet PTSD diagnostic criteria. They will also be screened for the presence of at least one re-experiencing symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], to ensure specificity of presenting symptoms to PTSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and on which to anchor the trauma memory reprocessing therapeutic procedures. The diagnostic interview will put particular emphasis on assessing symptom stability, i.e. continuous presence of symptoms, attributable to the index trauma, for 1 month minimum, as specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). Third, this study will differ from the Dutch trials (including a new, ongoing trial comparing Prolonged Exposure, EMDR, Cognitive Restructuring and Waiting List) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] by only including participants with current distressing psychotic symptoms, rather than merely a lifetime psychotic disorder diagnosis. Last, between-group analyses 2 years post-randomisation will be reported to ascertain the sustainability of treatment effects.</p>
                <p id="Par83">Integrating TF therapy with CBTp means that it is more intensive and lengthier than the Prolonged Exposure intervention reported by the Dutch group (9 months compared to eight weekly 90-min sessions over 10 weeks, respectively). However, van den Berg and colleagues have since reported their protocol had too few sessions and have recommended longer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Psychosis and PTSD symptoms are often intertwined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], for example hearing the voice of an abuser, experiencing physical sensations of being interfered with, or visions of past torturers (i.e. auditory, somatic, and visual hallucinations); or believing past abusers implanted a chip in your brain to track you (paranoid delusions). In practice, it therefore makes little clinical sense to treat the PTSD and psychosis symptoms separately. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] recommend a minimum of 16 sessions over 6 months or longer for psychosis, with more sessions leading to better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Therapy lasting 12 months plus boosters is recommended for complex PTSD where there are multiple or chronic traumas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which is the case for most of the people with psychosis seen in services. Therefore, TF-CBTp is shorter and potentially less costly than if the two conditions were addressed separately. In general, integration of exposure procedures within standard therapies is preferable for complex, co-morbid populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par84">To conclude, the current evidence derives from a range of diverse small trials in different health settings. They clearly demonstrate feasibility and promise of useful effects, but a pragmatic effectiveness trial is now needed. NICE have recommended that ‘an adequately powered, multi-centre RCT is needed to test whether a CBT-based trauma reprocessing intervention can reduce PTSD symptoms and related distress in people with psychosis and schizophrenia’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The recent Cochrane Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] also recommended that good quality evidence is required on trauma-focused therapy in psychosis individuals with co-morbid PTSD. This study follows these recommendations and will test of whether TF-CBTp is safe, and clinically and cost-effective in people with psychosis.</p>
                <sec id="Sec4">
                  <title>Covid-19 adaptations to the trial</title>
                  <p id="Par85">Adaptations were made to the protocol during the pandemic to enable assessments and the intervention to be delivered remotely either by videoconferencing or telephone, when in-person meetings were not possible. Although the drivers for these adaptations were compliance with UK government guidelines, there is evidence about the efficacy of remote delivery of PTSD psychological treatments dating back to more than a decade, both in terms of telehealth (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for a review) and e-Mental Health (internet) interventions more generally (39 studies identified by a systematic review by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]). There is evidence of non-inferiority from trials comparing remote with in-person delivery of treatment directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], in terms of PTSD symptom reductions and maintenance of treatment gains. The use of remote therapy does not affect therapy competence, adherence, and general fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Overall, a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] concluded that telehealth interventions for PTSD have a demonstrated evidence base of feasibility, acceptability, and comparable outcomes to traditional in-person therapy, without compromising the therapeutic process.</p>
                  <p id="Par86">There is less research on telephone delivery, but several studies support the efficacy of telephone treatments for depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. A review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] found few differences in patient satisfaction in 15 studies comparing video conferencing or telephone therapy to in-person therapy. Of note, although there is a dearth of studies investigating videoconferencing in psychosis populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], in clinical practice it is the norm to have at least some therapy sessions delivered by phone with such populations, which reduces the number of missed sessions for this group who may have difficulty attending in person.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">There has been some suggestions that remote delivery may adversely impact the therapeutic relationship, with some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] finding a slightly higher drop-out rate than in in-person PTSD treatments. To minimise this possibility, we incorporated the extensive guidelines that have been published for successful delivery of remote therapy in our therapy protocol and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]; see also resources at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Foxcadatresources.com%2Fcovid-19-resources%2F&amp;data=01%7C01%7Cemmanuelle.peters%40kcl.ac.uk%7C7d3e75893a8149ebbd8e08d850c5e8ad%7C8370cf1416f34c16b83c724071654356%7C0&amp;sdata=jrT3Bcl8qo7yMGdlCAPaaPPHM4kCZqXD0LLJHnuYrOE%3D&amp;reserved=0">https://oxcadatresources.com/covid-19-resources/</ext-link>). In addition, our therapy protocol already includes digital materials (around providing psychoeducation and promoting control), which will benefit digital platforms and will facilitate therapy engagement.</p>
                  <p id="Par88">We have included a measure of therapeutic alliance for participants in the therapy group that will allow us to monitor the potential impact of different modes of delivery on the therapeutic relationship. We will record the type of delivery used for each assessment and therapy session, which will enable us, if required, to do post hoc analyses comparing the use of different platforms on outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">If appropriate, the adaptations will be deliverable for the entirety of the study, rather than just during the pandemic. Pre-pandemic, the drivers for developing remote treatments were to increase access to therapy when in-person meetings were not feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, during 2020, there has been a step change in the implementation of these methods across the UK (and internationally). It is likely that some of these changes will remain post-pandemic, and we will be able to continue to offer remote delivery throughout the trial for those who prefer it. There is limited research evidence on patient preferences, but one study found that up to 50% of participants preferred remote delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par90">Equally, we know that not everyone is able or willing to access remote therapy, with older and disadvantaged groups being less likely to have access to the technology, including having the necessary digital literacy, and/or suitable private space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. With regard to psychosis populations specifically, a recent study in one of the trial sites showed that 30% of people on a psychological therapy waiting list declined the offer of remote therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, to adhere to patient choice, there will be the opportunity to carry out in-person therapy for those who choose to do so, even during Covid-19 restrictions, adhering to Trust policies and government guidelines to ensure safety of therapists and participants.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">Overall, the current changes taking place throughout the UK and elsewhere will likely change the landscape of therapy delivery well beyond this pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and will contribute to increased patient choice and access to therapy, especially for difficult to reach populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Delivering at least some therapy sessions by phone is already standard practice with psychosis population; going forward, there will be increased flexibility of delivery platforms to cater to different clinical needs and preferences, both across patients and within the duration of therapy for individual patients. We are therefore confident that our results will be valid and generalisable post-pandemic. We will also have access to further data on patient and therapist experience through our qualitative interviews, which will provide useful information about the effective use of the different options.</p>

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par100">There will be five recruiting sites across England (South London and Maudsley (SLaM); Greater Manchester Mental Health; Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear; Oxford Health; Sussex Partnership), all of which are foundation NHS mental health trusts and have close links with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) (King’s College London (KCL); University of Manchester; Newcastle University; Oxford University; University of Sussex). All secondary and tertiary care services within these trusts are potential sources of recruitment. Neighbouring trusts will be approached to act as Participant Identification Centres (PIC) for the recruiting sites if required.</p>
                <p id="Par101">The five NHS Trusts serve an ethnically diverse population and provide mental health care across a range of services in a variety of settings, ranging from adult Community Mental Health Teams, including Early Intervention for Psychosis services; inpatient wards and residential services; outpatient clinics and allied third sector services. Therapy will be delivered in community settings.</p>

                  <p id="Par102">In response to the global pandemic, the research team has made adaptations to the protocol to enable the trial to continue in the event of social distancing restrictions being in place. Recruitment, assessment, and therapy delivery will be conducted remotely, using videoconferencing or telephone, where it is not possible to see participants in-person. Study documents such as Participant Information Sheets and trial leaflets will be sent either by e-mail or post. Wherever possible, participant choice for mode of attendance will be respected, unless it conflicts with NHS trust and University guidance at any given time.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par103">The target population will be adult mental health patients in secondary or tertiary care at the time of referral, presenting with current distressing psychotic and post-traumatic stress symptoms. They will meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses (SSD) and PTSD, the former determined by the research team following clinical notes review and consultation with care team, as appropriate, and the latter determined by a diagnostic assessment using a standardised measure.</p>
                <p id="Par104">Potential participants with psychosis who report a past index trauma, defined as event(s) experienced at least 1 m ago and still affecting them now (ascertained using the Mini-Trauma And Life Events (TALE) checklist (5 items depicting common traumas + 1 item in two parts (‘do any of the event(s) reported still affect you now and if so which one(s) currently affect you most’) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]), will first be screened for the presence of at least one of the five re-experiencing items from the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>];, to ensure participants are presenting with PTSD-specific symptoms on which to anchor the trauma-focused therapy. Participants who satisfy the re-experiencing symptom criterion will then be administered the full-length TALE checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], to determine trauma nature and timing, and elicit any other index traumatic event(s). They will then undergo a PTSD diagnostic interview based on the identified index trauma(s), according to the DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] criteria, to ensure presence and stability of PTSD symptom criteria.</p>
                <p id="Par105">People with SSD do not necessarily experience continuous psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, which typically are the targets of psychological therapies: their symptoms may have remitted, or they may present with cognitive or functional impairments only. We will therefore have the additional requirement that individuals report current distressing hallucinations and/or delusions (over the past month), as specified by previous CBTp trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The full Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram depicting the eligibility and assessment stages is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

                <p id="Par106">These specifications will ensure inclusion of people with at least moderately severe and stable post-traumatic stress and psychotic symptoms. Traumatic events can occur before or after psychosis onset, and co-morbid PTSD presentations are present in all stages of psychosis presentations. We will therefore not place any restrictions on type or timing of traumatic exposure, or participants’ age (apart from those applied to adult services).</p>

                  <title>Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp)</title>
                  <p id="Par128">TF-CBTp is a manualised therapy integrating standard psychological therapy for PTSD and for psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It will be delivered over a period of 9 m. Approximately 26 weekly or bi-weekly individual 60–90-min sessions will be offered in the first 6 m. Bi-weekly rather than weekly sessions have a potential to be beneficial during the trauma reprocessing phase of the therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] but it will be left to participant choice. A further three sessions will be offered on a monthly basis during the next 3 m, to consolidate therapeutic gains. They will be done jointly with the care coordinator, if possible, to assist with generalisability of therapy effects. Therapists will liaise with clinical teams throughout the delivery of therapy to discuss progress, with the participant’s consent, and to share any potential risk to self or others.</p>
                  <p id="Par129">TF-CBTp is formulation-based and individualised to tailor to the specific needs of the individual, depending on the type of PTSD presentation (for example, PTSD following a single traumatic event versus complex PTSD as a result of polyvictimisation) and type of psychotic symptom (for example, hallucinations or delusions). Therapy is conducted in a flexible style with an emphasis on engagement and building a good therapeutic relationship, which is key throughout the delivery of therapy. Trauma-focused work can be emotionally challenging, and throughout, a balance is struck between ensuring the person is able to manage distress and improve their coping if necessary, whilst not delaying or avoiding the trauma-focused interventions. Overall, TF-CBTp consists of four broad, flexible phases: (1) assessment, psychoeducation, and goal setting; (2) developing a shared understanding of current difficulties and maintenance cycles, i.e. formulation; (3) formulation-driven model-based interventions, consisting of (a) promoting control; (b) addressing trauma memories, anomalous experiences, and associated meanings; and (c) rebuilding your life, with cognitive, behavioural, and interpersonal techniques integrated as necessary into model-based interventions; and (4) consolidation and staying well (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Phase 3 includes the memory reprocessing strategies, which are hypothesised to be necessary for the reduction of post-traumatic stress symptoms. The aim here is to reduce re-experiencing and/or associated psychotic symptoms through elaboration of the trauma memory and discrimination of triggers. The method of elaboration will be determined by the nature of the person’s memory intrusions as specified in the formulation but will include established reprocessing strategies such as imaginal reliving and imagery rescripting.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (TF-CBTp) overview</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6215_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                  <p id="Par130">Given the time limited nature of the therapy and that the main target of therapy is post-traumatic stress symptoms, the aim is to adhere to PTSD model-based interventions unless adaptations for psychosis are necessary. In practice, therapy is formulation based and hence personalised and pragmatic in that it is adapted to the individual, with clinicians able to shift focus according to clinical need. Similarly, therapy speed and progression are tailored to the individual. Psychosis-focused interventions are embedded throughout to address psychosis-related experiences, appraisals, and behaviours as they arise.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                <p id="Par131">There are no trial criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions at the individual participant level. It will be made clear to each participant that, should they find any aspect of the research distressing, and/or no longer wish to continue with either the research or the therapy, they will be able to withdraw from either or both without having to give a reason or this impacting on their usual clinical care in any way. Clinical teams will be responsible for the provision of TAU interventions, with no interference from the research team.</p>
                <p id="Par132">At the trial level, it is an important subsidiary goal of the trial to establish the safety of the intervention, and we will take all appropriate steps during the conduct of the trial for ensuring participant safety, in both arms of the trial. Concerns over safety of TF-CBTp, identified through adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), therapy sessional ratings or qualitative interviews, would, in the first instance, lead to therapy protocol amendments, but could lead to study termination at any time. Our experience with this population and type of therapy suggests that the therapy proving unacceptable or too distressing to participants is a low risk. So far the evidence suggests the opposite, with van den Berg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] showing that fewer SAEs, symptom exacerbations, and revictimisation experiences were reported in the therapy groups, compared to the Waiting List group, suggesting that therapy decreases risk. However, we would see this unlikely eventuality as an important outcome of the study, as it would provide empirical evidence to inform future studies on what should be avoided in people with PTSD and psychosis, rather than relying solely on clinical intuition.</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par133">The intervention will be delivered by trained psychological therapists with experience of working with severe mental health problems, to ensure competence in engaging this complex population. They will receive training in delivering TF-CBTp by the study team (3 days training, with 2-day booster sessions in subsequent years). Therapists will travel to participants’ team base or home/residence if required, or conduct sessions remotely, to maximise retention in the therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par134">Three related aspects of therapy fidelity will be monitored and assessed: (i) participants’ adherence to the therapy, (ii) therapist adherence to the manual, (iii) therapist competence in delivering the therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par135">Participants’ adherence to the therapy will be assessed by recording the number of sessions offered and attended, including length of sessions attended. Completion of between-session tasks (i.e. therapy ‘homeworks’) will also be monitored.</p>
                <p id="Par136">Study-specific therapist adherence and competency scales will be developed to fit the therapy manual. Adherence will consist of a checklist of therapeutic procedures and therapy milestones extracted from the manual, to record content of sessions in terms of agenda targets, homework tasks, and change strategies used in all phases of the manual. Competence in applying these procedures will be assessed by adapting items from existing measures to assess skills and competences related to basic CBT, psychosis work, and PTSD trauma-focused work (PTSD-adapted version of the Cognitive Therapy Scale – Revised (CTS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://oxcadatresources.com">oxcadatresources.com</ext-link>).</p>
                <p id="Par137">To monitor therapy adherence, therapists will complete the adherence checklist following each session. These data will be extracted at regular time points throughout the trial to check therapy milestones are being met and ensure the therapy protocol is being followed. This ongoing monitoring will pick up on any adherence issues across sites or individual therapists and will inform training and supervision content.</p>
                <p id="Par138">Therapist competence in delivering the manual will be monitored through recordings of therapy sessions, with participants’ consent. Therapists will have weekly supervision from a senior clinical psychologist on each site, who will listen to and provide detailed feedback on a selection of therapy tapes using the competency scale to inform their feedback. All therapists and site supervisors will also meet remotely with the research team therapy leads for monthly group supervision. This will be done throughout the therapy delivery period to provide quality assurance and ensure action can be taken if required.</p>
                <p id="Par139">Therapy tapes from five participants on each site (total of 25 participants) will be randomly chosen to be rated by an expert clinician independent from the trial, to provide an objective verification of therapist fidelity, using the adherence and competency scales developed for the study.

                <p id="Par142">The primary outcome for the study is PTSD symptom severity at 9 m post-randomisation (end of therapy), assessed on the CAPS-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] (past-month version), a semi-structured interview assessing the severity of symptoms delineated in DSM-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. It is currently the recommended clinical interview in PTSD research, including in psychosis populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The total symptom severity score will be the specific measurement variable.</p>
                <p id="Par143">Our secondary outcomes will consist of a range of clinical domains that are anticipated the therapy may impact on, namely percentage of participants achieving loss of PTSD diagnosis and demonstrating clinically significant change; self-reported PTSD and complex PTSD (Disturbances in Self-Organisation; DSO) symptoms; psychosis symptoms; emotional well-being, suicidal ideation and substance use; psychological recovery; and social functioning. Total or sub-scale scores for each questionnaire will be the measurement variable. See ‘Data collection and management’ section for a full list and description of measures.</p>
                <p id="Par144">We will collect further information on participants and their trauma experiences to characterise the sample, namely demographic variables (age; gender; ethnicity; migrant and asylum status; relationship status; education; living situation; working status); clinical variables (F20-F29 diagnosis); percentage of individuals reporting delusions and hallucinations (including multi-modal hallucinations); percentage who meet criteria for complex PTSD; lifetime substance use; age at start of psychotic symptoms and at first contact with mental health services; number of past psychiatric admissions; psychotropic medications); type of trauma experienced, timing, and multiple exposure, for all trauma experiences and the index event; and percentage of index events that meet Criterion A (exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence) on CAPS-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par145">In line with the recent CONSORT - Social and Psychological Interventions (CONSORT-SPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] guidance, which recommends minimising the distinction between primary and secondary outcomes for psychological therapies trials, all outcomes will be reported at all assessment time points.</p>
                <p id="Par146">In relation to cost-effectiveness, we will collect data on service use and health-related quality of life at all assessment time points. In addition, service use will be assessed for the previous 3 months at the ‘keeping in touch’ phone calls between the end of therapy (9 m post-randomisation) and final follow-up (24 m post-randomisation), to maximise the accuracy of these data. See ‘Economic analysis’ section for further details.</p>
                <p id="Par147">Acceptability of the therapy, through qualitative interviews, will also be assessed as a secondary outcome in the therapy group, and in therapists delivering the therapy. This qualitative element will identify key aspects of acceptability and tolerability in receiving and implementing the therapy that could not be detected by quantitative measures alone. Therapeutic alliance will also be assessed in the intervention group only (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

                <p id="Par149">Research assessments to assess PTSD and secondary outcomes, including cost-effectiveness outcomes, will take place at four time points (baseline, 4 m (mid-therapy), 9 m (end of therapy; primary endpoint), and 24 m (15 m post-therapy) post-randomisation). There will also be four ‘keeping in touch’ phone calls where service use will be assessed and contact details updated (at 12 m; 15 m; 18 m; and 21 m, post-randomisation). The 24 m post-randomisation assessment will enable us to determine whether therapy effects endure on both our primary and secondary outcomes. The 4 m assessment and the phone calls will help retention into the trial and reduce loss to follow-up, by avoiding having lengthy periods of time in the study without contact from the research team.</p>

A system of web-based data entry will be used to ensure assessors do not have access to information in the database that might reveal allocation. Participants and clinical teams will be reminded prior to each assessment timepoint by the research team that they must not inform the research workers of their group allocation. The senior trial statistician will be blind throughout the study; the trial statistician will be unblinded at a group level after the first Data Management and Ethics Committee (DMEC) meeting.

The index event could be a single trauma experience or multiple incidents. In this study, meeting Criterion A (i.e. only events including objective actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence) will not be a requirement, as we will include events related to psychosis and its consequences (e.g. hearing a threatening voice, involuntary admission or forced restraint), emotional and physical neglect, discrimination, and attachment disrupting experiences, as possible index events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

                <title>Plans to promote participant retention and complete follow-up {18b}</title>
                <p id="Par185">A number of strategies are planned to maximise participant retention into the trial and ensure completeness of outcomes. A ± 1 m window will be allowed for completion of assessments at each time point. Assessment measures will be clearly prioritised so that the most important will be collected first to avoid missing data. The CAPS-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] (primary outcome) will always be administered first, followed by the PSYRATS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and the health economy measures.</p>
                <p id="Par186">Participants who choose to end the therapy early or deviate from the allocation protocol (e.g. someone receiving trauma-focused therapy in the TAU group) will still be invited to complete all follow-up assessments. Participants will be remunerated for their time and travel, which secures good concordance with trial procedures, even in those who end therapy early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. There will be flexibility around the location of assessments, including remote assessments or home visits for participants who are unable to travel. Anyone who moves within the UK will be followed up.</p>
                <p id="Par187">A mid-therapy assessment is included to minimise attrition from the trial, as 9 m is a long period without contact with the research team for this population. This is particularly the case for the control group and those who end therapy early, and the extra assessment stage will provide data that can be used in the linear mixed model for the intention-to-treat analysis for those who drop out of the study at the primary endpoint. This adds some validation to a missing-at-random assumption for outcome missingness. The four ‘keeping in touch’ phone calls will also help to retain participants in the trial until the final assessment 24 m post-randomisation.</p>

No patient identifiable information is recorded on the research assessment records, and the computerised database is held centrally and managed by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU). A web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system will be designed, using the InferMed Macro 4 system. The EDC will be created in collaboration with the trial analyst/s and the Trial Coordinator and maintained by the KCTU for the duration of the project. It will be hosted on a dedicated server within KCL.</p>
                <p id="Par189">Source data will be entered by the research workers at each site by authorised staff onto the EDC. A full audit trial of data entry and any subsequent changes to entered data will be automatically date and time stamped, alongside information about the user making the entry/changes within the system. Database access will be strictly restricted through user-specific passwords to the authorised research team members. The data management plan is in the study site file and can be provided on request.</p>
                <p id="Par190">Data quality will be ensured by close monitoring and routine auditing for accuracy throughout the data collection period. To ensure the accuracy of the data entered into the database, the main outcome measure entry will be checked for 20% of participants by comparing the paper record with that on the database. An error rate of no more than 5% is acceptable. If the error rate is higher than 5%, the percentage of participants checked will increase to a minimum 50%. No data will be amended independently of the study site responsible for entering the data. Prior to analysis of the 9 m and 24 m outcomes, there will be a central process of data cleaning and checking to verify that all data are complete and correct. At this point, data can be formally locked for analysis of that timepoint.</p>

All analyses will be carried out using the intention to treat principle, incorporating data from all participants including those who do not complete therapy. Every effort will be made to follow up all participants in both arms for research assessments.</p>
                  <p id="Par203">Analyses will be conducted in Stata version 15 or later. Descriptive statistics within each randomised group will be presented for baseline values. These will include counts and percentages for binary and categorical variables, and means and standard deviations, or medians with lower and upper quartiles, for continuous variables, along with minimum and maximum values and counts of missing values. There will be no tests of statistical significance or confidence intervals for differences between randomised groups on any baseline variable.</p>
                  <p id="Par204">Treatment effects on primary and secondary outcomes will be estimated using linear mixed models. Fixed effects will be centre, baseline assessment for the outcome under investigation, group, time (categorical), and time × group interactions. Participant and therapist will be included as random intercepts. Marginal treatment effects will be estimated and reported for each time point as adjusted mean differences in scores between the groups with 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided <italic>p</italic>-values. For binary secondary outcomes, the same approach will be followed using logistic mixed models and effects will be reported as conditional odds ratios.</p>
                  <p id="Par205">The analysis will be conducted in two separate stages. The primary analysis will estimate treatment effects at the primary endpoint of 9 m, using all outcome data from 4 and 9 months. Analysis will take place after the last participant has completed their 9 m assessment and will report the estimated effects at 4 and 9 months. The results will not be shared with the blinded assessors, nor outside of the STAR team, until all 24-m assessments have been completed, to avoid any biases on data collection.</p>
                  <p id="Par206">The secondary analysis will estimate treatment effects at 24 m, using all outcomes from 4, 9, and 24 months. Analysis will take place after the last participant has completed their 24-m assessment, and will report the estimated effect at 24 m.</p>
                  <p id="Par207">Cohen’s <italic>D</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] effect sizes will be calculated as the adjusted mean difference of the outcome divided by the pooled sample standard deviation of the outcome at baseline. These will be displayed in a forest plot showing the therapy effects on the primary and the secondary outcomes at 9 and 24 months post-randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par208">Missing data on individual measures will be pro-rated if more than 80–90% (depending on questionnaire) of the items are completed; otherwise, the measure will be considered as missing. We will check for differential predictors of missing outcomes by comparing responders to non-responders on key baseline variables. Any significant predictors will be included in the analysis models. This accounts for missing outcome data under a missing at random assumption, conditional on the covariates included in the model. As a sensitivity analysis, we will assess whether therapy adherence is associated with missing data and, if it is associated, use inverse probability weights or multiple imputation to compare results.</p>

                  <p id="Par209">A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out, taking the NHS/personal social services perspective preferred by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Service use will be measured in interview using the AD-SUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], at baseline (covering the previous 3 months), at the 4 m, 9 m, and 24 m follow-up points, and at the four 3-monthly phone calls (covering the period since previous interview/phone call, thus ensuring coverage of the full 24-m period). Service use will be costed using nationally applicable unit costs (e.g. NHS Reference Costs for hospital contacts; Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) Unit Costs of Health and Social Care for community-based services; and the British National Formulary for medication). The TF-CBTp intervention will be directly costed taking a standard micro-costing approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Data on therapist time will be collected from clinical records (number and duration of face-to-face contacts) and unit costs will be based on the mid-point of the therapists’ salary, including all employer costs (National Insurance and superannuation) and appropriate overheads (capital, managerial, administrative, etc.). The cost of supervision will be included and indirect time (for, e.g. training, administration, meetings with other professionals) will be estimated using a questionnaire completed by each therapist on the time they spend on various direct and indirect patient-related activities.</p>
                  <p id="Par210">The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis carried out at the 9-m endpoint (end of therapy), in line with the clinical analyses, with outcomes expressed in terms of QALYs, calculated from the EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], using the area under the curve approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Given evidence to suggest the EQ-5D may not be particularly sensitive in psychosis populations, the new ReQoL measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] and the primary clinical outcome measure (CAPS-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]) will be included in secondary economic analyses. All three economic evaluations will be repeated at the 24-m follow-up to explore the longer-term impact of TF-CBTp compared to TAU.</p>
                  <p id="Par211">Costs and QALYs will be compared at the 9-m and 24-m follow-up points and presented as mean values by trial arm with standard deviations. Mean differences in costs and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by non-parametric bootstrap regressions to account for the non-normal distribution commonly found in economic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using the net benefit approach and following standard approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. A joint distribution of incremental mean costs and effects for the two groups will be generated using bootstrapping to explore the probability that TF-CBTp is the optimal choice compared to TAU, subject to a range of possible maximum values (ceiling ratio) that a decision-maker might be willing to pay for unit improvements in outcomes. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be presented by plotting these probabilities for a range of possible values of the ceiling ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. These curves are a recommended decision-making approach to dealing with the uncertainty that exists around the estimates of expected costs and expected effects associated with the interventions under investigation and uncertainty regarding the maximum cost-effectiveness ratio that a decision-maker would consider acceptable. To provide more relevant treatment-effect estimates, all economic analyses will include adjustment for the variable(s) of interest and baseline covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], which will be pre-specified and in line with the clinical analyses. The primary analysis will be a complete case analysis with the nature and impact of missing data, in particular those lost to follow-up, explored in sensitivity analyses.</p>

              <title>Patient and public involvement (PPI) strategy</title>
              <p id="Par221">One of the co-applicants (EL) is an expert-by-experience researcher and will be involved at all stages of the research, from the application through research delivery to dissemination. She will be part of the Trial Management Group and will lead on the qualitative aspects of the study. In addition, we will have local PPI reference groups who will be asked to contribute to the delivery of the trial in a range of ways, e.g. consultation and piloting on assessment protocols; reviewing materials; supporting training of staff; supporting recruitment to the trial; conducting qualitative interviews with participants in the intervention group; and assisting with dissemination. Experts by experience researchers conducting the interviews will be provided with supervision from EL and site leads.</p>

                <title>Adverse event reporting and harms {22}</title>
                <p id="Par222">Best practice, professional guideline, and local NHS policies for monitoring mental state and risk will be followed throughout the participants’ involvement in the trial and will be facilitated by close liaison with clinical teams. The safety of the intervention will be monitored closely during therapy sessions and through regular contact with the participant’s clinical team or GP.</p>
                <p id="Par223">The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) will be monitored actively and systematically and recorded by research workers and therapists, following guidance from the CONSORT-SPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] with the extension for non-pharmacologic treatment, and the extension for reporting of harms. Reasons for withdrawal from the study will also be recorded. Medical Research Council Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials will also be followed to ensure good governance of the trial for integrity and participants’ safety and well-being.</p>
                <p id="Par224">To ensure active surveillance of harms, at each assessment point, research workers will actively check for the occurrence of specific AEs using a structured checklist completed with the participant. Clinical notes will additionally be checked by unblinded members of the research team for any further undisclosed record of AEs. This extra procedure is to ensure completeness of records and to address the possibility of an increased likelihood of disclosure of AEs in the TF-CBTp condition, as a result of greater frequency of contact and the therapeutic relationship.</p>
                <p id="Par225">Good Clinical Practice guidance for non-CTIMPs (Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product) studies will be followed to make decisions regarding seriousness (i.e. AEs vs SAEs), relatedness to the trial (i.e. Related Events (REs) and serious related events (SREs), and unexpected serious related events (USREs).</p>
                <p id="Par226">AEs are defined by the Health Research Authority as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs in participants, whether or not related to the treatment, which require additional support or input from health professionals. In addition, since an important subsidiary goal of the trial is to establish the safety of the intervention, issues specific to psychological therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>], and specific concerns clinicians have about trauma-focused therapy with psychosis individuals, will also be monitored, namely clinically significant increases in mental health problems and/or risky or problematic behaviours; harm to self/others, including suicide attempts; harm from others; emergency room visits; or crises. Clinically significant increases will be operationalised as an unresolved exacerbation requiring increased involvement from the care team, e.g. requiring a change in treatment plan. Distress or complaints associated with therapy, completion of assessment measures, or any other trial procedure would also constitute AEs.</p>
                <p id="Par227">The causes for the AEs will also be recorded and monitored. For each AE, the following potential reasons will be identified: victimisation (aggressive behaviour, sexual abuse/assault, physical abuse/assault, emotional abuse/psychological maltreatment, exploitation, and other victimisation); mental health/psychological problems (excessive use of substances, general distress, psychotic symptoms, PTSD symptoms, suicidal ideation, and other psychological); trial procedures (group allocation, assessments, or therapy); physical health, including COVID-19; accidents or natural disasters; and other.</p>
                <p id="Par228">AEs will be assessed initially at three levels of severity, namely mild, moderate, and severe, which reflect the severity or impact of the event on the person at the time, and is distinct from seriousness. Seriousness relates to the outcome of the event and is the criteria for defining regulatory reporting obligations: SAEs are defined as death and life-threatening events (Category A), incidents which acutely jeopardise the health or psychological well-being of the individual, resulting in immediate hospital admission and/or persistent or significant disability or incapacity (category B), or resulting in injury requiring immediate medical attention (category C). However, in this study, any AE rated as ‘severe’ will automatically be classified as an SAE.</p>
                <p id="Par229">AEs will be categorised for severity and seriousness by the site leads/Trial Coordinators. Relatedness to the trial will be judged based on whether the event resulted from administration of any of the research or therapy procedures, according to a temporal relationship (i.e. SREs). Unexpectedness of an event to the intervention will be judged based on whether the event is unexpected or unexplained given the participant’s clinical course, previous conditions and history, and concomitant treatments (i.e. USREs).</p>
                <p id="Par230">Events identified as SAEs will be further reviewed by the PI initially and additionally by the chair of the DMEC. Only SAEs that have been judged by the PI and the chair of the DMEC to be USREs will be reported to the REC. The DMEC will be responsible for investigating further, if there are any concerns about unexpectedly high rates of SAEs, SREs, or USREs, which may include being unblinded as to trial condition or seeking further data on adverse events, and will advise the TSC on any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should be prematurely ended. The Funder will immediately be notified on receipt of any information that raises material concerns about safety or efficacy, and of any recommendations from the DMEC to end the trial.</p>

                <p id="Par233">We anticipate the key beneficiaries of our research to be people with psychosis who are affected by past trauma; academics; clinicians and mental health service providers; and NICE guideline development group. It is intended that the results of the study will be reported and disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed scientific journals and will be made available to participants and clinical teams in an accessible format and on the study website. Trial findings will also be accessible in print and digital media and presented at stakeholder’s events. One of the key outputs of this study will be the publication of the final, detailed therapy manual, which will include specific guidelines for the delivery of therapy and operational guidelines for its application, including case examples. A key aspect of the long-term dissemination will be through settings associated with health-care provision, such as presentations and workshops for CBT practitioners and health-care managers.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par234">Improving access to psychological therapies and the implementation of trauma-informed care are key issues for NHS services. The proposed therapy, if acceptable, will provide a new, integrated psychological therapy for people with complex mental health problems whose needs are often not met by mental health services. The outcomes of this study, if positive, will be immediately useful to patients, clinicians, and clinical services. The proposed intervention has the potential to provide significant benefits to the substantial number of people who are affected by past trauma in terms of reductions in distressing post-traumatic stress, psychosis, and other symptoms. If found to be acceptable and safe, the therapy could overcome obstacles in therapy delivery in clinical practice such as clinicians’ concerns about the potential of trauma-focused therapy to exacerbate psychosis symptoms, and lack of confidence or competence in effectively treating trauma-related problems in psychosis populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Importantly, it has the potential to be cost-effective to service providers through reduced need for participants to receive support from other health and social care services.</p>
              <p id="Par235">As well as meeting unmet needs for populations within secondary care mental health services, the therapy could also address the gap in provision that exists between primary care and secondary care. Many people with psychosis are denied entry into secondary care services, despite the presence of distressing symptoms, because they do not meet the increasingly high threshold set by Community Mental Health Teams and Early Intervention for Psychosis services, which are often based on complexity of social needs, lack of general functioning and immediate risk of hospitalisation, rather than presenting distress. Therefore, individuals assessed as functioning ‘well enough’, or not currently presenting with sufficient acuity or in crisis, are referred back to primary care, but their psychosis diagnosis excludes them from primary care psychological therapy services. This trial would potentially provide an evidence-based intervention to meet the needs of this currently neglected population.</p>
              <p id="Par236">The availability of a detailed therapy manual will enable the therapy to be applied by CBT-trained therapists throughout the NHS, in both primary and secondary care settings and elsewhere. There are current plans for a significant expansion of training in CBTp nationally by NHS-England (NHS-E), which will be timely for maximum impact of the manual, as it can be embedded within the curriculum of the national training programs.</p>
              <p id="Par237">The main barrier to providing immediate patient benefit is likely to be a lack of resources for the implementation of the therapy. However, providing parity of care for mental health is an ongoing, pan-party government agenda. The development of psychological interventions for psychosis, specifically, is a current NHS priority, with recent investments by NHS-E in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies – Severe Mental Illness (IAPT-SMI) demonstration sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>], and the implementation of national standards for the access and waiting times for psychological therapies in Early Interventions for Psychosis services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. The remit of IAPT-SMI has since expanded (now renamed Psychological Therapies for SMI), with training plans contributing to a national agenda for increasing the workforce. The recent inclusion in NICE guidelines of the necessity to assess and treat trauma symptoms in people with psychosis in Early Interventions for Psychosis services is an indication that this topic is timely and will remain highly relevant to the needs of the NHS. Pathways to specialist trauma therapy are also integral to the provision of trauma-informed care, which is recommended in the NHS Long Term Plan as the model for community services in adults with severe mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. A failure to treat trauma sequelae in psychosis is itself costly to patients, their families, and the NHS. Should the therapy prove cost-effective, it will provide evidence to Clinical Commissioning Groups that investing in this treatment will save money in the long run.</p>
