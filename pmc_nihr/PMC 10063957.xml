                  <p>Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is more effective than IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine at reducing malaria infection during pregnancy in areas with high-grade resistance to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in east Africa. We aimed to assess whether IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, alone or combined with azithromycin, can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did an individually randomised, double-blind, three-arm, partly placebo-controlled trial in areas of high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance in Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania. HIV-negative women with a viable singleton pregnancy were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation, stratified by site and gravidity, to receive monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (500 mg of sulfadoxine and 25 mg of pyrimethamine for 1 day), monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (dosed by weight; three to five tablets containing 40 mg of dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg of piperaquine once daily for 3 consecutive days) plus a single treatment course of placebo, or monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus a single treatment course of azithromycin (two tablets containing 500 mg once daily for 2 consecutive days). Outcome assessors in the delivery units were masked to treatment group. The composite primary endpoint was adverse pregnancy outcome, defined as fetal loss, adverse newborn baby outcomes (small for gestational age, low birthweight, or preterm), or neonatal death. The primary analysis was by modified intention to treat, consisting of all randomised participants with primary endpoint data. Women who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>From March-29, 2018, to July 5, 2019, 4680 women (mean age 25·0 years [SD 6·0]) were enrolled and randomly assigned: 1561 (33%; mean age 24·9 years [SD 6·1]) to the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group, 1561 (33%; mean age 25·1 years [6·1]) to the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group, and 1558 (33%; mean age 24·9 years [6.0]) to the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group. Compared with 335 (23·3%) of 1435 women in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group, the primary composite endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes was reported more frequently in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group (403 [27·9%] of 1442; risk ratio 1·20, 95% CI 1·06–1·36; p=0·0040) and in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group (396 [27·6%] of 1433; 1·16, 1·03–1·32; p=0·017). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in mothers (sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group 17·7 per 100 person-years, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group 14·8 per 100 person-years, and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group 16·9 per 100 person-years) and infants (sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group 49·2 per 100 person-years, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group 42·4 per 100 person-years, and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group 47·8 per 100 person-years) across treatment groups. 12 (0·2%) of 6685 sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, 19 (0·3%) of 7014 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, and 23 (0·3%) of 6849 dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin treatment courses were vomited within 30 min.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine did not improve pregnancy outcomes, and the addition of a single course of azithromycin did not enhance the effect of monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Trials that combine sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine for IPTp should be considered.</p>

                <p id="para30">A 2018 meta-analysis of two trials (one from western Kenya and one from Uganda) of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine versus standard of care of IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine concluded that in areas of high resistance to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, the fixed-dose combination of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is a promising candidate to replace sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine as IPTp. Dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was well tolerated and associated with greater reductions in the incidence of moderate-to-severe maternal anaemia, clinical malaria, and the prevalence of maternal peripheral malaria infection at delivery, and placental malaria infections than sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine. In addition, the risk of fetal loss was lower in the IPTp in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group. However, no difference was reported in adverse morbidity outcomes among livebirths (low birthweight, preterm birth, or small for gestational age). WHO recommended that more research was needed to evaluate the effect of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Before the final design of this trial, we did an initial electronic literature search for trials comparing IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine using the search terms (“intermittent” OR “IPT”) AND (“sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine” OR “sulphadoxine–pyrimethamine”) AND “dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine” AND (“malaria” OR “Plasmodium”) AND (“pregnan*” OR “antenatal”) AND “trial”. We searched MEDLINE and the Malaria in Pregnancy Library, which consists of references from Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, Bioline, the Cochrane Library databases, and WHO Global Health Library, from inception of the database to Dec 1, 2016. The Malaria in Pregnancy Library also contains grey literature and conference abstracts. No language restrictions were used. No new trials were identified. We updated our literature search on June 20, 2022, and identified two additional trials, one from Uganda (n=782) and one from southern Tanzania (n=956). In both trials, monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was superior to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine for reducing the risk of malaria infections during pregnancy. In the trial in Tanzania, dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was also superior with regards to mean birthweight and low birthweight, but this was not observed in the Ugandan trial. No trials were identified that combined azithromycin with IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine.</p>

                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">None of the four previous trials were powered to assess the effect of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine on adverse pregnancy outcomes, and the results were conflicting. Our trial in 4680 women was designed to address the recommendation by WHO for larger definitive trials to investigate the effect of monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine compared with IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on adverse pregnancy outcomes. We found that the standard of care of monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was associated with fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes (primary composite endpoint) than monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, and that this difference was driven by better maternal gestational weight gain and fewer low-birthweight and small-for-gestational-age births. However, compared with monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was associated with reductions in clinical malaria, malaria infection detected by microscopy during pregnancy, and placental malaria at delivery. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to assess the effect of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and azithromycin on sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis. We showed that adding a single 2 g dose of azithromycin at the initial antenatal visit between 16 weeks and 28 weeks gestation did not enhance the effect of monthly dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine on adverse pregnancy outcomes (primary composite endpoint). IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was associated with a lower prevalence of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> at term than IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin or dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine alone. This finding is important because azithromycin is the WHO-recommended first-line treatment for chlamydia.</p>

                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">Replacing IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine will probably result in marked and clinically relevant reductions in clinical malaria and maternal malaria infection during pregnancy in areas with high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. However, countries that choose to do so need to be aware that replacing sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine may increase the absolute number of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, even in areas with very high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. We hypothesise that sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine has potent non-malarial effects on fetal growth that outweigh any improvements in birthweight associated with better prevention from malaria by dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine combined with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine warrants investigation to evaluate the potential benefits of combining the non-malarial effects of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on fetal growth with the superior antimalarial effects of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Moreover, additional studies of the mechanisms by which sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine promotes maternal gestational weight gain and fetal growth, independent of its antimalarial effects, are also warranted.</p>

Women of any age with a viable singleton pregnancy between 16 weeks and 28 weeks gestation confirmed by ultrasound were eligible for inclusion if they were residents of the study area and were willing to adhere to the follow-up schedule and give birth in a study clinic. Women with multiple pregnancies, a known heart ailment, a history of receiving IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine during the current pregnancy, a known allergy or contraindication to any of the study drugs, or women living with HIV were excluded. All study participants provided written informed consent.

                <p id="para130">The comparison between IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was open label. The use of azithromycin was placebo controlled to ensure masking between the two arms containing IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Women were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group), monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus a single treatment course of placebo at enrolment (dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group), or monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine combined with a single dose of azithromycin at enrolment (dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group). Randomisation sequences were computer generated centrally at LSTM by the study statistician (DW), using permuted block randomisation (block size of three), stratified by site and gravidity (first or second <italic>vs</italic> more than two previous pregnancies). Before study onset, a set of sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes containing the allocation group was prepared and stored in two boxes per site, one for each gravidity stratum. A second statistician at LSTM and a lead pharmacist in Kenya who were not otherwise involved in the study were responsible for treatment allocation and the preparation of study drugs. In each clinic, study staff were responsible for participant enrolment. The allocation of eligible participants occurred in the order of their study identification number by drawing the next sequentially numbered sealed envelope. Outcome assessors in the delivery units, laboratory staff, data managers, and study statisticians were masked to treatment group.</p>
                <p id="para140">In addition, a subgroup of a third of all participants in each group and study site was selected randomly for additional assessments. These included serial ultrasound scans to assess fetal growth, and extra samples taken for the assessment of STIs and other RTIs in the third trimester. This was based on computer-generated lists prepared centrally by the statistician in Liverpool (DW) before the start of the study. The same statistician also prepared another computer-generated list to select 10% of participants in each group and study site for home visits to assess tolerance and adherence to study drugs administered at home. The information on whether the participant was eligible for these additional assessments and home visits was included in the same sealed envelopes as the study allocation.</p>

                <p id="para150">At enrolment, demographic, socioeconomic, and educational information was collected from the participant on standardised case report forms. Participants had their medical and obstetric history recorded, a venous blood and urine sample collected, and they underwent a routine medical examination and an ultrasound scan to assess their gestational age. The randomly selected subgroup of a third of participants had vaginal swabs taken to assess for the presence of curable STIs and bacterial vaginosis. All participants received a long-lasting insecticide-treated net as part of routine antenatal care.</p>
                <p id="para160">Each sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine course consisted of three tablets containing 500 mg of sulfadoxine and 25 mg of pyrimethamine (unbranded generic sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, Medopharm, Chennai, India; quality controlled by Durbin, Hayes, UK) given as a single oral dose for 1 day (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). Each dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine course was dosed according to the bodyweight of each participant and consisted of three to five tablets containing 40 mg of dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg of piperaquine (Alfasigma, Bologna, Italy), given orally once a day for 3 consecutive days. Each dose of azithromycin consisted of two tablets containing 500 mg (Universal Corporation, Nairobi, Kenya) given orally once daily for 2 consecutive days (cumulative dose of 2 g) at the same time as the first and second daily dose of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine at enrolment. The placebo tablets were also provided by Universal Corporation and had the same appearance as active azithromycin (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). The first daily dose was administered in the study clinic under the direct supervision of the study staff, combined with a slice of dry bread or a biscuit. The daily doses on the second and third days were self-administered at home at approximately the same time of the day and in a similar manner as the first dose taken under observation in the clinic. Tolerance and adherance to study drugs administered at home were assessed during unannounced home visits in a randomly selected subset of 10% of participants in each group and during telephone calls to all participants on days 2 and 3 of each course.</p>
                <p id="para170">In Kenya and Tanzania, women were screened for malaria at enrolment using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as per national guidelines. All women who tested negative in all groups received their first course of IPTp at enrolment; women who tested positive in all groups in Kenya and those who tested positive in the IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group in Tanzania received a standard 3-day treatment course with artemether–lumefantrine. The first dose of IPTp was delayed until the next scheduled visit 4 weeks later. In Tanzania, women who tested positive for malaria in both the groups that included dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine received their first course of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine or IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin at enrolment instead of artemether-lumefantrine (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para180">Participants attended study clinics every 4 weeks, during which a clinical history of recent illness and drug use was taken and a clinical and obstetric examination was done. A blood sample was taken for malaria microscopy, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and targeted next-generation sequencing for molecular markers of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance for later examination, not to inform patient care. Haemoglobin and routine urinalysis were assessed during the last scheduled visit in the third trimester. Women were encouraged to make unscheduled visits if they felt ill or were concerned about their pregnancy. Women with documented fever or a history of fever during or between scheduled visits were tested for malaria by RDT. Women who tested positive for malaria in all groups received a 3-day course of artemether–lumefantrine. If this treatment overlapped with a scheduled IPTp visit, the IPTp course was delayed for 4 weeks, until the next scheduled visit. In the random sample of a third of women from each site, fetal weight was estimated by ultrasound scan at enrolment if the gestational age was at least 22 weeks and converted into Z scores using the INTERGROWTH-21 reference (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). Two additional ultrasound scans were done to estimate fetal weight at scheduled visits at around 25–28 and 32–35 weeks gestation. In these women, repeat vaginal swabs and microscopy slides of genital secretions were taken before dosing at enrolment and again at the 32–36-week visit to assess the effect of exposure to IPTp on STIs and bacterial vaginosis (all countries).</p>
                <p id="para190">In all participants, a maternal venous blood sample for the same malaria metrics was taken at delivery (during labour where possible), combined with placental and cord-blood samples for placental histology, malaria RDT, microscopy, and qPCR. qPCR samples at enrolment and delivery were analysed for all participants. The qPCR samples taken between enrolment and delivery were analysed in the third of all participants selected for serial ultrasound and third trimester assessment of STIs and bacterial vaginosis described earlier. Newborn babies were weighed as soon as study staff were notified of birth (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>). In addition, congenital abnormalities and jaundice were assessed at delivery, day 7, and at the final visit at 6–8 weeks, coinciding with the infants' childhood vaccination visit. Between scheduled visits, infants were followed up passively, when parents or guardians came to the study clinic because they were concerned about the health of the baby.</p>
                <p id="para200">In a subgroup of 189 women from Malawi and Kenya who were in the two IPTp groups containing dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, three sets of electrocardiograms were done to assess the heart-rate corrected QT intervals (QTc) before the first daily dose of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and 4 h after the third daily dose at enrolment, and twice more during pregnancy (approximately 1–2 and 3–4 months later; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>). The 189 women were selected through convenient sampling based on travel time to the facility and their availability to attend the extra clinic visits. Adverse events and serious adverse events were assessed up to 6 weeks postpartum and graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0) at every scheduled monthly clinic visit and unscheduled visit. Events were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding. Tolerability was assessed by comparing the rates of vomiting within 30 min of drug intake in the clinic and other adverse events at each scheduled monthly visit (all women) and during random home visits in 10% of participants (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>).</p>

Statistical analyses were done using Stata (version 17). For the primary and dichotomous secondary endpoints, we used log-binomial regression to obtain RRs and corresponding 95% CIs, and modified Poisson regression in case of non-convergence (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 7–8</xref>). We used linear regression for continuous variables, and results were expressed as mean difference and 95% CIs. The mean differences for estimated fetal weight Z scores were obtained by linear mixed models for repeated measures. We used Poisson regression with a log-link function and follow-up time as an offset for count variables to obtain incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs. The unadjusted (crude) analysis was the primary analysis and included the stratification factors study site and gravidae group in all models. Secondary, covariate-adjusted analyses were done using the following other prespecified baseline covariates in addition to gravidity and site: malaria status (positive <italic>vs</italic> negative) at enrolment; gestational age (continuous) at enrolment; socioeconomic status (calculated using principal component analysis; continuous); malaria transmission season (based on average rainfall in the last 6 months of pregnancy; continuous); malaria transmission intensity by study site (based on the prevalence of malaria at enrolment); and the degree of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance by study site (very high <italic>vs</italic> high based on the prevalence of the Ala581Gly substitutions in the <italic>dhps</italic> gene &gt;40% <italic>vs</italic> ≤40%; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>). The unadjusted linear mixed models contained visit, study arm, the interaction between visit and study arm, and the stratification factors site and gravidity as fixed effect and participant as random effects to account for the clustering within subject. The adjusted linear mixed models also included the six additional prespecified covariates as fixed effect and participant as random effects. Missing covariates were imputed using simple imputation. These same covariates were also included in subgroup analyses. We used a two-sided p value less than 0·05 to define statistical significance. p values and the widths of the 95% CIs for the primary and secondary endpoints have not been adjusted for multiplicity, so the values should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects. The modified intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomised participants who contributed to the endpoint) was used for primary analyses. We did a sensitivity analysis using non-responder imputation<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> to assess the effect of attrition bias (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). Per-protocol analyses were done for the composite primary endpoint and its individual components. The per-protocol population included participants who attended every scheduled visit, took all scheduled IPTp courses, did not use prohibited medication, and contributed to the endpoint. For the safety analyses, women were included if they received at least one dose of study drug. All analyses were prespecified (unless otherwise indicated as post hoc) in a statistical analysis plan approved by the data and safety monitoring board. Post-hoc analyses in women were any malaria at delivery (a composite of malaria infection detected by any diagnostic test in either maternal or placental blood); gestational weight gain; and a composite of placental inflammation or chorioamnionitis. Post-hoc analyses in infants were a composite of fetal and neonatal death, early neonatal death, perinatal death, neonatal wasting, and a composite of neonatal wasting or stunting.

              <p id="para270">Prespecified subgroup analyses of the comparison between the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine groups showed evidence of a dose response, with the greatest difference in favour of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine in women who had received six or more IPTp courses (RR 1·38, 95% CI 1·02–1·88) and no statistical difference in women who had received three or fewer courses (RR 1·03, 0·82–1·31; p<sub>interaction</sub>&lt;0·0001; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 26</xref>).

The effect in favour of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was independent of the level of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance in the study area and occurred in areas with very high (Tanzania; RR 1·25, 95% CI 1·05–1·49) and high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine parasite resistance (Kenya and Malawi; RR 1·16, 0·97–1·38; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0·52; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 26</xref>). However, the effect in favour of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was not apparent in areas with very high resistance in the comparison between dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine (Tanzania RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·84–1·22), only in areas with high resistance (Kenya and Malawi 1·30, 95% CI 1·10–1·54; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0·064; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 27</xref>). Subgroup analyses of the comparison between dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine suggested that the effect in favour of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine occurred in paucigravidae (RR 1·16, 95% CI 1·00–1·36) and multigravidae (1·27, 1·04–1·56; p<sub>interaction</sub> 0·61; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 26</xref>). For the comparison between dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, this effect in favour of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was only evident in multigravidae (RR 1·38, 95% CI 1·13–1·66), but not in paucigravidae (1·05, 0·89–1·23; p<sub>interaction</sub>=0·036; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 27</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para280">The prespecified secondary outcome analysis of the composite primary endpoint components showed that the lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine mainly reflected a difference in low birthweight and small for gestational age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para330">In this trial, which compared standard of care with monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin, the use of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was associated with reductions in clinical malaria, malaria infection detected by microscopy during pregnancy, and placental malaria at the time of birth. However, despite these reductions in malaria, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (composite primary endpoint) was significantly lower in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group than in both dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups. Newborn babies in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group had a lower risk of low birthweight and of being small for gestational age compared with the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups. Birthweight for gestational age Z scores at birth, a marker of fetal growth, were higher in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group, as were Z scores for estimated fetal weight obtained by ultrasound. No statistical differences were reported in mean gestational age at birth, preterm delivery, fetal loss, or neonatal mortality. The results were similar in all three countries, including northeastern Tanzania, where 40% of parasites carried the highly resistant sextuple <italic>dhfr</italic>/<italic>dhps</italic> mutant haplotype containing the <italic>dhps</italic> Ala581Gly mutation. Adding one dose of azithromycin at enrolment to monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine did not result in a significant difference in the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes, yet, it increased the incidence of vomiting and the mean change in QTc interval after the first course. These results suggest that replacing sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine for IPTp, alone or combined with azithromycin, might reduce the risk of malaria infection during pregnancy, but may result in an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes, even in areas with very high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance.</p>
              <p id="para340">In a previous meta-analysis<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> a modest, but non-significant, reduction of 17% in the number of adverse pregnancy outcomes favouring dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine versus sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine was reported. This reduction was driven by a 61% reduction in fetal loss (miscarriage or stillbirth), but adverse livebirth outcomes did not differ significantly between groups.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> These findings led WHO to recommend larger definitive studies to determine whether IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine improves adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine in areas with high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. Our results are consistent with those from a third trial in eastern Uganda, which showed that monthly IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine did not decrease the number of adverse pregnancy outcomes among livebirths or reduce fetal loss compared with monthly IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A potential explanation for the difference could be the use of monthly courses in the later trials<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> instead of the three to four courses used in the first two trials.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> All of these trials, including ours, show that dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is the superior antimalarial, resulting in 40–90% fewer malaria infections during pregnancy.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p id="para350">The observed 31% lower risk of low birthweight with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine versus dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (the reciprocal of the 44% increase in risk, relative to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine) and 25% lower risk versus dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin (the reciprocal of the 33% increase in risk, relative to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine) are similar to the 18% reduction in low birthweight associated with daily iron supplementation in high-quality trials,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and the 23% reduction in low birthweight associated with insecticide-treated bednets.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The reductions in low birthweight and small for gestational age in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group were reported even though these newborn babies were born to mothers at nearly double the risk of malaria infection during pregnancy. Our results suggest that the effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes and on birthweight is driven by the effect on intrauterine fetal growth rather than the duration of gestation. The effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on the mean birthweight were observed across all three countries, and thus was independent of the degree of malaria transmission and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance in an area. Findings from subgroup analyses suggested that the effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes might be greatest in multigravidae, who are at lower risk of malaria-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes than paucigravidae.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para360">The mechanisms by which sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine might stimulate fetal growth are not fully understood. A potent non-malarial effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine might exist that outweighed any improvements in birthweight associated with better malaria prevention in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The non-malarial effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine might involve the antibacterial properties of sulfadoxine, either directly by preventing or suppressing bacterial infections or indirectly by altering the intestinal or vaginal microbiome.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine might also have immunomodulatory effects, similar to those described for antifolate co-trimoxazole,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> or a combination of these mechanisms. Although the differences were small, women in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group had significantly higher MUAC scores at delivery and better gestational weight gain during pregnancy. Thus, our results support findings from a study of 105 women from Malawi that the effect on fetal growth might,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> at least in part, be mediated by the promotion of maternal weight gain during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In this study,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> the prevalence of enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was dose-dependently reduced by sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine. After three or more doses, women who received IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine were 90% less likely to be infected with enteroaggregative <italic>E coli</italic> than those who received dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> This finding coincided with higher maternal weight gain and other nutritional indicators, such as MUAC and BMI.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> An alternative explanation for the observed differences in birthweight between the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups could be an unexplained negative effect of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine on fetal growth or maternal weight gain during pregnancy. However the Z scores for fetal weight gain in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine arms were close to zero, suggesting the fetal growth was close to the average of the INTERGROWTH reference population used.</p>
              <p id="para370">The number of serious adverse events was similar across all three groups in mothers and infants. IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was well tolerated, which is essential for drugs used for chemoprevention when most recipients are asymptomatic. Although dizziness, vomiting, and nausea were more frequently reported in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine groups than in the sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group, these adverse events were reported by less than 5% of participants and did not affect adherence or dropouts. However, the addition of azithromycin resulted in significantly more vomiting than with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine alone.</p>
              <p id="para380">Furthermore, adding azithromycin to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine was not associated with a reduction in the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes, any of the individual components of the composite primary endpoint, or a reduction in STIs and bacterial vaginosis. The high prevalence of curable STIs and bacterial vaginosis at enrolment (16·9%) in this study, which is similar to that reported in a meta-analysis,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment of curable STIs and other RTIs as part of antenatal care in sub-Saharan Africa. The evidence base of the benefits of adding azithromycin to IPTp in malaria-endemic settings is contradictory.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p id="para390">We considered more frequent doses of azithromycin during pregnancy at the design stage. However, after discussion with WHO, this idea was disregarded in favour of a single dose of azithromycin because of concerns about the potential effect of azithromycin on macrolide resistance when given presumptively several times in pregnancy to all pregnant women even when asymptomatic. None of the pregnancy studies summarised, including our trial, involved partner screening and treatment for STIs; therefore, reinfection cannot be ruled out. The risk of reinfection is an important consideration, which might explain the superior effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on chlamydia infection. Women in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus azithromycin group received 2 g of azithromycin at the enrolment visit, double the WHO-recommended first-line treatment for chlamydia (1 g on 1 day). By contrast, participants in the IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine group received a median of five courses of 1·5 g of sulfadoxine throughout pregnancy. Sulfadoxine is a sulfonamide derivative. Sulfisoxazole, another sulfonamide, which inhibits <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> was used to treat chlamydia in the 1980s.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para400">Because both dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and azithromycin can cause QT prolongation,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> nested cardiac monitoring was completed in a subgroup of women. Adding azithromycin at the enrolment visit resulted in significantly longer QT prolongation compared with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine alone (36 ms <italic>vs</italic> 27 ms), and a greater proportion of women had QTc values exceeding 500 ms. All QTc prolongation was asymptomatic. QTc prolongation progressively declined with subsequent IPTp courses, including in the dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine group that did not receive azithromycin, consistent with previous chemoprevention trials with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine in pregnant women<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> or children,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> suggesting tolerance to dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine-associated QT prolongation with monthly dosing.</p>
              <p id="para410">The strengths of this trial are that it was powered to detect differences in the composite primary endpoint of adverse pregnancy outcomes and used ultrasound to determine gestational age for the accurate assessment of preterm delivery, small for gestational age, and estimated fetal weight gain during pregnancy. It also contained serial measures of gestational weight and assessment of malaria infection and common STIs and bacterial vaginosis. Furthermore, adherence to the follow-up schedule was good, with 91% of scheduled visits attended and 92% of participants included in the primary analysis, and the trial was done in areas with both high and very high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance.</p>
              <p id="para420">A limitation of this study is that only the first-day dose of each course was given as directly observed therapy in the clinic: although all sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine courses were given under direct supervision, the second and third day doses of the 3-day dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine course and the second day dose of the 2-day azithromycin course were self-administered at home. Even though the self-reported adherence to all doses of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine exceeded 97·5%, this was verified in less than 10% of IPTp courses by unannounced home visits. Furthermore, 9% of monthly courses were skipped. Incomplete adherence or spacing beyond 1 month between some of the courses could have resulted in inadequate piperaquine drug concentrations,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> which might partly explain the 10% malaria prevalence at delivery in the two groups receiving dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Another explanation is that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling suggests that monthly dosing, although effective, does not provide complete protection from malaria infection to all women, even when fully adhered to.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> A second limitation is the lower than usual levels of malaria transmission in all three countries, resulting in less placental malaria and a lower population-attributable risk of malaria than in previous studies at these sites. This disparity could partly explain the reduced effect of IPTp with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine on adverse pregnancy outcomes relative to the non-significant reduction of 17% observed in a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> of the first two trials,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and the 12% in the subsequent trial in Uganda,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and thus a larger difference in favour of the malaria-independent effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine. Third, a surprising finding was that malaria RDTs detected more malaria infections at enrolment than qPCR. Some of these might have been false-positive infections because malaria RDTs can detect parasite circulating antigens for several weeks after clearance of <italic>P falciparum</italic> infections, for example after treatment. Also, our qPCR method, which used 50 μL of whole blood obtained from dried blood spots, will not be as sensitive as can be achieved with larger volumes obtained from whole blood pellets.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> A fourth limitation is the open-label comparison between sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine, which could have biased the assessment of tolerance and safety outcomes. Finally, there might have been selection bias in our modified ITT analysis due to the omission of participants with missing outcome data and in our per-protocol estimates in the presence of imperfect adherence, and measurement bias in our ITT analysis might affect the generalisability of our findings.</p>
              <p id="para430">In conclusion, replacing IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine will probably result in marked and clinically relevant reductions in clinical malaria and maternal malaria infection during pregnancy in areas with high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. However, countries that choose to do so need to be aware that replacing sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine might increase the absolute number of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared with IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, even in areas with very high sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine resistance. We hypothesise that in these high resistance areas, sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine is likely to continue to provide benefits through malaria-independent effects on fetal growth, which might have masked any reductions in malaria-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine. Combining the superior antimalarial effects of dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine and the non-malarial effect of sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine on fetal growth merits future investigation. Further studies of how IPTp with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine promotes gestational weight gain and fetal growth are also warranted.</p>
