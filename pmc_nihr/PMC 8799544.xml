                  <p id="Par1">Caffeine is frequently consumed to boost goal-directed attention. These procognitive effects may occur due to the adenosine-mediated enhancement of monoamines, such as dopamine, after caffeine administration. As such, caffeine’s beneficial effects may be altered in conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, whether caffeine improves cognition, and at what cost, has not been experimentally established in patients with neurodegenerative disease.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Single-dose trials to probe cognitive effects of caffeine are often confounded by short-term caffeine abstinence which conflates caffeine’s effects with treatment of withdrawal. Using a placebo controlled, blinded, randomised trial design, we assessed the effect of 100 mg of caffeine across well-established tasks (Choice reaction time, Stroop Task and Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Task; RSVP) that probe different aspects of attention in PD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and controls (<italic>n</italic> = 44). Critically, participants withdrew from caffeine for a week prior to testing to eliminate the possibility that withdrawal reversal explained any cognitive benefit.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Caffeine administration was found to reduce the overall number of errors in patients and controls on the Stroop (<italic>p</italic> = .018, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .086) and Choice reaction time (<italic>p</italic> &lt; . 0001, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = .588) tasks, but there was no specific effect of caffeine on ignoring irrelevant information in the Stroop task. On the RSVP task, caffeine improved dual item accuracy (<italic>p</italic> = .037) but impaired single item accuracy (<italic>p</italic> = .044). Across all tasks, there was little evidence that caffeine has different effects in PD participants and controls.</p>

                  <p id="Par4">When removing withdrawal effects as a factor, we demonstrate caffeine has beneficial effects on selective attention but is a double-edge sword for visual temporal attention and would need careful targeting to be clinically useful.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">Impairments in goal-directed attention are a frequent problem in older adults (Zanto and Gazzaley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2014</xref>). Normal age-related cognitive decline can be a significant source of distress and economic burden, but these problems become magnified in neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although symptomatic treatment of PD focuses on motor deficits, cognitive deficits can be disabling, even in the early stages with mild cognitive impairment affecting 19 to 55% (Goldman and Litvan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). The increased level of cognitive deficits in PD patients is partly explained through the increase in dopaminergic degeneration this group displays compared to normal ageing (Kaasinen and Rinne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2002</xref>). However, there is also pathology to noradrenergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems (Bohnen &amp; Albin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>; Kish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>; Vazey &amp; Aston-Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2012</xref>), again to a greater extent than seen in normal ageing, which may also be responsible for driving cognitive deficits (Kehagia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2012</xref>). In this study, we assess the ability of caffeine to act as a novel enhancer of goal-directed attention in PD patients and healthy older adults. Specifically, we address the hypothesis that caffeine improves all forms of goal-directed attention or only a subset of attentional functions, and whether the pattern of attentional gains is similar in patients and controls.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Caffeine is often overlooked as a cognitive enhancer for healthy older adults and PD due to its widespread habitual use across society. However, caffeine is safe and easily traverses the blood–brain barrier to exhibit its main neurochemical effect: blocking the effects of the endogenous neuromodulator adenosine which eventually triggers release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and dopamine (Koppelstaetter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>; Ribeiro &amp; Sebastião <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). Neuroimaging has also revealed that caffeine enhances bilateral activity in the striatum and functional connectivity in fronto-striatal regions in older adults (Haller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). Therefore, there are several routes through which caffeine could modulate cortical arousal and benefit cognition, potentially counteracting the effect of neuronal depletion found in PD and ageing.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The effects may also be different in PD. Pharmacologically, compared to age-matched health controls, PD is associated with a decrease in adenosine A2A receptors in the dorsal striatum, an increase in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, but with no change in any other brain regions (Hurley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>). Adenosine A2A receptors are also co-localised with dopaminergic D2 receptors on GABAergic neurons and have antagonising effects (Benarroch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Ferré <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2008</xref>; Fredholm &amp; Svenningsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2003</xref>). Striatal D2 receptor activation forms part of the striatopallidal indirect pathway which is concerned with suppressing motor activity, in balance with the direct pathway in enhancing voluntary motor actions (Svenningsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1999</xref>). Adenosine A2A receptor activation theoretically suppresses GABAergic neuronal inhibition of the indirect pathway and should therefore improve movement in PD by restoring some balance between the direct and indirect dopamine pathways (Mori &amp; Shindou <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>), although more research is needed. Thus, A2A receptor antagonists such as caffeine should exert a similar effect to dopamine agonists and could function as an add on to conventional levodopa therapy in PD (Vuorimaa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>). However, whether these effects extend to the cognitive domain has not been fully explored.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Caffeine may not affect attention in a monolithic fashion. Attention is not a unitary construct but has been argued to contain three independent systems. Functionally, attention can be distilled into a three-stage process: disengaging attention from its current target, shifting attention to a new focus and processing the new target (Petersen &amp; Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). Voluntary orienting to visual information has been associated with control networks in dorsal frontal and dorsal parietal cortex which bias activity in the visual cortex to favour the processing of important over irrelevant stimuli (Corbetta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; Grent- ‘t-Jong &amp; Woldorff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par9">Of these networks, the effect of caffeine on Stroop performance that maps on to the concept of executive attention has been the most widely studied. Several electrophysiological studies have found that caffeine can improve the neural markers of selective attention (Lorist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1995</xref>; Ruijter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2000</xref>) but the extent to which these translate into improvements in behaviour is unclear. For example, in the Stroop task, there are mixed findings concerning whether caffeine specifically improves performance in trials requiring selective attention (incongruent condition) compared to enabling non-selective performance enhancements to take place (Kenemans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>; van den Berg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). PD patients have also been found to be impaired at the Stroop task (Brown and Marsden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>), but whether caffeine ameliorates this deficit, and to the same extent as controls, remains to be explored. However, given the heterogenous nature of attention (Petersen and Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>), declaring specific effects on attention function is difficult as performance on one task could be augmented through many different processes such as enhanced motivation or increased vigilance.</p>
              <p id="Par10">The effects of caffeine on Stroop performance, and its attentional pre-requisites, can be compared to tasks measuring simple and choice reactions times. These tasks assess the ability to sustain vigilance on a limited range of stimuli, representing alerting attention (Petersen &amp; Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). In withdrawn consumers, acute caffeine has demonstrated beneficial effects on the speed of response and accuracy in both simple and choice reaction time (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>); however, this effect was absent if sleep deprivation was an added factor (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>). Chronic caffeine use has not been demonstrated to improve choice response latencies (Judelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>). Simple and choice reaction times are found to be impaired in PD due to cognitive, rather than motoric, difficulties (Kutukcu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1999</xref>). The effect of caffeine on simple and choice reaction times seems largely unknown, but given caffeine’s adrenergic effects (Nehlig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1992</xref>), a beneficial effect in this cohort (as with healthy controls) is likely.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Temporal constraints on attention have been extensively studied, particularly using the Rapid Visual Serial Presentation (RSVP) task (Raymond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1992</xref>). The RSVP paradigm stresses the temporal capacity of visual selective attention to its limit, enabling characterisation of the efficiency at which information is analysed and encoded (Raymond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1992</xref>). The participant is required to identify two targets when stimuli (letters) are presented in the same location in rapid succession. This task illustrates the phenomenon of the ‘attentional blink’ (AB), where identification of an initial target is followed by a refractory period preventing a second target being identified. RSVP performance has been compared between non-demented PD participants and aged-matched healthy controls; there was no difference in AB, suggesting the increased AB magnitude is secondary to age-related decline (Vardy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2003</xref>). The duration of attentional blink has been found to be related to dopamine receptor levels in the striatum (Slagter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>) and administering dopamine to PD patients can decrease the size of the attentional blink in these patients (Slagter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>). Therefore, given that caffeine can modulate dopamine, via its effects on adenosine, RSVP performance should be affected by caffeine administration.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Brunye and colleagues investigated synoptic effects of caffeine on attention and found dose-dependent effects of caffeine on different aspect of attentional networks (Brunye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). Following overnight withdrawal, intermediate doses of caffeine were associated with improved alerting and executive attention, but impaired orientating. In a similar vein to Brunye, a more recent study (Huertas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>) assessed the effect of caffeine versus placebo on all three attentional networks under the conditions of either rest or aerobic exercise. They showed that caffeine improved reaction times across tests of attention, but only in moderate users. Whilst these results point to differential effects of caffeine across attentional demands, there are several methodological flaws. Crucially, most studies which demonstrate a beneficial psychostimulant effect of caffeine have not fully withdrawn study participants from caffeine prior to testing (Warburton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1995</xref>). This has led to scepticism of caffeine producing a net benefit to users and the formation of the caffeine withdrawal reversal hypothesis (Bruce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1991</xref>; James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1998</xref>; James &amp; Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>; Yeomans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2002</xref>), i.e. that caffeine consumed prior to full withdrawal, simply acts to ameliorate the fatiguing effects of withdrawal itself rather than produce an overall, net improvement in cognitive function.</p>
              <p id="Par13">The effect of caffeine on attentional networks in fully withdrawn participants has not been systematically tested. Here we seek to address this issue by examining the effect of caffeine on tasks that tax each of these networks. We selected neuropsychological paradigms that would individually probe each facet of the trinity of independent but interacting attentional networks, as described by the Posner-Petersen model (Petersen &amp; Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). The Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm evaluated the ability to align attention to a changing source of sensory input, reflecting orienting attention. The Stroop task was applied to evaluate top-down attentional control and the ability to focus attention selectively according to task demands, representing executive attention. Here we overcome the issue of withdrawal by using a prolonged caffeine withdrawal of 7 days. We also reduce the impact of practice effects on repeat testing on and off caffeine by performing baseline and 7-day testing on the experimental tasks before entering the placebo-controlled trial phase.</p>

                <p id="Par15">A single-blind, cross-over trial compared 100-mg caffeine (Proplus) tablets dissolved in instant decaffeinated coffee, with instant decaffeinated coffee. The coffee was served with or without artificial sweetener as per patient preference but consistently given across the trial. Milk was not offered. The drink was served at a temperature range of between 50 and 60 °C, confirmed by measurement with a thermometer.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Participants attended for baseline testing on day 1 without any dietary caffeine restriction. Following testing they were given a supply of either decaffeinated coffee and/or decaffeinated tea to cover the trial duration (as per their consumption preference) and requested not to ingest caffeine-containing foods such as tea, coffee and chocolate for the remainder of the trial (9 days) but could freely consume the decaffeinated tea/coffee supplied to them. On day 7 (i.e. 1 week free from caffeine), participants repeated testing to assess for effects of caffeine withdrawal on attention and allow task familiarisation so that the effect of learning on subsequent performance was minimised. On day 8, participants received either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and testing started 60 min later. In the interim, participants would wait in a quiet waiting room with books and magazines for interest if desired. On day 9, the participants received the alternative type of coffee (caffeinated or decaffeinated whichever not already allocated) and began testing 60 min following consumption. Testing was performed within 15 min of the same time on all days. The task battery was performed in the same chronological order as presented below, for all participants on each visit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Testing protocol.

                <p id="Par17">All neuropsychological paradigms were performed using pre-programmed tasks by Presentation software (Version 18.0 NeuroBehavioral Systems, Albany, CA, USA) which was run on a 15-inch Toshiba laptop running 32-bit Windows 7 pro or a 15-inch Dell laptop with 64-bit Windows 7 pro. A Cedrus RB-844 response box was used to record participant responses. The same laptop and response box were used across all testing sessions for an individual, to negate any intra-variability discrepancies as a result of computer hardware or software precision (Plant and Turner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2009</xref>).

Each RSVP stream was 25 letters long. All letters were black except the target letter (T1), which was red. The background throughout the sequence was a uniform grey. Each trial began with a black fixation cross lasting 500 ms. Prior to T1, the number of letters presented randomly varied between 7 and 15. T1 could be any letter except for ‘X’. The second target letter (T2) was a black ‘X’, randomly present in only 50% of trials. The T2 (letter X) was never presented before T1 (red letter) and no letter appeared twice within a single RSVP stream.

                <p id="Par43">The above analysis identified that caffeine improved performance on the dual task condition, but it does not illuminate the mechanisms through which caffeine exerts these beneficial effects. Here, we try to isolate the specific cognitive component caffeine is affecting by analysing the pattern of errors the drug produces. The difficulty of the dual task stems from the requirement to identify both T1 (correct identification of red target letter) and T2 (correct identification of presence of an X following T1). Thus, one or both of these processes may go awry during a trial, which would indicate separate deficits in attention. To examine whether this is the case, we tested the effect of caffeine on T1 verses T2 identification accuracy. To this end, we performed separate mixed ANOVA on T1 and T2 identification accuracy (dual task only) with drug (caffeine, decaffeinated) and condition (1…<italic>n</italic>) as within-subject factors and disease as a between-subject variable.</p>

We employed a more rigorous testing procedure to ensure adequate time for participants to be fully withdrawn from caffeine before being randomised to caffeine or placebo.</p>
              <p id="Par52">There was no evidence that caffeine affected attention in a unitary manner, across all attentional networks (Petersen and Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). Rather, the effect of caffeine on cognitive performance depended greatly upon the specific task requirements. Caffeine improves accuracy on the choice reaction time task.

Caffeine improved accuracy of response selection in both the congruent and incongruent conditions.</p>

                <title>Caffeine improves response selection</title>
                <p id="Par54">Caffeine is frequently taken to improve performance and may have utility as a cognitive enhancer in neurodegenerative conditions, such as PD but providing robust evidence for the cognitive functions that caffeine does, and does not, affect has been lacking. Utilising our full withdrawal design this study provides important new insights into the selective effects of caffeine on cognitive functioning in health and disease.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Only a handful of published randomised controlled trials have tested the acute attentional effects of caffeine following a withdrawal period of 4 days or longer whilst the majority of published trials typically use a withdrawal period of less than 48 h (Judelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>). Consistent with some of these findings, in this study, the clearest evidence for cognitive gains after caffeine administration was found in the accuracy scores for the choice reaction time task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and overall accuracy in the Stroop task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Evidence from electrophysiological studies have reliably shown that caffeine increases ERPs that are related to the selective processing of relevant information (Lorist et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1995</xref>; Ruijter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2000</xref>) suggesting that caffeine may lead to enhanced performance when relevant information must be selected over irrelevant information as is required during incongruent trials in the Stroop task, i.e. the font colour needs to be responding to whilst ignoring the colour name. However, demonstrating a selective benefit for caffeine on errors in the incongruent trials has proved controversial with multiple findings being reported depending on the nature of the paradigm and the pharmacological procedure (Kenemans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>). In this study, there was no evidence that caffeine had selective behavioural effects on accuracy in the congruent or incongruent conditions, rather errors appeared to be reduced in both the congruent and incongruent conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This suggests that this effect is not driven by caffeine enhancing the activity of networks that enable selective attention, but something more general. An alternative hypothesis for these effects is that caffeine improved response selection, the ability to correctly couple a perceptual feature (colour) to a specific response (as was clearly demanded in this study’s version of the Stroop). This explanation would align well with the finding that caffeine improved accuracy on the choice reaction time task. Also, it seems unlikely that this effect is due to some non-specific effect such as generic changes in attentional lapses, motivation, vigilance or other deficits in sustained attention as contrasting effects were found in the RSVP task.</p>

                <title>Caffeine only improves response latency on the Stroop task</title>
                <p id="Par56">One of the most prominent findings in the literature on the cognitive effects of caffeine is that it can speed up motor responses on choice reaction time tasks (e.g. Liberman, effects of low dose caffeine on human performance and mood). We did not observe a significant quickening of response on caffeine on the serial or choice reaction time tasks. One obvious explanation for this is that caffeine is exert different effects across the attentional networks that support these tasks (Petersen and Posner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>), gains on the Stroop task are supported by caffeine modulating the executive network and effects on the choice reaction time are due to effects on the alerting network. Alternatively, this discrepancy could be due attributed to the age of the sample population and disease effects, who due to normal or abnormal ageing, respectively, lack the ability to obtain this effect after caffeine. However, this seems unlikely given that reactions were found to be speeded up in the Stroop task after caffeine administration. It is possible though that there is some task-specific effect of our protocol (e.g. multiple testing sessions affecting arousal or novelty) that prevented us from observing significant effects of caffeine on response latency in the CRT. Future studies should seek to implement designs that allow these different explanations to be assessed. Specifically, the inclusion of a younger sample of participants would also clarify the extent to which the effects observed here were due to ageing or the protocol.</p>

                <title>Caffeine differentially modulates accuracy according to task demands</title>
                <p id="Par57">There was no evidence that caffeine appreciably modulated the nature of the attentional blink in patients or controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Rather, caffeine was found to have negative or positive effects according to the whether the single or dual task was being performed, i.e. enhanced performance on dual task conditions co-occurred with relatively impaired performance on the single task condition.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Ostensibly, this finding of impaired or improved performance after drug administration is entirely in line with the results from other putative cognitive enhancers (Fallon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016a</xref>). In keeping with the Yerkes-Dodson theorem, performance with respect to the level arousal, or redolent form of neurochemical stimulation, is proposed to follow an inverted U-shaped curve (Anderson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>). Optimum performance for a given task does not occur when arousal is maximal, but rather when intermediate states have been achieved. Different tasks are seen to require different optima, such that improving performance on one task may impair another (Roshan Cools &amp; D’Esposito <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>; Mattay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). Within this framework, it could be argued that the single and the dual tasks have different optimum levels of arousal, or neurostimulation, associated with them and therefore improved performance on the dual task comes at the expense of the impaired performance on the single task.</p>
                <p id="Par59">It would be tempting to argue that caffeine improves performance on the high demand task (dual) but impairs performance on the low demand task (single). However, this framing would have trouble accommodating the other low-demand tasks in this study, such as the choice reaction time task, which caffeine was found to improve. It is likely, therefore, that the answer may reside in the unique attentional requirements of the RSVP task.</p>
                <p id="Par60">A potentially important clue in understanding this effect is the finding that caffeine improves dual task performance by aiding T1 (red letter) and not T2 (presence or absence of an X) identification. During the dual task condition, caffeine improved performance by augmenting T1 identification with no effect on T2 identification. This runs contra to most models of the attentional blink, which often argue that sensory processing of T1 will inhibit processing of T2; for a detailed review of the attentional blink, see Dux and Marois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>). However, our results demonstrate enhanced performance on the dual task condition due to improved identification of T1 rather than T2, suggesting that caffeine is primarily acting to enhance the processing of T1.</p>
                <p id="Par61">One hypothesis to explain this result is that caffeine serves to boost processing of salient information such as T1 irrespective of whether the reporting of this letter is required during the current block, i.e. in both the single and the dual task conditions. The enhanced processing of T1 would result in superior performance on the dual task condition, but impaired performance on the single task condition. Mechanistically, such an effect could be engineered by caffeine-mediated dopaminergic effects in the basal ganglia.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Dopamine D2-receptor expressing neurons in the basal ganglia have been found to be involved in regulating the attentional blink. Specifically, a position emission tomography (PET) study has found that individuals with higher levels of D2 receptors in the striatum have a larger attentional blink (Slagter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>), i.e. higher levels of D2 receptors are associated with an increase in the failure to identify T2 after correctly identifying T1. Administration of dopamine to PD patients can decrease the size of the attentional blink in some patients (Slagter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2016</xref>). An unresolved question is the extent to which the role of the D2 receptor in the attentional blink is due to the gating of items in working memory. A large corpus of evidence points for a role of the D2 dopamine receptor in preventing unwanted information from entering working memory (Frank; Cools, Chatham) (Broadway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Chatham &amp; Badre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>; Fallon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>; Frank &amp; O’Reilly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>) with a prominent role for the dopamine D2-receptor expressing neurons in the indirect pathway in filtering out irrelevant (non-needed) information. Previously, administration of a D2 agonist, cabergoline, was found to causes an undifferentiated amplification of sensory information into working memory with the consequence that the entry of isolated information into working memory was enhanced but improved when presented in the context of multiple items (Fallon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016b</xref>). Such a mechanism may also be at work here. However, further work, perhaps involving pharmacological manipulations, will be needed in order to verify this account.</p>

Studies have suggested that there is a lower density of adenosine receptors in the dorsal striatum in PD compared to controls (Hurley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2000</xref>) and that these receptors are co-localised on D2-expressing neurons in the indirect pathway. Such findings would suggest that PD patients may differ in their cognitive response to caffeine. However, across all times, this was not found to be the case.</p>

                <p id="Par64">With the exception of PD patients on the CRT, testing participants following a 1-week caffeine abstention was not associated with impaired performance compared to baseline testing whilst on habitual caffeine consumption. Rather, as expected, testing participants after abstinence was associated with improved performance, mostly likely due to practice effects. Most studies to date were conducted during the acute withdrawal period and our results do not detract from the <italic>caffeine withdrawal reversal hypothesis</italic> (James and Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>, Yeomans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2002</xref>, Bruce et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1991</xref>, James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1998</xref>). Instead, these results confirm an abstention period of a week is long enough to pass beyond withdrawal, avoiding the associated negative attentional effects. Any future research examining the acute cognitive effects of caffeine should ensure a similar duration of abstention as a minimum. Future research is required to ascertain whether the effects of caffeine abstention found here are genuinely due to the removing caffeine from daily life or are driven by practice effects.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par65">The optimal caffeine dose to enhance attention is not known. We opted for a moderate dose of 100 mg caffeine as the intervention, which is greater than found in foodstuffs but smaller than any other trial which fully withdrew participants prior to testing (Judelson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>; Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>). Caffeine doses as low as 20 mg and as high as 800 mg/day have been trialled but few studies have performed head-to-head comparisons of the effect of different doses on the same cohort using the same attention tests (Kamimori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Lieberman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1987</xref>). It is perhaps because of the assumption that the greater the caffeine dose, the greater the attentional enhancement. This is in juxtaposition to the Yerkes-Dodson law where it is conceivable, a low or moderate dose may be more effective than high-dose caffeine and that the optimum dose is task demand specific.</p>
                <p id="Par66">The effect of caffeine was modest and whilst this could be attributed to the dose, it may be that it is simple a weaker attentional enhancer than other medications, such as amphetamine or modafinil. However, it will be important for future studies to directly compare the cognitive enhancing effects of caffeine to those obtained with these other cognitive enhancers. The almost ubiquitous use of caffeine means that whilst the individual effect might be small, at a population level, the effect is much larger. We have demonstrated an effect when using neuropsychological paradigms in a controlled environment and the next step is to establish whether this translates to a real-world benefit.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Moreover, assessing whether these potentially small acute effects of caffeine translate into a larger clinical benefit will require longer trials and longer follow-up periods. These are necessary to establish whether caffeine could be a viable cognitive enhancer in neurological populations.</p>
                <p id="Par68">The purpose of the manuscript was to compare the effect of caffeine across different tests of attention to evaluate whether caffeine has the same, or different, effects across different attentional tasks. Thus, in seeking to elucidate the effects of caffeine on different attentional networks, we have performed numerous statistical comparisons. This could lead to the suggestion that some of the effects observed here are false positives. However, the effects of caffeine on the Stroop task are not consistent with this view. On the Stroop task, we found improvements in both response latency and accuracy, suggesting the cognitive components that contribute to this task were generally augmented. Again, further trials in larger samples of patients will be needed to confirm the above findings.</p>
                <p id="Par69">A limitation of this study is that we did not collect data on various physiological substrates known to affect caffeine metabolism, e.g. CYP1A2 and ADORA2A genotype, drugs modulating CYP1A2 activity. Additional testing for ADORA2A gene polymorphism could predict the sensitivity of an individual to the antagonising effects of caffeine on adenosine receptors. The CYP1A2 gene is responsible for the main hepatic enzyme which metabolises caffeine, with several single nucleoside polymorphisms associated with increased caffeine clearance (Landolt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>; Djordjevic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Nehlig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2018</xref>). Future studies should seek to stratify participants by these variables in order to ascertain discrete cognitive effects.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p id="Par70">A body of research spanning over a century has championed caffeine as a panacea for impaired attention. In contrast to the majority of published data, this study (i) applied an appropriate caffeine withdrawal period of 1 week prior to testing; (ii) employed a battery of neuropsychological tests to comprehensively assess visual attention and (iii) demonstrated a differential improvement in selective visual attention dependent on task difficulty, following acute caffeine administration. There were no group differences between PD and aged matched healthy elderly participants. We demonstrated beneficial effects on the Stroop task independent of withdrawal. In the RSVP task, we propose caffeine enhances the AB by either a beneficial effect on working memory or by improving the process required for discriminating between distractors from target stimuli, improving T1 target accuracy but at a cost to identifying T2. This study posits caffeine’s overall attentional effects should be considered neither exclusively positive nor detrimental but instead conditional on task demands.</p>
