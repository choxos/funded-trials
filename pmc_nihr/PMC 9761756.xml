                <sec id="abs1">
                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Almonds contain lipid, fiber, and polyphenols and possess physicochemical properties that affect nutrient bioaccessibility, which are hypothesized to affect gut physiology and microbiota.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs2">
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>To investigate the impact of whole almonds and ground almonds (almond flour) on fecal bifidobacteria (primary outcome), gut microbiota composition, and gut transit time.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs3">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Healthy adults (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 87) participated in a parallel, 3-arm randomized controlled trial. Participants received whole almonds (56 g/d), ground almonds (56 g/d), or an isocaloric control in place of habitual snacks for 4 wk. Gut microbiota composition and diversity (16S rRNA gene sequencing), SCFAs (GC), volatile organic compounds (GC-MS), gut transit time (wireless motility capsule), stool output and gut symptoms (7-d diary) were measured at baseline and endpoint. The impact of almond form on particle size distribution (PSD) and predicted lipid release was measured (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 31).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="abs4">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed on 79 participants. There were no significant differences in mean ± SD abundance of fecal bifidobacteria after consumption of whole almonds (8.7% ± 7.7%), ground almonds (7.8% ± 6.9%), or control (13.0% ± 10.2%; <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.613). Consumption of almonds (whole and ground pooled) resulted in higher mean ± SD butyrate (24.1 ± 15.0 μmol/g) than control (18.2 ± 9.1 μmol/g; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.046). There was no effect of almonds on gut microbiota at the phylum level or diversity, gut transit time, stool consistency, or gut symptoms. Almond form (whole compared with ground) had no effect on study outcomes. Ground almonds resulted in significantly smaller PSD and higher mean ± SD predicted lipid release (10.4% ± 1.8%) than whole almonds (9.3% ± 2.0%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.017).</p>

                <sec id="abs5">
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Almond consumption has limited impact on microbiota composition but increases butyrate in adults, suggesting positive alterations to microbiota functionality. Almonds can be incorporated into the diet to increase fiber consumption without gut symptoms.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Diet is an important modifiable factor exerting a profound effect on the composition of the gut microbiota (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The majority of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring diet–microbiota interactions have focused on individual nutrients, with strong evidence for the modulatory impact of fiber (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Fiber is derived from plant foods whose diverse components (macronutrients, micronutrients, nonnutrient bioactives) may interact to synergistically affect the gut microbiota, and their physical food matrix may alter nutrient availability for both host and micro-organisms (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Considering the diverse roles of gut microbiota in human health (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the identification of whole foods that affect the gut microbiota is important to inform public health messages and clinical practice guidelines.</p>
              <p>Early studies suggested a prebiotic effect of almonds on fecal bifidobacteria in vitro (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>) and in vivo (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Subsequently, a systematic review of RCTs of nuts reported almond-specific effects including increased bacterial α-diversity and relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus level (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, there is a lack of consensus between RCTs on the impact of almonds on fecal bifidobacteria, β-diversity, and stool output that is likely due to limitations in study design that affect the assessment of gut microbiota, such as the use of a crossover design, which is not ideal because the effects of diet on microbiome can persist in the short term after discontinuation of the intervention (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and because crossover trials can compromise blinding or masking of food interventions (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Other limitations include washout periods of insufficient duration (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) and lack of power (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref>). In addition, few studies addressed the impact of almond consumption on gut function or clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>The mechanisms responsible for a prebiotic effect of almonds remain unclear, but potentially include their high fiber and polyphenol content and their low lipid bioaccessibility, due to their storage of lipids as droplets within tough cell walls that are resistant to human digestion (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). After mastication of whole almonds, the incomplete fracture of cell walls (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) results in almond cells and their intracellular lipid reaching the colon intact where they are available for metabolism by the microbiota. In contrast, it is hypothesized that processing into ground almonds (almond flour) would result in higher lipid bioaccessibility due to decreased particle size before consumption, and therefore less lipid delivery to the colon. Maintenance of an intact almond cell matrix may therefore represent a unique method of delivering a rich supply of fermentable nutrients to the gut microbiota.</p>
              <p>To address the lack of consensus between studies regarding the prebiotic effect of almonds and the potential impact of processing on the effect, a parallel-design RCT was conducted, powered to investigate the impact of whole or ground almonds on abundance of fecal bifidobacteria (primary outcome), gut microbiota composition, and gut transit time. To elucidate components responsible for the previously observed effects, we further investigated the role of almond processing by comparing the effects of whole almonds (low bioaccessible lipid) and ground almonds (high bioaccessible lipid) on study outcomes.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>Participants in the study (NCT03581812) were healthy adult males and females (aged 18–45 y), who consumed snacks regularly (self-reported ≥ 2/d) and did not follow a moderate- or high-fiber diet [&lt;22 g/d; assessed by the Block Fruit/Vegetable/Fiber screener (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]. Volunteers were excluded if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: allergy; intolerance; dislike or regular consumption of almonds as snacks; history of gastrointestinal disorders; history of another chronic medical condition; history of abuse of alcohol, drugs, or other medications; antibiotic therapy in the past 4 wk; ongoing therapy with medication known to affect gastrointestinal motility; presence of medical devices; pregnant; planning pregnancy or lactating; consumption of prebiotics or probiotic supplements in the past 4 wk; consumption of prebiotic or probiotic foods in the past 2 wk; very high physical activity levels [assessed by the international physical activity questionnaire (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)]; BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) &lt;18.5 or &gt;29.9; or unintentional weight loss in the past 6 mo.</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited via circular emails to staff and students of King's College London and other London universities; advertisements in local newspapers, social media, and clinical trials databases; and recruitment posters and leaflets between June 2018 and September 2019. Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment in the study. Trial procedures were approved by the King's College London Research Ethics Committee (RESCM-17/18-5341) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>This was a free-living, 4-wk, 3-arm, parallel-design RCT conducted as a snack-replacement study to minimize impact on habitual background food intake (<bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref></bold>). The study was powered to detect differences in the primary outcome of fecal bifidobacteria abundance between groups based on a previous observation of an effect of almonds in comparison with control in a nonrandomized human trial [10.47% compared with 9.75% (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)] with 90% power. A significance level (α) of 0.0166 was used to allow for a post hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. This calculation resulted in the requirement of 72 participants (24/group), but with an anticipated attrition of 15%–20% we aimed to recruit 87 participants (29/group). The study was also powered to detect differences in whole-gut transit time (WGTT) based on a previous observation of the effect of fiber in comparison with control on WGTT [22.5 h compared with 31.4 h (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)] with 80% power and an attrition rate of 15%–20%. Thus, 48 participants (16/group) were required to undergo measurement of WGTT.</p>
                <p>Volunteers were screened via telephone and in person. Eligible participants attended study visits at the beginning and end of the 4-wk intervention period for collection of data and samples, and, in a subgroup, measurement of WGTT. All study visits took place at the Metabolic Research Unit, King's College London.</p>
                <p>At baseline, participants were randomly allocated to receive either whole almonds (56 g/d), ground almonds (56 g/d), or an energy-matched control snack muffin (2/d) using block randomization with a block size of 6. Randomization was conducted by an independent researcher using a randomization website (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>) with sex (male, female), age (18–30, 31–45 y), and willingness to undergo measurement of WGTT (yes, no) as stratification variables. Allocations were concealed from study researchers in opaque sealed envelopes that were only opened after completion of baseline measurements.</p>
                <p>Blinding of participants to the intervention was not feasible for numerous reasons: almonds are easily identifiable; it was impossible to design a placebo identical to almonds, but without any active components; and it was necessary to exclude participants who had an allergy/intolerance or dislike to almonds. However, all efforts were made to mask participants to the true intervention by advertising the trial as a “snack replacement trial” testing the impact of a variety of snack foods on gut health, and avoiding any mention of almonds in advertising materials. Researchers were blinded to intervention allocation for data analysis through recoding of participant data.</p>
                <p><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1</xref> shows the trial design and procedures. The primary outcome assessed at baseline and endpoint was relative abundance of fecal bifidobacteria, and secondary outcomes were fecal microbiota composition (phyla and genera) and diversity (α and β), fecal SCFAs, fecal volatile organic compounds (VOCs), WGTT, regional gut transit times, gut pH, stool output (frequency and consistency), and gut symptoms. Potential confounders were monitored at baseline and endpoint: diet, body composition, and BMI. Compliance and acceptability were assessed at the endpoint visit.</p>

                <title>Dietary interventions</title>
                <p>Participants were required to consume study snacks in place of habitual snack foods, twice a day for 4 wk. Two almond arms were included: whole almonds (2 × 28 g/d) and ground almonds (2 × 28 g/d). This dosage was selected because 28 g is the established amount for a single serving of almonds and has been used in studies previously (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and this duration was selected because it was considered sufficient to allow for changes to gut microbiota (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), while also allowing for adaptation to the increase in fiber from almonds, and accounting for the impact of hormone fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle on metabolism and GTT (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p>
                <p>To facilitate consumption, participants were instructed to consume the ground almond intervention mixed with 15 mL of water. Whole and ground natural almonds with skins (Nonpareil) were provided (Almond Board of California). The control group received an isocaloric muffin intervention (2 × muffin/d) that was developed at King's College London and used as a control in previous studies (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The muffins were designed to provide a macronutrient profile approximating the average nutrient intake from snacks (excluding fruit) from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Muffins were prepared by study researchers at King's College London. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> includes the macronutrient profiles for the snacks consumed in each arm.</p>

The carrier gas was N<sub>2</sub>, and the oven was initially set to 80°C and programmed to increase by 10°C/min up to 145°C and 100°C/min up to 200°C to complete the elution. The injected sample volume was 0.2 μL, followed by a 1.2% formic acid wash solution (Merck) to minimize carryover from the previous sample. A blend of 6 pure SCFAs at 6 different concentrations were first run to produce calibration curves for quantitative analysis. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The concentrations of individual SCFAs were expressed as μmol/g of wet feces and total SCFA concentrations were calculated as the sum of the individual SCFA concentrations.</p>

                <p>Whole and regional gut transit times and pH were measured using the SmartPill® wireless motility capsule (WMC; Medtronic). The procedure for administration and analysis of the WMC has been described previously (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In brief, the WMC was ingested orally and continuously measured gastrointestinal pH, temperature, and pressure via sensors encapsulated in an indigestible polyurethane shell. Data from sensors were transmitted to a receiver worn by the participant. Two researchers independently identified the following landmarks using proprietary software (MotiliGI™, Medtronic): ingestion (abrupt drop in pH, rapid rise in temperature); pyloric–duodenal transition (sharp, sustained rise in pH of &gt;3 pH units); passage through the ileo-cecal junction (ICJ) (fall in pH of ≥1 pH unit, sustained for ≥10 min); and pill exit (sharp drop in temperature with termination of pressure and pH signals). Whole and regional gut transit times were derived from time intervals between landmarks: gastric emptying time (GET; from ingestion to pyloric–duodenal transition), small bowel transit time (SBTT; from pyloric–duodenal transition to passage through the ICJ), colonic transit time (CTT; from passage through the ICJ to pill exit), and WGTT (from ingestion to pill exit). Mean values for regional transit times and pH in the small bowel and colon, calculated using data from both researchers, were used for analysis. Normal ranges for transit times and pH have been published previously (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>For the majority of study outcomes statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26 (IBM). All data were checked for normality and outliers using Q-Q plots and the Shapiro–Wilk statistic. Descriptive statistics were calculated: mean ± SD or median [IQR] for continuous outcomes and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> (%) for categoric variables.</p>
                <p>Differences between the 3 groups at endpoint were assessed using an ANCOVA, with baseline values as a covariate, or an ANOVA for change from baseline values. Where the tests were significant, comparisons on 2 groups were performed using a Bonferroni post hoc correction. For nonnormally distributed data, the Kruskal–Wallis test with post hoc Mann–Whitney test was applied. Categoric variables were assessed using the chi-square test. The following planned contrasts were conducted: <italic toggle="yes">1</italic>) analysis of almond groups pooled (whole almond and ground almond) compared with control; and <italic toggle="yes">2</italic>) analysis of whole almonds compared with ground almonds. Groups were compared by independent-samples <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test or Mann–Whitney test.</p>
                <p>The primary analysis was based on the ITT data set consisting of all participants randomly assigned. A modified-ITT analysis set (laboratory ITT), consisting of participants who provided sufficient stool at baseline and endpoint such that laboratory analyses could be completed, was used for the following outcomes: gut microbiota composition and diversity, SCFAs, and VOCs. A PP data set consisted of participants who completed the trial, maintained adequate compliance (&gt;75%), and provided primary outcome data (stool). Missing data were assumed to be completely missing at random and no imputation was performed.</p>
                <p>Analyses of gut microbiota composition were conducted using the MicrobiomeAnalyst software package (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Taxonomic comparisons were conducted on relative abundance of taxa at the phylum and genus levels with differences between groups assessed by nonparametric tests. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>). A UniFrac weighted distance matrix was generated using the phangorn package in R (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) that was used to create nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots and permutational multivariate ANOVA <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values using the Vegan library package in R (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p>
                <p>Statistical analysis of fecal VOCs was conducted in Metaboanalyst version 4.0 (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Missing data were replaced by one-fifth the minimum value for each compound. The data were normalized to the sample median, log transformed, and then auto-scaled. Differences in abundance of fecal VOCs between groups at baseline and endpoint were analyzed by 1-factor ANOVA and corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots generated from log-transformed data were used to visually compare VOC profiles between groups.</p>
                <p>Differences in PSDs from mechanical sieving were assessed by 2-factor repeated-measures ANOVA with sieve aperture size and almond form (whole or ground) as factors. Where there was a significant interaction, simple main effects were analyzed at each level of particle size (paired <italic toggle="yes">t</italic> test) and <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Bonferroni post hoc correction.

                <p>Seven (8.0%) participants were noncompliant (consumption of &lt;75% of snacks) to the whole almond (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3), ground almond (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3), or control muffin (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) regime. Therefore, 74 participants were included in the PP analysis set. There were no differences in the number of compliant participants between groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.464; chi-square test).</p>
                <p>Overall compliance was 86.7% ± 27.7% corresponding to mean consumption of 49 ± 15.5 snacks throughout the intervention period. Compliance in the control group (93.5% ± 21.8%) was significantly greater than in the ground almond group (80.7% ± 27.8%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.028).</p>

                <p>A total of 2,697,014 high-quality paired 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from all samples, an average of 16,149/stool sample (range: 3195–41,293). Sequences were rarefied to an even sampling depth of 3195 sequences/sample and resolved into a total of 9131 ASVs. After the application of filters to remove low-abundance and rare taxa, 417 ASVs remained and were included in analysis. The modified-ITT analysis consisted of 79 participants at the end of the intervention, owing to removal of 1 participant (ground almond group) for insufficient sequencing quality.</p>
                <p>There were no significant differences in phyla or genera between groups at baseline, except for the genus <italic toggle="yes">Oscillibacter</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.042), which was significantly higher in the control group (0.115% ± 0.132%) than in the whole almond group (0.024% ± 0.087%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.005).</p>
                <p>In contrast to the primary hypothesis that almonds would increase the abundance of fecal bifidobacteria, there was significantly lower abundance after whole almonds (8.7% ± 7.7%) and ground almonds (7.8% ± 6.9%) than after control muffins (13.0% ± 10.2%; <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.031, Kruskal–Wallis test). However, this did not remain significant after FDR adjustment (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic> = 0.613; <bold><xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Table 1</xref></bold>). An additional 4 taxa were significantly different across the groups (<italic toggle="yes">Lachnospiraceae_UCG_001, Phascolarctobacterium, Tuzzerella, Tyzzerella</italic>; all <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

There were no significant differences between groups for any taxa under the PP analysis or the planned contrasts.</p>
                <p>There were no other significant differences observed in microbiota analyses, or α-diversity or β-diversity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>).</p>

              <p>In this first appropriately powered, parallel-design RCT to investigate the impact of almonds and almond processing on gut microbiota and incorporating clinical and gut function endpoints, we observed that almonds may affect gut microbial metabolism and stool output. However, contrary to our hypothesis, results of this RCT show that consumption of whole or ground almonds for 4 wk had no impact on fecal bifidobacteria numbers; indeed, the abundance was numerically lower in the almond groups. These findings are in agreement with previous RCTs that have reported no effect of almond consumption on bifidobacteria (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), but are in contrast to 1 RCT that found a significant decrease in bifidobacteria after a pooled analysis of 4 processed almond forms (whole natural, whole roasted, chopped, butter) in comparison with control (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As outlined, previous RCTs had significant limitations, which were overcome in the current trial and therefore our results can be considered robust.</p>
              <p>There were no significant differences between groups for any taxa at the phylum or genus level at the end of the intervention period. This is despite good compliance to whole almonds (86.5%, ∼48 g/d) and ground almonds (80.7%, ∼45 g/d). It is widely acknowledged that gut microbiota composition is subject to large interindividual variability (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), therefore, although the RCT was powered to detect changes in bifidobacteria it is possible that secondary outcomes such as bacterial abundance at the phylum and genus levels were insufficiently powered to detect significant effects should they occur.</p>
              <p>Several members of the family Lachnospiraceae were altered by almond consumption in this RCT, but the observed effects did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Lachnospiraceae are among the main producers of colonic SCFAs (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and members of this family have been reported to be influenced by almond consumption in a meta-analysis of almond interventions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed significant increases in the SCFA butyrate and several VOCs after almond consumption (whole and ground pooled) in comparison with control muffins in the first RCT to assess the impact of almonds on bacterial metabolites. It was anticipated that almonds would increase production of SCFA, which would result in a more acidic pH, particularly in the right side of the colon. However, contrary to these findings, there was no impact of almonds on colonic pH. Therefore, we must interpret these results with caution, owing to uneven group sizes and potential for type 1 error. Nonetheless, they indicate potentially important outcomes for future investigations. In particular, butyrate plays a role in multiple processes relating to human health (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). For example, 2-methylbutyric acid is produced by bacteria when carbohydrates are limited (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), indicating a transfer from saccharolytic to proteolytic metabolism potentially due to increased availability of almond proteins. Also, nonanal has been identified in roasted almonds after storage, and is considered an indicator of shelf life (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), representing an area for future investigation as an objective biomarker of almond intake.</p>
              <p>There was no impact of almond consumption on α-diversity or β-diversity by any metric, in agreement with previous RCTs that also reported no effect of almonds on β-diversity (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In contrast, a previous RCT reported an effect of almonds on α-diversity (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), whereby snacking on almonds for 8 wk resulted in increases in both the Chao1 index and Shannon's index in comparison with control. Similarly, the meta-analysis of almond RCTs reported consumption of almonds resulted in an increase in Shannon's index that was borderline statistically significant (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Despite these conflicting results, it is worth emphasizing that evidence for an effect of gut microbiota diversity on human health is limited to observational trials and therefore its importance as an outcome in dietary intervention trials remains unclear (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>).</p>
              <p>Duration of interventions is an important consideration in diet–microbiome studies, a factor that may explain the variability in results between studies (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The long-term impact of almonds on gut microbiota remains to be evaluated. It has been suggested that although short-term changes in diet (2 d–12 wk) rapidly alter gut microbiota, it is possible that long-term changes in dietary habits (&gt;6 mo) have the greatest potential influence on gut microbiota composition and subsequent clinical benefits associated with their modulation (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Dose may be important as shown from a previous meta-analysis (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) but it was not possible to explore this in the current study.</p>
              <p>This was, to our knowledge, the first RCT to investigate the impact of almonds on whole and regional gut transit time and luminal pH. Contrary to our hypothesis that almonds would result in faster WGTT, our findings indicate no effect on this outcome. A plausible explanation for this has been illustrated by a systematic review of 65 intervention trials that reported that the effect of fiber on transit is dependent on baseline WGTT, whereby reductions are most pronounced in those with baseline WGTT of &gt;48 h (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In this study, mean ± SD WGTT at baseline was normal [37.4 ± 21.4 h (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)], potentially accounting for the lack of overall effect of almonds on WGTT. Our results indicate that almonds have a small impact on increasing stool frequency in healthy people but have no effect on stool consistency (when assessed by both subjective and objective measures) or gut symptoms. This finding confirms that whole almonds and ground almonds, consumed as a snack twice a day for 4 wk, are well tolerated by healthy adults with low fiber intake.</p>
              <p>Finally, almond processing had no impact on any study outcome. The hypothesis that, after mastication, ground almonds would have a PSD with greater proportions of smaller particles than would whole almonds, and this would subsequently influence predicted lipid bioaccessibility, was investigated in the mastication study. Our results confirmed that after mastication, ground almonds had more particles of smaller size than did whole almonds. Despite this, although it was significant, the difference in lipid bioaccessibility between these almond forms was very small (mean ± SD difference: 1.1% ± 2.3%). Therefore, these findings support the comparable effect of whole and ground almonds on study outcome measures. It can be concluded that commercial grinding of almonds does not result in clinically meaningful differences in nutrient bioaccessibility.</p>
              <p>The main limitation of this trial is the sex distribution, which is predominantly female (86.2%) and young (27.5 ± 6.2 y), and therefore the results are not representative of male and older populations.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, almond consumption does not exert a prebiotic effect on fecal bifidobacteria abundance or result in major changes in other gastrointestinal microbiota, gastrointestinal transit, pH, pressure, stool output, or gut symptoms in healthy adults. Therefore, their incorporation into the diet of low fiber consumers among the public, to increase fiber intake, would likely be well tolerated. Almond consumption may influence the family Lachnospiraceae and aspects of bacterial metabolism, in particular fecal butyrate. These outcomes warrant further investigation in future RCTs, which should focus on confirming these findings in cohorts of older adults with an even sex distribution. Commercial processing of almonds increases predicted lipid bioaccessibility to a limited degree but did not appreciably influence gut health.</p>
