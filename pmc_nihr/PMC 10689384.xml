                  <p>Feeding practices developed in early life can impact a child’s nutrition, growth, dental health, cognitive development and lifetime risk of chronic diseases. Substantial evidence suggests ethnic health inequalities, and non-recommended complementary infant feeding practices among UK’s South Asian (SA) population. Nurture Early for Optimal Nutrition aims to use women’s group participatory learning and action (PLA) cycles to optimise infant feeding, care and dental hygiene practices in SA infants &lt;2 years in East London.</p>

                  <p>A three-arm pilot feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial will assess feasibility, acceptability, costs and explore preliminary effectiveness for proposed primary outcome (ie, reporting on body mass index (BMI) z-score). Multilingual SA community facilitators will deliver the intervention, group PLA Cycle, to mothers/carers in respective ethnic/language groups. 12 wards are randomised to face-to-face PLA, online PLA and usual care arms in 1:1:1 ratio. Primary outcomes are feasibility and process measures (ie, BMI z-score, study records, feedback questionnaires, direct observation of intervention and sustainability) for assessment against Go/Stop criteria. Secondary outcomes are cluster-level and economic outcomes (ie, eating behaviour, parental feeding practices, network diffusion, children development performance, level of dental caries, general practitioner utilisation, costs, staff time). Outcomes are measured at baseline, every 2 weeks during intervention, 14 weeks and at 6 months by blinded outcome assessors where possible. This study will use concurrent mixed-methods evaluation. Quantitative analyses include descriptive summary with 95% CI and sample size calculation for the definitive trial. The intervention effect with CI will be estimated for child BMI z-score. Implementation will be evaluated qualitatively using thematic framework analysis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The first 1000 days of life is important for growth and brain development. There is mounting evidence that influences during pregnancy and infancy may alter lifetime risk of nutrition and dental related diseases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Feeding practices developed during this period can impact children’s nutrition, growth, dental health, cognitive development, and may lead eventually to heart disease, obesity and diabetes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>Britain’s ethnically diverse population is mostly disadvantaged across a range of socioeconomic outcomes, forming fundamental causes of ethnic health inequalities in the UK.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Some of the widest differences have been observed in the South Asian (SA) population, more so for Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities compared with Indians.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Systematic reviews assessing complementary feeding practices and the sociocultural beliefs underpinning them in children &lt;2 years within SA families in the UK were explored. Despite the adoption of the WHO Infant and Young Children Feeding Guidelines, there remains substantial evidence of non-recommended complementary feeding practices such as early introduction of solids, introduction of minimum dietary diversity or minimum frequency of meals being followed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> Contributing factors that persisted postmigration included bicultural issues or low acculturation levels and conflicting information among health professionals, extended family, and religious and community leaders.</p>
              <p>Effective early life interventions tailored to different ethnic groups have great potential to reduce the development of short-term and long-term conditions and, thereby, lifetime inequalities. At present, however, few of such interventions exist.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Traditionally, UK health services provide unidirectional information based on guidelines and National Health Service (NHS) recommendations. Specific ethnic groups may be marginalised by this approach as most advice is not tailored to their cultural practices. There is a need for interventions that target these communities through a top-down unidirectional approach and bring a change originating from within the communities. Therefore, it is important to work in partnership with communities thereby building their capacity to work closely with local authorities/stakeholders. The asset-based community development approach has been successful in community development as this helps communities identify their assets through asset mapping and mobilise them to bring along the desired change.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>Based on Lakhanpaul and Panchsheeel’s Motivation Awareness Resources Knowledge and Skills model,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> current practice lacks the space to understand parents’ motivation and ability to support families in skills development, all of which is key to providing optimal infant feeding, care and dental hygiene support. Considering the resource constraints of the NHS and its 10-Year Forward Plan which aims to shift the emphasis to the community, highlighting a need for interventions that enable communities to use their available community assets. The participatory learning and action (PLA) cycle is an iterative process led by multilingual facilitators through a four-stage cycle of identifying and prioritising contextual issues, designing problem-solving strategies, implementing these strategies and a postimplementation evaluation. The PLA approach is a low-cost, community-based, culturally sensitive intervention that can be adapted from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to high-income countries, as well as to different population groups and topic areas. This strategy is also recommended by the WHO to improve maternal and infant survival.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A meta-analysis of seven cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using PLA in LMICs showed reduced maternal and neonatal mortality by 37% and 23%, respectively.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>An RCT and controlled before-and-after study have demonstrated reduced maternal depression, increased exclusive breastfeeding rates and decreased under-5 morbidity.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A Mumbai-based RCT also showed improvements in maternal practices and care-seeking behaviour.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Recognising WHO recommendations and the success of PLA in LMICs, this approach was adopted for the Nurture Early for Optimal Nutrition (NEON) programme.</p>
              <p>In NEON phase 1 (intervention development) was codeveloped with the SA community facilitators (CF) (now community researchers (CRs)/independent observers in NEON phase 2), community members, research team and independent experts (ie, health visitors (HVs), dentists, dieticians, nutritionists, general practitioners (GPs) and midwives). This followed the MRC complex intervention framework, which involved using formative research and prior trials as evidence-based factors; microadaptations involved adjusting language, literacy levels for materials, using picture cards, face-to-face and interactive learning delivery methods. This protocol describes NEON phase 2: pilot feasibility cluster RCT.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This three-arm pilot feasibility cluster RCT study is expected to run from July 2021 to May 2023 in three East London boroughs. Eighteen clusters defined as borough wards will be randomised with 1:1:1 allocation to two intervention arms (face-to-face or online NEON women’s group PLA cycle) and one control arm (usual care). An online arm enables the trial to continue under COVID-19 restrictions; usual care was selected as control to avoid depriving participants of essential and available infant and maternal care services. Multilingual CFs will deliver interventions in respective ethnic/language groups. Ward-level randomisation is a trade-off between minimising contamination and ensuring maximum SA population representation given the diversity in the ethnic makeup, that is, SA subgroups, of the aforementioned boroughs.</p>

Development phase, representing different SA communities, is now recruited as CRs to support; protocol development and ethics application by ensuring participants-facing documents are clear, appropriate and sensitively worded; topic guide and questionnaire development; strategy development and troubleshooting (eg, recruitment); interpretation of findings into appropriate and attainable recommendations for practice; review and revision of draft academic papers; dissemination activities and development of plain language summaries.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>With communication and cultural sensitivity as key drivers of the NEON intervention, the sample size will partly depend on the coverage of ethnic and language groupings. The choice of ethnic/language groups were informed by the 2011 ONS Census<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and input from CFs stressing that, while language is important for communication, people’s practices are embedded in different ethnicities.</p>
                <p>The main ethnic/language group(s) identified are: one group in TH (Bangladeshi/Bengali and Sylleti); four groups in NH (Indian/Gujrati, Indian/Punjabi, Pakistani/Urdu and Sri Lankan/Tamil); three groups in WF (Indian/Punjabi, Pakistani/Urdu, Sri Lankan/Tamil). In each borough, one women’s group PLA cycle will run per ethnic/language group per ward.</p>
                <p>We aim to run 20–32 women’s group PLA cycle (with equal numbers of face-to-face and online PLA groups) at 6–8 participants per PLA group. Including control groups totals to 288–384 participants. Assuming an 80% recruitment or retention rate, this enables us to be 85% confident that the true population rate will fall between 0.76% and 0.84% (precision=0.04). This was estimated using a geometric mean cluster size=16 participants, cluster size coefficient of variation =0.7 and intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.02.</p>

                  <p>Due to the diversity of the target population, multiple recruitment methods are needed to maximise reach and minimise inequalities or non-representative samples.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> For instance, relying solely on online recruitment may be ineffective due to digital poverty. Thus, other mediums including leveraging on existing social networks (snowballing), identifying and fostering collaborations with community leaders, and creating clear and succinct recruitment materials<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> were employed. All study promotional materials (eg, participants information sheets, posters) will be available in English and local languages. To standardise the recruitment process, we will provide the same recruitment script and study materials to all recruiters. Potential participants will contact the RA, who will confirm eligibility, consent and register them into the study.</p>
                  <p>Participant recruitment will follow three strategies with regular advice by CRs to maximise reach:</p>
                  <p>(1) Recruitment through CFs: CFs will share study materials with their network to invite eligible participants with subsequent snowballing. We will provide training to standardise CF recruitment. (2) Recruitment through HVs, GPs and Midwifery teams: HVs, GPs and midwives who have been identified based on their geographical proximity to study wards will share study materials to eligible participants. Details of those interested will be given to the RA. (3) Online recruitment: Online social media campaigns on Facebook and Instagram will be used.

                  <p>We will recruit CFs from our local stakeholders’ network. Recruitment via CFs is particularly useful for studies with underserved or traditionally hard-to-reach populations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> CFs are leaders/champions in their local community who, with training and support, help improve the health and well-being of their communities. In line with NIHR’s ‘INVOLVE’ guideline, CFs will be paid £30 for each PLA meeting and additional £5 to cover travel costs for face-to-face meetings. A comprehensive manual for the CFs will be developed with PLA experts. A tool kit will be provided to support the learnings. The CFs will attend a 3-day comprehensive workshop and additional sessions will be conducted in between the eight-meeting cycle as a refresher and address any challenges. Biweekly meetings with the RA will be conducted to discuss learnings from the sessions. The CFs will be paid through vouchers for their time similar to a 0-hour contract. HV, GP and midwives would be identified and recruited by our study partners at each study ward. Payments will be supported by NHS support costs and decided with the relevant clinical lead.</p>

                <title>Allocation concealment and blinding</title>
                <p>First, treatment allocation will be concealed from participants and recruiters during participant recruitment to reduce recruitment bias. After recruitment has been completed for that ethnic/language group in the borough, the RA will reveal ward allocation to participants and CFs via text or email, listing postcodes by trial arms to allow CFs to effectively organise and deliver the intervention.</p>
                <p>Second, outcome assessors (CRs) will be blinded where possible to reduce measurement bias. This will be achieved by CRs logging the data collected onto an electronic platform that automatically links participant ID to maintain blinding. Baseline measurement of BMI will be done by HVs in each borough who will be blinded.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Overall, quantitative and qualitative data will be analysed concurrently at multiple time points to identify early problems that are rectified as the trial progresses. Quantitative data such as the BMI z-score will be descriptively summarised using mean and SD for continuous variables, number with percentages for categorical variables and 95% CI with a breakdown of participants by trial arm, ethnic/language group and borough where relevant. An intention-to-treat analysis will also be considered. Results will be collectively assessed against the Go/Stop criteria. Before progression to the definitive trial, we will systematically and rigorously assess areas of improvement using a structured discussion tool: a process for decision-making after pilot and feasibility Trials.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> All statistical analyses will be done by an independent statistician who would be blinded.</p>
                <sec id="s3-12-1">
                  <title>Sample characteristics</title>
                  <p>Participant demographic characteristics will be descriptively summarised by trial arm. We will check for recruitment bias across different arms at baseline and compare later recruits who are prone to unblinded recruitment.</p>

                  <title>Feasibility and process measures</title>
                  <p>Across the three arms, we will check for any differential recruitment or retention rates and any consequent systematic differences in participant characteristics over time, as control arm participants may be less keen to participate or remain in the study. For the two intervention arms, we will conduct a mixed-methods implementation evaluation to explore the possibility of a blended approach in the definitive trial as some features of each delivery mode might be particularly salient. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically using framework analysis that include participants’ motivation for engagement, expectations, experiences, intervention acceptability, implementation barriers and suggestions for improvement. Negative ‘deviant’ cases will inform interpretation.</p>

                      <p>Feasibility of collecting outcome measures: To assess completeness, degrees of missingness at the individual item level and the entire outcome measure will be reported overall, by time point and trial arms. Other feasibility measures would be captured by analyses of process measures above.</p>

                    <list-item>
                      <p>Intervention effect for proposed primary outcome (BMI z-score): Conditioned on low recruitment bias and sufficient adherence to trial protocol, we will estimate the difference in BMI z-score between each intervention arm vs the control arm. We will consider methods to pool data across age groups depending on the actual sample age breakdown.</p>

                      <p>Sample size and power calculation for the definitive trial: Data from the pilot feasibility trial will enable us to determine (1) the smallest difference of clinical importance (through multiple testing of several key endpoints for the proposed primary outcome), (2) the clinically justifiable power-significance level or scientifically acceptable probability of ‘false positive’ (type I error) results and (3i) whether we need to adjust the calculated sample size for expected level of non-compliance/drop-in and drop-outs. We will report the ICC.</p>

We will estimate the total cost, average annual cost, cost-effectiveness, equity impact analysis and compare across three arms.</p>

                <p>The principal investigator (PI) will be responsible for day-to-day monitoring and study management.</p>
                <p>The NEON Steering and Data Management Team will ensure adherence to all relevant regulations and principles of good clinical practice. The team consists of multidisciplinary experts in child health, practitioners, PLA expert, SA independent observers from NEON 1 and Queen Mary University of London Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit. Committee meetings will be held every 3 months to review the Go/Stop criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) and interim analyses. The team will agree to the trial protocol and facilitate any necessary protocol amendments; provide independent expert advice (including on project management governance); monitor progress; ensure adequate deadlines are set and met; monitor and advise NEON Core Team (Trial Management Group) on strategic decisions in light of new evidence; and ensure successful delivery by meeting and reporting on study progress with the Core Team biannually. The PI and other Core Team members will attend all necessary meetings and report on the study progress.</p>
                <p>Any adverse events or safety concerns will be captured in the Participant Feedback Questionnaire and Facilitator Report Form (every 2 weeks during intervention period) and reported to the steering and safety monitoring team.</p>
                <p>The UCLH/UCL Joint Research Office, on behalf of the Sponsor (UCL), may conduct random audits in accordance with the UK Policy Framework for Health and Social Care Research and UCL’s policies and procedures.</p>

                <p>Ethical approval has been obtained from UCL Research Ethics Committee and NHS Health Research Authority. The participant information sheet will be provided in English or participants’ native language in-writing and/or verbally by CFs for informed consent. The RA or CRs will obtain written or audio-recorded consent ≥24 hours later.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Participation will be voluntary and they may withdraw anytime without prejudicing treatment or usual care. No incentives will be provided except for small reimbursements (eg, childcare at the local centre where PLA meetings take place).</p>
                <p>UCL will provide insurance cover and we will also signpost any vulnerable participants who require protection from harm to relevant safeguarding organisations.</p>
                <p>Regular progress updates will be shared via UCL or NIHR websites and patient group newsletters. Study findings will be submitted for 3–5 publications in high impact factor peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. Researchers and community members from the steering team will contribute to confirming analysis and write-up, adhering to authorship guidelines. To reach wider audiences, we will (1) disseminate plain language summaries for each academic paper through community groups, social media and You Tube; (2) present findings at lay-person meetings at community or children centres through the NIHR CLAHRC network and (3) organise 2–3 annual workshops with commissioners, partner organisations and NEON CFs to share key findings and recommendations.</p>
