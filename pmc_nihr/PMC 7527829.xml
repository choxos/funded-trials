                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Chronic pelvic pain affects 2–24% of women worldwide and evidence for medical treatments is scarce. Gabapentin is effective in treating some chronic pain conditions. We aimed to measure the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We performed a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in 39 UK hospital centres. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy, which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin (titrated to a maximum dose of 2700 mg daily) or matching placebo for 16 weeks. The online randomisation system minimised allocations by presence or absence of dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, current use of hormonal contraceptives, and hospital centre. The appearance, route, and administration of the assigned intervention were identical in both groups. Patients, clinicians, and research staff were unaware of the trial group assignments throughout the trial. Participants were unmasked once they had provided all outcome data at week 16–17, or sooner if a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the study drug occurred. The dual primary outcome measures were worst and average pain scores assessed separately on a numerical rating scale in weeks 13–16 after randomisation, in the intention-to-treat population. Self-reported adverse events were assessed according to intention-to-treat principles. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISCRTN77451762.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Participants were screened between Nov 30, 2015, and March 6, 2019, and 306 were randomly assigned (153 to gabapentin and 153 to placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in both worst and average numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores at 13–16 weeks after randomisation. The mean worst NRS pain score was 7·1 (standard deviation [SD] 2·6) in the gabapentin group and 7·4 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·4 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and −1·2 (SD 2·1) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·20 [97·5% CI −0·81 to 0·42]; p=0·47). The mean average NRS pain score was 4·3 (SD 2·3) in the gabapentin group and 4·5 (SD 2·2) in the placebo group. Mean change from baseline was −1·1 (SD 2·0) in the gabapentin group and −0·9 (SD 1·8) in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference −0·18 [97·5% CI −0·71 to 0·35]; p=0·45). More women had a serious adverse event in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group (10 [7%] of 153 in the gabapentin group compared with 3 [2%] of 153 in the placebo group; p=0·04). Dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances were more common in the gabapentin group.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This study was adequately powered, but treatment with gabapentin did not result in significantly lower pain scores in women with chronic pelvic pain, and was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo. Given the increasing reports of abuse and evidence of potential harms associated with gabapentin use, it is important that clinicians consider alternative treatment options to off-label gabapentin for the management of chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">At the time of the design of the pilot study for this trial (GaPP1), there had been an increase in prescription of gabapentin in general within the UK. The rate of patients newly treated with gabapentinoids in primary care tripled from 2007 to 2017, and by 2017 half of the prescriptions of gabapentinoids were for an off-label indication. At the time, we also observed that there was considerable use of gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain (largely because of its perceived effectiveness in other chronic pain conditions). First, we surveyed a random group of general practitioners, with the support of the Scottish Primary Care Research Network. Of the general practitioners who responded to our survey, 74% said that they would consider gabapentin as a treatment option for chronic pelvic pain in women. Second, we surveyed a random group of gynaecologists, with the support of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Of those who responded to our survey, 50% said that they currently prescribe gabapentin for chronic pelvic pain, and 92% said that they would consider gabapentin as a treatment option for this condition. Since then, awareness and use of gabapentinoids has continued to increase in gynaecology, with the publication of reviews in this area and reference within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for endometriosis to the NICE guideline on neuropathic pain for treatment of chronic pelvic pain with neuromodulators. However, data from randomised clinical trials of the use of gabapentin in women with chronic pelvic pain are scarce. A 2017 Cochrane review identified one trial that compared the efficacy of gabapentin and amitriptyline for chronic pelvic pain in women with a range of pelvic pathologies, but this study was open-label, there was no placebo group, the population had a mixed aetiology of pain symptoms, and the numbers analysed were small, with only 56 participants. An update to the Cochrane review search strategy in MEDLINE, Embase, PsychLit, and CAB abstracts to April 15, 2020, found only our own pilot trial (GaPP1) and one other placebo-controlled trial from Egypt, neither of which were powered to detect significant differences, and both had substantial attrition. An increased risk of suicidal behaviour, as a potential side-effect of gabapentin, and possible misuse of the drug have been of concern with the rise in the prescribing of gabapentin.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">This study is the first large, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial to report on treatment of chronic pelvic pain with gabapentin. Although it conflicts with the results of the Egyptian trial, the robustness of the study design, including masking to treatment allocation of both participants and investigators, ensured internal validity, enabling the results to be interpreted with confidence. Groups were balanced with respect to dysmenorrhoea, psychological distress, and concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives—all potentially prognostic for reported pain. The design of our trial reflects the real-word choices that women and their gynaecologists make about the management of chronic pelvic pain. We can confidently conclude that gabapentin is not effective for chronic pelvic pain in women.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology should be advised that gabapentin might not alleviate their pain and could give them unpleasant side-effects. In our opinion, no further research is required to establish the role of gabapentin in the management of chronic pelvic pain in women with no obvious pelvic pathology. Questions that remain unaddressed relate to the use of other pharmacological interventions (monotherapy <italic>vs</italic> combination therapy), physiotherapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy for treating chronic pelvic pain in women. It is possible that subgroups of women could benefit from gabapentin, but these will need to be carefully characterised and explored.</p>

                <p id="para110">This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GaPP2) took place in 39 UK hospital centres. Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the UK Coventry and Warwick Research Ethics Committee (REC 15/WM/0036) and clinical trial authorisation was obtained from the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority. A trial steering committee provided independent oversight of the trial. Confidential interim analysis of all available data alongside anonymised reports of adverse events by participants were reviewed by a data monitoring committee on four occasions. No reason to recommend halting or modifying the trial was identified. The trial protocol has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para120">The recruitment criteria for this study were defined before the International Classification of Diseases-11 classification for chronic secondary visceral pain was drawn up, and were based on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists definition for chronic pelvic pain and the 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain taxonomy.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Moreover, we believe that they reflect the group of women commonly seen in gynaecological practice within the UK and that any heterogeneity is a strength, ensuring that our results are generalisable. Eligible participants were women with chronic pelvic pain (with or without dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia) of at least 3 months duration. We limited the study to women because of the growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that suggest sex differences in pain thresholds, sensitivity, and underlying neuroimmune modulation.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Pelvic pain was defined as pain located within the true pelvis (between and below the anterior iliac crests). Inclusion criteria were 18–50 years of age, use or willingness to use contraception to avoid pregnancy, and no obvious pelvic pathology at laparoscopy (eg, macroscopic endometriosis lesions, complex ovarian cysts or ovarian cysts of &gt;5 cm, fibroids of &gt;3 cm, and dense adhesions), which must have taken place at least 2 weeks before consent but less than 36 months previously. Women were excluded if they only had dysmenorrhoea; had a malignancy; were currently using or had previously used gabapentin or pregabalin; had surgery planned in next 6 months; had contraindications to taking gabapentin; had a previous reaction to gabapentin; were taking gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists and were unable or unwilling to stop; were breastfeeding, pregnant, or planned a pregnancy in next 6 months; or had pain suspected to be of gastrointestinal origin (according to positive Rome III Diagnostic Criteria); or had previously participated in the GaPP1 pilot study. All women provided written informed consent. After confirmation of clinical eligibility, women entered a pre-randomisation screening phase where they were required to return their worst and average pain scores on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable), weekly for 4 weeks via a centralised text messaging system. To be considered eligible for randomisation, women were required to have returned at least three of four pre-randomisation NRS scores on both the worst and average NRS scales to show adherence to data collection. At least two of the worst NRS pain scores needed to be a score of 4 or higher, for the pain to be considered sufficient for entry into the trial. No study drugs were taken during this pre-randomisation screening phase, but participants were able to remain on any analgesics they were taking. We did not specify a target recruitment per centre; all centres recruited as many women as they could during the recruitment period.</p>

                <p id="para140">Participants took the assigned drugs orally, every day from the time of randomisation to 16 weeks after randomisation. The study drugs were supplied by Sharp Clinical Services UK, who procured the gabapentin and manufactured the placebo capsule, over-encapsulated the gabapentin, and dispensed all capsules into numbered containers. The dosing regimen included a 4-week titration phase where each participant started on one capsule (300 mg) daily, and increased the dose by one capsule every 3 days until they perceived that they were gaining adequate pain relief, or reported side-effects that precluded them from further increases, up to a maximum dose of nine capsules. If necessary, participants were advised to titrate down to the last tolerated dose with minimal side-effects. They were also asked to maintain their highest tolerated dose until the end of week 16. Study drugs were dispensed at time of randomisation, at weeks 4–5, and (dependent on the maximum tolerated dose reached) at weeks 8–10. Other analgesic medications, including opioids and antidepressants (but excluding those contraindicated alongside gabapentin) were allowed and their use was recorded.</p>

They were collected via weekly text messages and assessed or interpreted as separate outcomes. The final worst pain score was taken as the worst response from the worst pain scores returned, and the average pain score as the mean of the average pain scores returned. Non-responders were contacted by telephone and the pain scores reported verbally. Secondary outcome measures comprised an examination at 16 weeks after randomisation of the proportion of women who had a 30% or 50% reduction in worst and average NRS pain scores (from baseline to end of treatment); global patient impression of change; general quality of life (Short Form-12),<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> further pain assessment (Brief Pain Inventory),<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> assessment for neuropathic-like features of pain (PainDETECT),<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> fatigue assessment (Brief Fatigue Inventory),<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire),<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> pain-related cognitions (Pain Catastrophizing Scale),<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> impairments in paid work or activities (Work and Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire),<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and sexual functioning (Sexual Activity Questionnaire).<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Patient-reported questionnaires were collected at weeks 16–17 post-randomisation. The Pelvic Pain and Urinary Frequency Patient Symptom Scale was completed at baseline only. Data on use of analgesics, serious adverse events, and side-effects were collected at weeks 4–5 and 8–10, either when the study drug was dispensed or by telephone. Women were asked to report appointments with health-care professionals (eg, general practitioner or hospital doctor). Reporting was restricted to appointments in relation to chronic pelvic pain, in addition to those required by the trial. We attempted to collect outcome data for all participants who were randomly assigned, regardless of adherence to the trial group assignment. Adherence to the study drug was collected using treatment diaries which recorded the number of tablets taken daily, alongside self-reported estimates of adherence. Adherence to treatment was defined as taking more than 50% of the study drug, self-reported at weeks 16–17.</p>

There is a body of literature<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> to support one point on a NRS or 1 cm on a visual analogue scale representing minimal or little change, and 2·0–2·7 points being much or some change. To account for any increase in the risk of type 1 error that could be associated with having dual outcome measures, a Bonferroni correction was applied (with a two-sided α-level of 0·025). We planned to include 300 women in the trial to account for up to 20% loss to follow-up.</p>

Mean differences were adjusted for baseline score and minimisation variables. Mean change from baseline is also presented by group. The primary analysis is equivalent to a change from baseline analysis when also adjusting for baseline score. 97·5% CIs have been used and p values have been reported from two-sided tests at the 2·5% significance level, to account for the Bonferroni correction applied to the dual primary outcome measures. NRS scores were further analysed using a repeated-measures model in which all assessment times were included. Binary secondary outcomes are presented as risk ratios produced from a log-binomial regression model. All continuous secondary outcome measures are presented as mean differences produced from a linear regression model. Appointments with health-care professionals for chronic pelvic pain and use of analgesics, in addition to appointments required by the trial, are reported descriptively only. All secondary outcomes are reported as point estimates with 99% CIs (without p values).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para270">This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that, in women with chronic pelvic pain and no obvious pelvic pathology, gabapentin was no more effective than placebo in reducing pain. The trial was powered adequately to detect differences between trial groups, and the between-group point estimates and corresponding CIs excluded a minimally important clinical difference of one point on a 0–10 pain scale, so we can confidently conclude that gabapentin is not effective for chronic pelvic pain at a group level. The incidence of side-effects and serious adverse events was higher in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. We do not believe that the inclusion of a small proportion of women with neuropathic-like pain (65 [22%] of 301 participants) and potentially a number of actual neuropathies, explains the lack of efficacy of gabapentin over placebo overall in our study, given that there was no difference in mean PainDETECT scores between the two groups at baseline nor at the end of the study.</p>
              <p id="para280">We used a dual primary outcome measure and considered both worst and average pain scores. These outcomes were considered separately and an improvement in one (or both) would conclude gabapentin was efficacious. Although we acknowledge that it is preferable to have a single primary outcome, a survey of our patient involvement group found that worst and average pain were equally important to women.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> We therefore collected the pain scores weekly over a 4-week period, asking participants to rate both worst and average pain for the preceding week, and defined a minimum number of responses to create a valid outcome. We used this approach because chronic pelvic pain can fluctuate during a woman's menstrual cycle, so eliciting a pain score at a single timepoint is unlikely to capture the effect of gabapentin nor reflect the woman's experience of pain. All outcome data in the trial were subjective or participant-reported outcomes (rather than laboratory measurements), but the study was blinded, reducing risk of incurring assessor bias.</p>
              <p id="para290">The calculation for the sample size for the trial was based on a recognised minimally important clinical difference for chronic pain<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> of one point on a 0–10 NRS, and used a SD from a comparable pilot study.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Appropriate adjustments were applied to account for the dual primary outcome in both the sample size calculation and analysis. The target number of women were recruited and missing outcome data were as anticipated, with a follow-up rate for the dual primary outcome of 80% of women (246 [80%] worst NRS and 244 [80%] average NRS). The sensitivity analysis was almost identical to the observed data comparison and the CIs for both did not reach the minimally important clinical difference, so it is unlikely a meaningful treatment effect was missed because of missing data.</p>
              <p id="para300">Rate of adherence to the trial regimen was high (women reported taking at least half of the study drug doses throughout the trial), but was not validated against an objective method such as pill-counting. The dose of gabapentin that participants received was based on individual adjustment of the dose by the participants themselves, which reflected their perception of pain relief and side-effects. Adjustments were made in accordance with existing dosing recommendations,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> up to a dose of 2700 mg per day, and final doses ranged from 600 mg to 2700 mg per day during the treatment phase. When the trial protocol was written, 2700 mg was the maximum dose recommended by the British National Formulary, and only pain clinics used to prescribe above this dose. We recognise that it is now generally accepted that higher doses can be prescribed, if side-effects permit.</p>
              <p id="para310">We also acknowledge that it would have been interesting to look at the effect of review by a pain specialist or specialist pain medicine prescription on outcomes, but we did not document whether patients had been seen by a pain specialist at the outset of the trial. However, it is worth noting that within the UK, pain management approaches for chronic pelvic pain are not usually considered until after all gynaecological and other relevant specialist (eg, urology, gastroenterology) assessments and appropriate treatments are complete, or not providing symptom improvement. Therefore, it is unlikely that the women enrolled in this trial would have been seen by a pain specialist with regards to their pelvic pain.</p>
              <p id="para320">Although more women in the placebo group were able to correctly guess their allocation at the end of the treatment period (78 [74%] of 106 correctly guessed placebo and 64 [58%] of 111 correctly guessed gabapentin), their use of rescue medication was similar. We cannot conclude that women who perceived they were taking placebo compensated by increasing their analgesic use and thus negated any effect of gabapentin.</p>
              <p id="para330">The higher rates of side-effects observed with gabapentin compared with placebo (eg, dizziness, drowsiness, and visual disturbances) in the trial are consistent with other published studies. A 2018 meta-analysis of all trials for postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> showed that, compared with placebo, gabapentin was associated with more drowsiness (gabapentin 14% <italic>vs</italic> placebo 5%; p&lt;0·001) and dizziness (gabapentin 19% <italic>vs</italic> placebo 7%; p&lt;0·001). Nevertheless, the rates of side-effects in our trial are lower than in these other studies, despite only measuring these in women. This would suggest that women are not more susceptible to developing side-effects from gabapentin than men.</p>
              <p id="para340">Similar to many clinical trials for treatments for pain, we observed a potential placebo effect.<sup>29</sup> The trial was not designed to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms behind this effect, but information offered in relation to treatment, patients' expectations, previous encounters with gabapentin, and the therapeutic milieu can all generate this response.<sup>30</sup> Nonetheless, the placebo effect observed is very relevant, because of the side-effect profile of gabapentin and its potential addictive properties.<sup>31</sup></p>
              <p id="para350">In conclusion, our results show that gabapentin did not relieve pain in women with chronic pelvic pain, and that gabapentin was associated with higher rates of side-effects than placebo.</p>
