                  <p id="Par1">Older people are vulnerable to sustained high levels of psychosocial distress following a crime. A cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-informed psychological therapy, the Victim Improvement Package (VIP) may aid recovery. The VIP trial aims to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the VIP for alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms in older victims of crime.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">People aged 65â€‰years or more who report being a victim of crime will be screened by Metropolitan Police Service Safer Neighbourhood Teams within a month of the crime for distress using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-2. Those who screen positive will be signposted to their GP for assistance, and re-screened at 3â€‰months. Participants who screen positive for depression and/or anxiety at re-screening are randomised to a CBT informed VIP added to treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone. The intervention consists of 10 individual 1-h sessions, delivered weekly by therapists from the mental health charity Mind.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome measure is the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), used as a composite measure, assessed at 6â€‰months after the crime (post therapy) with a 9-month post-crime follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include the EQ-5D, and a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory. A total of 226 participants will be randomised VIP:TAU with a ratio 1:1, in order to detect a standardised difference of at least 0.5 between groups, using a mixed-effects linear-regression model with 90% power and a 5% significance level (adjusting for therapist clustering and potential drop-out).</p>
                  <p id="Par4">A cost-effectiveness analysis will incorporate intervention costs to compare overall health care costs and quality of life years between treatment arms. An embedded study will examine the impact of past trauma and engagement in safety behaviours and distress on the main outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par5">This trial should provide data on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a CBT-informed psychological therapy for older victims of crime with anxiety and/or depressive symptoms and should demonstrate a model of integrated cross-agency working. Our findings should provide evidence for policy-makers, commissioners and clinicians responding to the needs of older victims of crime.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par31">Anyone can be a victim of crime. Its behavioural and psychological effects on quality of life can be severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Older people may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of crime because of concurrent life events, such as family bereavements, diminishing support networks, increasing physical frailty or financial difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consequently, older people may feel more isolated, more vulnerable, and require additional support following a crime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Our society continues to age, with people aged 85 years or over estimated to reach 3.2 million in the UK by 2033 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From the limited data on the impact of crime in older people, there appear to be increases in psychological distress, social care needs and mortality. Older victims of crime have significant levels of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and are at increased risk of needing placement in a care home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], compared to their peers who have not experienced a crime. Psychological morbidity also compounds age-associated ill-health and disability, leading to higher use of social and health care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Currently, 95% of depressed older people receive no specific treatment, with only 5% being referred to mental health services compared to 50% of younger adults, and only 3.7% of referrals for psychological therapies being for older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Failure to treat depression and anxiety in older people often leads to chronicity of their symptoms for months or years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">There is scant research regarding specific interventions for older people who have been victims of crime. One small study of a video-based intervention for those with anxiety or depressive symptoms showed no significant benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Our National Institute for Health Research-funded study â€˜Helping Aged Victims of Crimeâ€™ (HAVoC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which assessed the impact of crime and its management in older people, confirms its significance as a public health issue: 3â€‰months after a crime, 65% of victims felt that it had affected their daily life and 27% were psychologically distressed, with just under a half meeting <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>) criteria for a psychiatric disorder attributed to the crime. Findings from the HAVoC study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] suggest that our specially tailored cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-informed psychological therapy, the Victim Improvement Package (VIP) may benefit people with depressive- and anxiety-related symptoms. Findings from the HaVoC study informed the present, fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the addition of a psychological therapy (the VIP) to usual care, compared to usual care alone.</p>

                <title>Location</title>
                <p id="Par47">Participants will be recruited from nine London boroughs: Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Camden, Islington, Barnet, Havering, Haringey, Newham and Enfield. These areas were selected for demographic diversity (ethnicity, social economic status) and because of the availability of local psychological services, provided by the mental health charity Mind.</p>

                <title>Recruitment methods and procedures</title>
                <p id="Par48">Recruitment into this RCT follows a three-step procedure, comprising: (1) screening; (2) re-screening; and (3) the RCT. These three steps are outlined below:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par49">Step 1</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par50"><italic>Screening.</italic> Any person aged 65â€‰years or more, recorded as a victim of crime (excluding domestic and sexual crimes) from one of nine London boroughs will be identified from a computer search on the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) database. Identified victims will be contacted by a police administrator to arrange a visit (either a police community support officer or a police constable), from one of the MPS Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNTs) within a month of the crime.</p>
                <p id="Par51">A pre-populated proforma completed by a central administrator will be forwarded to a police officer who then visits to explain the trial to victims. Informed consent to participate will be sought by the visiting officer. If the person agrees, the officer will collect additional demographic information and details about the crime as well as screening the victim for depressive and anxiety symptoms using abbreviated forms of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), respectively (see TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Victims who score 3 or more on the PHQ-2 and/or 2 or more on the GAD-2 are considered screen-positive; scores below these cut-offs on both of these measures are case-negative. The police will then signpost the screen-positive participants to their general practitioner (GP), providing an accompanying letter that states that the person appears to be experiencing significant distress, recommending that the GP should manage them as they see fit. Those who are screen-negative are provided with information about the impact of crime and advised to see their GP if they develop symptoms of anxiety or depression.

                <p id="Par52">The trial will start with SNTs screening all suitable older victims for distress. However, as police resources are constrained, once we have established that SNTs can screen both positive and negative older victims, procedures will be adapted to screen older victims over the phone and only for SNTs to visit those who are screen-positive or deemed vulnerable. This will ensure that police resources are targeted at distressed older victims only.</p>
                <p id="Par53">In addition to the above a subset of screen-positive and screen-negative victims from steps 1 and 2, are invited to take part in qualitative interviews. Details of these are outlined in the â€˜Qualitative researchâ€™ section below.

                <p id="Par55"><italic>Re-screening</italic>. Screen-positive victims from step 1 are re-screened 3â€‰months after the crime over the phone for continued symptoms of depression (â‰¥ 3 on PHQ-2) and/or anxiety (â‰¥ 2 on GAD-2). Eligibility criteria (outlined below) are assessed. A home visit by a trial researcher further assesses participants to ensure that they satisfy all the entry criteria for the RCT (step 3).

However, we will be constrained by the availability of therapists and will adapt a pragmatic approach, using therapists who are experienced in psychological approaches and have undertaken training in CBT. All therapists will be given a full day of training on how to apply their existing skill set to the VIP intervention. They will be taken through the VIP manual step by step and also asked to participate in role plays of various scenarios typical of older victims of crime.</p>

Therapy sessions will follow a typical CBT model: setting an agenda, conducting therapy and encouraging between-session homework exercises.</p>

Both the BDI-II and BAI are self-reported scales with 21 items each having four possible answer choices. They have good reliability and validity for measuring severity of depression and anxiety, respectively. The BDI-II has the advantage over other scales because it includes a significant number of cognitive-affective as well as somatic dimensions.

For standardisation, the corresponding sample mean (BAI or BDI-II) will be subtracted from the BAI or BDI-II measurement and then the resulting measure divided by the corresponding sample standard deviation (BAI or BDI-II). This will yield a standardised outcome measure to be modelled for all trial participants (whether anxious or depressed, with or without anxiety). Although there is little evidence as to what constitutes a clinically meaningful difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], consensus between experts in the field suggest that a change of 0.5 of a standard deviation, 3 or more on the BDI, is considered a NICE-approved clinically important change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It is feasible to detect a (â€˜trueâ€™) average difference of at least 0.5 on the standardised joint scale with 90% power and a 5% significance level using a total sample size (<italic>N</italic>) of 168, with participants randomised VIP:TAU with a ratio 1:1. Applying an overall â€˜cluster-adjustmentâ€™ for therapist effects, assuming a cluster-size of 8 intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) ofâ€‰=â€‰0.02 and 15% allowance for drop-out, increases this to <italic>N</italic>â€‰=â€‰226. Using data from the pilot study, the â€˜targetâ€™ standardised difference of 0.5 implies changes in both BAI and BDI-II of about 4 and this is valuable clinically, given the scales show that for moderate levels of symptoms the scores range from 20 to 28 and 16â€“25 for anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par124">This trial is the first fully powered study, building on our pilot HAVoC trial, to work across agencies for the screening and treatment of depression and/or anxiety in older victims of crime. Older people are particularly vulnerable to the impact of crime because of concurrent life events; family bereavements, physical ill-health, disability, financial difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As the proportion of older people in the UK population rises, society is going to be increasingly impacted by this. Older victims of crime experience significant levels of depression and anxiety, which in many persists for months after victimisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The VIP trial should provide robust evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treating depression and/or anxiety in this population.</p>
              <sec id="Sec30">
                <title>Research implications</title>
                <p id="Par125">There are virtually no studies published about the mental health of older victims of crime. This trial should demonstrate the utility of a model of cross-agency working in which the police screen older victims of crime, the university team follow-up the victims, and the mental health charity Mind deliver a psychological treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par126">Older victims are particularly hard to reach. Despite significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, which develop rapidly after a crime, existing health care and voluntary services appear unaware of these. If feasible, our model for screening victims, identifying distress and referring for treatment, could be adapted to other research projects in other hard-to-reach and vulnerable victim groups, such as people with intellectual difficulties, in whom mental distress may otherwise be missed.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec31">
                <title>Clinical and policy implications</title>
                <p id="Par127">The primary objective of the VIP trial is to determine whether manualised, context-specific CBT, delivered through the mental health charity Mind, is more clinically and cost-effective than TAU for treating anxiety and depression in older victims of crime. Secondary objectives should determine whether older people take up the offer of signposting, and whether health professionals act on this as part of the first step in public health prevention to reduce the potential chronicity of symptoms. The built-in cost-effectiveness analysis should also help evaluate the indirect costs associated with the impact of crime and whether the intervention appears to be cost-effective, such as, for example, reducing the use of health care or social services in this vulnerable population. The final objective is to evaluate whether the model of cross-agency working is successful so that it can then be rolled out across the UK. In this model, the police identify older victims of crime, screen them for distress and, using a coordinator embedded in the police, refer distressed older victims for further evaluation to see whether a CBT intervention is indicated. Delivery of CBT could be undertaken by a variety of agencies, including Mind, IAPT or referral to accredited CBT therapists practising within a GP or community setting.</p>
                <p id="Par128">This trial should provide information on: the proportion of crimes against older people compared to their younger counterparts; the mental health impact that crimes have on older people; the relationship between different types of crime and mental health; the chronicity of anxiety and depressive symptoms associated with a crime; and the health care costs associated with crime. It should also generate evidence to inform guidelines for the Ministry of Justice on how the needs of older victims may be managed.</p>
                <p id="Par129">If our findings suggest that signposting to existing services by the police does not work as part of public health prevention strategy, older victims could be referred directly to mental health services for active surveillance of symptoms, so that an intervention can be delivered if necessary. This framework could still be used nationally and internationally to manage distressed older victims of crime.</p>
