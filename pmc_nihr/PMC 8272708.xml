                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Equivalent efficacy was demonstrated for the biosimilar CT-P6 and trastuzumab following neoadjuvant therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. Following adjuvant treatment, efficacy and safety were comparable between treatments. We report updated safety and efficacy data after up to 3 years’ follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CT-P6/trastuzumab, patients underwent surgery and continued receiving adjuvant CT-P6/trastuzumab. The primary endpoint (previously reported) was pathological complete response. Time-to-event analyses (disease-free survival [DFS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall survival [OS]), study drug-related and cardiac adverse events, and immunogenicity were assessed during post-treatment follow-up.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Most patients entered the follow-up period (CT-P6: 259 [95.6%]; trastuzumab: 269 [96.8%]). After a median follow-up of 38.7 (CT-P6) and 39.6 (trastuzumab) months, medians were not reached for time-to-event parameters; estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 3-year survival rates were similar between groups. Estimated HRs (95% confidence intervals) for CT-P6 versus trastuzumab were 1.23 (0.78–1.93) for DFS, 1.31 (0.86–2.01) for PFS, and 1.10 (0.57–2.13) for OS (intention-to-treat population). Safety findings were comparable between groups for the overall study and follow-up period, including study drug-related cardiac disorders (CT-P6: 22 [8.1%] patients; trastuzumab: 24 [8.6%] patients [overall]) and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction. Immunogenicity was similar between groups.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The similarity of the time-to-event analyses between CT-P6 and trastuzumab supports the equivalence in terms of efficacy established for the primary endpoint. CT-P6 was well tolerated, with comparable safety and immunogenicity to trastuzumab.</p>

              <p id="Par6">Trastuzumab plays a key role in the treatment of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. For example, adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab is highlighted in the National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], while the European Society for Medical Oncology clinical practice guidelines recognize that “(neo)adjuvant trastuzumab is highly effective and should be given to all HER2-positive early breast cancer patients who do not have contraindications for its use,” with limited exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. NCCN guidelines note that a trastuzumab biosimilar licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is “an appropriate substitute” for the reference product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One such trastuzumab biosimilar is CT-P6, which is licensed by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency for the same indications for HER2-overexpressing cancers as the reference product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The comparability of CT-P6 and trastuzumab has been demonstrated in terms of structural, physicochemical, and biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], as well as for the in vitro mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, the pharmacokinetic equivalence and similar safety of CT-P6 and trastuzumab have been demonstrated in a phase I, single-dose study in healthy adult males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">The current phase III study compared the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CT-P6 and trastuzumab, administered as both neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for patients with operable HER2-positive early breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Equivalent efficacy was demonstrated between CT-P6 and trastuzumab in terms of pathological complete response rate following neoadjuvant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other assessments and safety outcomes were comparable between groups during the neoadjuvant period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Outcomes of adjuvant therapy with CT-P6, in terms of preventing disease progression or recurrence and safety profile, were also comparable to those with trastuzumab treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This article reports long-term survival outcomes and safety findings, including cardiac toxicity, after up to 3 years’ follow-up during the post-treatment period of the study.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="Par8">Full details of this randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase III study (NCT02162667) have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients were recruited from 112 centers in 23 countries. Patients received neoadjuvant treatment with eight 3-week cycles of CT-P6 (Herzuma<sup>®</sup>; Celltrion, Inc., Incheon, Republic of Korea) or trastuzumab (Herceptin<sup>®</sup>; Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA), both administered at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg on day 1 of cycle 1 and then at 6 mg/kg on day 1 of cycles 2–8, with docetaxel and fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, followed by surgery (Fig. S1 in Online Resource 1). Patients then received ≤ 10 cycles of adjuvant CT-P6 or trastuzumab (6 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks, per original randomization) before entering a post-treatment follow-up period, which extended until 3 years from the day of enrollment of the last patient.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Eligible patients were women aged ≥ 18 years with histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer of clinical stage I–IIIa per American Joint Committee on Cancer Breast Cancer Staging, Seventh Edition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients were required to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 55% at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Key exclusion criteria included bilateral breast cancer, prior breast cancer treatment, and prior anthracycline treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>

                <title>Endpoints and assessments</title>
                <p id="Par10">The primary efficacy endpoint was pathological complete response rate analyzed in the per-protocol population, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Secondary efficacy endpoints assessed during the study period were disease-free survival (DFS), defined as the interval between the date of breast surgery and disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause; progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the interval between randomization and disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause; and overall survival (OS), defined as the interval between randomization and death from any cause. DFS and PFS endpoints used disease status assessment by mammogram, physical examination, other radiological methods on the tumor site, or clinical symptoms.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Assessments conducted during the post-treatment follow-up period included physical examination of the tumor site and tumor response evaluation every 3 months (until disease progression or recurrence), mammogram every year (for patients with non-measurable lesions eligible for assessment), and chest X-ray every 6 months (at the investigator’s discretion). Survival status and any salvage therapy were recorded every 3 months.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Adverse events (AEs) were recorded until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, Version 18.1. Between 30 days after last study drug administration and the end of the study, only study drug-related AEs and cardiac AEs were reported. For cardiac monitoring, 12-lead electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or multiple-gated acquisition scan (to determine LVEF) and New York Heart Association class evaluation were conducted every 6 months for up to 2 years (for a maximum of four times), with additional evaluations conducted if clinically indicated during the post-treatment follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Blood samples for immunogenicity testing were obtained every 3 months for up to 1 year (to a maximum of four samples). Antidrug antibodies (ADAs) against CT-P6 or trastuzumab were detected in serum samples using an electrochemiluminescence assay based on the Meso Scale Discovery platform (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA), which was validated as part of the CT-P6 development process. Samples positive for ADAs on screening were confirmed as positive using the same assay platform in a competitive inhibition format. ADA-positive samples were further characterized using a cell-based neutralization assay.</p>

                <title>Statistical analyses</title>
                <p id="Par14">Sample size was determined as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing CT-P6 with trastuzumab for time-to-event analyses were estimated using an adjusted stratified Cox regression model with disease stage (stage I or II vs stage IIIa or higher), estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), progesterone receptor status (positive vs negative), and region (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa vs Asia vs America) as stratification factors. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to analyze median survival times and 3-year survival rates. Time-to-event analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations. The ITT population comprised all patients randomized to study drug, regardless of whether a dose of study drug was received. The per-protocol population comprised all patients included in the ITT population, other than any patients excluded because of major protocol deviations. Safety analyses were conducted in the safety population, comprising all patients randomized to study drug who had received at least 1 (full or partial) dose.</p>

                <p id="Par16">In the ITT population, the median (95% CI) follow-up duration was similar between the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups (38.7 [38.1–39.4] and 39.6 [38.9–40.1] months, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Kaplan–Meier plots for time-to-event analyses (intention-to-treat population). <bold>a</bold> Follow-up duration, <bold>b</bold> disease-free survival, <bold>c</bold> progression-free survival, <bold>d</bold> overall survival. <italic>CI</italic> confidence interval, <italic>HR</italic> hazard ratio</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10549_2021_6240_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par17">Median DFS was not yet reached in either group in the ITT population due to an insufficient number of events (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Events were most commonly progressive disease/recurrence (CT-P6: 41 [15.9%] patients; trastuzumab: 33 [12.6%] patients). In both treatment groups, most progressive disease/recurrence events were distant rather than locoregional (Table S1 in Online Resource 1). Deaths accounted for the remaining events (CT-P6: 1 [0.4%] patients; trastuzumab: 3 [1.1%] patients). The estimated HR was 1.23 (95% CI 0.78–1.93) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). DFS was similar between groups in terms of the 3-year rate (CT-P6: 0.83 [95% CI 0.77–0.87]; trastuzumab: 0.83 [95% CI 0.76–0.88]).</p>

One death in each treatment group was breast cancer-related. The estimated HR was 1.31 (95% CI 0.86–2.01) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c), and PFS was similar between groups in terms of the 3-year rate (CT-P6: 0.81 [95% CI 0.76–0.85]; trastuzumab: 0.87 [95% CI 0.82–0.90]).</p>

                <p id="Par21">During the overall study, the proportions of patients experiencing treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were similar between groups (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most frequently reported TEAEs in the CT-P6 group were alopecia (196 [72.3%] patients), nausea (99 [36.5%]), and neutropenia (96 [35.4%]) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In the trastuzumab group, the most frequently reported TEAEs were alopecia (213 [76.6%] patients), neutropenia (116 [41.7%]), and nausea (94 [33.8%]). The proportions of patients experiencing study drug-related TEAEs were also similar between groups (Table S2 in Online Resource 1). In the CT-P6 group, the most frequently reported study drug-related TEAEs were infusion-related reactions (22 [8.1%] patients), alopecia (21 [7.7%]), and ejection fraction decreased (19 [7.0%]), while in the trastuzumab group these were neutropenia (30 [10.8%]), anemia (25 [9.0%]), and alopecia (24 [8.6%]). Treatment-emergent serious AEs (TESAEs) were reported for 21 (7.7%) and 35 (12.6%) patients in the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups, respectively (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Similar proportions of patients experienced study drug-related TESAEs in each group (CT-P6: 6 [2.2%]; trastuzumab: 9 [3.2%]). Four deaths related to TEAEs occurred during the overall study, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Two deaths occurred in the CT-P6 group during the neoadjuvant period and were associated with sudden death and dyspnea.

                <p id="Par24">As previously reported, median LVEF at baseline was 66.0% in both treatment groups (range, 55.0–83.0% [CT-P6 group] and 55.0–79.0% [trastuzumab group]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During the overall study period, most patients had a decrease of &lt; 10 percentage points from baseline in LVEF (CT-P6: 169 [62.4%]; trastuzumab: 165 [59.4%]). Similar proportions of patients experienced significant LVEF decrease, defined as an absolute LVEF of &lt; 50% with a decrease from baseline of ≥ 10 percentage points, in each treatment group (CT-P6: 9 [3.3%]; trastuzumab: 7 [2.5%]). As previously reported, 1 patient in the trastuzumab group exhibited symptoms of LVEF dysfunction and discontinued the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; the remaining patients had no signs or symptoms of LVEF dysfunction.</p>
                <p id="Par25">During the follow-up period, the median (range) worst post-baseline LVEF value was 61.0% (41.0–76.0%) in the CT-P6 group and 62.0% (43.3–79.0%) in the trastuzumab group. The majority of patients had an increase, no change, or a decrease of &lt; 10 percentage points from baseline in LVEF (CT-P6: 204 [75.3%]; trastuzumab: 208 [74.8%]). Three (1.1%) and two (0.7%) patients in the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups, respectively, experienced significant LVEF decrease, and 3 (1.1%) patients in the CT-P6 group only reported TEAEs under the Preferred Term <italic>ejection fraction decreased</italic> within system organ class <italic>Investigations</italic> (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par27">Most patients with operable HER2-positive early breast cancer who were enrolled in this study entered the follow-up period. Therefore, this study provides robust data from the post-treatment setting after neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with either CT-P6 or trastuzumab. The similarity of the time-to-event analyses between treatment groups provides long-term data to support the conclusion of equivalence of CT-P6 and trastuzumab drawn for the primary endpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, CT-P6 was well tolerated, with a comparable safety profile to that of trastuzumab throughout the study.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In terms of time-to-event analyses, our findings were comparable with those of previous studies that had evaluated the treatment of early or operable HER2-positive breast cancer with trastuzumab administered in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. The 3-year OS identified in our study (CT-P6: 0.93; trastuzumab: 0.94) is comparable to findings from the phase III HannaH study, in which the 3-year OS rate was 0.90 for patients receiving neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, including intravenous trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and to the OS of 0.90 demonstrated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in the phase III NeoALTTO study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our findings were also broadly comparable to the 3-year OS of 0.98 reported in the phase II JBCRG-10 study, which evaluated different sequences of trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the 3-year OS of 0.87 in a retrospective study that evaluated a trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant regimen, followed by up to 1 year of trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">In terms of DFS, the 3-year rates of 0.83 for both groups in the present study were similar to the 3-year rate (0.84) in a retrospective study of patients treated with a trastuzumab-containing neoadjuvant regimen, followed by up to 1 year of trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. DFS findings were also broadly comparable to 3-year results from 2 studies evaluating trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant setting only (0.97 in the JBCRG-10 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and 0.95 in a retrospective and prospective observational study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Our DFS findings were in line with the 3-year rates of 0.87 and 0.89 for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with trastuzumab for 1 or 2 years, respectively, in the phase III HERA trial, which enrolled patients who had undergone diverse primary treatment (including surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par30">To our knowledge, PFS data for comparable treatment regimens and patient populations are not available. However, our 3-year PFS rates (CT-P6: 0.81; trastuzumab: 0.87) are similar to the 3-year event-free survival rates of 0.76 reported following neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in the NeoALTTO study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and 0.73 reported for the intravenous trastuzumab arm in the HannaH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">The overall long-term safety findings of the present study were consistent with the known safety profile of trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and there were no new or unexpected safety findings. One important element of the trastuzumab safety profile is cardiac safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study, 11.8% and 14.0% of patients in the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups, respectively, experienced cardiac disorders. This is comparable to the 13.4% of intravenous trastuzumab-treated patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer reporting cardiac events during the study period (which included 2 years of treatment-free follow-up) in the HannaH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and the 8.3% of patients receiving subcutaneous or intravenous trastuzumab-containing regimens who had experienced cardiac AEs in the phase II PrefHer study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In keeping with the rare occurrence of cardiac events after completion of trastuzumab treatment in the HERA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and the 1.3% incidence of cardiac AEs for intravenous trastuzumab-treated patients during treatment-free follow-up in the HannaH study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], few patients (3 [1.1%] in each group) reported cardiac disorders during the follow-up period of our study, while no longer receiving trastuzumab. TEAEs captured for heart failure were uncommon, with relevant Preferred Terms reported by at most 1 (0.4%) patient in each group, other than for ejection fraction decreased (reported by 20 [7.4%] and 9 [3.2%] patients in the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups, respectively, overall). The incidence of ejection fraction decreased was in line with expectations based on information for the reference product from clinical trial and post-marketing settings (frequency ≥ 1/10), while the incidence of other TEAEs captured for cardiac failure was in keeping with the expected frequency for comparable terms listed in the reference product information (≥ 1/100 to &lt; 1/10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">The interpretation of our findings is limited by the trial not being powered for survival, as previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Conclusions about long-term efficacy are also limited by the relatively short follow-up (median of 38.7 and 39.6 months in the CT-P6 and trastuzumab groups, respectively). However, the CT-P6 4.2 extension study (EudraCT number: 2019-003518-15) is ongoing. The CT-P6 4.2 study will collect data for up to 3 years after the last follow-up visit in the CT-P6 3.2 study, enabling analysis of 6-year DFS, PFS, and OS data.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The availability of biosimilars can increase the number of treatment options for both clinicians and patients. Reduced prices for biosimilars, compared with reference products, may improve access to biologic therapies, helping to improve financial sustainability of healthcare systems in the face of increasing drug costs in oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For CT-P6, in particular, a budget impact analysis has considered the effect of switching from trastuzumab to CT-P6 for the treatment of early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic gastric cancer in 28 European countries, and predicted substantial cost savings that could improve patient access to biologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">In summary, the similarity of DFS, PFS, and OS between CT-P6 and trastuzumab, demonstrated in this analysis after up to 3 years’ follow-up, supports the conclusion of equivalence in terms of efficacy previously established between the biosimilar and reference product. In addition, CT-P6 was well tolerated, with comparable safety and immunogenicity profiles to trastuzumab.</p>
