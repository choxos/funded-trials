                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Persistent physical symptoms (PPS), also known as medically unexplained symptoms are associated with profound physical disability, psychological distress and high healthcare costs. England’s annual National Health Service costs of attempting to diagnose and treat PPS amounts to approximately £3 billion. Current treatment relies on a positive diagnosis, life-style advice and drug therapy. However, many patients continue to suffer from ongoing symptoms and general practitioners (GPs) are challenged to find effective treatments. Training GPs in basic cognitive behavioural skills and providing self-help materials to patients could be useful, but availability in primary care settings is limited.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A cluster randomised waiting list, controlled trial will be conducted to assess the feasibility of an integrated approach to care in general practice. Approximately 240 patients with PPS will be recruited from 8 to 12 GP practices in London. GP practices will be randomised to ‘integrated GP care plus treatment as usual’ or waiting list control. Integrated GP care plus treatment as usual will include GP training in cognitive behavioural skills, GP supervision and written and audio visual materials for both GPs and participants. The primary objectives will be assessment of trial and intervention feasibility. Secondary objectives will include estimating the intracluster correlation coefficient for potential outcome measures for cluster effects in a sample size calculation. Feasibility parameters and identification of suitable primary and secondary outcomes for future trial evaluations will be assessed prerandomisation and at 12 and 24 weeks’ postrandomisation, using a mixed-methods approach.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>Ethical approval was granted by the Camberwell St Giles Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. This trial will inform researchers, clinicians, patients and healthcare providers about the feasibility and potential cost-effectiveness of an integrated approach to managing PPS in primary care.</p>

              <p>Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are an umbrella term referring to persistent bodily symptoms, which cannot be adequately explained by organic pathology.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> MUS are highly prevalent with ~10%–49% of patients in primary care.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> MUS are associated with significant functional impairment, psychological distress and high healthcare costs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> Moreover, ~60% of patients have a comorbid psychiatric condition, including depression, anxiety and panic disorders.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7–9</xref> The National Health Service (NHS) in England is estimated to spend approximately £3 billion each year attempting to diagnose and treat MUS, which represented ~10% of the total NHS expenditure in 2008–2009.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>The term MUS is commonly used in healthcare and research. However, it has been argued that using the label persistent physical symptoms (PPS) may be more appropriate for a number of reasons. First, recent surveys indicated that people with such symptoms and healthy respondents preferred the term PPS, as it avoids mind-body dualism and has cross-cultural relevance.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Second, it includes symptoms associated with medically diagnosed long-term conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, which may present comorbidly with MUS. Third, it concurs with changes in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM-5). The DSM-5 has consolidated previous terms including somatisation disorder, conversion disorder and hypochondriasis into a new diagnostic term—somatic symptom disorder. This refers to persistent (6 months) and clinically significant somatic complaints accompanied by excessive and disproportionate health-related thoughts, feelings and behaviours regarding the symptoms.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In this paper, we will use the term PPS to refer to MUS.</p>
              <p>There is an accumulating body of evidence showing that cognitive behavioural interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve overall functioning in patients with PPS. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has demonstrated both short-term and long-term efficacy with small to medium effect sizes for PPS.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Larger treatment effects have been reported for specific PPS syndromes, including non-cardiac chest pain<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> and irritable bowel syndrome.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref></p>
              <p>Research indicates that the way healthcare professionals deliver interventions and offer treatment to patients with PPS significantly affects health outcomes. For instance, a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the effectiveness of an integrated approach in treating women with chronic pelvic pain in secondary care. This involved an assessment of pain sensation, nociception, pain suffering and pain behaviour, followed by a discussion about possible physical, psychological, dietary and environmental contributions plus physiotherapy, versus routine laparoscopy. The findings revealed that the integrated approach was significantly more effective in reducing pelvic pain compared with routine laparoscopy.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence supporting the efficacy of psychopharmacological interventions for PPS is less clear. A previous Cochrane review on pharmacological interventions found low-quality evidence for the use of new-generation antidepressants. No evidence was found for other psychotropic drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This suggests the need for further research investigating the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments in managing PPS, including psychosocial interventions.</p>
              <p>General practitioners (GPs) play a major role in identifying and managing patients with PPS. The Royal College of General Practitioners emphasise the importance of GPs in helping patients with PPS to make sense of their symptoms by adopting a biopsychosocial approach to treatment.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A previous randomised parallel group pilot trial investigated the feasibility (ie, recruitment, retention and acceptability) of implementing a primary care symptoms clinic for patients with PPS.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The symptoms clinic comprised a structured set of consultations delivered by a specially trained GP with a strong interest in PPS. The intervention included exploring potential biological mechanisms underlying the PPS condition, empathetic support and training patients in symptom management (ie, medication or cognitive behavioural techniques). The results indicated that the symptoms clinic was acceptable to the majority of patients randomised to the intervention group and may have the potential to generate clinically significant benefits. However, this pilot study did not assess feasibility parameters referring to GPs’ willingness to participate in the study and undergo specialised psychological training. Moreover, the intervention was carried out by only one GP, raising questions about the generalisability of the study.</p>
              <p>Managing patients with PPS can be highly challenging in general practice. Although GPs recognise the treatment of PPS as a responsibility of primary care, previous studies show that GPs often feel powerless, frustrated and helpless when encountering these patients.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> One possible explanation for this is an epistemological incongruence between taught ideal biomedical models of disease, and the reality of meeting patients presenting with subjective PPS, which cannot be fully explained by organic causes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, GPs frequently report that factors such as time constraints and the lack of psychological training prevents them from effectively addressing patients’ psychosocial needs and developing appropriate doctor–patient communication skills.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>Taken together, there are four strands of evidence:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Psychological interventions may help patients with long-standing PPS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The way in which investigations are carried out and offered to patients with PPS affects health outcomes and service costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Psychopharmacological interventions (ie, antidepressants) have shown no or only small effects on alleviating PPS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>GPs often feel helpless and ill-equipped to manage patients with PPS.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <p>Approximately 240 patients with PPS will be recruited from 8 to 12 GP practices. These GP practices will be randomised to either ‘integrated GP care plus treatment as usual’ or waiting list control. GP practices randomised to integrated GP care plus treatment as usual will include (1) GP training in cognitive behavioural techniques, (2) GP supervision, (3) audio visual material for GPs and (4) self-help materials for participants. GP practices randomised to the waiting list control arm will continue with treatment as usual. The waiting list control arm will be crossed over at 28 weeks to give 4 weeks to collect measures. This will not be part of the RCT but will contribute to a separate long-term follow-up. A selection of feasibility parameters will be investigated prerandomisation. In addition, to identify suitable primary and secondary outcomes for future trial evaluations measures will be completed at 12 and 24 weeks. GPs who attend the offer of GP training will complete measures pre and post GP training.</p>

                <title>Study procedure</title>
                <p>Patients who give their consent to be contacted will be further screened and checked for eligibility by the research team. If the research team is unsure about their diagnosis, they will contact their GP and ask for confirmation. To formally enrol, patients will be required to complete and return a signed consent form. Once consent is obtained, a baseline questionnaire pack will be sent to participants 4 weeks prior to a prespecified randomisation date. If participants complete the questionnaire pack before this date they will be fully eligible to take part in the study. Participants will be fully informed that if they do not complete the baseline pack before the randomisation date they will not be able to participate in the study. GP practices will be randomised on the prespecified date to one of two arms: integrated GP care plus treatment as usual or waiting list control (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> and section on planned intervention for more details). Participants of GP practices randomised to integrated GP care plus treatment as usual should be offered the self-help material within 1 week of randomisation and GP’s should be offered the training within 2 weeks of randomisation. GP practices randomised to the waiting list control arm will continue with treatment as usual until they are crossed over at 28 weeks. Based on these timeframes, a training date for all GP practices will be scheduled in advance. However, GP practices will be fully informed that the GP training session is dependent on the randomisation outcome, that is, only GP practices randomised to integrated GP care will be offered the GP training. Once randomisation is completed both GP practices and participants will be informed of the outcome and this will be week 0 and considered the anchor point for this trial for all the participants. Measures will subsequently be taken at 12 and 24 weeks.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation of the GP practice clusters will take place following recruitment and baseline assessments of patients within each GP practice. The randomisation method will be stratified randomisation at the level of the cluster (ie, GP practice). The randomisation will be stratified by size of GP practice (≤6000 registered patients or &gt;6000 registered patients). GP practice randomisation will occur in pairs; two GP practices will be randomised at the same time with one being randomised to the waiting list control and the other being randomised to integrated GP care plus treatment as usual. Within strata (large or small practices) blocking is used to ensure that numbers allocated to either trial arm balance after each block. To avoid being able to predict the allocation of a GP practice, practices are randomised as pairs rather than sequentially. This ensures that forthcoming allocations cannot be predicted. Participants will have 4 weeks prior to randomisation to complete the baseline questionnaire pack. GP practice randomisation will be coordinated by an independent randomisation service at the United Kingdom Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) registered King’s Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU).</p>

                <title>GP training</title>
                <p>GP training will be delivered at GP practices by clinicians based within King’s Health Partners. To inform our decision about length of training, we discussed options with the GP’s and offered them anything from 1 hour to 1 day training in behaviour change skills. Most reported that they could spare up to 90 min as a group given their other commitments. For this reason, this is what we settled on. The session will involve a lecture, a role-play demonstrating engagement of a patient in a dialogue which focuses on a behaviour change technique and discussion. The specific content of the session will include background information about PPS and a three systems model of understanding how symptoms might be perpetuated regardless of cause. The link between symptoms, cognitions and behaviour will be described. The emphasis will be on engagement skills and behaviour change interventions, not cognitive re-structuring, as this is more realistic for GP’s with limited time. More specifically, we will focus on techniques that improve sleep routines and the uptake of meaningful activities. In addition, we will demonstrate ways of negotiating the setting of goals that the individual values, as homework. We will ask GP’s to use these skills and techniques in their consultations. We will not be encouraging the GP to see the participants for additional consultations. GPs will therefore use the approach during routine rather than study-specific consultations. To ensure that GPs are aware of which participants are taking part in PRINCE Primary we will upload a file note on the GP practice database for every patient who participates. This means that if a participant has an appointment, the GP will be aware that they are participating in this study. GPs will be provided with study-specific guidance on how to change the nature of consultations. Guidance notes and supporting manuals/documentation will be written which are potentially sustainable and suitable for use in other NHS settings. Information will be tailored to the needs of the patient and will be focused on a range of clinical conditions. Examples include low back pain, dizziness and headaches.</p>
                <p>A list of helpful responses in the consultation with patients will be provided. The training will be assessed (before and after) in terms of knowledge of PPS and confidence in diagnosing and managing these symptoms. Knowledge will be assessed via 10 true and false questions referring to the content of the training. GPs will also be asked to rate their confidence in working with patients with persistent symptoms by responding to a series of prespecified questions, using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 7 (very confident). Satisfaction with training will be assessed after the training. Open-ended questions will be used to elicit feedback about the workshops. Optional supervision (individual face-to-face, Skype/phone and/or group supervision) will be provided to GPs who request additional support. We will assess the uptake of this. Hand-outs will be available for GPs to give to participants. These will be reviewed for ease of reading by service users before the trial starts.</p>

                <p>The aim of the qualitative interview will be to discuss the participant’s experiences and opinions of the intervention, in particular (1) what they thought of the intervention, (2) how useful they found the resources and (3) whether they perceived any differences in treatment approach during their GP consultation.

                <p>GP’s will also be invited to participate in a semistructured interview (group/individual). The aim of the interview will be to discuss GPs experiences of implementing the intervention as well as discussing any suggestions on how the intervention could be improved.

This would mean that 120 patients will receive the integrated GP care by 24 weeks and will complete measures. As this trial is a feasibility study, no formal power calculation has been carried out. Instead, the number of GP practices was chosen, such that we have sufficient replicates to estimate feasibility parameters at the practice level.</p>

                <p>Data will be collected on paper source data worksheets. Data will then be entered onto the InferMed MACRO online data entry system, on a study-specific database designed and hosted at the KCTU. The system is compliant with Good Clinical Practice and Title 21 Part 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that establishes the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on electronic records and electronic signatures (FDA 21 CFR Part 11). Data exports will be provided to the trial statistician on request.</p>
                <p>The web-based randomisation system will maintain an accurate record of randomisations and data can be exported from this system for reports. Postrandomisation data can be readily extracted from the MACRO trial database for the preparation of DMEC reports and a front-end search function is available to support data checking and cleaning.</p>
                <p>Central data entry and data cleaning will be undertaken by a designated research worker. Major issues in staff training or data quality will be raised with the trial manager, who will perform source data checking against the data collection forms. Discrepancies can be raised in the system for resolution by site staff. Source data verification will be recorded on the system and any changes to data subsequent to verification will automatically generate an alert in the system. Individual user access to the InferMed MACRO system will be co-ordinated via the trial manager, who will submit requests to the KCTU. No direct requests from sites will be accepted.</p>
                <p>The chief investigator will act as custodian for the trial data. The following guidelines will be strictly adhered to (1) patient data will be pseudo-anonymised (allocation of a unique personal identification number) and (2) all pseudo-anonymised data will be stored on a password-protected computer. All trial data will be stored in line with the General Data Protection Regulation and archived in line with sponsor requirements. Consent forms and other paper records will be stored in swipe-card accessed offices in locked filing cabinets.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>A Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram will be constructed including various feasibility parameters: the number of eligible practices and patients, number of practices and patients agreeing to enter the trial, number of GP practices randomised, then by treatment arm: the number of patients continuing through the trial, the number withdrawing from the study at various time-points. The feasibility parameters will be estimated using the CONSORT diagram and will be presented as proportions accompanied by 95% CIs to provide a measure of estimator precision.</p>
                <p>Inferential analyses will be used to estimate intervention effects in terms of outcome variables. The formal statistical analyses will estimate the difference in mean outcomes between patients from GP practices randomised to integrated GP care plus treatment as usual and waiting list control by intention to treat at 12 and 24 weeks’ follow-up. We will provide estimates of trial arm differences with associated 95% CIs and will also translate these effects into standardised effects sizes to enable comparisons across measures and time-points. This information can help the planning of a future evaluation trial by providing guidance as to promising outcome measures and likely effect sizes. No formal significance testing will be carried out. Standardised effect sizes will be calculated by dividing estimated mean differences by the respective baseline SDs. Analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle and we plan to use linear mixed modelling with maximum likelihood estimation. A random effect for participant will be entered in the model to account for correlations between repeated measures. Additionally, a random effect for cluster will also be included to allow for correlations between patients within a practice. Bias in estimates of trial arm differences will be avoided by use of randomisation and blinding of the outcome assessors.</p>
                <p>All efforts will be made to avoid missing baseline data (ie, requiring completion of baseline data before randomisation), but missing values will be imputed according to current recommendations.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Missing scale item data will be handled as per questionnaire specific recommendations. We will aim to support participating practices to minimise loss to follow-up by encouraging a number of approaches: adopting other evidence-based procedures for recruiting and maintaining participation in the study and encouraging patients to return outcome measures (eg, contacting people before sending out questionnaires, sending personalised cover letters using colour printing and keeping measures short in terms of completion time).<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref></p>

                <p>Adverse events are any clinical change, disease or disorder experienced by the participant during their participation in the trial, whether or not considered related to the use of treatments being studied in the trial. Any SAEs, serious adverse reaction (SAR) or suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction will be recorded by the research worker at 12 and 24 weeks’ postbaseline. An adverse event is defined as serious if it:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Results in death.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is life-threatening (with an immediate not hypothetical risk of death at the time of the event).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Requires hospitalisation (but not including elective hospitalisation for pre-existing condition).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Results in a new persistent or new significant disability or incapacity defined as:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Severe=a significant deterioration in the participant’s ability to carry out their important activities of daily living (eg, employed person no longer able to work, caregiver no longer able to give care, ambulant participant becoming bed bound).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Persistent=4 weeks’ continuous duration.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Any other important medical condition which, though not included in the above, may jeopardise the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Any new episode of deliberate self-harm.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p>We will require two clinically trained scrutinisers to review all SAEs and reactions, independently from the trial team. They will be blind to the treatment group and will be required to establish whether events reported constituted SAEs. The scrutinisers would then be unblinded to treatment allocation so that they can then establish whether any SAEs were SARs to the system approach.</p>

The trial manager will prepare study specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the study. The trial manager will supervise a designated research worker to undertake data management/cleaning, so that they can provide regular reports on data quality to the chief investigator and the other coapplicants. Quality assurance checks will be undertaken by the trial team to monitor the level of missing data and timeliness of data entry and check for illogical or inconsistent data. The trial manager will monitor data collection procedures, ensure that study data entry procedures are followed and undertake source data verification against the paper data collection forms. The trial statisticians will be affiliated with KCTU, and will be responsible for producing DMEC reports, drafting of the statistical analysis plan and for carrying out primary analyses. We will ask the DMEC to take on this role of monitoring participating GP practices at recruitment. Our KCTU has SOPs that guide the trial statistician’s reporting to the DMEC.</p>

                <p>In the early stages of this study, we developed links with key stakeholders including patients with PPS, commissioners and a national charity. The first meeting entailed an open discussion to ensure that the trial was not burdensome for patients and to also gain a better understanding of what GP’s felt was possible. We continue to involve these stakeholders during the study. Patients were not involved with the recruitment of participants into the study. Peer-reviewed results will be disseminated to participating GP practices and study participants.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This cluster randomised waiting list, controlled trial aims to investigate the feasibility of an integrated GP care approach plus treatment as usual for patients with PPS in primary care versus waiting list control. The intervention primarily operates at the GP practice (cluster) level and hence a cluster randomised trial design is employed. This means GP practices randomised to integrated GP care plus treatment as usual will include (1) GP training in cognitive behavioural skills, (2) GP supervision, (3) audio visual material for GPs and (4) self-help materials for participants. GP practices randomised to the waiting list control arm will continue with treatment as usual (ie, GP practices will not be offered the intervention initially but will be crossed over and offered the intervention at 28 weeks to give 4 weeks’ time to collect measures). Cluster randomised trials can be subject to selection bias when patients are recruited after allocation of the intervention to the clusters (GP practices). Hence, our design ensures that patients are recruited before their GP practice is randomised so their decision to take part in the trial cannot be informed by knowledge of whether the GP practice receives the intervention. To avoid participants having to wait a long time only those who frequently attended their GP will be eligible to participate in this study (please see eligibility criteria). Patients will not be dropped if they are not seen by a trained GP as the integrated care approach also includes self-help materials for patients. This study aims to mimic a real-life setting in which a patient may not see the same GP on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>Given the prevalence of PPS and their costs to health services, there is an urgent need to develop easily accessible and affordable treatments for this patient group. Although previous studies have examined the efficacy of CBT-based approaches in treating patients with PPS, most studies were conducted in secondary care and focused on specific conditions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Taken together, evidence suggests positive effects of CBT-based group intervention on PPS. However, group interventions and bringing in secondary care healthcare professionals may not always be feasible and time efficient. The present trial attempts to address these challenges by evaluating the feasibility of training GPs in delivering behaviour change interventions in a 10 min consultation and providing patients with self-help materials.</p>
              <p>There are limitations to this study. It is unlikely that all GPs will attend all of the training. However, we will organise the training at times that suit as many GPs as possible. We cannot be sure in any case that GPs will use the skills they may have acquired during the training. GPs consultations will not be recorded as GP’s themselves feel it is too burdensome. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, we will conduct semistructured qualitative interviews with a random selection of patients to assess whether they had seen a GP and whether they felt that a behaviour change intervention had been delivered.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this RCT aims to assess the feasibility of an integrated GP approach for treating patients with PPS. Based on the results of the study, a fully powered RCT will be considered in order to assess the clinical effectiveness of this approach in changing identified health-related outcomes.</p>
