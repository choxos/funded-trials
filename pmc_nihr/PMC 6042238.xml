                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Whilst pathways relating to the early stages of stroke care have become well established, strategies for longer-term care are less developed and longer-term outcomes remain poor for many stroke survivors. <italic>New Start</italic>, a complex intervention that includes needs identification, exploration of social networks and components of problem-solving and self-management, was designed to improve stroke survivorsâ€™ quality of life by addressing unmet needs and increasing participation. It is delivered approximately 6 months post-stroke by trained staff (facilitators). We are currently undertaking a cluster randomised feasibility trial of the New Start intervention with an embedded process evaluation, which is an important component of the design and testing of complex interventions as it provides an understanding of how interventions are delivered and function in different settings.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This mixed methods process evaluation will explore the degree to which New Start is implemented as intended, the impact of context on intervention delivery and the acceptability of the intervention for stroke survivors, their families and practitioners. It will include non-participant observation of facilitator training and intervention delivery. Interviews with stroke survivors, facilitators and other relevant staff (including administrators and managerial staff) will be undertaken. Qualitative data from interview transcripts, facilitator reflections and observational field notes will be analysed thematically alongside numerical data documenting intervention delivery collected as part of the trial.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This process evaluation will identify factors that aid and impede implementation of the New Start interventionÂ and improve understanding of this novel approach to longer-term stroke care.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par11">The poor longer-term outcome for patients and their carers after stroke has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We are conducting a programme of research to develop an evidence-based and replicable longer-term care strategy for stroke survivors and their carers (the LoTS2Care programme). Through a structured process, we have developed an intervention, called <italic>New Start</italic>, that is designed to improve stroke survivorsâ€™ quality of life by addressing unmet needs and increasing participation. The LoTS2Care feasibility trial is a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) of the New Start intervention, designed to gather data to inform the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future definitive cRCT.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>New Start intervention</title>
                <p id="Par12">Our intent was to address the national guideline recommendation for a 6-month review of health and social care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with an evidence-based intervention. The development of New Start will be reported separately, but in summary, the intervention involves a trained facilitator eliciting a stroke survivorâ€™s needs and mapping their social networks at approximately 6 months post-stroke. An open process seeks to enable stroke survivors to address their identified needs and includes components of problem-solving and self-management. The implementation of the intervention is supported by a training package that trains individuals within a service unit to become New Start facilitators.</p>

                    <title>New Start training course</title>
                    <p id="Par13">Stroke services randomised to the intervention arm will identify facilitators to be trained in the intervention. It is anticipated that the New Start facilitators will have experience in one of the following roles: nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, health and well-being practitioner, or will have other allied health professional training, and will have stroke-specific knowledge or training.</p>
                    <p id="Par14">The facilitators will be trained in delivering New Start in the weeks preceding trial commencement. The initial training will consist of a 2-day training course during which facilitators will learn relevant theory about a self-management approach and communication skills. They will also learn about the intervention and how to deliver it to stroke survivors, with the opportunity to observe aspects of the intervention being delivered and to practise these skills. The facilitators will then practise delivering the intervention in their services. A further training day will take place approximately 3 to 6 weeks after the initial course and will provide facilitators with the opportunity to discuss progress and challenges with colleagues in a supportive environment. Purposively designed training records will be kept to document the training received by each facilitator.</p>
                    <p id="Par15">The New Start facilitators will be assessed for competency in the delivery of the New Start intervention approximately 16Â weeks after completing the initial training course, through a review of purposively designed documents to record intervention activity (termed activity records), reflective reports, interviews and observation. This will coincide with trial recruitment commencing.</p>

                    <title>New Start supported self-management sessions with stroke survivors</title>
                    <p id="Par16">The New Start intervention will be offered to all stroke survivors within the stroke services allocated to the intervention arm and who are approximately 6 months post-stroke. The New Start intervention consists of an initial face-to-face meeting, at the stroke survivorâ€™s home or in clinic, with a trained facilitator. It seeks to help stroke survivors identify any unmet needs they may have and then to work with them to address these needs. A leaflet providing a list of common problems faced by stroke survivors (termed a priming tool) will be sent out with an appointment letter in advance to highlight potential topics for discussion (unmet needs) and it invites the survivor to add their own. At the meeting, these issues and needs will be discussed (whether noted on the priming tool or not) and a supported self-management approach introduced. The process involves facilitated action-planning, goal-setting, and review, all of which are supported by New Start materials, a set of worksheets developed during previous phases of the LoTS2Care programme. At each stage, participants are encouraged to see those in their social network as resources to help in this process. Booklets containing information about stroke and useful contacts are also available and can be provided to stroke survivors as appropriate. Stroke survivors can have as many meetings with the facilitators as required. It is anticipated that most stroke survivors will have at least three visits and support may also be provided via other means (e.g. by phone or email).</p>

                <title>Feasibility trial</title>
                <p id="Par17">The protocol for the trial has been described in detail in a separate paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Briefly, the trial involves randomisation of ten UK-based National Health Service (NHS) stroke services on a 1:1 basis, either to implement the New Start intervention in their service, with delivery to the whole stroke population (intervention arm), or to continue with usual care (control arm). Approximately 200 stroke survivors across all the stroke services will be recruited into the trial. They will complete outcome assessments at baseline, and three, 6 and 9 months post-recruitment. In keeping with the cluster design, all stroke survivors within the intervention arm services will be offered the opportunity to receive the New Start intervention when they are 6 months post-stroke, independent of their participation in the completion of outcome measures as part of the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par18">This paper describes the protocol for the process evaluation embedded within the LoTS2Care feasibility trial, which has been designed in accordance with the Medical Research Council guidance for conducting process evaluations of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

                <title>Process evaluation development</title>
                <p id="Par19">The design for the process evaluation was developed through an iterative process including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par20">Further articulating the theoretical models of the intervention and implementation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Considering the relevant objectives for a process evaluation in the context of this feasibility and cRCT</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">Considering possible data sources and cross-referencing with the objectives</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par23">Developing a feasible protocol with consideration for the available resource and compatibility with the trial and implementation work.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par24">A pragmatic approach was taken to ensure results were applicable to the needs of this feasibility trial and intervention development. We drew on principles of evaluation frameworks (including realist evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], programme theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and Grantâ€™s framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), a taxonomy of factors that influence implementation (the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) and a theory of the work done in implementation (normalisation process theory, NPT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]).</p>
                <p id="Par25">To articulate the theoretical model of the intervention and its implementation further, two authors (NH and TC) utilised the research findings from the prior intervention development work, alongside discussions with the research team exploring their understandings of the intervention and their intended strategy for implementation. Following this, the logic of the developed intervention was explicated in a diagram (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and accompanying explanatory text.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>New Start intervention logic model. QoL quality of life</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2683_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par26">In addition, an outcomes chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was developed to represent diagrammatically a theory of change, i.e. what must be achieved in implementing the intervention to bring about the overall outcome â€” improved quality of life and increased participation for stroke survivors (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Each box contains an outcome (of implementation)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> that is related to other outcomes in the chain. Some of these relationships are stronger than others. Some outcomes are dependent<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> on the outcome preceding it, for example, the successful appointment of New Start facilitators is dependent on funding being available. However, other outcomes are not dependent on previous outcomes but are importantly influenced by them, for example, facilitators being capable and motivated to deliver New Start may be more likely in the presence of management support. In all cases, achieving any given outcome does not mean that the following outcome will be achieved. Rather, it suggests that it can be (dependent relationship) or is more likely to be (influential relationship).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>New Start outcomes chain.

                <p id="Par29">A matrix to accompany the outcomes chain (an example for one of the outcomes is provided in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for illustrative purposes) was also developed to describe details about success criteria for each outcome and factors that may aidÂ or impede its achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The process evaluation described in this protocol will be informed by these documents as a sensitising framework for the project and will examine the utility of the theory that underpins the design of the intervention and its implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcomes chain matrix (for one outcome as an illustrative example)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Outcome from outcomes chain</th><th>Success criteria</th><th>Programme factors</th><th>Non-programme factors</th><th>Activities (A) and principles (P)</th><th>Inputs and resources: financial (Â£) and human (â˜º)</th><th>Monitoring and assessment measurement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New Start facilitators are in post</td><td>Someone is employed by a stroke service to deliver the New Start intervention as a facilitator for 12Â months.<break/>A facilitator is:<break/>â€¢ Willing to support stroke survivors through a programme of supported self-management (the New Start intervention)<break/>â€¢ Willing and able to attend the New Start training course<break/>â€¢ Employed in this role for a minimum of 2 days per week (0.4wte)<break/>A facilitator has some stroke-specific knowledge that includes the causes and short- and long-term consequences of a stroke.</td><td>Whether:<break/>Stroke services are given guidance on the desired attributes required of a New Start facilitator, and on the minimum time required for the delivery of the intervention.</td><td>Whether:<break/>Stroke services are willing or able to recruit a facilitator according to the guidance given to them.<break/>Facilitators can attend the training course.</td><td>A: LoTS2Care team provide guidance to stroke service and managers about the desired attributes of New Start facilitators.<break/>A: LoTS2Care team provide the dates of the New Start training course to stroke services prior to recruitment.<break/>A: Stroke services identify or recruit a facilitator following local processes.</td><td>Â£ Funding (site) â€“ to employ a facilitator<break/>â˜º Management â€“ to recruit an appropriate facilitator<break/>â˜º Human resources personnel â€“ to support the employment process<break/>â˜º LoTS2Care team â€“ to provide guidance about the facilitator role and dates for the training course</td><td>Interviews with managers to ask if enough guidance was given to enable them to take appropriate action, and to check whether a facilitator is in place according to the success criteria.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par30">LoTS2Care is a feasibility randomised controlled trial. A key component of feasibility is the implementation of the intervention and therefore, much of this process evaluation will focus on exploring the ways in which New Start is implemented across the five intervention sites. In terms of Grantâ€™s framework, these are the domains: delivery to clusters, response of clusters, recruitment and reach of individuals, and delivery to individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Data collection and analysis will focus on exploring the outcomes contained in the blue boxes in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, because these are the outcomes directly associated with implementation. This process evaluation will, however, collect and access limited data from control sites to make some comparisons between each of the sites in the trial. It will also look at the response of individuals: the ways in which the New Start intervention is received by the target population (stroke survivors) and what they do as a result. These latter activities will primarily inform the feasibility of data collection methods for a process evaluation of a future effectiveness trial.</p>

These observations will increase their understanding of what the organisational unit does, how it does it and why, to inform their understanding of usual care. This will enable the researchers to document change. During the observations, researchers will not seek to become involved in conversations, meetings or interactions, so as not to influence local processes, but may seek clarification about what has been observed through conversation at an appropriate later time. In addition to field notes, researchers will document what kinds of services are provided and to whom, how people are offered access to these services, what different roles exist within each of the sites and why, and how decisions are made within the organisation as a whole and on a day-to-day basis.</p>

These interviews will explore their experiences of participating in the New Start intervention. Researchers may also, with agreement, retrospectively review and discuss intervention materials given to stroke survivors and carers to understand their use in practice. A topic guide will be devised drawing on our previous intervention development and piloting work. Interviews will aim to capture what stroke survivors and carers did during the meetings with facilitators (i.e. how many meetings there were, the duration of these meetings, and what actions occurred during the meetings); what stroke survivors and/or carers did as a result of participating in the intervention; whether, how and to what extent the intervention impacted the lives of stroke survivors and/or carers; alongside their experiences of participating in the intervention as a whole, including their experience of, and perspective about, the facilitators.</p>
                    <p id="Par49">Stroke survivors will be purposively sampled to achieve a diversity of informants with respect to the extent of intervention activity and the time since first activity using data from the activity records. Inclusion criteria for participation in the interviews are: individuals must have had (or be caring for someone who has had) a stroke, they must be living in the community and they must have been approached to take part in the New Start intervention. Only stroke survivors who are not participating in the trial will be approached for interview to avoid the effects of interviews and intervention delivery being confounded. Approximately 25 stroke survivors and their carers or supportersâ€”approximately five from each of the active sitesâ€”will be interviewed.</p>
                    <p id="Par50">Following appropriate informed consent procedures, stroke survivors and their carers or supporters will be given the option of being interviewed together or separately. We expect that individuals will be interviewed only once. To include stroke survivors who have varying degrees of ability to communicate, steps will be taken to adapt the interview methods, for instance by using pictures, adapting the topic guide or writing down key words. Photographs of the facilitator(s) may also be shown to stroke survivors to aid their memory of the intervention where appropriate. These interviews will be conducted in a quiet, private area (usually the stroke survivorâ€™s own home) and, with participantsâ€™ permission, be audio recorded. Demographic data including participantsâ€™ age group, gender, ethnicity, living arrangements and the relationship between the stroke survivor and carer (where participating) will be collected from each participant at the time of the interview for sample characterisation.</p>

                    <title>Interviews with New Start facilitators and relevant site staff (addressing objectives 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)</title>
                    <p id="Par51">At the end of the intervention implementation period, following appropriate informed consent procedures, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with all of the facilitators and with any additional site staff involved in implementation of the intervention (including administrators and managerial staff). Semi-structured topic guides will be utilised but will be sufficiently flexible to allow respondents to introduce any issues they consider relevant. The researchers will have gathered data from and about the services throughout the trial, so the topic guide will be devised close to when the interviews are undertaken, so that it can be tailored to each individual and reflect the context within which they work. Nonetheless, there will be core questions that each person will be asked, and these will be informed by previous work and the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Questions are likely to explore facilitatorsâ€™ experiences of the training package and whether they felt adequately prepared to deliver the care strategy; their experiences of delivering the care strategy; the impact of the organisational context on how the strategy has been implemented and delivered (e.g. the development of the intervention in their service, links with other staff members, organisations and departments, and the flow of survivors through the service); and their insights into the impact the care strategy has had on their own practice, the organisation and for recipients. These individual interviews will be conducted in a quiet, private areaâ€”likely to be at the individualâ€™s place of workâ€”and, with participantsâ€™ permission, be audio recorded. Demographic data including participantsâ€™ age group, gender and professional background will be collected at the time of interview for sample characterisation.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p id="Par56">Recorded interviews will be transcribed verbatim and anonymised, and managed alongside anonymised observational field notes and records, facilitatorsâ€™ reflective reports and site surveys using the qualitative data analysis tool QSR NVivo (version 10.0). Familiarisation with the data will be followed by data reduction, during which the researcher will engage in â€˜selecting, focusing, simplifying, abstracting, and transforming the dataâ€™ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to identify patterns and themes within and between sets of data, thereby making sense of them and generating descriptions and explanations relevant to the phenomena being explored.</p>
                <p id="Par57">Standard approaches to demonstrating trustworthiness and quality in qualitative research will be used, including clearly documenting the research process (methods, analysis and any problems encountered and solutions found), transparently developing interview topic guides in light of ongoing analysis, documenting the contextual features in which the research was carried out, exploring deviant cases and alternative explanations, and discussing emerging findings among the process evaluation team. Moreover, the researchers will keep a reflexive diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par58">Data from the activity records will be entered into a database. These data will be analysed with descriptive statistics such as count, proportion, mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range for each site and facilitator, and represented in graphs as appropriate.</p>

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p id="Par59">Written informed consent will be obtained from all study participants. For stroke survivors who lack capacity to give consent (e.g. due to cognitive difficulties associated with their stroke), consultee declaration will be sought from someone who is well placed to make a judgement on the stroke survivorâ€™s wishes. The consultee will be advised to set aside their own views and provide advice on the stroke survivorâ€™s participation in the research, taking into consideration the personâ€™s wishes and interests. An information sheet advising them on their potential role and their right to refuse will be provided. Capacity to provide consent will be assessed by the researcher during the conversation with each potential participant before consultee declaration or consent is obtained. The research team has previous experience of working with and interviewing people who lack capacity and who have cognitive impairments. For those who are unable to read or sign the consent form due to impairments, but who have capacity to consent, the consent procedure will be witnessed (the witness may be the caregiver or significant other).</p>
                <p id="Par60">When seeking consent to observe intervention delivery, if there are several people present (e.g. the stroke survivor and a relative) and some decline consent while some provide consent, the researcher will seek to understand their reasons for declining and obtain agreement for one of the following options: no observation is conducted, the observation is conducted but nothing about those declining consent is recorded, or the observation is conducted and the people who declined consent are not present. The researcher will be led by the will and needs of the survivor and carer and will not seek to impose observation on anyone who is unwilling. We believe this will provide the appropriate balance between an individualâ€™s right to participate in the research and anotherâ€™s right to refuse participation.</p>
                <p id="Par61">The right of potential participants to refuse consent without giving reasons will be respected at every stage of the research process. All data will be kept confidential and stored securely.</p>

                  <p id="Par62">It is possible that, during discussions, stroke survivors may disclose information to the researcher, or the researcher may have concerns, that the individual may be experiencing abuse or is at risk of abuse. In such circumstances, the researcher will follow the relevant NHS Trustâ€™s safeguarding adults policy (or equivalent document).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par63">The process evaluation described here has been designed to explore the degree to which New Start<italic>,</italic> a newly developed component of a longer-term stroke care strategy, is implemented as intended, the impact of context on intervention delivery and the acceptability of the intervention for stroke survivors, their families and practitioners. Process evaluation is recommended and regarded as good practice in trials of complex interventions such as this, which involve several interacting components, including some element of behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Such evaluations enable us to open the black box of complex interventions, providing insight into how interventions are delivered on the ground and the underlying processes influencing them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par64">There is little guidance for process evaluations in the context of feasibility trials and relatively few published examples. We have incorporated several highly structured data collection elements and have also included less structured elements, such as field notes from observations and semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders, to help us identify the most appropriate factors to evaluate in a process evaluation alongside a future effectiveness trial.</p>
              <p id="Par65">Our process evaluation has been designed to focus on answering clear questions around implementation fidelity, contextual factors, feasibility of data collection, intervention acceptability and causal assumptions based on a pre-specified theory of change and logic model. The findings from this in-depth evaluation will be invaluable in the interpretation of outcomes from the feasibility cRCT and will inform the future optimisation of the New Start intervention and its definitive evaluation.</p>
