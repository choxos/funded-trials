                  <title>Methods and results</title>
                  <p>We conducted a qualitative study, using semi‐structured interviews, with participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 12) and the research team (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4) from the TRED‐HF trial. Interviews were carried out in 2019 and were audio‐recorded and transcribed. Data were managed using NVivo and analysed using framework analysis. A patient representative provided guidance on the interpretation of findings and presentation of themes to ensure these remained meaningful, and an accurate representation, to those living with dilated cardiomyopathy. Three key themes emerged from the data: (i) perception of health; (ii) experiences and relationships with healthcare services and researchers; and (iii) perception of risk. Study participants held differing perceptions of their health; some did not consider themselves to have a heart condition or disagreed with the medical term ‘heart failure’. Relationships between participants, research staff, and clinical management teams influenced participants' experiences and decision making during the trial, including following clinical advice. There were differences in participants' perceptions of risk and their decisions to take heart failure medication after the trial was completed. Although the original TRED‐HF trial did not provide the results many had hoped for, a strong motivator for taking part was the opportunity to withdraw medication in a safely monitored environment which had been previously considered by some participants before. Investigators acknowledged that the insights gained from the study can now be used to support evidence‐based conversations with patients.</p>

                  <p>For people whose dilated cardiomyopathy is in remission, decisions to continue, reduce, or stop their medication are influenced by perceptions of personal health, perceive risk and the important of work, employment, recreation, relationships, and long‐term plans. The unique relationship between patient and cardiologist provides opportunities to promote honest discussion about adherence to medication and personalized long‐term management.</p>

              <title>Patient's perspective</title>
              <p>By Richard Mindham</p>
              <p>For the relatively young patient, having a chronic disease defines your sense of self and your very being. Taking tablets several times a day, visiting the General Practitioner (GP) for routine tests and repeat prescriptions, and collecting medicines, all act as repeat reminders of being ‘other’. Should providence shine on you and your condition improve, it is common to wonder whether it is possible to shed the sense of being a lifelong patient by reducing or removing your medication altogether. This question was addressed in the TRED‐HF trial where a small number of ‘recovered’ dilated cardiomyopathy patients withdrew their medication under supervision. This paper looks at their experiences and the psychological consequences of success or the unwanted confirmation that they needed to return to their drugs. Their perception of the risk of withdrawal, before and after the trial, is also reported.</p>

              <p>Pharmacological therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) may lead to resolution of symptoms and normalization of cardiac function and heart failure biomarkers.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Such patients often ask health professionals whether they can stop taking medication.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The ‘Therapy withdrawal in Recovered Dilated cardiomyopathy—Heart Failure’ (TRED‐HF) trial was undertaken to address this question.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The trial found that 40% of participants relapsed within 6 months of beginning withdrawal of therapy, suggesting that their disease had been in remission rather than cured.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The study team, and others,<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> therefore, recommended that all participants should resume medication until reliable predictors of relapse could be identified.</p>
              <p>Whether patients decide to take medications is influenced by many factors, including how they perceive the diagnosis and risk associated with it. A diagnosis of ‘heart failure’ has been shown to lead to denial of illness as a coping mechanism.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Other important factors include perception of over‐medicalization and the nature of the relationship with their physician.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Patient's trust in healthcare providers results in greater treatment adherence,<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> but whilst collaborative relationships enhance care and sustained contact improves outcomes,<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> there is a risk that patients perceive that healthcare staff are in control and so fail to make decisions for themselves.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> People with DCM are often young and are frustrated by the thought of taking medication for decades with side effects, perceived or actual, which can affect their sense of wellbeing and finances.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Patients become uncertain about whether medications are still required when they become asymptomatic but may also worry about the risk of relapse.</p>

                <p>The TRED‐HF lead researcher (B. H.) categorized participants based on study outcome into three categories: (i) relapsed; (ii) did not relapse, followed recommendations to go back on medication; (iii) did not relapse, did not follow the recommendation to go back on medication. Two researchers (V. P. and K. J.) randomly selected 15 participants (five from each category) using a computer‐generated number, reviewed the selection for a mix of age and sex in each category and reselected as required to reflect the study population. Two participants who did not fit the categories were also included. B. H. selected six members of the research team to participate. All potential participants were sent an information sheet and provided informed consent for the sub‐study.</p>

                <p>Motivations to take part in the TRED‐HF trial focused on personal gain, such as stopping or reducing pill ‘burden’, and altruism, to help others with the condition (including affected family members and future patients). Participants with fewer time commitments, for example, those who were retired, described a sense of duty to take part to advance knowledge and assist the health service.

                <title>Theme 1: Perceptions of health</title>
                <p>We asked participants to tell us about their heart condition, which led to a discussion on their diagnosis, what this means to them, the asymptomatic nature of their current DCM, and managing this in relation to other health conditions.</p>

                  <p>Most explicitly described themselves as having a heart condition; however, one felt her heart had since ‘recovered’. Some did not view themselves as having a heart condition; their heart had ‘healed’ or was secondary to a previous self‐limiting infection. Participants referred to ‘labelling’ of medical terminology. For some, receiving a diagnosis harmed their wellbeing; Ella described initially feeling <italic toggle="yes">psychologically crushed</italic> with her <italic toggle="yes">‘</italic>… hopes and dreams of living a really long life were very questionable… It can make you quite depressed, although you keep it to yourself most of the time.’</p>

                  <p>Participants thought trial visits were helpful to improve their understanding of their condition and receive more attention than would occur during routine care. Feeling comfortable with the level of attention and interacting with a ‘new’ clinical team differed; Alan described feeling embarrassed about receiving greater attention during the trial when he otherwise felt well, whereas Jack was concerned that researchers might be less familiar with his condition than his regular clinical care team.</p>

                  <p>Some participants appeared to have a disconnect between their perceived and actual health, likely linked to the largely asymptomatic nature of their condition. For instance, Daniel explained that the condition does not affect his day‐to‐day life, although he does sometimes experience short‐lived chest pain, which is thought to be non‐cardiac in origin. After withdrawing from the trial shortly after enrolment, and despite always remaining on medication, he was told that his heart function had deteriorated slightly, and he was surprised by this. Some described that others do not see any visible signs of illness, which impacts how they perceive their health. Some were uncertain of the cause of their condition, which made them worry about the potential for symptoms to return once medications were stopped.</p>

                  <p>Participants living with multiple health conditions described a sense of frustration when navigating the healthcare system and managing medications. For example, Katie described negative experiences of talking about managing her diabetes with cardiologists she had previously encountered often working in ‘silos’. She wanted a more open and honest, rather than dismissive, conversation with health professionals. She felt that her relationship with study staff was more positive, ‘[Name] didn't do that; that's just the general cardiology world that I've interacted with.’</p>

Jack described intentionally not taking his medication prior to the study whenever he <italic toggle="yes">felt fine</italic>. However, most participants described motivations to take part in TRED‐HF driven by the amount of medication, rather than experiences of side effects.</p>
                  <p>Others described feeling the medication was ‘unnecessary’, particularly if they felt well, and often linked this to medical staff prescribing tablets that were not needed (or ‘medicalization’).

                <p>Most participants followed the advice given to restart medication. Any differences in reporting could be either participant inaccuracy but more likely a time delay between interviews and their last contact with study staff.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study found that a strong driver for patients agreeing to participate in TRED‐HF was to address an unanswered question, in a safely monitored environment, ‘what will happen if I stop taking my medication?’ Participants took part with the hope of getting the answer they wanted for themselves; the hope of reducing medication (dosage and quantity) was especially evident when participants did not view themselves as having a heart condition or felt their heart had ‘recovered’. This is likely to have been influenced by the study's conceptualization through patient demand and design informed by public involvement.</p>
              <p>The TRED‐HF trial did not provide the results many participants hoped for (i.e. that medication could be stopped), but most participants appeared to follow the recommendation to restart medications after the trial. Some had decided to make their own decisions; for example, remaining on a lower dosage, or to continue not to take medication. The decision to continue taking heart medication was driven by several factors including managing other health conditions together with views on subsequent polypharmacy, being asymptomatic and fearful of symptoms returning, and attempting to navigate an often complex and disjointed wider healthcare system. Similar challenges have been described among people treated for latent tuberculosis<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and people living with HIV.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Decision making is therefore largely underpinned by an individual's perceptions of risk. However, TRED‐HF participants may be less risk averse and keen to stop taking medication compared with other patients with recovered DCM.</p>
              <p>Recovered DCM provides an interesting narrative because most patients do not have symptoms of heart failure, yet it is a lifelong condition. One study<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> describes a deliberate or unconscious process of denial of illness to cope with a heart failure diagnosis. Patients may, therefore, view DCM in a similar way to patients with other ‘stable’ conditions that are perceived as ‘cured’ (e.g. breast cancer survivorship), after normalization of cardiac function.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> This contrasts with the needs of those who require treatment to control the symptoms and signs of heart failure. Lehman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> have suggested re‐labelling the term ‘heart failure’ as ‘cardiac impairment’ to avoid the patient thinking that ‘failure means the end of hope’, which might have a negative impact on adherence to treatment.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The study population of TRED‐HF living with DCM was younger than the broader population of heart failure patients; we found evidence of psychological implications of a DCM diagnosis and prescribed medications such as view of life and mortality. Taking daily medication was a reminder of living with a chronic condition. The original TRED‐HF trial also included symptom burden assessments using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) and found no significant difference between randomized groups.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>A strength of the study is that we were able to understand the reality faced by people living with a largely asymptomatic, yet lifelong condition. Working in collaboration with clinical researchers, we quickly built a rapport with interviewees to explore complex topics including adherence to medication. We were also able to understand how and why patients may choose not to follow advice after a trial has finished. We felt that because the interviewers (V. P. and K. J.) were not involved in the original TRED‐HF trial, we were able to elicit more honest responses from participants. However, our study remains limited by its context‐specific nature particularly as this was conducted in an National Health Service (NHS) setting and we interviewed a small sample of the original study population. A qualitative study design means our results must be considered as ‘hypothesis generating’. We are also unable to comment on whether theoretical saturation was met (i.e. whether any new data would have emerged from interviewing additional participants), as each clinical trial experience was as unique as the previous; however, we feel that a range of backgrounds and experiences were captured in this study.</p>
              <p>TRED‐HF has shifted the narrative around traditional, and often more paternalistic, approaches to medicine to person‐centred care. The results should inform patients' decision to adhere to medication but also to clinical advice. For instance, this could be by providing patients with the space and time to ask honest questions free from judgement whilst being empathetic to the potential implications of the outcomes of clinical investigations to the patient's ‘lifeworld’ as is common practice in some other therapeutic areas.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>, <xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Future studies should consider the potential psychological impact of ‘disappointing’ research findings on their participants. This should be co‐created with all stakeholders (patients, carers and clinical staff) involved across the diagnosis, treatment and care pathway, in a way that acknowledges power differentials and governance structures, to optimize research impact.<xref rid="ehf213524-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Despite the efforts of the TRED‐HF trial team of communicating with primary care physicians, cardiologists and participants, we found that some study participants struggled with the transition back to standard care and accepting disappointing study results.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Patients with DCM and heart failure who are in remission perceive their health in different ways. This is influenced by previous interactions with healthcare professionals, personal relationships, and their hopes and expectations for the future. Whilst surprising for caregivers, for some patients, the concern regarding side effects and the impact of taking medication on quality of life may be greater than the risk of heart failure relapse. A proportion remains eager to stop or reduce medication and may resort to self‐management against advice, even equipped with the knowledge of the high risk of relapse observed in the TRED‐HF trial. To ensure the best outcome for patients, we must move from a paternalistic, ‘one size fits all approach’ to an open shared decision‐making approach, including candid discussions about the risk of relapse and taking into account the individual's perception of risk and hopes for the future.</p>
