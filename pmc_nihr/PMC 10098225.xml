                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Proximal humerus fractures (PHF) are common and painful injuries, with the majority resulting from falls from a standing height. As with other fragility fractures, its age-specific incidence is increasing. Surgical treatment with hemiarthroplasty (HA) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) have been increasingly used for displaced 3- and 4-part fractures despite a lack of good quality evidence as to whether one type of arthroplasty is superior to the other, and whether surgery is better than non-surgical management. The PROFHER-2 trial has been designed as a pragmatic, multicentre randomised trial to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of RSA vs HA vs Non-Surgical (NS) treatment in patients with 3- and 4-part PHF.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Adults over 65 years of age presenting with acute radiographically confirmed 3- or 4-part fractures, with or without associated glenohumeral joint dislocation, who consent for trial participation will be recruited from around 40 National Health Service (NHS) Hospitals in the UK. Patients with polytrauma, open fractures, presence of axillary nerve palsy, pathological (other than osteoporotic) fractures, and those who are unable to adhere to trial procedures will be excluded. We will aim to recruit 380 participants (152 RSA, 152 HA, 76 NS) using 2:2:1 (HA:RSA:NS) randomisation for 3- or 4-part fractures without joint dislocation, and 1:1 (HA:RSA) randomisation for 3- or 4-part fracture dislocations. The primary outcome is the Oxford Shoulder Score at 24 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), pain, range of shoulder motion, fracture healing and implant position on X-rays, further procedures, and complications. Independent Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee will oversee the trial conduct, including the reporting of adverse events and harms.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The PROFHER-2 trial is designed to provide a robust answer to guide the treatment of patients aged 65 years or over who sustain 3- and 4-part proximal humeral fractures. The pragmatic design and recruitment from around 40 UK NHS hospitals will ensure immediate applicability and generalisability of the trial findings. The full trial results will be made available in a relevant open-access peer-reviewed journal.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par27">Proximal humerus fractures (PHFs) are common and painful injuries, with the majority (about 90%) resulting from falls from a standing height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Their incidence rises markedly with age, being highest in those aged 70 years and over, and are about three times more common in women than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The frequency of these fractures is expected to increase due to the growing incidence of fragility fractures secondary to an ageing population. PHFs are associated with disability and loss of independence and have a negative impact on health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">The pattern of injury varies, and the fracture may be undisplaced or displaced. Undisplaced fractures are effectively treated non-surgically, but displaced fractures trigger treatment uncertainties. The three key elements of displaced fractures are as follows: the number of displaced fractured segments or “parts” (two-, three- or four-part fractures); whether the joint surface itself is fractured; and whether there is an associated shoulder joint dislocation (found to be between 5% and 8.6% of PHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]). These fractures can be treated either surgically or non-surgically. Non-surgical treatment involves resting the injured arm in a sling for around 3 weeks to allow initial healing, followed by physiotherapy. Surgical treatment generally involves internal fixation and preservation of the humeral head; replacement of the humeral head (hemiarthroplasty); or replacement of the humeral head and glenoid/socket (reverse shoulder arthroplasty).</p>
                <p id="Par29">The PROFHER trial found that surgical treatment was not superior to non-surgical treatment for the majority of adults with displaced PHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The trial aimed to recruit a population that reflected normal PHF epidemiology and therefore only a quarter of the study population had three- or four-part fractures. The findings provide unparalleled evidence for the management of the majority of displaced PHFs but the effectiveness of reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) for more complex fractures (3- or 4-part) was not tested within that trial.</p>
                <p id="Par30">There are reports in the literature of case series of RSA for 3- or 4-part PHFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and observational studies comparing RSA against hemiarthroplasty (HA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A systematic review suggests that using RSA for fracture results in reliable pain relief, functional range of movement and acceptable levels of patient satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is, however, an awareness of the potential complications of RSA, with up to 24% of patients reported as having a minor or major complication following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another systematic review comparing HA with RSA for treatment of PHF found that pain and functional outcomes were similar in the two groups, but RSA was associated with 4.0 times greater odds of a postoperative complication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. No differences in patient-reported outcomes were noted at 12 months follow-up for RSA over non-surgical treatment other than marginally better VAS pain scores in the RSA group in a relatively small randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Given the lack of good quality evidence, there is clear clinical uncertainty regarding the use of arthroplasty as a treatment for more complex (3- or 4-part) PHFs.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Despite the risk profile, the higher costs associated with RSA, and the presence of clinical uncertainty, its use is increasing over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Data from the 2021 National Joint Registry report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] confirms this trend in the UK, where the use of RSA for all indications has more than doubled over the 5 years from 2014, and RSA is being used nearly twice as often as HA for PHFs. The James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership on surgery for shoulder pain identified the use of RSA for 3- and 4-part PHFs as a key research priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is a clear need for a sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the effectiveness of RSA compared to HA and non-surgical treatment for 3- and 4-part PHFs.</p>
                <p id="Par32">The PROFHER-2 trial was therefore designed as a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled, three-arm trial to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RSA vs HA vs non-surgical (NS) treatment in patients with 3- and 4-part PHF.</p>

                  <p id="Par59">During RSA surgery, the fractured articular head fragment of the humerus is removed. The joint is replaced with a reversed geometry prosthesis, where the glenoid surface (socket) receives a prosthetic hemisphere, and the humeral side receives a prosthesis that usually has a stem that anchors into the humerus and bears a socket at the top. The implant design aims to alter the joint biomechanics, making the deltoid muscle more efficient at moving the shoulder without reliance on the rotator cuff muscles.</p>

                <sec id="Sec14">
                  <title>Hemiarthroplasty (HA)</title>
                  <p id="Par60">During HA surgery, the fractured articular head fragment of the humerus is removed. The humerus is then prepared to accept a humeral stem implant that bears a spherical head at the top as a replacement for the fractured humeral head. The remaining tuberosity fragments and associated rotator cuff are repaired to the proximal humerus and prosthesis, to reconstruct “normal” anatomy around the prosthesis. The native glenoid is not instrumented and articulates with the replaced humeral head component, thus only half the joint is replaced in this procedure.</p>

                <sec id="Sec15">
                  <title>Non-surgical treatment (NS)</title>
                  <p id="Par61">Non-surgical treatment involves supporting the injured arm in a sling for a period of 3 weeks for comfort as in the PROFHER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and participants are provided with a sling care advice leaflet at the time of randomisation. The arm and shoulder are then gently mobilised under supervision of a physiotherapist with the aim of increasing the range of motion and performing active exercises as tolerated. Physiotherapy sessions are tailored and include advice and education on a home exercise programme predominantly based on daily functional tasks. The physiotherapy sessions include a combination of exercise, soft tissue techniques, joint mobilisations, stretching and relaxation techniques. The physiotherapy pathway for non-surgical treatment follows what was used successfully in the PROFHER trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As 3- and 4-part fractures will be included in this trial, we have allowed for a median of 12 physiotherapy sessions being required (compared to eight required in PROFHER). The exact treatments may be individualised to ensure that rehabilitation is tailored to individual needs in line with routine conservative care.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">Non-surgical treatment has the advantage of avoiding the risks of anaesthesia and surgery. If pain is persistent or function remains poor after non-surgical treatment, delayed surgery may be performed at clinical discretion. This would not usually be considered before 6 months to allow an adequate period of rehabilitation to be pursued.</p>

                <p id="Par63">The need for comparison of surgical options for this patient group was part of the funder commission (NIHR 16/73). HA was the most commonly used surgical option at the point RSA was introduced in practice and was thereby chosen as the surgical comparator. Acknowledging the results from the PROFHER trial which found no significant difference between surgical and non-surgical treatments, it was deemed necessary to also include a non-surgical comparator to determine the best method for treating these fractures.</p>

                <p id="Par66">Following surgery (RSA or HA) a supportive arm sling is provided for comfort and a graduated rehabilitation programme followed. Physiotherapy guidance for RSA and HA developed through consensus by the British Elbow and Shoulder Society physiotherapists for the purposes of this trial will be provided to all trial centres. The guidance recommends supervised physiotherapy with the aim of gradually increasing range of motion and function. Due to the biomechanics of RSA and the increased risk of dislocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], internal rotation (i.e., hand behind back movement) is avoided following RSA to protect the joint until clinician review (at around 6 weeks).</p>
                <p id="Par67">Perioperative care provided to participants will be recorded; however, there is no standardisation of perioperative care, in line with the pragmatic nature of PROFHER-2. Perioperative care is defined as the period from start of anaesthesia to the discharge of the patient from the ward following surgery.</p>

As RSA is more extensive and expensive, it would be essential for RSA to be superior to HA by at least five OSS points to justify its use. Surgical intervention carries higher risks and costs compared to non-surgical treatment and therefore looking for a larger difference in OSS of 6 points would be appropriate to justify the use of surgical treatment over non-surgical treatment {van Kampen}. Hence, a mean difference of five OSS points will be sought between the two surgical arms and six OSS points between each surgical arm and non-surgical treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par81">Assuming a standard deviation of 12, 90% power and 5% two-sided statistical significance, 320 participants are required to power all three group comparisons. Assuming 15% attrition over 24 months, the total recruitment target is 380 (152 RSA, 152 HA, 76 NS — figures initially using a 2:2:1 ratio (HA:RSA:NS)). Included in this sample are patients who are allocated 1:1 to one of the two surgery arms only (i.e. patients who require general anaesthetic for fracture dislocation reduction). The proportion of participants requiring general anaesthesia to reduce an associated joint dislocation was monitored as part of the pilot phase and was consistently found to be higher than anticipated (approximately 35% at the end of the pilot phase, compared to the expected 5%). As such an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 replaced the previous allocation ratio of 2:2:1 for participants randomised to all three arms (where there is no associated dislocation that needs general anaesthesia for reduction). This was implemented on 12th October 2020 to maintain power for all planned comparisons, and the initial sample size target remained unchanged.</p>

                <p id="Par93">Also, there is some evidence to suggest that contacting participants in advance of sending a questionnaire (pre-notification) may help to increase response rates; however, the evidence is not of high certainty and therefore additional studies are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

There were no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria. It was intended for the SWAT to run until the end of the study follow-up; however, it ended early on 30th April 2022. The decision to stop the SWAT was based on the steer from public contributors on the perceived benefit of maintaining participant engagement and to ensure a high response rate to the 24-month questionnaire with all participants in the trial and not just those randomised to receive the intervention. Participants were randomised to the SWAT using a 1:1 ratio (pre-notification newsletter and cover letter, or to receive neither). Generation of the allocation sequence was undertaken independently by a researcher not involved with the follow-up of participants.

                  <p id="Par111">Self-reported questionnaires and hospital forms will be used to evaluate resource use and associated costs over the follow-up of the trial. Cost components will compromise hospital stay (initial and subsequent inpatient episodes, outpatient hospital visits and A&amp;E hospital admissions) and primary care consultations (e.g. GP, nurse and physiotherapy). An accurate record of procedures at the hospital level (e.g. centres in the trial) will be put in place to record per patient information (e.g. surgical procedures, complications related to the surgical intervention, and other medical complications). Costs relating to surgical procedures will be based on time in theatre, staff time, consumables and devices, and nights in hospital after the procedure. These data will be collected via a form that will be specifically designed for this trial. Similarly, physiotherapy treatment logs will be completed by physiotherapists providing patient care. Cost components for health resource use will be derived from established national costing sources such as NHS Reference Costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], PSSRU Unit costs of health and social care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and the British National Formulary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Unit costs will be multiplied by resource use to obtain a total cost for each patient.</p>
                  <p id="Par112">The primary outcome for the economic analysis will be the additional cost per quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY). Value for money will therefore be estimated in terms of cost per QALY following an intention-to-treat approach using EQ-5D-5L data. The EQ-5D-5L will be collected at Baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months’ follow-up. The overall difference in EQ-5D index scores between the two arms will be examined through regression methods, consistent with the model selected in the statistical analysis. The EQ-5D health states will be valued using the mapping function developed by van Hout et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and following the NICE position statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] QALYs will be calculated by plotting the utility scores at each of the three time points and estimating the area under the curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. A discount rate will be applied to all costs and QALYs accrued after 12 months at a rate of 3.5% per annum in line with NICE guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par113">For the analysis, regression methods will be used to allow for differences in prognostic variables. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net-benefit statistics will be calculated. The pattern of missing data will be analysed and handled by means of multiple imputation (MI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. A range of sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of the results under different scenarios, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In case of positive results of the trial, we will recommend that costs and outcomes will be extrapolated and modelled over a longer time horizon than captured by the trial (e.g. lifetime of the patient).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par140">The PROFHER-2 trial is designed to provide a robust answer to guide the treatment of patients aged 65 or over who sustain three and four proximal humeral fractures with regard to the clinical and cost-effectiveness of RSA vs HA, and surgery vs non-surgical treatment. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, recruitment to PROFHER-2 was paused between March 2020 and August 2020. In view of the challenges posed by subsequent recovery of services, resumption of recruitment to the trial was slower than anticipated. With approval from the funder, the overall study timeline was therefore extended, and the timeline for completion of trial recruitment was extended from May 2021 to June 2023. During trial conduct, it was apparent that a higher proportion of participants (35%) had an associated joint dislocation than anticipated at the start of the trial (10%). That led to a higher number of participants randomised to the surgical comparisons (RSA vs HA). Therefore, in order to maintain power for all planned comparisons, the allocation ratio was changed to 1:1:1 (RSA:HA:NS). Other key amendments to the protocol approved by the Research Ethics Committee include allowing remote follow-up of patients by sites where necessary, which was in response to the changes in clinical services imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this trial should provide high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice in the use of arthroplasty for patients aged 65 years or over who sustain more complex (3- and 4-part) proximal humeral fractures.</p>
