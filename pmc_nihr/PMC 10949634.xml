                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a programme of exercise and education and the most effective treatment for the symptoms and disability associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the benefits of PR are limited by poor uptake and completion. This trial will determine whether using trained volunteer lay health workers, called “PR buddies,” improves uptake and completion of PR and is cost-effective. This trial protocol outlines the methods for evaluating effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The IMPROVE trial is a pragmatic, open, cluster randomised controlled trial planned in 38 PR services across England and Wales. PR services will be randomised to either intervention arm—offering support from PR buddies to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—or to usual care as the control arm. PR staff in trial sites randomised to the intervention arm will receive training in recruiting and training PR buddies. They will deliver training to volunteers, recruited from among people who have recently completed PR in their service. The 3-day PR-buddy training programme covers communication skills, confidentiality, boundaries of the PR-buddy role and behaviour change techniques to help patients overcome obstacles to attending PR. An internal pilot will test the implementation of the trial in eight sites (four intervention sites and four in control arm). The primary outcome of the trial is the uptake and completion of PR. A process evaluation will investigate the acceptability of the intervention to patients, PR staff and the volunteer PR buddies, and intervention fidelity. We will also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Improving outcomes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and access to PR are priorities for the UK National Health Service (NHS) in its long-term plan. The trial hypothesis is that volunteer PR buddies, who are recruited and trained by local PR teams, are an effective and cost-effective way to improve the uptake and completion rates of PR. The trial is pragmatic, since it will test whether the intervention can be incorporated into NHS PR services. Information obtained in this trial may be used to influence policy on the use of PR buddies in PR and other similar services in the NHS.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p id="Par23">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most common chronic lung disease caused by smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than a million people in the United Kingdom (UK) live with the condition, with a higher prevalence typically reported in more deprived areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The symptoms of COPD include cough, breathlessness and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A severe exacerbation of COPD symptoms is a key cause of attendances at Accident and Emergency departments and of hospital admissions in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. COPD is also the third most common cause of death in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par24">The most effective treatment for the symptoms and disability associated with COPD is pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. PR is a prescribed exercise-based treatment programme which has been identified by NICE (The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) as one of the “five fundamentals of COPD care” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Structured group classes include physical exercise and information on self-management. Social interaction is a notable element in almost all services. The effectiveness of PR in improving symptoms, quality of life and exercise capacity in people living with COPD has been demonstrated conclusively in a longstanding Cochrane review now close [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. More recently, PR has also been associated with improved survival following discharge from hospital after a COPD exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par25">Despite strong evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of PR, patients likely to benefit from it often do not receive a referral by healthcare professionals or do not join the programme. In an audit of PR services in England and Wales in 2015, the annual number of referrals of patients with COPD to 240 services was estimated to be 68,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This equated to approximately 5% of the estimated 1.3 million people with symptomatic COPD. If patients were referred every 5 years (annual referral is desirable), the rate of referral of appropriate people with COPD would be still only 25%. In subsequent audits, 62% of the eligible patients who were referred to PR joined the programme, and 65% of those who joined the programme completed PR, an overall rate of uptake and completion of 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society have recommended a more collaborative approach between clinicians, patients, and funders to improve the delivery of PR within healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">The barriers to attending or completing PR are well understood. The reasons for poor rates of uptake include a perceived lack of benefit by patients and uncertainty about its effectiveness by those making the referral, travel issues, inconvenient timing and disruption to valued routines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Reasons such as being a current smoker and having comorbidities, particularly depression, are associated with non-completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A qualitative study of patients who had recently completed PR reported that smoking was associated with feelings of unworthiness to participate in the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Previous interventions that have sought to improve uptake and completion of PR have included computerised reminders, provision of a patient information or care manual, education for clinicians and financial incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In 2009, Harris et al. showed in a before and after study that providing patients with a manual summarising evidence of effective care led to an 18% improvement in PR enrolment in the most socio-economically disadvantage group, compared to usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Zwar et al. showed increased uptake of PR among patients with COPD who received care for their COPD at home by a nurse (31.1% compared to 9.6% for the control group) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">Lay health workers are described as “any health worker carrying out functions related to healthcare delivery, trained in some way in the context of the intervention, and having no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree” and can be involved in either paid or voluntary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Lay health workers have been used predominantly in low- and middle-income countries where their role has been to complement local health services especially where there is underfunding of conventional health services. There is evidence that using lay health workers improves uptake of clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but they are not widely used in the NHS. In the United States of America, lay health workers commonly work as patient navigators and play a range of other roles such as supporting patient self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Adhikari et al. have published the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial of female volunteers in the diagnosis and management of COPD in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the context of the trial proposed here in the UK, lay health workers are an example of reverse innovation, introducing into high-income countries an innovation that was first devised in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">The IMPROVE trial seeks to use lay health workers to support patients with COPD who are referred for PR to help them overcome barriers that could stop them from attending the programme. In this intervention, we train the lay health workers to use selected behaviour change techniques to overcome these barriers. In the trial, lay health workers are called “PR buddies,” a term preferred by our patient advisors. In a feasibility study of using lay health workers to improve the uptake and completion of PR, the feasibility of recruitment and training of PR-buddy volunteers was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. PR buddies were successfully used in supporting patients and the fidelity of the intervention was shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Among the advantages of using PR buddies are the shared social backgrounds, and shared personal experiences of the health issue among patients and PR buddies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p id="Par30">The primary objective of the IMPROVE trial is to assess the effectiveness of the intervention using volunteer PR buddies trained by PR teams to improve completion of PR in patients with COPD. The working hypothesis for the trial is that PR experienced volunteer PR buddies, recruited and trained by PR staff to support COPD patients newly referred to PR, will improve uptake and completion of PR in comparison with usual care.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p id="Par44">IMPROVE is a prospective, open, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled clinical trial, with an internal pilot, with clustering at site level. Sites will be PR services. The feasibility study suggested that the recruitment and training of PR buddies and the recruitment of patient participants are feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, the trial is in equipoise about the effectiveness of the intervention. Trial sites will be randomised 1:1 to either PR-buddy service or to continue delivering care as usual.</p>

                <title>Study setting</title>
                <p id="Par45">The IMPROVE trial will be conducted in PR centres in England and Wales. It will recruit PR services (sites) being run either by NHS staff, or by private companies contracted by the NHS. These may be community or hospital-based services. Potential sites are being identified through the list of sites participating in the National Respiratory Audit Programme and through the Clinical Research Network and regional PR networks. Each site is then contacted by a member of the IMPROVE research team. There will be an internal pilot in eight sites; the target is for the main trial to have a further 30 sites making 38 sites in total.

                <title>Consenting participants</title>
                <p id="Par105">PR-staff research participants will be in the intervention arm of the trial. They will give written informed consent after the site has been randomised. Sufficient time will be allowed for the invited staff to read the participant information sheet and to have the opportunity to ask questions. Consent will be taken by a member of the IMPROVE research team on a video call. Volunteers who would like to become PR buddies will give written informed consent in-person during the first day of the PR buddies’ training having previously been sent the participant information sheet. Consent will be taken by a trained member of PR staff or a member of the IMPROVE research team after the PR buddy has had a chance to ask questions.</p>
                <p id="Par106">Patient participants will give their consent to local National Health Service (NHS) research delivery staff or Clinical Research Network (CRN) staff. Patient participant consent may be taken in-person or remotely through a phone or video call, depending on individual preference. All potential participants will be sent the patient information sheet and the consent form in advance of consent meetings. After having an opportunity to ask questions, if the patient consents they will sign and date the consent form. In in-person consent interviews, the research staff member will countersign and date the form and give a copy to the patient. Where consent is given remotely, two methods may be used. The patient may sign and date the consent form and send it to the research staff member who will then sign and date it and send a copy to the patient. The alternative method is for the research staff member to audio-record the patient giving verbal consent by telephone and to securely store the recording. The research staff member should sign the consent form and send a copy to the patient. [Communication from the Preston Research Ethics Committee, 19 April 2023].</p>
                <p id="Par107">As part of the trial process evaluation, some patient participants and some PR staff will be invited to a qualitative interview, and some PR buddies will be invited to participate in focus groups to provide feedback on their experience of participating in the trial. Participants consenting to give one-to-one interviews or to participate in a focus group will additionally consent to these interactions being recorded and transcribed. Consent to participate in a qualitative interview or focus group will be taken at the same time as written informed consent for participation in the trial as described above.</p>

              <title>Intervention</title>
              <p id="Par109">Randomisation will be at the PR-service level. Rates for completion of PR for patient participants who receive PR-buddy support in services in the intervention arm will be compared to those for patient participants in PR services randomised to offer care as usual. Randomisation at the level of sites is essential to prevent contamination of patient participants not receiving the PR-buddy intervention by those who are receiving it or who have received it. For this reason, the comparison will be between sites and not between individual patient participants. Recruitment of patient participants will be identical in both arms of the trial. Patient participants will not be aware of the outcome of the PR service randomisation at the time of recruitment. The site target for recruitment of patient participants, at least 36, will be the same for all sites.</p>
              <p id="Par110">The IMPROVE PR-buddy intervention has five elements: PR-staff training, PR-buddy recruitment, PR-buddy training, patient-participant support by the PR buddies, and PR-buddy management and support by the PR staff. A ‘train-the trainer’ approach will be used, whereby designated PR staff in services in the intervention arm of the trial will be trained in the setting up and running of a PR-buddy service. Using this model moves the burden of training multiple groups of PR buddies from the IMPROVE research team to individual PR services. This will help to provide a more realistic assessment of the intervention as it would be implemented in ‘real-world’ practice and will also facilitate implementation across the NHS if the trial outcome is positive.</p>
              <p id="Par111">The PR-buddy training will be informed by the COM-B model and include selected behaviour change techniques. The COM-B model for behaviour change proposes that there are 3 components to any behaviour: capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. PR buddies sharing their own positive experiences of PR with patient participants will be a central element of the PR-buddy intervention. Manuals for the training for PR staff and the training of PR buddies will be freely available for services in the NHS only after completion of the trial.</p>

                <p id="Par118">If a PR staff member is unable to attend any part of their training, an alternative session will be provided, if possible, at another training session. If a staff member is unable to continue in the trial, another PR staff member who has attended training will take over the role. If a PR buddy is unable to attend any part of the training, the component(s) missed will be noted and, where possible, catch-up sessions will be arranged. If missed training sessions cannot be caught up, the volunteer(s) will be signposted to other volunteering opportunities.</p>
                <p id="Par119">Following training, if a PR buddy is unable to continue supporting patients the patients will be allocated a different PR buddy. If a PR buddy asks to be withdrawn from support of a particular patient participant, or a patient participant asks to be withdrawn from receiving support from a particular PR buddy, the party seeking to be withdrawn will be interviewed by a PR staff member to assess the issue. If there are no concerns about the behaviour of the other party, then the staff member will recommend that new PR-buddy support or a new patient participant will be found to replace the withdrawing party.</p>

Each remote live day of PR-staff training and at least 1 session (1/4 of a day) of the PR-buddy training at each site will be recorded by the IMPROVE research team to enable more objective assessment of fidelity of delivery of training. A 20% sample will be analysed for content of delivery by listening back to of these recordings and comparing them to the relevant component of the training manual and slide deck. Training reviews will be used both for PR staff and PR buddies to assess fidelity of receipt of the training.</p>
                <p id="Par121">Using dedicated trial phones, PR buddies will record the contacts they have with the patients they support. Recordings will be collected once a month by the research team. Intervention fidelity of PR-buddy support will be assessed by listening to a randomly selected sample of the recordings (10% of the recordings made by 2 PR buddies per site). This assessment will focus on analysing delivery style (use of communications skills training) and on the use of taught behaviour change techniques by the PR buddies. Analysis will be based on a coding framework developed and used in the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Recordings will be coded independently by two coders and discrepancies in coding then resolved by discussion.</p>
                <p id="Par122">Any concomitant care is permitted. It is not anticipated that provisions will be required for post-trial care. This trial has been assessed as low risk. The trial co-sponsors have agreed that any harm resulting from the trial will be the responsibility of the main sponsor, King’s College London. King’s College London will provide indemnity for the duration of the trial.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par123">The primary outcome is completion of PR by each individual patient participant, summarised as a proportion for each trial site. Standard PR treatment usually consists of a pre-PR assessment, twelve classes over 6 to 8 weeks and a final assessment. Uptake is defined as attendance at the pre-PR assessment; completion is defined as attendance of 75% or more of the planned PR sessions—usually at least 9 out of 12 sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par130">The process evaluation will include collection of process data (e.g. relating to training delivery, contacts between PR buddies and supported patients), qualitative interviews with some of the trial participants (PR staff and patient participants), focus groups with some PR buddies and field diaries to capture reflections of researchers throughout the implementation period. Assessment of the fidelity of the intervention delivery of patient support by PR buddies is as described above. We will also perform an economic evaluation to examine whether the intervention is potentially cost-effective compared to the current standard care alone, from the perspectives of the NHS and personal social services and the society.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par132">Based on the 2017 PR audit of the Royal College of Physicians the mean completion proportion over 182 PR sites in England was 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sites with a completion proportion of 55% or less were considered “sub-optimal performers”; the mean completion proportion among these sites was estimated at 32%. Due to regression to the mean, it is likely that these “sub-optimal” performing sites may perform better the following year, and so the control group completion proportion is likely to be between 32 and 40%.</p>
                <p id="Par133">Assuming an overall completion proportion of 40% in the control group, 36 sites (18 per arm) would be required to detect a 40% relative increase in completion proportion to 56% with 90% power, assuming an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.056 and 30 patient participants per site. The choice of ICC = 0.056 was made on basis of the literature and recommendations based on similar interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Where interventions include training of health professionals, or other personnel who will deliver the intervention while the outcome is to be measured on patients, an ICC around 0.05 has been widely used. Assuming a completion proportion of 32%, the same number of sites would also be required to detect an increase from 32 to 48%, assuming the same power and ICC. Therefore, after accounting for one site per arm dropping out, a total of 38 sites (19 per arm) would be required. After accounting for six (20%) patient participants dropping out, 36 patient participants would be required in each site.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p id="Par134">At time of writing (October 2023), site recruitment is underway. The trial is being promoted in PR services across England and Wales through emails, phone calls, presentations at regional PR-network meetings, meetings with local Clinical Research Networks and conferences. Services interested in becoming a trial site are asked to complete an expression of interest form. PR staff in eligible sites are invited to an information meeting. The expression of interest form and information meeting are used to ascertain if the PR service meets the site eligibility criteria. The IMPROVE trial manager liaises with the local NHS research and development department in relation to assessment of capacity and capability and to get a site agreement in place. A site initiation visit will be held then. The site will be randomised then. All sites will nominate a site Principal Investigator to take overall responsibility for the leadership and conduct of the research at their site.</p>
                <p id="Par135">In sites randomised to the intervention PR staff nominated to undertake the PR-staff training will be consented as trial participants by IMPROVE research staff. Eligible PR buddies will be recruited by the trained PR staff, who will write to COPD patients who have completed PR in their service within the last year. All interested respondents will be screened for eligibility in a phone call. Those considered eligible will then be invited to interview. All those who successfully complete the interview will be invited to attend the PR-buddy training at that site. Consent will be obtained from PR buddies at the first training day.</p>
                <p id="Par136">Patient participants referred for PR will be informed about the trial at the time they are offered a pre-PR assessment appointment. Recruitment and consent of patient participants will be completed by local NHS research delivery staff or local Clinical Research Network staff who are blinded to the outcome of randomisation for the PR service.</p>

                <title>Assignment of interventions: allocation</title>
                <p id="Par137">During the internal pilot, block randomisation will be used. It will be applied to 8 internal pilot sites and will be carried out by the King’s Clinical Trials Unit (KCTU) using specifically designed software. Randomisation data will be held by the KCTU on a King’s College London (KCL) server.</p>
                <p id="Par138">Minimisation randomisation will take place in the main trial also at the level of research (PR) sites. It will be carried out online by the KCTU, also using specifically designed software. Randomisation data will be held by KCTU on a KCL server. Factors in minimisation will be as follows: the workplace setting of the PR service (whether it is a stand-alone PR service or integrated within a respiratory service team or community team); site situation in an urban or rural setting; and delivery of the service in cohorts or as a rolling programme (in cohorts all patients start PR at the same time, in rolling programmes patients can join the programme at any time).</p>
                <p id="Par139">The allocation sequence will be generated by KCTU. IMPROVE research staff will enter the details of the participating sites into the online minimisation randomisation system. The site will then be allocated to either the intervention or control arm of the trial. Back-up telephone access will be available where randomisation cannot be done online. A validated password website using a secure server will ensure concealment.</p>

                <title>Assignment of interventions: blinding</title>
                <p id="Par140">PR staff and PR buddies will know to which arm of the intervention their PR service has been allocated. Patient participants will be blinded until they consent to participate, to ensure their decision to participate is not influenced by whether they will be offered the support of a PR buddy. Staff taking consent from patient participants will not be based in the PR service or the IMPROVE team. These staff will be blinded to the outcome of randomisation until the end of patient-participant recruitment in that site.</p>
                <p id="Par141">Blinding is not related to treatment allocation, but it is important to patient-participant consent. There is no situation in which unblinding would be required for patient safety. Any instances of unblinding of the local NHS research delivery staff or Clinical Research Network taking patient-participant consent will be recorded.</p>

These researchers will attend 2 out of the 3 days of PR-buddy training to assist with completion of trial-related paperwork, such as consenting PR buddies and completion of volunteer agreements. The link researcher will visit intervention sites monthly to collect recorded phone data and to link with the PR team regarding any other research management issues.</p>
                <p id="Par150">PR buddies will attend monthly meetings at which they will be offered ongoing support from PR staff. The support will include checking on interactions with patient participants, identifying any patient participants who the PR buddy is having difficulty supporting and providing remedies, sharing experience and solutions to common problems. PR buddies who withdraw while they are supporting patients will be asked to stay in contact with these patients until they end of their PR. If they are not able to do this, then the patients will be reassigned to another PR buddy by PR staff. Patient participants who wish to withdraw will be invited to complete the follow-up data collection questionnaires before leaving the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par151">Any PR staff or PR buddies who choose not to or are unable to continue until the end of the trial will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview as part of the process evaluation.

Patient-level costs collected will cover meetings attended and resource use consequences for primary and secondary care, and personal social services, as well as out-of-pocket expenses (e.g. travel) borne by patients. Provider costs will be valued using national unit prices where possible to facilitate generalisability followed by published literature or if unavailable, local costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

Findings will also be presented at events organised by special interest groups, seminars organised by the NHS, and events organised by patient groups. Results will also be disseminated via online platforms including the trial website.</p>

              <p id="Par179">The IMPROVE trial will use a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design with mixed methods, nested process, and economic evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This trial has the potential to improve rates of uptake and completion of PR, which is the most effective treatment known to improve symptoms and quality of life for people with COPD.</p>
              <p id="Par180">The IMPROVE trial will use a train-the-trainer model, whereby PR staff will be trained by the researchers to subsequently train volunteer PR buddies (specially trained lay health workers). Although volunteers of this kind have been used in other healthcare settings, this will be the first time (apart from the trial feasibility study) that volunteer lay health workers are used in pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD. If successful, this intervention will have the potential to be rolled out across the NHS.</p>
              <p id="Par181">The trial includes a nested process evaluation to inform the implementation of the intervention if the trial yields positive findings, or to inform the interpretation of findings if otherwise. The economic evaluation will be the first of a trial using PR conducted in the UK since 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par182">The NHS Long Term Plan aims to increase access to PR over the next 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. As services expand to meet this target, the IMPROVE intervention has the potential to help optimise the benefits of PR for patients with COPD by increasing the number of patients who are successfully completing the programme. This, in turn, should lead to benefits on quality of life, exercise tolerance and more effective self-management of COPD. The intervention has been designed so that it can be delivered feasibly by volunteers familiar with PR and who are trained and supported by PR staff. If the trial shows positive results, the intervention could be implemented by PR services throughout the NHS. The PR-buddy model also has the potential to be used in other settings including cardiac rehabilitation and rehabilitation in long COVID services.</p>

There is no independent trial management committee for this trial as the main outcome measure will be analysed using relatively simple statistical techniques. The principal outcome measure is the completion rate of pulmonary rehabilitation in each research site, also described as a cluster. This is a low risk trial and outcome will have no implications for individual participants that would lead to early closure.</p>
