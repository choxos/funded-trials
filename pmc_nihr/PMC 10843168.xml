                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The OPTimisE intervention was developed to address uncertainty regarding the most effective physiotherapy treatment strategy for people with Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy (LET).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>To assess the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating whether the OPTimisE intervention is superior to usual physiotherapy treatment for adults with LET.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>A mixed-methods multi-centred, parallel pilot and feasibility RCT, conducted in three outpatient physiotherapy departments in the UK.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Patients were independently randomised 1:1 in mixed blocks, stratified by site, to the OPTimisE intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed using pre-defined feasibility progression criteria.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>50 patients were randomised (22 Female, 28 Male), mean age 48 years (range 27–75). Consent rate was 71% (50/70), fidelity to intervention 89% (16/18), attendance rate in the OPTimisE group 82% (55/67) vs 85% (56/66) in usual care, outcome measure completion 81% (39/48) at six-month follow-up. There were no related adverse events. Patients and physiotherapists reported that the OPTimisE intervention was acceptable but suggested improvements to the trial design. 49 patients were recruited from physiotherapy referrals vs one from primary care records. Outcome measure return rates were higher when completed online (74%) compared to postal questionnaire (50%). Exploratory analysis showed improvements in both groups over time.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>It is methodologically feasible to conduct a fully powered RCT comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the OPTimisE intervention versus usual physiotherapy treatment. Considering the similar improvements observed in both groups, careful consideration is needed regarding the priority research question to be addressed in future research.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0030">Lateral elbow tendinopathy (LET), also known as Tennis Elbow, is a common cause of elbow pain affecting sleep and basic daily activities, as well as sports, work and hobbies (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sanders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Keijsers et al., 2019</xref>). Work absence due to LET was estimated to cost the UK economy £27million based upon data from 2012 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hopkins et al., 2016</xref>). For many, symptoms may resolve over time but 10% of control group participants in clinical trials failed to achieve much improvement or full resolution after one year (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ikonen et al., 2022</xref>). Physiotherapy is recommended if symptoms persist after six weeks. (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</xref>) Evidence from two high-quality trials suggests that whilst multi-modal physiotherapy does not influence the long-term outcome for people with LET, it results in faster recovery in the short term (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Coombes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bisset et al., 2006</xref>). These studies were conducted between 2002 and 2010, with patients receiving eight treatments over a six to eight week period. Such treatment intensity is challenging to deliver in publicly-funded healthcare systems and considered to be over-burdensome by some patients (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). Wide variations in current physiotherapy treatment provision have been identified that do not align with research evidence (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). Treatments including ultrasound therapy, massage, acupuncture and shockwave therapy are still used in clinical practice without scientific justification (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Long et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Buchbinder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bisset and Vicenzino, 2015</xref>). There is therefore a need to streamline physiotherapy provision, ensuring that treatment protocols are efficient, evidence-based and practical to use.</p>
              <p id="p0035">The OPTimisE intervention was designed in consultation with patients and clinicians to reflect the current evidence base in a way that could be implemented into real-world clinical practice. We combined research evidence with the opinions of patients, physiotherapists with a special interest in LET and physiotherapy service managers, to form a consensus on what the intervention should comprise (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). The OPTimisE intervention has been previously described in full and consists of three elements: condition-specific and general health advice that addresses modifiable risk factors, supported by high-quality printed and online resources; an exercise regimen that empowers the patient to progress or regress their rehabilitation based upon limits of pain deemed acceptable by individual patients; and the provision of a counter-force orthosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>). Prior to implementation, the OPTimisE intervention needed to be tested in clinical practice to establish firstly, whether it was deliverable and secondly, whether it was effective. We therefore aimed in this study to test the feasibility of conducting a future, fully-powered randomised controlled trial that would evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the OPTimisE intervention versus usual physiotherapy treatment.</p>

                <p id="p0110">We piloted two methods of participant identification: screening of General Practice (GP) computer records and screening of referrals at physiotherapy sites. Those patients identified from GP records were sent a self-screening checklist and invitation letter to contact the trial team if they wished to be considered. Their GP was then asked to refer them to their local physiotherapy site. All physiotherapy referrals for elbow pain were screened at one of three National Health Service (NHS) physiotherapy sites, in either Birmingham, Derby or Sheffield. Patients deemed potentially eligible were sent a patient information sheet (PIS) then telephoned by the site principal investigator (PI) to check eligibility and invite for clinical assessment screening. Inclusion criteria: adults aged 18 or over; physiotherapist-diagnosed tennis elbow which included pain on palpation of the common extensor origin and on gripping; either a positive Cozen's, Mills', or Maudsley's test (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Zwerus et al., 2018</xref>). Exclusion criteria: a recent history of significant trauma to the affected limb, e.g. a fall on an outstretched hand; previous diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis or gout; previous diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the affected elbow; neurological symptoms in the affected limb correlating with onset of elbow pain, e.g. loss of sensation in the hand; co-existing neck pain and stiffness that started at a similar time to the elbow symptoms; inability to understand English or lacking capacity for informed consent; currently enrolled in another health-related research trial.</p>

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="p0120">We allocated participants to receive either the OPTimisE intervention or usual physiotherapy care. We did not standardise usual care in this pragmatic trial but we recorded treatments received by participants, to allow comparison with the OPTimisE intervention. Physiotherapists providing usual care treatment had no restrictions on the treatments they could offer. Physiotherapists provided treatments for one intervention arm only, to minimise contamination. Those providing usual care did not receive training in the OPTimisE intervention.</p>
                <p id="p0125">The OPTimisE intervention consisted of three elements: condition-specific and general health advice, supported by printed and online resources; a progressive exercise regime working within limits of pain deemed acceptable by individual patients; and the provision of a counter-force orthosis. Exercises were progressed when the existing exercise was no longer painful, or regressed if the exercise provoked unacceptable levels of pain. The OPTimisE Intervention Handbook is supplied as a supplementary file, providing full details of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="p0130">At the first appointment, those in the OPTimisE arm were provided with a Patient Manual containing advice/education material, exercise instructions and a password to access online resources. Advice and education topics were then discussed with the physiotherapist. Participants were supplied with an orthosis (Epi-Hit® Classic), as a means of providing short-term symptomatic relief, and instructed how to fit it correctly, then taught an exercise regimen that they could progress or regress based upon their symptom response. Follow-up appointments, to review progress, discuss advice/education topics further and review/adjust exercises, were arranged at the discretion of the physiotherapist but guidance was that appointments should be spaced at least four weeks apart, as recommended by patients during the intervention design. Appointments could be face-to-face, online or by telephone.</p>

For the grip-strength measurements, we piloted the use of an electronic grip-measuring device (Squegg™, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mysquegg.com" id="intref0010">https://mysquegg.com</ext-link>) that connects to an application on the participant's smartphone or tablet. The Squegg is a US Food and Drug Administration approved dynamometer. We gave participants in the OPTimisE group a Squegg after randomisation, to capture grip-strength data at all time points. However, to ensure that usual care participants did not use it as part of their treatment, they were only sent the Squegg by post in advance of their final six-month follow-up questionnaire. Grip measurements were taken in neutral forearm rotation, with the elbow at 90°. The mean value was taken from three measurements.</p>
                <p id="p0145">Participants were given the choice of receiving questionnaires by post or online, using the Amplitude Pro-One™ system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://amplitude-clinical.com/" id="intref0015">https://amplitude-clinical.com/</ext-link>) and were sent questionnaires at 6-weeks, 12-weeks and 6-months post-randomisation. We telephoned or sent reminders by email to participants using the postal service if they failed to return their questionnaires after two weeks. The Amplitude system sent automated email and SMS text reminders to users of the online system after one and two weeks if data was not returned. We amended the protocol mid-way through the trial to allow the site PI to telephone participants who had not returned questionnaires, to collect minimum data about adverse events and the primary outcome (PRTEE) responses. We implemented this at 6-month follow-up, due to low data returns at 6-weeks and 12-weeks. We asked participants in the OPTimisE intervention group to complete a daily exercise diary to collect data about exercise adherence.</p>

The categorical variables (e.g. sex) were reported with frequencies &amp; percentages. Similarly, we analysed data descriptively to explore the outcome measure scores in the intervention and control groups at baseline and follow-up, to explore changes in LET health status over time. The study was not powered for analysis of results between groups. We also assessed external responsiveness to change of PROMs using Spearman's rank correlation, with GPE-11 scores as the anchor. SPSS Statistics software (version 27) was used for the analysis.</p>

We followed this up by telephone or email to gain provisional consent and organise a mutually convenient time. Similarly, physiotherapists involved in the trial were approached at the end of recruitment. Interviews were conducted face-to-face, by telephone or video-conference via Microsoft Teams, at the participant's preference. We audio-recorded all interviews and asked participants to formally consent verbally after reading a consent form. Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim using an online service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.universitytranscriptions.co.uk/" id="intref0020">https://www.universitytranscriptions.co.uk/</ext-link>). All transcriptions were checked for accuracy and any uncertainties were resolved by relistening to the original recording. Anonymised interview transcripts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Transcript coding was performed using NVivo 12 software. Interviews continued until data saturation was reached, assessed in terms of ‘informational redundancy’, the point at which additional data no longer offers new insights (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sandelowski and Given, 2008</xref>). Data from the qualitative study were used to assess acceptability from the perspectives of both patients receiving the OPTimisE intervention and physiotherapists delivering it (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). Feedback related to trial processes was used to refine the method of a future fully-powered trial.</p>

Patients in the OPTimisE group attended a mean of 3.1 sessions, compared to 2.3 sessions in the usual care group. Five participants in the OPTimisE intervention group failed to attend their first treatment session, so did not receive the intervention.

                <p id="p0205">Exercise adherence score (median (IQR values)), measured using the EARS questionnaire, at 12 weeks was 15.5 (9.5–21.5) in the OPTimisE group compared to 16 (12–20.75) in the usual care group; at six months 13 (8-21) and 16 (12-23) respectively. Only 6/18 (33%) participants who received the OPTimisE intervention returned their exercise diaries, reporting median adherence of 81% (IQR 74-93).</p>
                <p id="p0210">The review of clinical report forms from the usual care group showed that all patients received basic advice about LET and were taught exercises. Few were provided with advice related to lifestyle factors or modifiable risk factors. Exercises often lacked a clear dosing strategy or progression. Three patients received manual therapy treatment from the physiotherapist and one was taught to perform self-administered manual therapy. No patients were provided with an orthosis, although two patients requested advice on how to fit orthoses that they had previously purchased themselves.</p>
                <p id="p0215">No related adverse events were reported. One participant was involved in a road traffic collision during their period of treatment. They did not sustain serious injuries and were able to continue their trial participation.</p>
                <p id="p0220">From the qualitative interviews, patient and physiotherapist participants both found the OPTimisE intervention to be acceptable and physiotherapists perceived key differences to usual care, related to exercise selection, dose, educational content and provision of the orthosis. The slowing of recruitment after month seven was perceived to be due to a change in referral patterns, with more patients with LET managed by First Contact Practitioners (FCPs)<sup>$</sup>, rather than being referred to outpatient physiotherapy clinics. We identified improvements that could be made to the trial processes to reduce administrative burden, increase support for physiotherapists, improve return rate of outcome questionnaires, and provide language translation to increase accessibility for under-served communities. Details of these findings can be found in a separate publication (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>).<disp-quote id="disp0010"><p>[<sup>$</sup>Footnote: FCPs are primary care healthcare professionals, typically physiotherapists in the context of musculoskeletal conditions, who assess and manage patients instead of a General Practitioner.]</p></disp-quote></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0225">Our results suggest that it is feasible to conduct a full-scale trial to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the OPTimisE intervention compared with usual NHS physiotherapy care. We successfully recruited to target ahead of schedule, but the number of eligible patients identified was lower than predicted based upon site referral data at the planning stage of the project. This was offset by consent rates being far greater (71%) than the conservative feasibility target (25%) set <italic>a priori</italic>. The low eligibility numbers may have been in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and also due to the rollout of FCP services across the English healthcare system. The qualitative interview findings suggest that more patients with LET are being managed in community settings by FCPs rather than being referred to outpatient physiotherapy clinics. The attendance rate at all planned sessions in the OPTimisE intervention group was 82% (55/67 sessions), with five participants not receiving the intervention. This compared to 85% (56/66 sessions) in the usual care group, with two participants not receiving any treatment. The patients interviewed in the qualitative study had positive views with regard to randomisation and did not express strong preferences for their treatment group allocation, however a potential source of bias within the qualitative study is that none of the patients who failed to attend for treatment agreed to be interviewed, despite being approached. It is possible that those who did not attend were dissatisfied with their group allocation resulting in their non-attendance. Alternatively, the wait of 2–8 weeks from consent to receiving their first treatment might have been a factor.</p>
              <p id="p0230">In terms of fidelity, the OPTimisE intervention was delivered as intended to the majority of patients (89%). The pre-defined quantitative criteria for fidelity were binary (i.e. fidelity was achieved or not) but in two cases, fidelity was not achieved because physiotherapists only delivered five of the twelve advice/education topics instead of the six required to satisfy the fidelity criteria. The other remaining criteria, related to exercise prescription and provision of the counterforce brace, were all satisfied.</p>
              <p id="p0235">Of the two patient identification methods, the screening of referrals at physiotherapy clinics was most successful, accounting for 49/50 patients recruited. The database screening at GP practices only generated three expressions of interest, with two of those already identified from referral screening, so this method is unlikely to be worthwhile within a future main trial.</p>
              <p id="p0240">We found that questionnaire returns were low at six-week follow-up (59%). The follow-up questionnaires were sent at time points determined from the date of randomisation. Some patient participants told us in the interviews that they had not returned the questionnaire due to the fact that they had not yet started treatment or only recently started treatment at the time the questionnaire was sent, due to waiting times for initial physiotherapy appointments. Returns increased by 12-week follow-up to 65% but did not meet the feasibility threshold. We introduced a protocol amendment to allow telephone reminders and minimum data collection at this stage which, coupled with the pre-agreed £20 voucher incentive for six-month data return, resulted in an 81% response, surpassing the feasibility threshold.</p>
              <p id="p0245">When we examined the responsiveness of the different PROMs included, the PRTEE measure of function and NRS for pain on gripping showed the highest correlation with patient perceived overall treatment effect. The PRTEE is the recommended primary outcome measure in the core outcome set for LET and the NRS for pain on gripping is recommended for interim use, pending psychometric evaluation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2022b</xref>). Our findings suggest that it has similar external responsiveness to the PRTEE. During the qualitative interviews, patient participants were receptive to the idea of adding a monthly SMS text message asking them to report their level of pain on gripping. They felt that this might act as a reminder that they were still part of the trial and provide additional data regarding how their symptoms might fluctuate over time (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). The responsiveness analysis suggests that this would be an appropriate way to monitor treatment effect. The qualitative study also identified that the questionnaires were too time-consuming and needed to be shortened. We included two psychological measures: the TSK-11 measure of fear of movement and PSEQ questionnaire to capture pain self-efficacy, and found that the PSEQ was more highly correlated with treatment outcome. Similarly, we included both pain-free grip-strength and maximum grip-strength but the former was more highly correlated with treatment outcome. This is consistent with previous studies comparing the two methods (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Macdermid and Silbernagel, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the TSK-11 and maximum grip-strength could be removed from a future main trial.</p>
              <p id="p0250">We piloted a method of grip-strength self-measurement using the Squegg device. Grip-strength data were provided in 77% of questionnaire returns, suggesting not all participants could/would use the device. Qualitative data suggested that some participants relied upon the assistance of family to use the device and one person was unable to connect it to their smartphone (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). A previous UK study that used an analogue spring balance for similar self-measurement, reported 73% data return suggesting that other factors were involved, rather than the choice of device.</p>
              <p id="p0255">Adherence to exercise remains a challenge in physiotherapy trials and is difficult to measure (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mallett et al., 2020</xref>). The daily exercise diary that we piloted was only returned by a third of participants, so failed to provide meaningful data. The EARS questionnaire provided a complete dataset from questionnaires returned, so would be the preferred method of assessment of exercise adherence in a main trial.</p>
              <p id="p0260">Although the focus of this pilot and feasibility trial was not on between-group differences (and we did not conduct statistical tests to compare outcomes), the descriptive analysis of the data showed improvements in both groups in health outcomes over 6 months. In some outcomes, the trend was towards greater improvement in the usual care group than the intervention group for disability and perceived overall treatment effect, which was not expected. This may be explained by the usual care provided by the research-active sites involved in the trial being of higher quality than that provided by non-research-active centres more generally. Whilst a fully-powered future RCT would help ascertain whether the intervention is more clinically- or cost-effective than usual care, a future trial using the same intervention approach is unlikely to be desirable given the results of this pilot. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of LET trials including placebo or wait-and-see controls suggested that following enrolment in a clinical trial, patients experience improvements over time without any active treatment, regardless of symptom duration prior to enrolment (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ikonen et al., 2022</xref>). It is important to note that the four included studies that were described as wait-and-see controls still included clinical assessment, a diagnosis of LET and provision of reassurance and advice. This may explain why improvements were seen in patients with longstanding symptoms after enrolment in research. Our qualitative interviews highlighted that patients were reluctant to follow self-help advice until they had received a diagnosis from a healthcare professional, reinforcing this hypothesis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). Careful consideration is therefore needed in terms of next research steps. Future randomised trials might instead want to consider comparing whether a single appointment to assess the patient, confirm diagnosis, reassure and provide self-help advice is non-inferior to usual physiotherapy interventions. The OPTimisE intervention could be adapted to form the self-directed advice and education component for such a trial.</p>
              <p id="p0265">The strengths of this study are that we were able to pilot different methods of participant identification, data collection and outcomes questionnaires, with clear quantitative and qualitative findings that allow us to refine the method of a future main trial. We included patient and public experience in our intervention and trial design. The design was limited by the lack of translation services, potentially resulting in fewer underserved communities being represented, but this could be addressed in the main trial design.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0270">It is methodologically feasible to conduct a fully powered RCT to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the OPTimisE treatment protocol against usual physiotherapy treatment. However, both intervention and usual care groups showed similar improvements over time, questioning the importance of a future comparative main trial. Future research might now consider comparing whether diagnosis, reassurance and comprehensive self-help advice is non-inferior to usual physiotherapy care in terms of cost-effectiveness. Any future trial would need to be adapted to simplify patient identification, shorten outcome questionnaires and include incentivisation, use online data collection by default, add monthly SMS text message outcomes, include minimum data collection by telephone, and incorporate language translation.</p>
