                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Online patient simulations (OPS) are a novel method for teaching clinical reasoning skills to students and could contribute to reducing diagnostic errors. However, little is known about how best to implement and evaluate OPS in medical curricula. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential effects of eCREST — the electronic Clinical Reasoning Educational Simulation Tool.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A feasibility randomised controlled trial was conducted with final year undergraduate students from three UK medical schools in academic year 2016/2017 (cohort one) and 2017/2018 (cohort two). Student volunteers were recruited in cohort one via email and on teaching days, and in cohort two eCREST was also integrated into a relevant module in the curriculum. The intervention group received three patient cases and the control group received teaching as usual; allocation ratio was 1:1. Researchers were blind to allocation. Clinical reasoning skills were measured using a survey after 1 week and a patient case after 1 month.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Across schools, 264 students participated (18.2% of all eligible). Cohort two had greater uptake (183/833, 22%) than cohort one (81/621, 13%). After 1 week, 99/137 (72%) of the intervention and 86/127 (68%) of the control group remained in the study. eCREST improved students’ ability to gather essential information from patients over controls (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1–1.7, <italic>n</italic> = 148). Of the intervention group, most (80/98, 82%) agreed eCREST helped them to learn clinical reasoning skills.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">eCREST was highly acceptable and improved data gathering skills that could reduce diagnostic errors. Uptake was low but improved when integrated into course delivery. A summative trial is needed to estimate effectiveness.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par14">Clinical reasoning — the thought processes used by clinicians during consultations to formulate appropriate questions — is essential for timely diagnosis of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Providing training in clinical reasoning as early as possible in medical education could improve reasoning skills in future doctors, as it provides a scaffold for future learning, and retraining reasoning can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, in undergraduate medical education, there is a lack of explicit teaching on clinical reasoning and the development and delivery of additional high quality and consistent clinical reasoning teaching potentially increases burden on faculty’s already stretched time and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Online patient simulations (OPS) are a specific type of computer-based program that simulates real-life clinical scenarios and could support teaching reasoning skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Theories of cognition suggest that exposure to a large number of different clinical cases via simulations could improve reasoning by restructuring and building more complex mental representations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Learning by experience also facilitates reflection, which helps students to retain skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. OPS can be blended with traditional teaching and offers the opportunity for students to practise data gathering and make diagnoses without burdening patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. OPS also have pragmatic benefits; once developed they are lower in cost to deliver, can be distributed widely, completed remotely, tailored to the learner and frequently updated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, using technology-enhanced learning (TEL) may have its own limitations, such as the potential for lack of engagement from users and faculty, lack of fidelity with real patient consultations and limited TEL skills of faculty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par16">There is currently little empirical evidence to support the use of OPS for assisting clinical reasoning skills teaching. The few studies conducted were not methodologically robust and difficult to interpret due to the poor validity of clinical reasoning outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, most previous studies had limited information on the feasibility of introducing a novel tool into a curriculum and evaluating them using a robust research method, such as a randomised controlled trial (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Understanding the feasibility of testing OPS using an RCT study design is necessary before a summative RCT can estimate effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par17">This research aimed to inform the design of a summative evaluation of an OPS to support teaching of reasoning skills in medical schools. The development of this OPS, the Electronic Clinical Reasoning Educational Simulation Tool (eCREST), is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, eCREST shows three videos of patients (played by actors) presenting to their primary care physician (PCP) with respiratory problems that could be indicative of serious conditions like lung cancer. The student gathers information from the patient, while continually being prompted to review their differential diagnosis. After each case they are asked to make a final differential diagnosis and receive feedback. Patient cases were developed with a small group of real patients who co-wrote the scripts of the vignettes and helped to identify pertinent clinical and behavioural characteristics for the simulated cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="Par22">A multicentre parallel feasibility RCT was conducted across three UK medical schools: A, B and C. We followed the CONSORT statement for reporting pilot or feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Eligible participants were final year undergraduate medical students. The curricula of the medical schools varied. Schools A and B implemented a traditional integrated/systems-based curriculum. School C followed a problem-based learning (PBL) curriculum. Ethical approval was gained from participating medical schools. Participants were recruited from March 2017–February 2018 in two cohorts. Cohort one was recruited after final examinations in April–July 2017, through advertisements in faculty newsletters and lecture ‘shout outs’. Cohort two was recruited prior to final examinations in October 2017–February 2018. School C students were only recruited in cohort two. Cohort two were invited to participate through the faculty online learning management platforms (e.g. Moodle), advertisements on social media, faculty newsletters, and lecture ‘shout outs’. As this was a feasibility trial, a sample size calculation was not required.</p>

Acceptability was measured by retention rates and a survey adapted from previous studies, consisting of six statements on the perceptions of eCREST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Clinical reasoning outcome measures</title>
                  <p id="Par24">Clinical reasoning was measured using the Flexibility in Thinking (FIT) scale of the Diagnostic Thinking Inventory (DTI), which is a self-reported measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The FIT (21 items) measures thought processes used in the diagnostic process, including the ability to generate new ideas, understand alternative outcomes and self-reflect. Higher scores on the FIT sub-scale are indicative of better clinical reasoning skills. The sub-scale has demonstrated validity to detect differences between student and professional reasoning. The internal consistency and test re-test reliability were acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par25">Clinical reasoning was also measured using an observed measure of clinical reasoning by using data from an additional eCREST patient case that students received 1 month after baseline. This measure comprised indicators of three cognitive biases that eCREST sought to influence: the unpacking principle, confirmation bias and anchoring. These were identified by previous clinical reasoning research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The unpacking principle refers to the tendency to not elicit the necessary information to make an informed judgement. Confirmation bias is when a clinician only seeks information to confirm their hypothesis. Anchoring occurs when clinicians stick to an initial hypothesis despite contradictory information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. eCREST prompts students to reflect throughout a consultation and provides feedback that enables them to reflect on their performance afterwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. By reflecting, students would be more likely to attend to evidence inconsistent with their hypotheses and consider alternatives, thereby reducing the chance of confirmation bias and anchoring. Reflection also encourages students to explore their hypotheses thoroughly, ensuring that they elicit relevant information from patients, reducing the effect of the unpacking principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par26">The observed measure assessed ‘essential information identified’ by measuring the proportion of essential questions and examinations asked, out of all possible essential examinations and questions identified by experts. This aimed to detect the influence of the unpacking principle on reasoning, as it captured whether the students elicited enough essential information to make an appropriate decision. The ‘relevance of history taking’ was measured by assessing the proportion of all relevant questions and examinations asked, out of the total questions and examinations asked by the student. This aimed to detect susceptibility to confirmation bias by capturing whether they sought relevant information. Finally, it measured ‘flexibility in diagnoses’ by counting the number of times students changed their diagnosis. This reflected how susceptible students were to anchoring, by measuring their willingness to change their initial differential diagnosis. All measures were developed by RP and three clinicians (PS, SG &amp; JT). The content validity of the observed measure of clinical reasoning was tested with two clinicians (SM, JH).</p>

                <p id="Par29">The trial procedure is outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, which shows how and when data from participants were collected. To address ethical concerns the information sheet made it clear to students that: participation in the trial was voluntary, they could withdraw at any stage, participation would not impact upon their summative assessments and only anonymised aggregate data would be shared. Students who provided written consent online were allocated to intervention or control groups using simple randomisation. Researchers were blind to allocation, completed by a computer algorithm. Randomisation was not precisely 1:1, as five students were mistakenly automatically allocated to the intervention group. The intervention group received three video patient cases in eCREST, all presenting with respiratory or related symptoms to their primary care physician [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The control group received no additional intervention and received teaching as usual. To address concerns that students in the control group may be disadvantaged by not having access to eCREST, we ensured that the control group had access to eCREST at the end of the trial.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par39">This feasibility trial of eCREST demonstrated that optimal recruitment and retention was achieved when the tool was integrated into curricula, as seen in the greater uptake for cohort two than cohort one. eCREST was also highly acceptable to students, suggesting it would be feasible to conduct a summative trial to estimate effectiveness of OPS in medical schools, if there was course integration.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Uptake, retention and acceptability were higher amongst students in cohort two than cohort one. Providing eCREST to students before exams, and advertising and integrating with students’ online learning management platforms, may have made eCREST more accessible and useful for revision. The low uptake at school C compared to the other sites was possibly due to their different curriculum design. Students at school C may have had more exposure to patient cases than A and B, as part of their PBL designed curriculum, reducing the need for simulated cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In a summative trial, recruitment efforts made for cohort two would likely yield greater uptake but uptake may vary across schools with different curricular approaches. Given the effect sizes observed in this study, we estimate that a sample size of 256 would be sufficient to detect a significant increase in the proportion of essential information identified. However, schools considering implementing OPS should be mindful that the acceptability of OPS to students could be affected by barriers to adoption at faculty level, such as insufficient technological capabilities to adapt and manage OPS and a lack of alignment of OPS content with educators’ needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To explore factors that might affect uptake we are undertaking qualitative research to understand how students’ reason and interact with eCREST and to understand from a faculty perspective how novel tools like eCREST can be implemented into curricula.</p>
              <p id="Par41">A lack of validated measures to assess clinical reasoning skills has been reported in medical education literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This study assessed the suitability of two potential measures. The FIT self-reported measure of clinical reasoning had some construct validity but poor predictive validity. It also may not capture actual reasoning as it is a self-reported measure. The observed measure of clinical reasoning developed for this study measured real-time thought processes involved in making decisions but had poor construct and predictive validity. Difficulties in establishing the validity of any clinical reasoning measure arise because of the subjective nature and context-dependency of clinical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In future, predictive validity of observed measures may be better established by applying rubrics to several patient cases and correlating with measures of summative performance that require strong clinical reasoning, such as objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) performance on related cases.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The observed clinical reasoning outcomes suggest that eCREST could reduce the effects of the unpacking principle, and confirmation and anchoring biases. eCREST helped students to elicit more information from patients on symptoms indicative of serious diseases and encouraged students to challenge their original hypotheses. Nevertheless, it is also possible that eCREST encouraged students to be less efficient when gathering information, by increasing the number of questions they asked. This may be an unfeasible approach in clinical practice given the significant time pressures clinicians face. However, given medical students’ limited level of experience, and exposure to patients and knowledge, this strategy may be appropriate when managing patients with non-specific symptoms in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec19">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par43">There was relatively low uptake in the study (18%) but the extensive demands of medical curricula often result in low uptake of additional resources. Uptake was higher in this study than some previous online learning studies that relied on medical student volunteers and the sample size was ample for the purposes of the feasibility RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. This study demonstrated that some integration of eCREST into the curricula in cohort two was possible and led to greater uptake, acceptability and retention. However, as this study relied on volunteers there was a risk of selection bias. Students who took part might have been different than those who did not.</p>
                <p id="Par44">A further limitation of this study is that it was a complete case analysis, which assumes data were missing at random and those who dropped out were similar to those who remained. It was not possible to follow up those who dropped out to determine whether they had different views of eCREST or different patterns of reasoning. Furthermore, the observed measure of clinical reasoning was only collected at T2 and not at baseline. It is possible that the two groups differed on this measure at baseline. However, no differences in self-reported clinical reasoning were detected between groups at baseline.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par45">This feasibility RCT has illustrated the importance of integration into the course when evaluating OPS in medical education. It would be feasible to conduct a summative trial to assess the effectiveness of eCREST on medical students’ clinical reasoning skills in multiple medical schools, if it were appropriately positioned in a curriculum to benefit student learning. Further testing of the validity of using OPS as an outcome measure is needed. Nevertheless, this study provides evidence that OPS can be used to support face-to-face teaching to reduce cognitive biases, which may help future doctors in achieving timely diagnoses in primary care.</p>
