                  <p id="Par1">Children and young people of parents with mental illness (COPMI) are at risk of poor mental, physical and emotional health, which can persist into adulthood. They also experience poorer social outcomes and wellbeing as well as poorer quality of life than their peers with ‘healthy’ parents. The needs of COPMI are likely to be significant; however, their prevalence is unknown, although estimates suggest over 60% of adults with a serious mental illness have children. Many receive little or no support and remain ‘hidden’, stigmatised or do not regard themselves as ‘in need’. Recent UK policies have identified supporting COPMI as a key priority, but this alone is insufficient and health-related quality of life has been neglected as an outcome.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">An age-appropriate standardised intervention for COPMI, called Young SMILES, was developed in collaboration with service users, National Health Service (NHS) and non-NHS stakeholders in our previous work. This protocol describes a randomised feasibility trial comparing Young SMILES with usual care, involving 60 families that will be identified through third sector organisations and NHS services, and recruited and randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive Young SMILES or usual care. Outcomes of the feasibility trial are rates of recruitment, follow-up and withdrawals, intervention uptake, and engagement. The optimal child-reported outcomes will also be determined alongside the assessment of resource use. A qualitative evaluation conducted at 3-months will explore the experiences and views of children and young people as well as parents accessing the intervention and the facilitators delivering the intervention.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">Current estimates suggest that over 60% of parents with a serious mental illness (SMI) live with one or more children or young people (CYP) under the age of 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Evidence indicates that CYP living, or in regular contact with a parent with SMI can be vulnerable to poorer mental and physical health, behavioural, social and educational difficulties, as well as maltreatment and neglect in comparison to other CYP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The effects can be long-lasting, with many at increased risk of socio-occupational dysfunction, psychiatric morbidity, alcohol or substance misuse, and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in adulthood. CYP of parents with SMI are said to have a 50% chance of developing a mental health problem, with a 32% probability of developing a SMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The problems arise not only because parents with SMI find it difficult to manage their role as carers, but also because they are often coping with multiple deprivation and have ongoing concerns about their children being moved to out-of-home care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par20">Many of the difficulties that CYP of parents with mental illness (COPMI) face can lead to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Several UK policy initiatives offer perspectives on CYP’s social and emotional wellbeing, including Social and Emotional Wellbeing for Children and Young People [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], Think Child, Think Parent, Think family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the Children’s and Young People’s Strategy in Northern Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], the Getting it Right for Every Child approach in Scotland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], Working with Troubled Families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and the Children’s and Young People’s Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Collectively, these policies clarify the responsibility and supportive nature that services have in ensuring the safeguarding and wellbeing of CYP who have parents experiencing mental illness; further, the importance of ensuring their needs, in addition to those of their parent, is explicitly identified in a timely and appropriate manner to ensure they are addressed effectively.</p>
              <p id="Par21">The importance of addressing the needs of COPMI is also identified internationally, for example, through the European Union’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health in Enlarged Europe CAMHEE initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the Children of Parents with a Mental Illness Framework for Mental Health Services 2010–2015 in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Child Welfare Act in Finland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Five broad quality of life domains are shared between these initiatives and are highlighted within the current agenda for CYP as (1) health, (2) safety, (3) economic well-being, (4) enjoyment and achievement, and (5) positive societal contribution.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Despite recognition of the support needed for COPMI, there is a significant lack of reliable evidence for the effectiveness of any evidence-based interventions for this population, particularly within the UK National Health Service (NHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It can be challenging for parents with SMI and their children to access the support they need. Integrated care for COPMI is complex because NHS adult mental health, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), social care, and child protection services are located and managed separately; this can mean that CYP ‘fall through the gaps’ between different health and social care providers. Furthermore, because services may not consider the CYP to be ‘at risk’, many services have little to offer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Added to this, many CYP may not identify themselves as having a ‘need’ for intervention. Those who do may have concerns about the stigma of mental health problems or worry about the consequences of asking for help, for example, on their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">One of the biggest challenges is identifying when and how to support COPMI effectively in a non-stigmatising and accessible way. Our consultation work with CYP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] expressed the need for interventions to improve their coping skills and mental health literacy. The earlier phase of this study, involving focus groups and interviews with parents with mental illness, highlighted that CYP and parents desired mental health literacy, and that communication and problem-solving skills should be the driving principles underlying each of the interventions. These views were mirrored by professionals working in the NHS and third sector organisations. A more recent mixed-methods study additionally supports these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is thought that a significant “<italic>paradigm shift is required at all levels of service development, delivery and policy</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to enhance the lives of these CYP and their families.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Since late 2011, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty for Children (NSPCC) has been providing and evaluating an intervention called Family SMILES (Simplifying Mental Illness + Life Enhancement Skills) for families with parental mental illness, particularly those (but not exclusively) where CYP were assessed as at risk of abuse or neglect. Family SMILES aims to improve CYP’s self-esteem, enhance parents’ protective abilities and improve parent–child relationships in CYP aged 8–13 years. The NSPCC’s preliminary evaluation of Family SMILES was a single-group, pre-test/post-test measurement of change on self-reported outcomes of strengths and difficulties, self-esteem and child abuse risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Of importance for the present study, the evaluation highlighted the potential benefits (1) for children (increased social functioning and confidence, reduced social isolation and reduced blame associated with parental illness); (2) for parents (less distress and unhappiness, shift of thinking from own need to children’s needs); and (3) for families (more relaxed atmosphere, openness about parental mental health, empathy between child and parent, shared responsibilities). There is significant potential for this intervention to be manualised, extended and enhanced with respect to supporting a wider age range and explicitly reaching out to CYP who may not have been identified as ‘at risk’ and to be implemented within an NHS context. Rather than the focus being on the whole family, there is the opportunity to focus specifically on enhancing the children’s quality of life.</p>

                <p id="Par32">This study is a feasibility RCT designed to assess the methodology proposed for the conduct of a future definitive RCT. It will evaluate the Young SMILES intervention in comparison to usual care alone. Families will be randomised to (1) Young SMILES or (2) usual care. Those allocated to Young SMILES will also be able to access any usual care services should they wish or require to do so. Families will be asked to complete outcome measures at baseline, 3-months, 6-months and 12-months following the baseline assessment. While this is a feasibility study and long-term follow-ups are not normally necessary, one of the findings within the Bee et al. review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was that no one carried out long-term outcomes for CYP and thus this was regarded as a useful opportunity to test the viability of doing so.</p>

                  <title>Intervention – Young SMILES</title>
                  <p id="Par49">Young SMILES is a service for CYP (aged 6–16) whose parents live with SMI, aiming specifically to improve the HRQoL of CYP. The intervention was co-developed in the earlier phase of this research via consultation with stakeholders (CYP of parents with serious mental illness, parents and practitioners from third sectors and NHS organisations). Young SMILES is an 8-week group programme (4–6 CYP per group) split into two age bands, namely 6–11 and 12–16. At week 4, five parallel sessions are offered to the parent or significant other adult. CYP and parent sessions last for 2 hours, which includes time for a short break and refreshments during and after the group. Where possible, the sessions will be held in a non-stigmatising venue such as a community location rather than a hospital clinic or school.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">Sessions will be facilitated by two trained practitioners. The expertise and skills of the facilitators is an invaluable aspect of the Young SMILES intervention. Groups will be delivered in an NHS organisation using a co-delivery model where one facilitator is from the NHS (family therapy background) and the other is from a third sector organisation. Third sector organisation facilitators will have a variety of professional backgrounds such as social workers, children’s service practitioners, psychologists and occupational therapists.</p>
                  <p id="Par51">Intervention facilitators will be provided with a 3-day training session. A training manual for facilitators was developed as part of the development phase which provides an overview of the feasibility trial and development of Young SMILES. It additionally incorporates structured detail on service delivery and intervention delivery, providing an on-going guide/reference for practitioners who deliver the service and manual to support trainers to ‘teach’ practitioners the aspects of the model and how it should be delivered.</p>
                  <sec id="FPar1">
                    <title>CYP group sessions</title>
                    <p id="Par52">Each session has specific aims and objectives. A brief outline of the session objectives is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Brief outline of children and young people group sessions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Session</th><th>Objectives</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Session 1: Welcome to Young SMILES</td><td>Understand the aim of the group and introduce key themes, e.g. the fictitious family</td></tr><tr><td>Session 2: All about me</td><td>Understand a sense of self and identify personal strengths and qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Session 3: What happens in my family?</td><td>Understand mental illness and the impact it can have on a young person’s family</td></tr><tr><td>Session 4: Things we worry about</td><td>Identify the sources of feelings and understand healthy and unhealthy responses to them</td></tr><tr><td>Session 5: Our world</td><td>Identify key sources of stress and the building blocks needed for a foundation of feeling good</td></tr><tr><td>Session 6: Where do I go when I need help?</td><td>Identify support networks and learn how to access help from professionals</td></tr><tr><td>Session 7: Enjoying being me</td><td>Understand personal strengths and aspirations; recognise which aspirations they can shape</td></tr><tr><td>Session 8: Moving on together</td><td>Celebrate progress, consolidate relationships and plan for the future</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                    <p id="Par53">The aims and objectives for both age groups (6–11 and 12–16) will stay consistent. The activities and communication style used to achieve these, however, may differ. Identifying the abilities of children in the group and modifying the activities to match these will be an important role of the facilitators; this will be discussed and addressed within the training provided.</p>
                    <p id="Par54">Themes that cut across all sessions will include mental health literacy, communication and problem-solving skills. Throughout the life of the group, the outcomes of each session will be facilitated through the creation of an ‘Imaginary Family’ for younger children (made from cardboard cut-outs/cartoon characters created electronically and printed) and a ‘Graffiti Wall Family’ for older children. A typical session format will include a ‘getting to know you’ (first session)/‘welcome back’ and ‘check-in’ on previous week, ‘ice-breaker’ activity, activities based on the session aims and snack time. A ‘Weekly Challenge’ at the end of each session will be included to orientate and tether COPMI to the next session in order to optimise engagement.</p>

                <p id="Par76">Recruiting gatekeepers will provide potential families with a study information pack including an invitation letter, information sheet and consent-to-contact form. Separate packs containing the same information will be provided to CYP and parents. If a family are interested in participating, they can return the consent-to-contact form, detailing their preferred method(s) of contact, directly back to the research team in the freepost envelope also included in the information pack. Families who are informed of the study by a practitioner or support worker will also have the opportunity to ask them to complete a contact form on their behalf and return it securely to the research team. Following receipt of a consent-to-contact form, the research team will contact the family, identify if the family are suitable based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined previously and confirm that they are still interested in taking part. If eligible families will be informed that they will be contacted at a later stage to arrange and complete a face-to-face baseline interview at a convenient time and place. The timing of the baseline interviews will be dependent on the research team receiving enough referrals of the same age band at one site. Families will be contacted by telephone fortnightly during the waiting period by the research team to be informed of progress and to provide them the opportunity to answer any additional questions. A one-off home visit to discuss the study will also be offered.</p>
                <p id="Par77">At the face-to-face interview, the family will be given the opportunity to ask any further questions and written consent will be taken. As the CYP will be 16 years old or younger, they will be asked to give assent and consent from their parents/carer will be obtained in support of their child’s participation. Separate consent will be obtained for parents/carers who are also participating. It will be made clear to all family members that they can withdraw from the study at any point, without detriment to their care. If a parent wishes to withdraw, their child/children can still participate with their consent. If the parent has more than one child, all children in the family will be eligible to participate, but are not required to do so. If siblings are in the same age band, they will attend different groups.</p>
                <p id="Par78">After obtaining consent, family members wishing to participate in the study will be asked to complete the baseline measure booklet.

This is an important pathway to research impact. We shall work with national and local service user groups and agencies, such as Rethink Mental Illness and Young Carers, to communicate the findings of our research, drawing on these organisations’ existing partnerships and knowledge transfer programmes.</p>

Due to family availability and referral rates, baseline interviews have been conducted over a longer time period than was anticipated. As a result, some families were being offered a 3-month follow-up appointment while still accessing the Young SMILES intervention (if randomised to that trial arm). To ensure the amount of ‘useful data’ is maximised, the primary outcome point was changed to 4 months, without altering the 6- and 12-month time points</td></tr><tr><td>Data collection</td><td>Addition of demographic questionnaire for all participants taking part in the feasibility trial (children and young people, parents, carers)<break/>Addition of referrer interviews to explore the experiences of individuals who have referred to the study and also those who have been approached but have not referred any families; individuals will be from health, social care, educational and third sector services, which will aid a more thorough understanding of the development of referral pathways that will add to the other findings from the feasibility study to assist with the development of an application for a full-scale trial</td></tr><tr><td>Randomisation</td><td>Change from using the Sealed Envelope system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sealedenvelope.com">www.sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>) to randomise 60 families on a 1:1 ratio either to Young SMILES or to usual care to online randomisation software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com">www.randomization.com</ext-link>), which would better meet study requirements in relation to sample size and the ability to stratify by age and site, without incurring costs<break/>Addition of 2:1 randomisation allocation procedures (2 Young SMILES intervention; 1 control) to expedite start of intervention groups; this has been acknowledged to be wholly appropriate for a feasibility trial in such a ‘specified group’ intervention</td></tr><tr><td>Intervention delivery</td><td>Inclusion of siblings within the same group (if in the same age band)<break/>Submission of young person travel consent form for parents/carers to consent to child/adolescent travelling to the intervention venue alone</td></tr><tr><td>Participant communication</td><td>Submission of letters/documents to communicate with families/sites during the trial, e.g. if unable to contact family or if any participant wishes to withdraw</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par97">The trial outlined is being conducted to explore if a structured, 8-week session-based intervention to improve the HRQoL in COPMI is feasible and acceptable. Once complete, it will offer valuable and timely insights into the delivery of evidence-based service development for this vulnerable population. Some barriers have been identified which may affect recruitment and completion of the study within existing timelines.</p>
              <sec id="Sec31">
                <title>Ethics and HRA issues</title>
                <p id="Par98">New REC/HRA approval processes delayed final REC/HRA approval in Phase I by 5 months. This, and the request that a separate application be submitted for Phase II, had a significant effect upon the start date of the feasibility trial. With final approvals for Phase II being delayed until June 2017, this resulted in an additional 3-month delay. Additional applications for one of our third sector partners following REC/HRA approval led to further unanticipated delays.</p>
                <p id="Par99">Once all approvals were in place, practitioners involved in the trial informed us that running groups during school holidays would be extremely challenging and have a significant and negative effect on their ability to engage families and CYP. Despite this, we worked with one site to pilot the feasibility of starting to run a group in the school summer holidays; but we were unable to identify any families during this time period, confirming the anticipated difficulties.</p>

              <sec id="Sec32">
                <title>Recruitment sites</title>
                <p id="Par100">Eight regional NSPCC service centres were closed as part of a strategic restructuring review prior to study recruitment start dates. Included in the closures was a local service centre we had planned to work with. This meant that we had to engage with two new NSPCC recruitment sites. This was achieved by the research team liaising with both sites to address queries and to establish new recruitment pathways. Changes in service management in one site have added to the workload and to the challenges of implementation of the Young SMILES at that site. The additional workload and greater distance from Manchester (compared to the original site, which was close to the research centre) has not only lengthened the time needed to complete the study tasks and delayed our milestones, but has also had a major effect on the budget allocated to travel (to deliver training, attend meetings, conduct data collection interviews with families).</p>
                <p id="Par101">Overall, the project timelines have been delayed by around 10-months by unforeseen events and procedural obstacles, which have been out of the control of the research team.</p>
