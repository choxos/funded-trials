                  <p id="Par1">To realize the full benefits of treatment as prevention in many hyperendemic African contexts, there is an urgent need to increase uptake of HIV testing and HIV treatment among men to reduce the rate of HIV transmission to (particularly young) women. This trial aims to evaluate the effect of two interventions - micro-incentives and a tablet-based male-targeted HIV decision support application - on increasing home-based HIV testing and linkage to HIV care among men with the ultimate aim of reducing HIV-related mortality in men and HIV incidence in young women.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a cluster randomized trial of 45 communities (clusters) in a rural area in the uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa (2018â2021). The study is built upon the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)âs HIV testing platform, which offers annual home-based rapid HIV testing to individuals aged 15âyears and above. In a 2âÃâ2 factorial design, individuals aged â¥15âyears living in the 45 clusters are randomly assigned to one of four arms: i) a financial micro-incentive (food voucher) (<italic>n</italic>â=â8); ii) male-targeted HIV specific decision support (EPIC-HIV) (<italic>n</italic>â=â8); iii) both the micro incentives and male-targeted decision support (<italic>n</italic>â=â8); and iv) standard of care (<italic>n</italic>â=â21). The EPIC-HIV application is developed and delivered via a tablet to encourage HIV testing and linkage to care among men. A mixed method approach is adopted to supplement the randomized control trial and meet the study aims.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has the dual benefit of increasing life expectancy for people living with HIV and preventing onwardÂ HIV transmission to uninfected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread scale-up of ART has reduced HIV-related deaths by almost half and led to substantial declines in new HIV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For example, in a rural area in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a 1% increase in community-levelÂ ART coverage was associated with a 1% reduction in theÂ individual risk of HIV acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the overall HIV incidence rates remain high in this setting, and young women are disproportionately at a risk of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. HIV-related mortality among men also remains comparatively high despite the mass provision of free ART in public health care facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These two challenges to current HIV programs â continued high HIV incidence in women and comparatively high HIV-related mortalityÂ in men â are inextricably linked. The key contributing factors are thatÂ men are less likely to test for HIV and far less likely to link to care if testedÂ HIV positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], putting them at a greater risk of HIV-related death, as well as HIV transmission to their sexual partners.</p>
              <p id="Par19">To realize the full benefits of treatment as prevention, it is urgent to increase uptake of HIV testing and HIV treatment among men who are living with HIV and at high risk of transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. Behavioural economics suggests that relatively small financial incentives can be used to ânudgeâ individuals towards healthy behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], particularly simple behavioural changes, such as agreeing to a rapid HIV test or making clinic appointments. Incentives have been shown as effective in increasing one-off behaviours, such as vaccinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], tuberculin screening testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], circumcision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], or uptake of preventative health counselling in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the causal impact of one-off financial incentives for HIV testing and linkage to care on long-term population-level benefits such as reducing HIV incidence has not been established.</p>
              <p id="Par20">On the other hand, long-term linkage to care involves repeated trips to the clinic which require ongoing intrinsic motivation. Yet, financial incentives tend to focus on short-term behavioural changes and operate via extrinsic motivation, which could potentially crowd out intrinsic motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The benefits of testing and early initiation of ART are also not widely understood or accepted by many men, often delaying HIV testing and linkage to care after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the treatment as prevention (TasP) trial (ANRS 12249) conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, the majority of men who did not consent for HIV testing reported feeling healthy as a reason for being reluctant to test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These barriers to test and linkÂ to care are usually based on lack of information, misinformation or lack of salience of the information. Providing decision support in the form of experiential information that describes the options available, allows clarification of personal values, and the need to make specific decisions (to test or link) explicit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] could increase intrinsic motivation. Also, given the lower level of testing and linkage to care among men compared to women, decision support for HIV testing and linkage to care needs to be tailored, flexible and gender sensitive to reflect existing values and norms of men and women, separately. Complementing financial incentives with gender specific HIV counselling could be an effective strategy to increase both intrinsic and extrinsic motivationÂ to test and link to HIV care.</p>
              <p id="Par21">We hypothesize that provision of micro-incentives and male-targeted HIV-specific decision-support (implemented via an android tablet-based application) would enable people to make more informed choices and thus increase uptake of home-based HIV testing and linkage to care, leading to reduction in population viral load and HIV-related mortality among men and ultimately lower HIV incidence in young women. To test this hypothesis, we designed a factorial cluster randomised controlled trial for implementation in the uMkhanyakude districtÂ of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.</p>

                <p id="Par26">The trial is conducted in the Hlabisa sub-district of the uMkhanyakude district located in northern KwaZulu-Natal South Africa between 2018 and 2021 (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The area is predominantly rural and has recorded one of the highest population HIV prevalence estimates globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this sub-district, AHRI has one of the largest population-based Demographic and HIV surveillance since 2000. The surveillance covers 432âkm<sup>2</sup> geographic area over approximately 100 000 individuals and 60 000 residents at any given time. Trained field-workers visit all households in the surveillance area and interview a key resident informant annually. The household survey records demographic components of households including size, composition, fertility, migration, mortality, and nuptiality. The HIV surveillance is annually conducted on all resident individuals aged 15âyears or older to collect sexual behaviour and general health data and dried blood spots (DBS) samples for anonymized HIV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The fieldwork visits are carried out in systematic cycles of 45â"week blocks". A week block is a workload-equivalent area developed using a GPS based methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. AHRI works closely with the local Department of Health in a comprehensive HIV Treatment and Care Programme, decentralized to the 17 primary health care clinics in the sub-district. HIV testing and treatment are available at all 17 primary health care clinics and the district hospital. Since 2017,Â AHRI has introduced home-based rapid HIV testing as part of the annual HIV surveillance.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Location of the study area in South Africa: Taken from another source - Tanser et al. 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p id="Par27">The two interventions, micro-incentives and the male-targeted HIV-specific decision support, are offered in a two-stage scheme. The first stage is aimed at encouraging HIV testing (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), while the second stage is aimed at encouraging linkage to care if testedÂ HIV positive (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Micro-incentives are in the form of a R50 food voucher (redeemable in a local supermarket) conditional on undergoing a home-based rapid HIV test. If diagnosed with HIV and present for HIV care in one of the local Department of Health clinics servicing the program area within 6âweeks of the HIV test, participants receive a second R50 food voucher.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Study flow - 1st stage: interventions at the time of home-based HIV testing offer</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_7277_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig><fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Study flow â 2nd stage: interventions at the time of linkage to care (Arm 1 and 2 for micro-incentives) or 1âmonth after HIV-positive test if not linked to care (Arm 2 and 3 for EPIC-HIV 2)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2019_7277_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par28">The male-targeted HIV-specific decision-support is implemented via a tablet-based application called EPIC-HIV. EPIC-HIV development was guided by a combination of human behaviour change theory and person-based intervention design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and human computer interaction techniques. The development processÂ (described elsewhereÂ in more detail) included three phases: 1) a thorough review of literature was conducted to synthesize key facilitators and barriers of HIV care and management among men in South Africa; 2) the review informed content, design features and format of the application, and the app was iteratively prototyped; 3) the content was evaluated with the community advisory board, and usability testing and in-depth interviews were conducted with representative users at every iteration to establish understanding of content and usability issues. The content is rooted in local narratives and provided in a form of experiential information to increase risk perception, salience and likelihood of response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. EPIC-HIV makes the decision to test or link to care explicit by providing experiential information about what various outcomes might be like (imagined future). It further supports three basic human âneedsâ as defined by the self-determination theory - the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The app is available in two versions (EPIC HIV-1 and EPIC HIV-2). EPIC-HIV 1 is offered to menÂ at the point of HIV test offer prior to HIV counselling and testing to support themÂ  when choosing whether or not to test for HIV. If participants are diagnosed with HIV but do not present in the local Department of Health clinic within a month of the positive HIV test, a study tracker team re-visit participants at home and offer EPIC-HIV 2, which is designed to address barriers to seek HIV treatment and encourage them to link to HIV care.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Male residents in the clusters that receive both interventions are offered EPIC-HIV 1 prior to HIV testing, a food voucher conditional on undergoing a rapid HIV test, and a second food voucher when they link to care within 6âweeks of receiving an HIV positive test. If they do not link to care within a month of the positive HIV test they become eligible for EPIC-HIV 2. Female residents in these clusters are eligible to receive the food voucher only. Residents in the control clusters receive standard of care where they are offered theÂ home-based HIV rapid test, and if diagnosed with HIV, referred to the clinic for linkage to HIV care.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par30">The goal of the trial is to establish whether the provision of micro-incentives and a male-targeted HIV-specific decision-support app will increase uptake of HIV testing and linkage to HIV care thus, ultimately reducing HIV-related mortality in men and population-level HIV incidence in young women. The trialâs primary endpoints are to measure the impact of the interventions at both individual and population-levels as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par31">HIV testing uptake at point of test offer in men</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">HIV treatment linkage in men at 1-year</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Population-level HIV viral suppression in men after 1-year</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Population-level HIV-related mortality in men after 3-years</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par35">Population-level HIV incidence in young women (15â30âyears of age) after 3-years</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par36">Specifically, the study compares differences in the percentage that received the rapid HIV test at home among those offered the test in men among the intervention arms compared to the SoC arm. The study will also compare the percentage who visited study clinics and initiated ART in men at 1-year after the home-based HIV-positive test, as well as prevalence of detectable viremia (detection limit of &gt;â1550 copies/ml) obtained from the DBS in men. Changes in the number of HIV-related deaths and mortality rates in men and changes in the number of new HIV infections and HIV incidence rates in young women 3âyears after the home-based HIV test will be compared across the arms.

Participants who consent to the HIV surveillance have blood collected on a filter paper as DBS, which are stored at the AHRI Biorepository in Durban [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A 4th generation HIV ELISA (Genscreenâ¢ ULTRA HIV Ag-Ab (Biorad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) adopted and evaluated in-house by the AHRI Diagnostic Research Laboratory (unpublished data) is used for testing of all DBS samples. All HIV ELISA positive DBS samples are subjected to HIV viral load determination using the automated Nuclisens EasyMagÂ® (Biomerieux, Marcy-lâEtiole, France). Viral load testing is performed on the same day as the extraction.</p>

                <p id="Par41">Randomisation was performed by the trial statistician prior to intervention rollout to ensure that each arm has similar baseline HIV incidence rates among women aged 15 and 30âyears. First, all 45 clusters were stratified by HIV incidence in young women using data from 7605 young women aged 15 and 30âyears old, who were residents in the PIPSA between 2006 and 2015 at least for 1 year. A total of 34551 person years and 1636 seroconversion events have been recorded, yielding overall 4.7 new infections per 100 person years. Then the 45 clusters were divided into four strata according to their HIV incidence rate such that stratum 1 comprises clusters with the lowest incidence rate, while stratum 4 comprises clusters with the highest incidence rate. Each of Arm 1, 2, and 3 consists of two clusters from each of the four incidence stratum (thus a total of eight clusters per arm). Arm 4 (SoC) consists of five clusters from each of the incidence stratum 1, 2, and 4, and six clusters from incidence stratum 3 (thus a total of 25-clusters). The study is an open label trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par42">The study was powered to achieve a 25%Â reduction in HIV incidence among females aged 15â30âyears old in the intervention arms. Using the AHRIâs actual HIV incidence data, we assumed HITS interventions were delivered in 2011 and simulated the effect of HITS interventions in 24 intervention communities after 3-years of follow up between 2012 and 2014. Using a simulation approachÂ weÂ then explored a scenario where the interventions lead to a 25% reduction in Arm 1 (micro-incentives), 25% reduction in Arm 3 (male-sensitive HIV specific counselling) and a 37% reduction in the combined arm (Arm 2) after 3-years of follow up.</p>
                  <p id="Par43">The results (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) show that we would have been able to detect this reduction in incidence in &gt;â80% of simulation replicates (<italic>p</italic>â&lt;â0.05). Therefore, if we were to introduce the HITS intervention in 2018 and follow young females up for at least 3âyears post-intervention (i.e.Â utilize a total of 17âyears of incidence data â 2004 to 2021), we would be in excess of 90% power to detect such a reduction in incidence in this critical age-group.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Power calculations.

                  <p id="Par45">All primary analyses (both primary and secondary endpoints) will be intent-to-treat (ITT). For the binary primary outcomes â HIV testing uptake and HIV treatment linkage â we will use generalized linear models with Poisson distribution, log link function, and robust error terms to determine effect sizes (risk ratios). We will fit beta regression models for incidence and mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We will also adjust for both baseline endpoints and clustering through random effects. Under the difference-in-differences study design, the individuals are followed in two periods of time: the âbeforeâ and the âafterâ period, where the interventions occur in the âafterâ period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The goal of the statistical analysis is to estimate the average treatment effect for the treated clusters (week blocks). We will make the usual assumption of parallel trend, that is, on average, the outcomes for all the clusters in the four arms would have followed a parallel path over time in the absence of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our generalized linear models will include fixed effects for the âbeforeâ and the âafterâ time periods, the grouping of the clusters in four arms, and the interaction between time periods and arms.</p>
                  <p id="Par46">For the two survival-analytic primary endpoints â population-level mortality among men and population-level HIV incidence among women â we will use the Cox proportional hazards model to determine effect sizes (hazard ratios). If the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model is violated, we will use appropriate alternative survival analytic models. We will use data from the period 2004â2017 for baseline endpoint adjustment. In addition, to the ITT analyses, we will measure intervention effects adjusted for non-compliance using instrumental variable (IV) approaches.</p>

                <p id="Par47">In order to determine how the implementation of the HITS intervention is achieved in our setting as well as the processes through which the interventions affect outcomes, we will gather stakeholder views in a purposive sample of up to 150 stakeholders (HITS participants, fieldworkers and health professionals) using mixed methods of quantitative and qualitative techniques (e.g. surveys and in-depth interviews). The evaluation is shaped by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on the process evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The guidelines identify three important pathways of understanding the process of achieving a particular outcome: a) Context â we will examine how the socio-cultural context of our setting influences the development process, delivery and functioning of the HITS interventions; b) Implementation of the HITS program - we will describe the resources and processes through which HITS implementation is achieved, and the extent to which HITS intervention would be delivered as intended or needed any program adaptations; c) Mechanisms of impact - we will examine how study participants respond to and interact with HITS interventions and whether these interventions promote behavioural change or not. In order to examine the âcausal assumptionsâ of the intervention, the evaluation is informed by the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The theory will help us to understand how the HITS intervention would be delivered, as well as any changes that could affect its fidelity. All interviews will be recorded and transcribed and subject to thematic analysis following an interpretivist approach.</p>

A time and motion study will be conducted to determine how much time fieldworkers spend on the HITS related activities including consenting for study participation, HIV testing, counselling, and provision of micro-incentives and/or EPIC-HIV. Detailed information on direct and indirect costs will be documented during the study implementation to determine the unit costs of providing the interventions. Effectiveness will be measured as the number of uptake of HIV testing, new HIV diagnosis, as well as linkage to care. We will also fit mathematical modelling to simulate dynamic HIV transmission calibrated to the data from the trial and the AHRI surveillance and estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) over 10âyears. We will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adding the interventions to standard of care.</p>

The study will also establish the mechanisms and the determinants of successful implementation through comprehensive process evaluation. Combination of quantitative and qualitative social science research produced from this study will be essential to understand the behavioural and social impact of offering micro-incentives and male-sensitive HIV specific decision support on the HIV care continuum and population-level health outcomes in this rural hyperendemic South African and other similar settings.</p>
