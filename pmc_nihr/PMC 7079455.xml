                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Psychosis often causes significant distress and impacts not only in the individuals, but also those close to them. Many relatives and friends (‘carers’) provide long-term support and need resources to assist them. We have co-produced a digital mental health intervention called COPe-support (Carers fOr People with Psychosis e-support) to provide carers with flexible access to high quality psychoeducation and interactive support from experts and peers. This study evaluates the effectiveness of COPe-support to promote mental wellbeing and caregiving experiences in carers.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study is a single-blind, parallel arm, individually randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing COPe-support, with attention control. Both groups continue to receive usual care. COPe-support provides interactive web-based psychoeducation on psychosis-related issues, wellbeing-promotion and network support through forums. The attention-control is a non-interactive online information resource pack. Carers living in England are eligible if they provide at least weekly support to a family member or close friend affected by psychosis, and use internet communication (including emails) daily. All trial procedures are run online, including collection of outcome measurements which participants will directly input into our secure platform. Following baseline assessment, a web-based randomization system will be used to allocate 360 carers to either arm. Participants have unlimited access to the allocated condition for 40 weeks. Data collection is at three time points (10, 20, and 40 weeks after randomization). Analyses will be conducted by trial statisticians blinded to allocation. The primary outcome is mental wellbeing measured by Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), at 20 weeks. As well as an intention-to-treat analysis, a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis will be conducted to estimate the intervention effect in participants who have accessed COPe-support content twice or more. The secondary objectives and analysis will examine other health and caregiving-related outcomes and explore mechanisms. In a process evaluation, we will interview 20% of the intervention arm participants regarding the acceptability of COPe-support. We will explore in detail participants’ usage patterns.</p>

              <p id="Par22">World-wide, an ever-increasing population is living longer in the community despite long-term illness. In addition to the advances of health care, one crucial element that support and sustain this population in their own home is the unpaid care and support provided by relatives and friends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the UK, it is estimated that approximately 1.5 million people are caring for a family member or friend with a mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Of these illnesses, psychosis is recognised as among the most common and severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Often, people with psychosis require long-term treatment and support across a range of life domains, including emotional support, financial and practical assistance for daily living activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the importance of relatives and friends - referred to carers hereafter - is well established. Extant research evidence has established that individuals who receive support and care from their familial networks have a better prognosis and enhanced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Conversely, the responsibility of caring often means that carers of people with psychosis experience high levels of distress and increased vulnerability to ill health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, carers’ psychiatric morbidities are shown to be inversely correlated with the amount of care they provide; that is, the higher amount of care provided leading to poorer mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Poor mental health in carers can further negatively impact their caregiving capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Carers who are unwell themselves or feel they lack resources to cope are less likely to engage in caring for their loved ones in a positive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">Consequently, a body of research has been undertaken to establish psychosocial interventions which can best support carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Among these, psychoeducation (i.e. information-giving on the illness condition and related caregiving and problem-solving strategies) especially those integrated with a peer support element between carers in a group setting, has the strongest evidence base for its effectiveness in enhancing carers’ knowledge and coping with their caring roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Carers also identify that sharing mutual support and learning with other carers as particularly useful in reducing their sense of isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the UK, psychoeducation is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on psychosis and schizophrenia for all carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">With digital health interventions becoming more widespread and popular across a range of public mental health topics in the recent time, interventions targeting carers supporting a loved one with long-term illness have increasingly adopted an online medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Many carers lead a busy lifestyle with multiple commitments in addition to caregiving. Digital interventions are potentially flexible, accessible and yet adaptable to individualized needs and schedule. Such interventions, using an enriched and dynamic online environment, are particularly suited to delivering psychoeducation, wellbeing promotion strategies, and network support with healthcare professionals and peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par25">Emerging research provides increasing evidence to promote digital mental health (or e-mental health) as an effective means to disseminate interventions to carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Across a wide range of long term illnesses, there is a particularly strong evidence base for psychoeducational interventions treating mental health morbidities in carers of people with dementia, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, both the volume of literature and research evidence are less established in mental health arena, with the exception of eating disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Few such interventions are available for psychosis carers and even fewer have been trialled rigorously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Hence, the EFFIP (E-support for Families and Friends of Individuals affected by Psychosis) Project was established to fill these research gaps to develop and evaluate a digital health intervention for carers supporting a relative or close friend with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The EFFIP project is a five-year research programme encompassing theoretical development work and participatory research to develop the digital health intervention which is then evaluated for effectiveness in promoting carers’ wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The participatory study through which the intervention, called “COPe-support (Carers fOr People with Psychosis e-support)” was co-produced, is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. COPe-support provides high quality psychoeducation and interactive support to carers entirely through the internet, promoting flexible access and individualized choice of content, pace, and engagement for its users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is expected that, if effective, COPe-support can help overcome some of the barriers associated with implementing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. These include lack of resources to prioritise carers’ needs on a par with those they care for, stigma, accessibility, and the mis-match between the conventional face-to-face service provision and the diverse needs of carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">There is a strong argument that interventions delivered online should also be evaluated online to maximize the trial’s external validity and some aspects of internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Firstly, it is of interest to establish whether the profile of carers using a digital intervention is representative of the wider populations, including those using conventional services (such as face-to-face carers groups, individual psychological intervention). Secondly, as COPe-support is delivered entirely online and requires the carers to self-pace and self-tailor the multiple components suiting their own needs and schedule, it is only logical to collect evaluation data directly from them using an online medium. Thirdly, while arguably the web-based media offers a low-cost platform through which the intervention can be delivered to a critical mass with a high level of fidelity to its design, research on online trials show that they can be inferior to conventional trials in terms of adherence and retention rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It is important for both the trial and the facilitation of COPe-support to consider effective strategies to engage with carers in line with its online delivery. Finally, as digital interventions allow their users a self-directed approach in using the content, intervention usage or adherence is often very heterogenous. It is important to explore the differential benefits of the intervention use in participants with different usage patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par49">The intervention condition, COPe-support, is delivered through a web-based virtual learning environment (VLE) called Canvas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.canvasvle.co.uk">https://www.canvasvle.co.uk</ext-link>). The VLE allows the participants to access the intervention online via desktop or laptop web browsers, as well as smartphones or tablets through a Canvas app. COPe-support was co-produced through participatory research with a wide range of experts through experience or through professional training, building upon results identified through systematic reviews of the literature and a focus group study with carers and people affected by psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. After the COPe-support prototype was finalized, we ran a mixed-method study to establish its feasibility and usability with a small sample of carers and technical expert. We also gleaned further usage and qualitative feedback from the usability study to refine the content and facilitation strategy of COPe-support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These have been incorporated to develop and revise the delivery and facilitation strategies of the RCT, as reported in this protocol.</p>

Potential participants can register their interest in joining the study and undertake eligibility screening through the study website. Those who meet all the eligibility criteria are then guided through the online informed consent seeking and study enrolment process. The study website also provides direct weblink for potential participants to post any queries and get in touch with the study team.</p>
                  <p id="Par62">We schedule all the participants recruited over a duration of two years (i.e. March 2018 to February 2020) into six cohorts, each lasting eight months, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. This approach allows us to group at least 20 but no more than 60 participants in the intervention platform at any one time.

                  <p id="Par65">Carers’ mental health knowledge, measured using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). MAKS has two sections: the former to investigate participants’ knowledge of mental health; the latter for contextualising the responses. Possible scores range from 6 to 30 by summing up the scores of the first section of six items. Higher scores of MAKS indicate better level of mental health knowledge.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">Carers’ appraisal of caregiving experience, assessed using the Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). There are 66 brief statements each requiring a rating on a 5-point ordinal scale (from 0 = never to 4 = nearly always) in the ECI. These are categorized into ten subscales; eight negative subscales summing into the total negative appraisal total (possible scores range from 0 to 208; higher scores indicate poorer outcome), and two positive subscales totaling into the positive appraisal score (possible scores range from 0 to 56; higher the scores better the positive perspective).</p>
                  <p id="Par67">Carers’ wellbeing and perceived support, measured with the Carers’ Wellbeing and Support Questionnaire (CWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). CWS contains two subscales: wellbeing (higher scores indicate better wellbeing) and perceived support (higher scores indicated lower satisfaction).</p>
                  <p id="Par68">Criticism and emotional over-involvement in the family, assessed by Family Questionnaire (FQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]). FQ comprises 20 short questions, with 10 of these covering the criticism subscale, and the remainders the emotional over-involvement subscale. Higher scores indicate poorer outcomes on both subscales.</p>
                  <p id="Par69">Carers’ quality of life assessed using Euro-QoL 5-level (EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). EQ-5D-5L comprises two components: health state description covering the domains of mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression; and an overall evaluation using a visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). The EQ-VAS asks the participants to rate their subjective rating of health ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 implies the best health one can imagine, and 0 the worst.</p>

                  <p id="Par71">The trial has an inbuilt process evaluation study to explore participants’ usage patterns and subjective experience of participants in using COPe-support. In order to understand when and how participants access and use the online intervention, we will collect usage data which the intervention and control platform automatically monitors and records. These include:

                  <p id="Par78">Perceived acceptability will be determined through interviewing a purposive sample of 20% of the participants in the intervention arms of the trial after all the data collection procedures (i.e. about 36 out of the 180, or less should data saturation, that is no further data is being collected that adds to the content of existing themes, be reached in the iterative analysis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]). For the individual interview, purposive sampling will be used to identify participants to ensure representation of diverse experiences and views from those with ethnic minority backgrounds, different caregiving experiences and roles, and usage patterns. The interview is designed to be semi-structured and conducted over phone or Skype, suiting the participants’ preference and convenience.</p>

All outcome measures are self-completed questionnaires as described above. At each time point, we will invite the participants to undertake an online assessment through our secure platform. At study enrolment, we will also collect data on participant’s demographic and caregivng-related information (e.g. the gender of the cared-for person, are they living together or separately, and how much time they spend on caring for their loved one in the previous week). At each assessment time point, participants will receive up to six email-reminders over a four-week window, linking them to an online platform through which they can complete the assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par80">We will collect the usage data during the intervention time (20 weeks) following completion of all outcome data collection, i.e. at the end of 40 weeks. These data will be collected from our intervention (and control) platform which automatically record individuals’ usage.</p>
                <p id="Par81">On completion of each assessment, participants will be emailed an Amazon voucher to thank for their time and participation (i.e. £10 for the first, £5 for the second and third respectively, and £10 for the fourth and last). We will offer an additional £10 Amazon voucher for those who give an interview. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows all the measures used and data collection schedule.

                <p id="Par82">The trial sample size is calculated with reference to an earlier study testing a digital health intervention targeting siblings of individuals with first episode psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and the primary outcome measure data (i.e. WEMWBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). This study is powered to detect the minimum clinically important difference of + 3 in WEMWBS which is considered a meaningful change post intervention between treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Using 80% power, significance level of 5% and an estimated SD of 9 from the E Sibling Project RCT baseline results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], 143 carers per arm are needed.

The algorithm for randomization will consist of permuted blocks stratified by the gender. While there is no established evidence of any carer sociodemographic or caregiving-related factors having an effect on carers’ health outcomes, females (having a caregiving role or not) are known to have worse outcomes in population mental wellbeing research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and that participants in most prior research recruiting carers were predominantly females.</p>

Nonetheless, all outcome data collected use self-reported measures and direct online input by participants.

The TSC provides governance and guidance on the study delivery and progress. It provides a monitoring and advice function for the safety and wellbeing of the study participants. In view of the safety event data, the TSC will consider the need for appointing a separate Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) if necessary.

                <p id="Par87">For this trial we have adapted the definition of adverse events commonly used in conventional clinical trials.</p>
                <p id="Par88">In addition to adverse and serious adverse events, we have devised a category labelled as “unintended consequences”. These are summarized as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par89">Unintended consequences (UCo) – incidents during which participants’ use of the intervention (or control) is interrupted and the potential distress caused is below the threshold of that described in adverse event category. Examples include participants forgetting their log-in password, platform technical issues interrupting delivering, or participants realizing their own unmet needs in light of the intervention content.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par90">Adverse events (AE) - clear evidence of distress or concerns of risk of harm towards participants or others, resulting in needs for medical and/or mental health support. However, there is no immediate or serious threat of severe harm or risk of life</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par91">Serious adverse events (SAE) – clear evidence of immediate risk to life or welfare for the participants or others.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par92">Monitoring of all potential safety concerns will cover both active monitoring of the online platform communications (e.g. participants’ post made on forums) and query/concerns raised by participants (e.g. those who send messages through our platform). In all circumstances, the online facilitator will contact the participant concerned and offer support through online or phone communication, in addition to signposting them to relevant local services. In the unlikely event of SAEs, we will contact the relevant local authorities (e.g. Police or social services) as appropriate. Such safety monitoring and support mechanisms are outlined in the participant information sheet.</p>
                <p id="Par93">Recording and coding of safety and untoward events will be conducted on a continuous basis. These will also be reported to the TSC prior to each of the biannual TSC meeting or at an ad hoc basis if indicated, both for consensus on coding and for safety monitoring. In the event of SAEs, these need to be reported to both the TSC chair and the sponsor within 48 hours.</p>
                <p id="Par94">Overall adverse effects, including the number of UCo, AE, and SAE, will be recorded by number of events, types and participants across both arms. In addition, we will also record and report participant withdrawals from the study.</p>

                  <p id="Par96">The data analysis will be performed by the trial statisticians who will be blind to randomized allocation for the primary and secondary outcome analysis. Primary analyses will be undertaken on an intent-to treat (ITT) basis, including all participants who were randomized and supplied at least one post-randomisation measure at 10, 20, or 40 weeks, regardless of usage status or withdrawal from the study. For the primary analysis, a linear mixed model will be used. The model will include participant and cohort as random effects and arm, time (10, 20, 40 weeks), the randomization stratification variable gender as well as baseline score and a time-by-arm interaction. In order to improve precision we will adjust for variables parent (Y/N) and living with the cared-for individual (Y/N). The model’s assumptions for random effects distributions and residuals will be investigated. If assumptions are not appropriate then transformation will be considered. This model will be used to estimate the mean difference and 95% CI in WEMWBS between arms at the 20-week time point (i.e. primary endpoint) though we will also explore and report the intervention effect at week 10 and 40. The model will be fitted using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Secondary outcome measures will be assessed using similar approach. No interim analyses will be performed.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">It is unlikely that missing baseline data will be problematic for the analysis as baseline outcomes are required to be collected prior to randomization. Further, as the analysis uses a mixed model which is efficient for missing data under the missing at random assumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] no multiple imputation will be performed. Sensitivity analysis will include exploring the mean WEMWBS score at each time point if all participants with missing information was set at the highest and lowest values seen in the dataset.</p>
                  <p id="Par98">Further analysis after the analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will not be blind as this is not feasible. The intervention effect in those that use COPe-support (defined as having at least two logins) will be estimated using a complier adjusted case analysis (CACE) with “usage” treated as both a binary and ordinal variable.</p>

We will explore if the effect worked through the mechanisms underlying the intervention design and as hypothesized by the adapted stress-appraisal-coping model applied in family caregiving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The mechanisms to be investigated include:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par100">Appraisal measured by ECI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] – exploring the effect of cognitive perception of the caregiving situation as the stressor;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par101">Perceived support measured using the support subscale of CWS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] – via use of the peer-to-peer forum and satisfaction with support received;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par102">Mental health knowledge assessed by MAKS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] – via psychoeducation provided by the intervention.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par103">The mediation analysis will allow us to decompose the total observed intervention effect into mediated (indirect) and non-mediated (direct) component and we will use a structural equation modelling approach. Wellbeing (WEMWBS) will be measured at 20 weeks and 40 weeks and mediators at all time points (i.e. 10, 20 and 40 weeks) but “adjusted” for previous level and/or baseline as indicative. We will fit each mediator in turn separately and then undertake a multiple mediation analysis. A full statistical analysis plan will be available on request from the lead trial statistician (VC).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par106">Despite clinical guidelines recommending psychoeducation, especially those delivered to carers using a group format as an effective support for carers, its provision remains scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Caregiving, although bringing positives to both personal experiences and bonds with significant others, often causes burden and distress in carers. Given carers’ wellbeing is correlated with their caregiving capacity, which can also affect the quality of support the cared-for person receives, it is paramount that carers have access to an effective treatment. Digital mental health interventions delivered through the internet offer novel and flexible solutions to disseminating evidence-based psychosocial interventions to carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The trial of COPe-support represents one step closer to providing carers access to digital mental health interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par107">This study will provide valuable evidence regarding the effectiveness of a web-based psychoeducation intervention integrated with peer support for carers. Despite the proliferation of digital mental health interventions, there is scarce research on the effectiveness in the field of psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Meanwhile, carers’ need for such an intervention maybe particularly high given their diverse needs and many other commitments, such as work and their own families. Digital interventions offer advantages in that they increase user autonomy and anonymity, which may be important as stigma and lack of knowledge of, or access to services can impact upon help-seeking behaviour in carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. An intervention delivered through the internet may also offer the only means to provide, through the healthcare system, highly individualised care to a critical mass of carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par108">While optimising all the potentials the internet offers into the study and intervention design, we are aware of the challenges common amongst digital interventions and online trials. Because digital interventions allow their users a self-directed approach in using the content, intervention usage or adherence is often much more heterogenous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Trial attrition and disengagement are also expected issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To account for potential drop out and disengagement, we have devised a facilitation protocol alongside the delivery of COPe-support, drawing strategies and ideas through extensive consultations with carers and a usability study on the intervention-prototype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We have used conservative recruitment and retention estimation taking lessons from the few other similar trials with carer populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, we have also used a trial design that includes an internal pilot with keen monitoring on these parameters. We will review and revise our strategies at end of pilot to scale up to the full trial accordingly. In terms of the usage issue, we have put in place several strategies. We recognise COPe-support is a novel intervention delivered through the internet, and as such a conventional “adherence threshold” or per protocol usage pattern would not be appropriate. As no literature-based usage was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], we consulted experts through experience and clinical and academic experts in the field to identify and define the meaningful usage definitions used in the study protocol. We are particularly interested in understanding (1) how carers will use COPe-support, and (2) if there is a differential intervention effects in those who have decided to log-in COPe-support twice or more and use it in different extent. For such goals, we consider it important to carry out the “complier average causal effect” (CACE) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is because the primary analysis using the ITT model, although the gold standard, will have neglected the usage effects, if any.</p>
              <p id="Par109">To our knowledge, the current study is one of the first to test online psychoeducation integrated with peer support for psychosis carers, compared to an attention control. In addition to enhance participant retention, we are mindful to design the control to match online resources typically available to carers as part of usual care. Although the choice of an attention control may reduce effect sizes, this stricter examination should result in stronger arguments for the use of interactive and moderated web-based interventions (such as COPe-support), rather than non-interactive information passively delivered through the internet.</p>
