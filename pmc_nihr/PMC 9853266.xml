                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Attendees of emergency departments (EDs) have a higher than expected prevalence of smoking. ED attendance may be a good opportunity to prompt positive behaviour change, even for smokers not currently motivated to quit. This study aims to determine whether an opportunist smoking cessation intervention delivered in the ED can help daily smokers attending the ED quit smoking and is cost-effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A two-arm pragmatic, multicentred, parallel-group, individually randomised, controlled superiority trial with an internal pilot, economic evaluation and mixed methods process evaluation. The trial will compare ED-based brief smoking cessation advice, including provision of an e-cigarette and referral to local stop smoking services (intervention) with the provision of contact details for local stop smoking services (control). Target sample size is 972, recruiting across 6 National Health Service EDs in England and Scotland. Outcomes will be collected at 1, 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome at 6 months is carbon monoxide verified continuous smoking abstinence.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The trial was approved by the South Central—Oxford B Research Committee (21/SC/0288). Dissemination will include the publication of outcomes, and the process and economic evaluations in peer-reviewed journals. The findings will also be appropriately disseminated to relevant practice, policy and patient representative groups.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Smoking cessation interventions usually target people who demonstrate initial motivation to quit. However, evidence suggests that ‘unmotivated quitters’, that is, people not actively seeking smoking cessation support at that time, are also aware of the health risks of smoking and many of them are willing to consider quitting.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Smoking rates are four times higher in the most disadvantaged populations compared with the most affluent,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and those with mental health problems are far more likely to smoke.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Both groups are also more likely to attend the emergency department (ED).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Our patient and public involvement (PPI) work, undertaken in 2019, showed that approximately 24% of ED attendees were current smokers, many more than in the wider population estimate of 15% in that same year.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This PPI work was undertaken at four EDs across the UK where a cross section of attendees were asked their smoking status. An ED visit is an ideal opportunity to screen for smoking status and deliver a smoking cessation intervention. There is good evidence that smokers in the ED are willing to consider quitting.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Previous public health interventions in the ED have failed due to time pressures on ED staff delivering those interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>There is inconsistent evidence for smoking cessation interventions delivered in the ED,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> no UK evidence, and no studies have explored using e-cigarettes for smoking cessation support within the ED. E-cigarettes are now the most popular support method for smokers trying to stop<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and there is increasing evidence that they are an effective way to quit.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A Cochrane living review suggests e-cigarettes are two times as effective as nicotine replacement therapy when combined with behavioural support.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, initial start-up costs and lack of information may be barriers to first use.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Providing an e-cigarette starter kit and brief advice, plus referral to support from local stop smoking services, may be a highly effective way of helping people to stop smoking, but has so far not been tested in populations recruited in an opportunistic setting that include unmotivated quitters and people who were not planning to access smoking cessation support.</p>
              <p>This research will provide much needed evidence as to whether a smoking cessation intervention delivered in EDs using e-cigarettes is effective and improves treatment uptake in high prevalence disadvantaged population groups. This is key to meeting Government targets for populations in greatest need, including those in lower socioeconomic and hard to reach groups, and reducing health inequalities.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> This study will also provide evidence of the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in smokers not planning a quit attempt.</p>
              <p>The overarching aim of this trial is to determine if an individually tailored brief intervention that includes behavioural support, provision of an e-cigarette and referral to local smoking cessation services, provides an effective and cost-effective approach to supporting smoking abstinence and/or reduction in unmotivated quitters attending the ED.</p>

                <title>Study design and setting</title>
                <p>The Cessation of smoking trial in the emergency department (CoSTED) trial is a pragmatic two-group, multicentred, randomised, controlled superiority trial with an internal pilot, economic evaluation and process evaluation. It will compare ED-based brief, individually tailored, smoking cessation advice including provision of an e-cigarette and referral to local stop smoking services (intervention) with the provision of contact details for local stop smoking services (control).</p>
                <p>Recruitment to the trial will be over approximately 9 months from 4 January 2022 in six NHS EDs preselected to maximise generalisability of findings based on being representative in deprivation, ethnicity, hospital size (including teaching and district general hospitals) and location (urban and rural). Additional sites will be included if recruitment to target is challenging.</p>

                <p>One member of the public is involved as named member of the trial steering group and a further three PPI representatives are involved in the trial management group (TMG) and advisory group. Three PPI members contributed fully to intervention development by commenting, rating and assessing different e-cigarette starter kits, to enable informed choice of the intervention starter kit for the trial. PPI members have actively contributed to study design and materials and will continue to be consulted throughout the study and invited to contribute to dissemination.</p>

                <p>Potential participants are approached in the ED. Participants are adults (≥18 years) who are daily tobacco smokers (≥1 cigarette or equivalent per day), verified by submitting an expired carbon monoxide (CO) breath test reading of ≥8 ppm. Smokers are ineligible if they require immediate medical treatment as defined by the treating clinician, are in police custody, report a known history of allergy to nicotine replacement products, are already using an e-cigarette daily or do not have capacity to give informed consent for participation. For those requiring translation, the method already used for triage and clinical appointments in the ED is used, following local policies.</p>
                <p>Potential participants admitted to hospital are not excluded, and if allocated to intervention, still receive it in the ED. They are given information on the local hospital smoking and e-cigarette policies.</p>

Participants can either (1) return to the hospital they attended at baseline, (2) undertake remote collection with a CO monitor that is sent to them (an appointment will be made with the central or local team for a video call to retrieve the reading), (3) be visited at their home by a member of the local or central research team or (4) meet with a member of the local or central team at a mutually acceptable place. On completing the 6-month follow-up questionnaire, randomised participants are reimbursed for their time with a £30 shopping voucher. Those who report no longer smoking and also complete the CO verification are offered an additional £30 voucher as reimbursement for their additional time, irrespective of the value of the CO reading.</p>

                  <p>Following trial specific intervention training, the advice will be delivered individually (or with an accompanying person) by a smoking cessation advisor. Protocol driven advice addresses key aspects of the importance of switching away from tobacco smoking, tailored to the participant (eg, discussing improved wound healing for patients attending with an open wound or discussing increased risk of fractures for those who continue to smoke, for those attending with a fracture). This part of the intervention is a single session undertaken within the ED department, in a quiet area or in a separate room if available. Participants are provided with an e-cigarette starter kit (the DotPro starter kit, manufactured by Liberty Flights, an independent e-cigarette manufacturer), which includes approximately 2 weeks supply of refill pods and training on its use. Participants are also offered referral to the local stop smoking service who will provide routine follow-up.</p>
                  <p>Those delivering the intervention, mainly nurses and healthcare assistants, undertook 2.5 days of standardised training and were provided with an intervention manual and videos. Training included online modules from the National Centre for Smoking Cessation (NCSCT) (NCSCT Training and Assessment Programme—core components, then specialty courses for certified practitioners, including modules on ‘mental health and smoking cessation’, ‘pregnancy and smoking cessation’, ‘E-cigarettes: a guide for healthcare professionals’ and ‘very brief advice on secondhand smoke’). Following this, NCSCT level 2 smoking cessation advisor training was delivered by SmokeFree Norfolk and bespoke training on use of e-cigarettes, which was initially delivered face to face and then videorecorded for future training. All those trained had the opportunity to undertake some role-play and/or shadow a trained advisor prior to delivering the intervention themselves. Methods to enhance and assess intervention fidelity are informed by the National Institutes of Health Behaviour Change Consortium fidelity framework.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>

Intervention costs are prospectively recorded alongside the intervention delivery. A self-completion service use questionnaire is used to collect participants’ utilisation of wider healthcare services at baseline and 6-month follow-up. A set of national average unit costs from secondary sources will be applied to derive a healthcare cost profile for each patient. We also collect participants’ out-of-pocket expenditure in relation to smoking cessation to capture potential financial burdens for participants.</p>
                <p>The economic evaluation will use both smoking abstinence at 6 months post randomisation and quality-adjusted life years, derived from EQ-5D-5L,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> as outcomes.</p>
                <p>The primary economic analysis is a within-trial CEA using total costs over the trial period and smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up. As the effects of smoking cessation on health and healthcare utilisation are likely to occur beyond the trial period, to demonstrate the effects beyond the time horizon of the trial we will undertake model-based lifetime projections to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. To reflect the full impact of smoking cessation on health, we will also estimate lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using model-based projections.</p>

The researcher will also broadly document details of the setting, including any smoking and vaping observed in and around the department. This will aid in assessing the context of intervention delivery. A Site Profile Form, completed prior to site observations as part of the Site Initiation Visit, will capture information that will support the researcher observations.

                <p>Data are collected and maintained in accordance with the current legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p>The REDCap database and associated code have been developed by NCTU Data Management, in conjunction with the CoSTED trial team. The database software provides a number of features to help maintain data quality, including maintaining an audit trail, allowing custom validations on all data, allowing users to raise data query requests and search facilities to identify validation failure/missing data.</p>
                <p>After completion of the trial, the database will be retained on the servers of NCTU for on-going analysis of secondary outcomes and held for 5 years in line with our data retention policy.</p>
                <p>The identification, screening and enrolment logs, linking participant identifiable data to the pseudoanonymised patient identification number (PIN), will be held centrally in REDCap to enable us to monitor screening progress and send out the SMS messages and emails. Screening forms will either be held in written form in a locked filing cabinet or electronically in a password protected form on hospital computers. After completion of the trial, the identification, screening and enrolment logs will be stored securely by the sites for 5 years.</p>
                <p>Qualitative interview data will be collected on an audio recorder, or by using computer recording via video conference, and immediately transferred to secure cloud storage (NCTU sharepoint) with access restricted to nominated members of the research team. Audio files will be transcribed verbatim by a member of University of East Anglia (UEA) administrative staff or by an external transcription company. When transcribed, a researcher will assign each transcript a unique study specific number and/or code and remove all identifying information from the transcripts. The anonymised data will be used for analysis and stored securely for 5 years unless otherwise advised by NCTU.</p>
                <p>Observational notes will also be assigned a unique identifying code and stored securely at UEA with access restricted to nominated members of the research team.</p>

The analyses will be reported in full and in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The main planned analyses are summarised below.</p>
                <p>The comparison of outcomes between the treatment groups will be based on the ITT population. This will consist of all randomised individuals according to the group that they were allocated. For individuals who have missing data for the primary outcome, it will be assumed that they are smoking. The primary outcome measure, smoking abstinence, will be compared between treatment groups using a binomial regression model adjusting for the factors stratified in the randomisation and any baseline factors that will be prespecified by the TMG prior to database lock, and the decision will be made blind to treatment allocation. The effect size will be estimated as the relative risk (log link function in the binomial regression) and the risk difference (identity link function).</p>
                <p>Secondary outcome measures will be analysed in a similar fashion, but the regression model will depend on the outcome, specifically, binomial regression for binary outcomes, Poisson/negative binomial for count outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes. If appropriate, non-parametric methods will be used.</p>
                <p>The pattern of missing data will be assessed, and multiple imputation methods will be used to assess for sensitivity of the results to assumptions around the missing data.</p>
