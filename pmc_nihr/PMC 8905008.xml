                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Surgical site infection (SSI) represents a major burden for patients, doctors, and health systems around the world. The aim of this trial is to assess whether the practice of using separate sterile gloves and instruments to close wounds at the end of surgery compared to current routine hospital practice can reduce surgical site infection at 30-days post-surgery for patients undergoing clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty abdominal surgery.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study protocol describes a pragmatic, international, multi-centre, 2-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial, with an internal pilot. Clusters are defined as hospitals within low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Official Development Assistance (ODA) list, where there are at least 4 eligible hospitals per country. Hospitals (clusters) must be in LMICs where glove and instrument change are not currently routine practice. Patients (adults and children) undergoing emergency or elective abdominal surgery for a clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty operation are eligible for inclusion. Before closing the abdominal wall, surgeons and the scrub nurse will change gloves and use separate, sterile instruments (intervention), versus no changing gloves or using separate, sterile instruments (standard practice, control). The primary outcome is SSI within 30 days after surgery, using the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) criteria. Secondary outcomes are SSI before point of hospital discharge, and readmission, reoperation, length of hospital stay, return to normal activities, and death up to 30-days after surgery. A 12-month internal pilot, including 12 clusters and approximately 600 participants, aims to assess adherence to allocation and follow-up of patients. The main trial is powered to detect a minimum reduction in the primary outcome from 16 to 12%. A total of 12,800 participants will be recruited from 64 clusters (hospitals) each including at least 200 participants.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Change of gloves and sterile instruments prior to fascial closure in abdominal surgery is a low-cost, simple, intraoperative intervention which involves all members of the surgical and scrub team. If effective at reducing SSI, this practice could be readily implemented across all contexts. The findings of this trial will inform future guideline updates from international healthcare organisations, including the World Health Organization.</p>

                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par23">Surgical site infection (SSI) represents a major burden for patients, doctors, and health systems around the world but is potentially preventable. SSI is the commonest postoperative complication across all income and development settings, and the commonest healthcare-associated infection in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has been associated with one third of postoperative deaths and accounts for 8% of all deaths caused by a nosocomial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rates vary significantly between different types of surgery, but it is particularly prevalent in abdominal operations with as many as one in four patients having an SSI when the operation involves the bowel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. SSIs cause pain and discomfort, increasing the time taken to return to work and other normal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; in resource-limited settings, this is disproportionately high since personal income is less and patients are required to pay for their own treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The GlobalSurg-2 cohort study captured the incidence of SSI in these patients, demonstrating how it affects people around the world and how those in the poorest setting are at greatest risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Whilst there are no direct data on the costs of SSI in LMICs, the burden of increased healthcare costs on patients, communities, and providers in low-income settings is likely to be substantial. Reducing SSI has an important impact on patients around the world.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="Sec5">
                  <title>Rationale</title>
                  <p id="Par24">Improving surgical outcomes is a global health priority, highlighted by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines made 29 recommendations for measures to prevent SSI, but there was little high-quality evidence to support most of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A Delphi consensus was undertaken by an international panel of surgeons to identify the WHO recommendations in greatest need of better supporting evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The WHO recommendations for change of gloves and sterile instruments at the time of fascial closure were identified as the priority recommendations.</p>
                  <p id="Par25">Specific evidence for SSI reduction with glove and instrument change before fascial closure is limited, including only small RCTs at high risk of bias; three studies have been published to date, all suggesting a benefit. The largest RCT (<italic>n</italic> = 182) included patients undergoing pancreatic surgery in a single Japanese hospital, finding a significantly lower SSI rates in the intervention group (2.2% v 12.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Of the two other RCTs, the first (<italic>n</italic> = 92) demonstrated a reduction in the risk of SSI after vascular surgery (5.0%) versus 12.5%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These early clinical data support the need for a major, pragmatic multicentre trial in LMICs where the burden of complications is greatest.</p>
                  <p id="Par26">Due to the heterogeneous evidence base, CDC, WHO, and NICE guidelines do not make recommendations on the practice of change of gloves/instruments as part of routine care. The executive summary of the 2017 WHO Guidelines on SSI reduction practice states: As there is no direct evidence of the effectiveness of sterile surgical instruments to wound closure, well-designed RCTs would be welcome. Studies should be conducted in high-, low-, and middle-income countries and include different surgical procedures using an SSI outcome defined according to CDC criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par28">The aim of the 12-month internal pilot is to assess (1) whether hospitals adhere to their allocation and (2) what proportion of patients who are eligible for ChEETAh can be followed up successfully at 30 days after their surgery.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">STOP-GO criteria will be assessed at 12 months following the commencement of recruitment. A traffic light system will be used to determine feasibility of progression to the main trial:

                  <p id="Par33">The primary objective is to assess whether the practice of using separate, sterile gloves, and instruments to close wounds at the end of surgery can reduce surgical site infection at 30-days post-surgery for patients undergoing clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty abdominal surgery, compared to current routine hospital practice.</p>
                  <p id="Par34">The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of changing gloves/instruments prior to wound closure compared to current routine hospital practice on secondary clinical outcomes up to 30 days post-surgery including: SSI during the in-hospital stay, re-admission, re-operation, length of hospital stay, return to normal activities, and death.</p>

                <p id="Par35">CHEETAH is an international, multicentre, 2-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot, to evaluate the use of separate sterile gloves and instruments at the time of wound closure to reduce SSI rates in patients undergoing surgery with an abdominal incision. Clusters are defined as hospitals. Clusters will be randomly allocated (1:1) to change of gloves and instruments (intervention group) or current routine hospital practice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Randomisation will be minimised by country (minimum participating of four clusters per country in order to achieve balance by treatment arm) and hospital type (referral hospital (yes or no) where a referral hospital is defined as a hospital that accepts pre-operative referrals from other surgical teams).

                <p id="Par37">Eligible hospitals (clusters) are any LMIC hospital performing abdominal surgery where glove and instrument change is not currently routine practice. LMICs are defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Official Development Assistance (ODA) list where there are at least 4 eligible hospitals per country. Participating sites are planned for inclusion from seven LMICs in total including (alphabetically) Benin, Ghana, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Rwanda, and South Africa.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par38">In clean (non-contaminated) surgery, the infection rate is low and benefits from research into interventions targeting SSI rates in those patients are limited. CHEETAH will therefore focus on clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty surgery.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Patients (adults and children) undergoing emergency or elective abdominal surgery for any indication (including trauma), with an intra-operative finding of clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty operation with at least one abdominal incision of 5 cm or greater are eligible for inclusion. Patients undergoing caesarean section will be excluded, as in many sites in LMICs, there is a risk they dominate recruitment and prevent a representative case-mix for other types of abdominal surgery. CHEETAH has no defined age limits, but each participating country will define age criteria based on country-specific regulatory approval processes.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Each participating hospital will develop a local pathway to recruit eligible patients. Potentially eligible patients can be identified by any member of the surgical team (research nurse, clinical officer, surgeon in training, operating surgeon), either before, during, or after surgery but before discharge.</p>

                <p id="Par41">Individual patient-level consent for exposure to the intervention or routine hospital practice is not possible since the randomisation is at the hospital level. Hospitals randomised to the intervention are likely to change practice for all patients once randomised.</p>
                <p id="Par42">All patients undergoing abdominal surgery and who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be followed up at 30-days post-surgery. Consent for data collection in the context of the CHEETAH trial protocol will be for data collection only and will be sought at the 30-days post-surgery follow-up time point. Other data collected is collected as part of normal practice.</p>
                <p id="Par43">For patients returning as part of routine care at 30-days, written consent will be sought for the collection of the 30-day follow-up data. A patient information sheet (PIS) (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) will be provided to those patients providing written informed consent (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), following which patients are asked to give informed consent to participate in the trial. The PIS has been translated into appropriate languages as advised by local research ethics committees.</p>
                <p id="Par44">Those patients that do not return to hospital as part of standard care, will be contacted by telephone, and will be asked to provide explicit verbal consent during the call for the collection of trial-related data at 30 days, and this will be clearly documented on the CHEETAH 30-day follow-up case report form (CRF) (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>_CHEEATH Adult CRF 30 day Follow-up_verbal consent).

                  <p id="Par47">The intervention used within CHEETAH is change of gloves and use of separate, sterile instruments before closing the abdominal wall.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">In sites randomised to the intervention group, since the final level of contamination may not be known until during the operation, all cases need to be prepared for glove and instrument change, if required. Clean instruments should be set to one side if using instruments from the main tray (e.g. needle holder, forceps, suture scissor tied in a swab). If using instruments from a new pack, these should be available in the operating theatre but unopened. When to change gloves and use clean instruments: change of gloves and instruments should be undertaken for all clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty surgeries. After completion of the abdominal component of the operation and at the time of the count of surgical swabs and instruments (preparing for the ‘sign out’ component of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), the surgical team should confirm eligibility of the participant.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">If the patient is eligible, the surgical team should change gloves and use the clean instruments before handling the wound edges to facilitate closure. This includes two key components: (1) gloves: change of sterile gloves (or outer gloves if double gloved) for operating surgeon, assistant surgeon(s), and scrub staff (2); instruments: a sterile set of instruments should be used for abdominal wall closure including a needle holder, forceps, and scissors. This should be implemented in each hospital according to local practice and availability. For example, they can be separated from the main instruments at the start of the operation by the scrub nurse (e.g. wrapped in a clean swab). Alternatively, a new instrument(s) pack may need to be opened.</p>
                  <p id="Par50">Through site surveys to address trial feasibility, most hospitals do not require additional instrument packs. Where required, Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit will work with Hubs to provide this, where feasible. The additional gloves required for the trial will be funded as part of the hospital’s normal glove purchasing processes (and then reimbursed via the Hub), to provide efficiencies in terms of supply and stock. The ICC/BCTU and the Hubs will request a report from individual hospitals for accountability of interventions.</p>

Intervention adherence will be monitored locally and centrally using the in-theatre CHEETAH Register, with the use of sterile gloves and instruments before fascial closure recorded for every case in a participating centre (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>).</p>

To detect an absolute difference of 4% (relative reduction of 25%) to 12%, with 90% power and using a 5% two-sided significance level, it requires 1580 participants in each group. To allow for clustering of centres the sample size was adjusted by inflating the estimate by the design effect given by 1 + (<italic>n</italic>–1)<italic>ρ</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the average cluster size and <italic>ρ</italic> is the estimated intra-class correlation coefficient. The intra-class correlation coefficient calculated from GlobalSurg 2 feasibility data was 0.02 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We expect this to be lower in ChEETAh; there are a smaller number of centres within a limited number of countries where there is willingness to participate in a clinical trial, hence less variation is likely. With an assumption of an intra-class correlation coefficient value of 0.01, power calculations indicated that we need 30 clusters per treatment group with an average of 170 participants per cluster. After allowing for 15% loss to follow-up rate for participants and 5% drop out rate for clusters, the total sample size is 6400 per group (32 clusters per group with an average of 200 participants). This sample size also allows the cluster size to vary (coefficient of variation = 0.5). The sample size was calculated using the clustersampsi Command in Stata 15 (StataCorp LLC, TX, USA).</p>

                  <title>Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes {18a}</title>
                  <p id="Par86">Patients will be reviewed, at the time of discharge from hospital, and at post-operative day 30. All patients who have been registered and operated on regardless of adherence to the randomised hospital allocation should be followed up.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">The primary outcome will be captured from the time of the index surgery until postoperative day 30. Once registered into the CHEETAH trial, the patient will be contacted on or after, but as close as possible to post-operative day 30 by a member of the research team (from the Hub or Spoke) to complete the 30-day follow-up assessment. If a patient achieves the primary outcome before 30 days, they should still be assessed at 30 days to record secondary outcome measures.</p>
                  <p id="Par88">Follow-up will be completed in-person for those returning to hospital as part of standard, routine care; all other patients will be followed up by telephone 30-days post-surgery.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">For patients being followed-up by telephone, they will be required to answer questions from a standardised script of questions to assess for SSI (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Within the GlobalSurg-2 cohort study, 43.1% (6907/16015) of patients were approached for telephone assessment, providing initial feasibility evidence for this approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Validity of telephone wound follow-up after hospital discharge has been demonstrated in several high-quality studies. In the UK, the Bluebelle trial used telephone-based SSI follow-up for primary outcome assessment with high sensitivity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. A study from the USA demonstrated equivalent rates of SSI between groups undergoing telephone follow-up and in-person assessment after caesarean section [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In LMICs, a pre- and post-implementation study of SSI reduction measures across four sub-Saharan African countries published in <italic>Lancet Infectious Disease</italic> successfully used telephone follow-up of the primary outcome measure (SSI according to CDC criteria) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Validation studies in Tanzania and Kenya have also demonstrated accuracy of telephone surveillance for postoperative SSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Over 80% of the population of LMICs have access to a mobile telephone justifying the use of an efficient, telephone-based follow-up pathway in CHEETAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par90">In CHEETAH, a member of the site research team will contact the patient and ask the questions from the follow-up form. In the case of children, a member of the site research team will contact the parent/guardian and ask the questions from the follow-up form. SSI will be determined by a computer-based algorithm and defined according to the CDC criteria. Outcome assessor(s) will be trained to ask a series of specific questions and to record the responses provided by the patient. The algorithm will determine whether the primary outcome has been met, overcoming the subjective interpretation of CDC criteria, which has potential to introduce bias.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">Other questions, as indicated, will be completed from a review of the patient notes during admission, checking hospital records (electronic or paper), discharge summaries and handover lists for re-attendances or re-admissions and checking for emergency department re-attendances.</p>

A brief outline of the analysis is given below. All analysis will be based on the intention to treat principle, i.e. participants from all hospitals will be analysed in the groups to which the hospitals were allocated. Summary statistics will be presented for all outcome measures, with the relevant adjusted effect measures, 95% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic>-values from two-sided tests. The effect of intervention will be adjusted for country and hospital type (district versus referral hospital). For all binary outcomes, adjusted relative risks (with 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated using log binomial regression models. The adjusted model will include country and hospital type as fixed effects and centre as a random effect to account for the clustered nature of the sample. If the log-binomial model fails to converge, a Poisson regression model with robust standard errors will be used to estimate the same parameters. If this also fails to converge, unadjusted estimates will be produced from the log-binomial model taking account the cluster design. It will be made clear in the final report why this occurred (e.g. not possible due to low event rate/lack of model convergence). For all time to event outcomes, Cox-proportional hazards models will be used, if the assumptions of proportionally are met, and adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals presented. A log-rank test will be used to assess statistical significance. The primary analysis for the study will occur once all participants have completed the 30-day follow-up assessment, corresponding outcome data has been entered onto the study database, and it has been validated ready for analysis. We will conduct sensitivity analysis on imbalanced factors between trial arms, which are expected in a cluster randomised design.</p>

The DMC will operate in accordance with a trial specific charter based upon the template created by the Damocles Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The DMC will meet at least annually unless there is a specific reason to amend the schedule. The DMC is scheduled to meet prior to the trial commencing and at 1 year after the trial opens to recruitment and then annually thereafter until the trial closes to recruitment. Additional meetings may be called if recruitment is much faster than anticipated and the DMC may, at their discretion, request to meet more frequently or continue to meet following completion of recruitment. An emergency meeting may also be convened if required. The DMC will advise the chair of the TSC if, in their view, any of the randomised comparisons in the trial have provided proof beyond reasonable doubt that for all, or for some types of patient one particular intervention is definitely indicated or definitely contra-indicated in terms of a net difference of a major outcome. Appropriate criteria of proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely, but a difference of at least <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (similar to a Haybittle-Peto2 stopping boundary) in an interim analysis of a major outcome may be required to justify halting, or modifying, the trial prematurely. If this criterion were to be adopted, it would have the practical advantage that the exact number of interim analyses would be of little importance, so no fixed schedule is proposed. Given the proposed use of the Haybittle-Peto boundary no adjustment for multiple testing (to control the overall type I error rate) is proposed, i.e. the threshold for statistical significance at final analysis will still be <italic>p</italic> = 0.05.</p>

However, most of these deaths will be a consequence of the condition the patients presented with which leads to the need for surgery. It is possible that there may be a difference in the rate of death between the two arms of the trial if SSIs are reduced in one arm. However, this will not be detected by expedited reporting because (i) the proportion of deaths due to the trial intervention will be small compared to the background risk of death and differences will be difficult, if not impossible to detect by reporting of individual deaths, and (ii) this is a cluster RCT so adjustment for the clustering will be required to explore whether crude differences in death rates are due to the intervention.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par115">CHEETAH represents one of the largest, international, cluster randomised trial in the surgical setting. The range of hospitals participating is varied and truly representative of the global network. The findings of this trial will provide evidence to influence international clinical guidelines such as the WHO recommendations on preoperative measures for SSI prevention and finally determine if the practice of change of gloves and instruments at the time of abdominal wound closure, which incur considerable costs in LMICs, reduce SSI, and will provide evidence that will impact on surgical practice everywhere. CHEETAH aims to produce high quality, generalisable data that will impact on surgical practice around the world. SSIs cause pain and discomfort, increasing the time taken to return to work and other normal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; this has an important impact on patients around the world. In resource-limited settings, this is disproportionately high since personal income is less and patients are required to pay for their own treatments and dressings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par116">A key design consideration for this trial is minimizing and monitoring for selection bias. Selection bias risks are being introduced in two ways. First is if centres change the operating theatres that they choose to collect data from after randomisation (e.g. choose not to collect data from an emergency theatre if randomised to the control arm). Secondly is if centres do not collect data on all consecutive patients undergoing surgery in pre-specified operating theatres within the hospital (cluster). We have carefully pre-specified a monitoring plan and several quality controls to mitigate against these risks. First, all centres must pre-specify the operating theatres which they will collect data from before randomisation on the Baseline Hospital Characteristics CRF (see Appendix <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). We will report this as a protocol deviation to the TMG and TSC and report this transparently in the final trial report. Secondly, we will issue a ChEETAh trial register to every participating theatre in every hospital (cluster). Every operated case in that theatre will be recorded in the theatre logbook. Eligibility is then assessed by the trained operating team, and details of all abdominal cases are included in the ChEETAh trial register, including the use (or not) of the trial intervention of change of gloves and sterile instruments for fascial closure will all be documented. This ChEETAh register can then be checked regularly against the existing in-theatre paper or electronic logbooks to monitor for selection bias. Again, these data will be regularly reviewed by the TMG and TSC.</p>
              <p id="Par117">Cluster randomised trials are common in global health but rare for evaluation of intraoperative interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One prominent example of an in-theatre intervention applied at a cluster level was the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this before-and-after quality improvement study, a system-level approach was taken to implementation at a hospital level, with a focus on training, local advocacy, and context adaptation to maximise adherence. Similarly, in ChEETAh, a cluster randomised design was thought to be most appropriate due to the whole-theatre team approach to implementation of change of sterile gloves and instruments at the time of fascia. During the ChEETAh design phase, the international collaboration group felt that individual randomisation would be too challenging for local teams, with high risk of contamination across groups. There is also a baseline level of sterile glove and instrument change expected in control centres (i.e. where this practice is not routine, but is indicated by the clinical situation such as gross contamination of the gloves), which would have led to difficulties in monitoring intervention adherence.</p>
              <p id="Par118">The intervention tested within ChEETAh was prioritised as part of a global consensus process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Change of sterile gloves and instruments at the time of fascial closure was found not to be routine practice in the collaborating centres, and have high acceptability, with community equipoise. If a beneficial effect of change of gloves and instruments is detected in ChEETAh, the costs incurred for health systems would be low, and the intervention is likely to be cost-effective. A paired health-economic analysis of the ChEETAh trial has been preplanned and informed from data both collected within ChEETAh and from our collaborating countries in previous SSI trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Implementation has already begun as part of trial training, and this will support uptake into local policy, guidelines and practice upon reporting of the trial.</p>
              <p id="Par119">Outcome assessment is also a challenge in a trial of this magnitude. As all consecutive eligible patients enter the trial, in-person follow-up could overwhelm high-volume centres. In addition, there remain concerns around the world about risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection in the outpatient setting. Therefore, we have opted for remote, telephone-based follow-up as the primary method of outcome assessment in ChEETAh, with a telephone interview schedule based on the US Centre for Disease Control criteria. This has precedent in the Pragmatic multi-centre factorial randomised controlled trial testing measures to reduce surgical site infection in low- and middle-income countries (FALCON) trial where 38.1% were followed-up by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par122">The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery identified that 5 billion people lack access to safe, affordable surgical and anaesthesia. An estimated 4.2 million people will die each year within 30 days of surgery—more than from all causes related to HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. High-quality collaborative research and training are essential to improve mortality and outcomes following surgery for patients in LMIC. The NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Global Surgery represents a £15-million investment by the UK government in infrastructure for high-quality research in surgery targeted towards priority topics in surgical care. NIHR GSU has worked with international partners to establish research Hubs in sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian sub-continent, South-East Asia, and Central America. It is led by the University of Birmingham in partnership with the University of Edinburgh and international partners from the GlobalSurg Collaborative in a range of LMICs.</p>
