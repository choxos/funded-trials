                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The provision of independent prescribing rights for United Kingdom (UK) pharmacists has enabled them to prescribe within their area of competence. The aim of this study was to evaluate an evidence-based training programme designed to prepare Pharmacist Independent Prescribers (PIPs) to safely and effectively assume responsibility for pharmaceutical care of older people in care homes in the UK, within a randomised controlled trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The training and competency assessment process included two training days, professional development planning against a bespoke competency framework, mentor support, and a viva with an independent General Practitioner (GP). Data on the PIPs’ perceptions of the training were collected through evaluation forms immediately after the training days and through online questionnaires and interviews after delivery of the 6-month intervention. Using a mixed method approach each data set was analysed separately then triangulated providing a detailed evaluation of the process. Kaufman’s Model of Learning Evaluation guided interpretations.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">All 25 PIPs who received the training completed an evaluation form (<italic>N</italic> = 25). Post-intervention questionnaires were completed by 16 PIPs and 14 PIPs took part in interviews. PIPs reported the training days and mentorship enabled them to develop a personalised portfolio of competence in preparation for discussion during a viva with an independent GP. Contact with the mentor reduced as PIPs gained confidence in their role. PIPs applied their new learning throughout the delivery of the intervention leading to perceived improvements in residents’ quality of life and medicines management. A few PIPs reported that developing a portfolio of competence was time intensive, and that further training on leadership skills would have been beneficial.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">The bespoke training programme was fit for purpose. Mentorship and competency assessment were resource intensive but appropriate. An additional benefit was that many PIPs reported professional growth beyond the requirement of the study.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par10">Care homes for older people provide support for those individuals who require 24-h care either with or without nursing. Although dementia is the most common reason for admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], many residents have multiple morbidities and associated medicines. The average number of medicines prescribed regularly to residents’ ranges from 6 to 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Research in the UK identified 70% of residents were exposed to a medicines-related error daily resulting in a government call for interventions to reduce this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">The most common intervention to optimise medicines use in care homes has been the deployment of pharmacists who draw on their clinical skills of patient-centred history taking, diagnostic reasoning and pharmacological knowledge to review medication and provide advice on medicines systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Whilst shown to reduce the number of prescribed medicines and improve medication appropriateness, current models have failed to adequately demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes. Identification of more effective models of care have therefore been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Study and training context</title>
                <p id="Par12">The legal provision of prescribing rights to pharmacists in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] allows them to prescribe and make changes to prescriptions without authorisation from a medical practitioner and therefore to assume responsibility for medicines optimisation activities within care homes. The UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the Care Homes Independent Pharmacist Prescriber Study (CHIPPS) to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this new model of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The CHIPPS intervention involved a triad of stakeholders: a Pharmacist Independent Prescriber (PIP), General Practitioner (GP) and staff in the care home from which residents were recruited. All PIPs had a postgraduate qualification in Independent Prescribing and took responsibility for medicines management for participating residents and offered general support and training to the care homes. Early-stage stakeholder engagement identified a need for reassurance regarding pharmacist independent prescribers’ competence to undertake this role in such a frail and elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The legislation enabling independent prescribing by non-medical prescribers states that prescribers only prescribe within their area of competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Consequently, it is usual to undertake training prior to undertaking the role, this was the aim of the CHIPPS pharmacist training.</p>
                <p id="Par13">A literature review identified limited evidence about the training needs for pharmacists working within care homes, possibly because without prescribing rights, recommendations are checked and authorised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in the CHIPPS study pharmacists were autonomous practitioners, therefore requiring assessment of competence before commencing the role.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Extensive multidisciplinary team engagement followed by feasibility testing with four pharmacist prescribers resulted in a training package for use within the main trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Training was delivered by a multidisciplinary team from across primary care, including senior experienced care home pharmacists, general practitioners and consultant geriatricians. Each PIP undertook two days’ face-to-face training primarily to cover the management of prescribing and deprescribing (stopping problematic medicines) for older people with complex health needs. Teaching methods included using exemplar real life case studies, personal reflection and discussion on managing challenging prescribing activity. In person training was followed by four days to develop relationships with the care homes, medical practices and community pharmacists with whom they would be working (see supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> CHIPPS competency framework and training programme). The PIP, or their employer, was reimbursed for this time. PIPs were each allocated a mentor, an experienced pharmacist, who worked with them using the competency framework to create a professional development plan. PIPs subsequently collated a portfolio of evidence to demonstrate competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. They then undertook a viva with an independent GP, to sign off their competence in independent prescribing in care homes.</p>
                <p id="Par15">Within the CHIPPS study PIPs delivered the intervention over six-months in line with an agreed service specification, including agreeing a care plan with residents, care staff and the GP and ensuring regular monitoring of medicines (see supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> CHIPPS Intervention Service Specification). The feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that PIPs wanted more instruction on how to use pharmaceutical care plans (PCPs: a written individualised medicine plan with clear therapeutic goals) so this was added to the training (see supplementary file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> CHIPPS competency framework and training programme). The 2-day face-to-face training also included sessions specific to the research aspects of the CHIPPS intervention.</p>

This enabled us to separate training input from training process, and micro-outcomes (specific to PIPs) from macro-outcomes (relating to GPs, care home staff and residents, and any societal benefits). Kaufman’s Model was appropriate to understanding the PIPs’ views on resources used in training and how training was delivered; and whether there was new learning, whether such new learning was used when delivering the CHIPPS service and the outcomes from new learning for the PIP and other stakeholders.</p>

Several PIPs had to travel from Northern Ireland and Scotland to attend training sessions held in Norfolk (England) and while all appreciated the face-to-face delivery, this was identified as requiring additional personal resources.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par40">This evaluation of the bespoke training provided for pharmacist independent prescribers was sufficient to enable them to take responsibility for care home residents’ medicine review and medication management. The professional learning and confidence they developed had impact beyond the CHIPPS intervention. The use of a tailored personal development programme acknowledged pharmacists’ individual prior skills and knowledge. A novel aspect of this research-based training programme was that pharmacists underwent a viva with an independent GP experienced in older people medicine management before delivering the research intervention. This facilitated the implementation of the CHIPPS intervention as GPs and care home staff had confidence in the pharmacist’s clinical competence. This method of training and assessment of competency has transferability to other intervention studies where health professionals are delivering medical interventions in unfamiliar health contexts.</p>
              <p id="Par41">The training programme was developed to equip pharmacists with the professional competence to undertake medicines management for older people living in care homes. Formal training on administration of specific medicines is not unusual, but our training had a focus on the more complex aspects of prescribing and deprescribing in older people with multimorbidity, a relatively new role for pharmacists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and one which could challenge another professional’s decision-making. The study process evaluation found there was extensive medication-related activity from all PIPs across all therapeutic groups suggesting that new learning was applied. A vital document in the study was the PCP completed by the pharmacist for each resident. The PCP was relevant to professional accountability and audit but was also a key research study document enabling researchers to analyse prescribing and deprescribing activity. Our results highlighted that PIPs perceived they needed training on the use of the PCP. This resonates with work by Benson et al. who used a Delphi study to reach consensus on the training needs of primary care pharmacists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In that study formulating, implementing and documenting care plans was identified as a training need.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Another intended outcome from the training programme was to educate the pharmacists in the research process and their role within it. While pharmacists are likely to be interested in and supportive of research, it is less likely that they have personal experience of research procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In our study immediately after the training days pharmacists agreed that information on research processes was required. However, during post-intervention data collection, the PIPs’ reflections on the training now focused on the benefit they had gained from the elements relating to prescribing and deprescribing for older people and the time to undertake personally directed professional development. It is likely that the research processes had become embedded in everyday practices after six-months of delivering the intervention, but the more tangible transferable generic skills of medicines management and deprescribing remained important to these pharmacists as health care professionals. This reflects suggestions by Sargeant et al. that professional development should be grounded in everyday practice and be of direct benefit to patients if it is also to support quality improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Clearly, were this intervention to be rolled out, the research elements of the training programme would be unnecessary.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The interprofessional elements of the training programme, with sessions led by hospital geriatricians and GPs, and a competency assessment by a GP were aspects particularly welcomed by the PIPs and identified as supporting clinical skill development. This supports other calls for training programmes to integrate interprofessional teams and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par44">PIPs suggested areas where the training could be improved; these focused predominantly on accessibility to training sessions and more detail on how to build strong relationships, especially where the PIP had not worked previously with the GP. While remote training is becoming the norm and would remove travel demands, there remain challenges using remote delivery methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, a refresher mid-way through the trial might be successfully managed remotely as group cohesion would have been developed.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p id="Par45">A strength of the study is that post-intervention data collection was undertaken soon after the pharmacist ended the intervention thereby reducing likelihood of recall bias. However, this means there are no data on whether the benefits reported are enduring. Further work would be required to evaluate long term impact. A limitation is that a full data set was not collected from all PIPs who delivered the intervention, however, the sample was representative of PIP characteristics including length of experience as a pharmacist and an independent prescriber.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par46">This interdisciplinary, empirically based training programme successfully enabled pharmacist independent prescribers to further develop clinical decision-making skills which enabled them to have the confidence and skills necessary to take responsibility for prescribing and medicines management in care homes. The focus on complex deprescribing was an area new to several pharmacists but the provision of a competency framework and assessment meant they all expressed confidence in delivering this intervention. Furthermore, the pharmacist's professional growth appeared to extend beyond the confines of the research study.</p>
              <p id="Par47">While the training, mentorship and competency assessment might appear resource intensive for a six-month intervention, many PIPs reported benefits beyond the study. In future, there is a need to consider a training approach which prepares pharmacists not only with clinical skills but also with higher level management skills to support relationship building across new teams.</p>
