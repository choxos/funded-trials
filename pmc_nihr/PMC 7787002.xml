                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study comprised a prospective baseline period, a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 52-week open-label period. Up to six protocol-specified concomitant preventive medications were allowed if patients were on a stable dose for 2 months prior to the prospective baseline period. Patients were randomized 1:1 to monthly subcutaneous galcanezumab (300 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was overall mean change from baseline in weekly attack frequency with galcanezumab compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints were ≥50% response rate and percentage of patients meeting sustained response. Results from the double-blind treatment period are reported.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 237 patients were randomized and treated (120 placebo; 117 galcanezumab). At baseline, the mean age was 45 years and 63% were using ≥1 preventive drug. The primary endpoint was not met; mean change in weekly attack frequency was −4.6 placebo versus −5.4 galcanezumab (<italic>p</italic> = 0.334). Key secondary endpoints also were not met. Injection site-related treatment-emergent adverse events were more common in the galcanezumab than the placebo group, with significantly more injection site erythema.</p>

                  <p>Treatment with galcanezumab 300 mg did not achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints. This study underscores the potential distinct biology of cCH as well as the significant unmet need for safe, effective, and well-tolerated preventive treatment. The safety profile of galcanezumab in cCH is consistent with that observed in trials of episodic CH and migraine.</p>

              <p>Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by attacks of intense unilateral headache, restlessness or agitation, and ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (<xref rid="bibr1-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Attacks occur near daily to multiple times daily during cluster periods. The two subtypes, episodic CH (eCH) and chronic CH (cCH), are differentiated by the presence and duration of attack-free remission periods. Chronic cluster headache, affecting up to 20% of patients (<xref rid="bibr3-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), is associated with cluster periods lasting 1 year or longer without remission or with remission periods lasting less than 3 months (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The disease burden of cCH is substantial (<xref rid="bibr5-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Current guidelines for CH prevention (<xref rid="bibr6-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) are based on a small body of evidence and few controlled trials.

              <p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is implicated in the pathophysiology of CH and migraine (<xref rid="bibr8-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). CGRP is highly expressed in anatomical locations activated during cluster headache and migraine, such as the trigeminal ganglion neurons and peripheral projections of the trigeminal nerve (<xref rid="bibr9-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

More recently, infusion of CGRP was shown to induce cluster headache attacks in patients with episodic and less predictably in chronic CH (<xref rid="bibr15-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p>
              <p>Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds CGRP and prevents its biological activity (<xref rid="bibr16-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In Phase 3 trials in patients with episodic and chronic migraine, galcanezumab treatment demonstrated clinically meaningful changes in migraine headache days, and a favorable safety profile (<xref rid="bibr17-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr19-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).

                <p>The prospective baseline period began after the patient completed screening and washout of excluded medications, and upon experiencing a CH attack (hereafter “attack”) and beginning to record their attack information and acute medication use in an electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) diary. Fourteen consecutive days from the ePRO diary were used to determine eligibility, establish baseline attack frequency and baseline use of acute medications; hereafter, this 14-day eligibility period is referred to as the baseline period. Patients meeting entry criteria were then randomized (1:1) to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with monthly subcutaneous injections of placebo or galcanezumab 300 mg. Treatment was assigned using a computer-generated random sequence generated by an interactive web response system, programmed using the dynamic allocation method (<xref rid="bibr23-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) to balance treatment arms for gender, average daily attack frequency ( ≤ 4 attacks per day/ &gt; 4 attacks per day), verapamil use (yes/no), and investigative site.</p>
                <p>Investigational product was administered by blinded trained staff. Galcanezumab was supplied as a lyophilized formulation in glass vials, and placebo was administered as 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. Galcanezumab and placebo were administered by blinded personnel using single dose, disposable syringes that were visibly indistinguishable from each other, with blinded labels containing subject number and study name. Patients in both groups received three injections at each dosing visit. Syringe preparation was completed by designated unblinded site personnel, not involved in clinical aspects of the study, including investigational product administration, clinical evaluations, and adverse event assessments.</p>

                <p>This study enrolled males and females, aged 18 to 65 years with a history of cCH, without a remission period, or with remissions lasting &lt;1 month, for at least 1 year as defined by ICHD-3 beta (<xref rid="bibr24-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the criteria that were in effect until enrollment was completed. The diagnostic criteria for cCH have since been updated and the duration of the remission periods changed to &lt;3 months (<xref rid="bibr4-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). During the baseline period, patients must have had at least eight total attacks, at least one attack every other day, and a maximum of eight attacks/day (<xref rid="bibr24-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p>
                <p>Patients were excluded from the study if they had any current or past exposure to any CGRP antibody, any antibody to the CGRP receptor, or nerve growth factor antibodies. Patients suspected of having another distinct trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) or using indomethacin to treat another suspected TAC were also excluded. If indomethacin was used to treat another condition, patients had to complete a washout period prior to the prospective baseline period. Additionally, patients who had used botulinum toxin type A or type B in the head or neck area within 4 months of the prospective baseline period were declared a screen fail and discontinued; however, these patients were allowed to rescreen for the study once, after they had completed the 4-month washout period for botulinum toxin type A or type B. Patients with a serious or unstable medical condition that precluded study participation, including (but not limited to) patients with a significant risk for suicide, history of substance abuse or dependence in the past year, history of stroke or intracranial aneurysm, or at risk for serious or acute cardiovascular events based on history or electrocardiogram findings, were also excluded. Supplemental material 1 shows the complete details of all inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p>
                <p>The following acute treatments for attacks were allowed: High-flow oxygen, oral triptans, subcutaneous and intranasal sumatriptan, intranasal zolmitriptan, acetaminophen/ paracetamol, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients could use up to six prespecified preventive treatments for cCH (verapamil ≤ 480 mg/day, lithium, valproate, gabapentin, melatonin, and topiramate) provided they were on a stable dose for at least 2 months prior to the prospective baseline period and the dose remained stable throughout double-blind treatment. No other acute or preventive treatments for cCH were allowed.</p>

                <title>Efficacy assessments</title>
                <p>Patients recorded attack-related information in an ePRO diary daily during the prospective baseline period, double-blind treatment period, and the first month of the open-label period. Patients recorded the number of attacks, average attack duration, average attack pain severity, and acute medication use for cCH. Pain severity was rated as: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe (<xref rid="bibr25-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The daily diary data were converted into biweekly intervals for analysis (weeks 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12 for the double-blind period).</p>
                <p>The primary endpoint was the overall mean change from baseline in weekly attack frequency across weeks 1–12 of the double-blind treatment period with galcanezumab compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints were a) estimated mean percentage of patients with a ≥50% reduction from baseline in weekly attack frequency across weeks 1–12 and b) percentage of patients meeting sustained response through week 12. Sustained response was defined as a ≥50% reduction in the weekly attack frequency from baseline to weeks 3/4 and maintained at weeks 5/6, weeks 7/8, weeks 9/10, and weeks 11/12. Patients discontinuing study treatment prior to weeks 11/12 were not considered sustained responders.</p>
                <p>Other secondary assessments were: Mean change in weekly attack frequency from baseline to each 2-week interval through week 12; percentage of patients with a ≥50% reduction in weekly attack frequency from baseline at each 2-week interval through week 12; percentage of patients with a ≥30% reduction in weekly attack frequency from baseline at each 2-week interval through week 12; and percentage of patients reporting a score of 1 (“very much better”) or 2 (“much better”) on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scale at week 4, week 8, and week 12.</p>
                <p>Pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy measure included these variables: Sex, race, ethnicity, age, baseline average number of attacks, baseline verapamil use, and region. Overall baseline preventive use was a post-hoc subgroup analysis.</p>

                <p>Efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on intent-to-treat patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of investigational product. The primary endpoint of change from baseline in weekly attack frequency across weeks 1–12 was analyzed using a mixed-effects model repeated measures analysis with longitudinal observations at weeks 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10, and 11/12. The model included fixed, categorical effects of treatment, sex, verapamil use, pooled investigative site, week, and treatment-by-week interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline value.

                <p>For the key secondary outcome of the estimated mean percentage of patients with a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the weekly attack frequency during the double-blind treatment period, a categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures analysis was used.

                <p>For the key secondary outcome of sustained response, treatment differences in the percentage of patients meeting the sustained response definition were determined using Koch's nonparametric randomization-based analysis of covariance method (<xref rid="bibr31-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which adjusted for continuous baseline value, sex, and verapamil use.</p>
                <p>To maintain the overall type I error rate at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 for the primary and key secondary endpoints, the Cui-Hung-Wang test statistic (<xref rid="bibr32-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) was calculated for each due to sample size re-estimation at the interim analysis. A gate-keeping strategy was employed whereby significance of the treatment comparison for primary and key secondary endpoints was tested in a pre-specified order.</p>
                <p>For other secondary efficacy outcomes and safety, treatment effects were evaluated based on a two-sided significance level of 0.05 without adjustment for multiplicity. A categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures analysis was used to analyze the categorical longitudinal secondary efficacy outcomes, including at least 50% and at least 30% reduction in weekly attack frequency from baseline at each 2-week interval through week 12, and PGI-I at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Categorical comparisons between treatment groups for safety measures were performed using Fisher's exact tests, where appropriate.</p>
                <p>For the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, for which data were captured with electronic diary use, if there were 8 or more days with non-missing diary data and the adherence to using the diary was more than 50% in the biweekly interval, the average number of cluster headache attacks across the non-missing days was used to impute the missing days. Otherwise, data for the biweekly interval were considered to be missing and were not imputed in the analyses.</p>

Overall, 230 (97%) patients completed double-blind treatment. Three patients discontinued from placebo treatment (AE [n = 1]; lack of efficacy [n = 1]; subject withdrawal [n = 1]) and four patients discontinued from galcanezumab treatment (AE [n = 1]; protocol deviation [n = 2]; subject withdrawal [n = 1]). The two protocol deviations that led to discontinuation were having met a cardiovascular exclusion criterion (high Bazett's QT interval prior to starting treatment) and taking an excluded medication (prednisone). The placebo- and galcanezumab-treated patients discontinued due to an AE of palpitations and an SAE of atrial fibrillation (lasting 1 day; patient diagnosed with thyroid nodules 3 weeks later), respectively (both resolved).

                <p>Pre-specified subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy measure included sex, race, ethnicity, age, baseline average number of attacks, baseline verapamil use, and region.

Subgroup-by-treatment interactions for sex, race, ethnicity, age, baseline average number of attacks, and baseline verapamil or preventive use were not statistically significant (Supplemental material 2; Table A). <italic>Post-hoc</italic> analyses were conducted to further understand the regional difference by searching for potential confounders or effect modifiers. An imbalance was observed in the following variables in North America: Baseline weekly attack frequency, baseline subcutaneous sumatriptan use, and lifetime suicidal ideation/behavior prior to screening (Supplemental material 2, Table B). There was also evidence of treatment-by-baseline subcutaneous sumatriptan use interaction (Supplemental material 2, Table C) with a greater reduction in attack frequency with galcanezumab compared to placebo in high-frequency users of subcutaneous sumatriptan (defined as ( &gt; 7.031 times of baseline sumatriptan use per week) compared to the low-frequency users.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To our knowledge this is one of the largest completed randomized, placebo-controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of a preventive treatment for cCH. Similar to the eCH study (<xref rid="bibr20-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), this study in patients with cCH evaluated whether galcanezumab reduced the frequency of weekly attacks, an endpoint consistent with the 1995 IHS guideline (<xref rid="bibr25-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In this cCH study, the primary endpoint, reduction in attack frequency across weeks 1–12, and key secondary objectives were not met. This is in contrast to the eCH study, which demonstrated that galcanezumab significantly reduced the number of weekly CH attacks across weeks 1–3 (<xref rid="bibr20-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In the eCH study, the early primary endpoint (across weeks 1–3) was necessary to ensure an adequate test prior to spontaneous remission as noted in the IHS guideline (<xref rid="bibr25-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>); however, for cCH, a durable effect measured across weeks 1–12 was chosen due to the largely unremitting nature of the disorder. While not observed at any other biweekly interval, a significantly greater reduction in the weekly attack frequency was observed with galcanezumab compared to placebo at weeks 1/2.</p>
              <p>With regard to the regional difference between Europe and North America on the primary endpoint, the results of the <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses provide evidence that the observed interaction by region could be partially induced by both imbalance of the confounders (baseline weekly attack frequency; baseline subcutaneous sumatriptan use; and lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior prior to screening) between treatment groups within region, and the difference in the distribution of effect modifier (baseline subcutaneous sumatriptan use). Given the small sample size in North America, the interaction of region by treatment could also be a spurious finding.</p>
              <p>The patient populations in the chronic and episodic studies had a similar mean age, and were predominantly male, Caucasian, and from Europe. The numbers of weekly attacks at baseline were similar (17.5 ± 10.0 episodic (<xref rid="bibr20-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>); 18.8 ± 10.2 chronic). One between-study difference was that preventive medications were allowed in the cCH trial, but not in the eCH trial. In the cCH trial, 63% of patients used at least one preventive medication, with 49.8% of all patients using verapamil; however, a subgroup analysis by baseline verapamil or preventive drug use did not show a treatment interaction.</p>
              <p>Other studies have also shown differential treatment effects between chronic and episodic CH. For instance, lithium demonstrated efficacy in a comparator trial in cCH, but not in a placebo-controlled trial in eCH (<xref rid="bibr34-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In the ACT-1 and -2 randomized, double-blind clinical trials, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation versus sham for the acute treatment of CH showed efficacy in patients with eCH, but not in patients with cCH (<xref rid="bibr36-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr37-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Potential differences between eCH and cCH are supported by research suggesting the brain anatomy (<xref rid="bibr38-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and the chronobiology of patients with cCH differ from those of patients with eCH and healthy controls (<xref rid="bibr39-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p>
              <p>It is conceivable that differences exist between episodic and chronic CH related to the role (or degree of influence) of CGRP. Studies to date that have reported CGRP elevations during CH attacks that normalized after successful treatment of the attack with subcutaneous sumatriptan or oxygen were in patients with eCH (<xref rid="bibr13-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, in a recent study, CGRP infusion provoked an attack in 50% of patients with cCH compared to 89% of patients with eCH during an active cluster period (<xref rid="bibr15-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), suggesting possible pathophysiological differences between the chronic and episodic subtypes and a different role of CGRP in cCH than in eCH.</p>
              <p>It is also possible that cCH is more treatment-resistant than eCH. Based on reported clinical observations, a subset of patients with cCH who do not respond adequately to existing treatment options may be refractory to preventive treatments (<xref rid="bibr36-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). These observations have resulted in a recommendation to establish diagnostic criteria for refractory cCH (<xref rid="bibr40-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this study, patients who had inadequate responses to prior and current preventive treatments were not excluded, and 63% were on preventive treatments at baseline, suggesting an inadequate response to those preventives. Additionally, the percentage of patients reporting lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior at baseline was higher in the cCH study compared to the eCH study (ideation: 23% vs. 13%; behavior: 4% vs. 1%, respectively), also suggesting a more severely affected patient population. However, as approximately 30% of patients in the eCH study were not in an active cluster period at the time of the baseline assessment of lifetime suicidality, this may have contributed to the lower reported frequency in the eCH study compared to the cCH study.</p>
              <p>Galcanezumab-treated patients had a high completion rate (96.6%) and low rate of discontinuation due to AEs ( &lt;1%). There was a higher frequency of treatment-emergent AEs in the galcanezumab group compared with the placebo group, which was due primarily to injection site-related treatment-emergent AEs. Overall, the safety of galcanezumab in patients with cCH was consistent with that seen with patients in the eCH and episodic and chronic migraine trials (<xref rid="bibr17-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr19-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr20-0333102420905321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p>
              <p>This study does have limitations. The patient population was predominantly European, which may limit generalizability of these results to patients in other geographies. Restrictions in the inclusion criteria of this study may also limit the generalizability of the results. The number of failed preventive drugs prior to study entry was not collected, and this information may have contributed to an understanding of the extent to which patients were treatment resistant. It is possible that patients with cCH may take longer to respond adequately to preventive CGRP antibody therapy, though conducting a longer placebo-controlled study in such a severely affected patient population would be challenging. This study includes a 52-week open-label extension; however, the results are not yet available.</p>
