                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>People with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are three times more likely to smoke than the wider population, contributing to widening health inequalities. Smoking remains the largest modifiable risk factor for this health inequality, but people with severe mental illness have not historically engaged with smoking cessation services. We aimed to test the effectiveness of a combined behavioural and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention targeted specifically at people with severe mental illness.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In the smoking cessation intervention for severe mental illness (SCIMITAR+) trial, a pragmatic, randomised controlled study, we recruited heavy smokers with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia from 16 primary care and 21 community-based mental health sites in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, and smoked at least five cigarettes per day. Exclusion criteria included substantial comorbid drug or alcohol problems and people who lacked capacity to consent at the time of recruitment. Using computer-generated random numbers, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a bespoke smoking cessation intervention or to usual care. Participants, mental health specialists, and primary care physicians were unmasked to assignment. The bespoke smoking cessation intervention consisted of behavioural support from a mental health smoking cessation practitioner and pharmacological aids for smoking cessation, with adaptations for people with severe mental illness—such as, extended pre-quit sessions, cut down to quit, and home visits. Access to pharmacotherapy was via primary care after discussion with the smoking cessation specialist. Under usual care participants were offered access to local smoking cessation services not specifically designed for people with severe mental illnesses. The primary endpoint was smoking cessation at 12 months ascertained via carbon monoxide measurements below 10 parts per million and self-reported cessation for the past 7 days. Secondary endpoints were biologically verified smoking cessation at 6 months; number of cigarettes smoked per day, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and Motivation to Quit (MTQ) questionnaire; general and mental health functioning determined via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); and body-mass index (BMI). This trial was registerd with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN72955454, and is complete.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Oct 7, 2015, and Dec 16, 2016, 526 eligible patients were randomly assigned to the bespoke smoking cessation intervention (n=265) or usual care (n=261). 309 (59%) participants were male, median age was 47·2 years (IQR 36·3–54·5), with high nicotine dependence (mean 24 cigarettes per day [SD 13·2]), and the most common severe mental disorders were schizophrenia or other psychotic illness (n=343 [65%]), bipolar disorder (n=115 [22%]), and schizoaffective disorder (n=66 [13%]). 234 (88%) of intervention participants engaged with the treatment programme and attended 6·4 (SD 3·5) quit smoking sessions, with an average duration of 39 min (SD 17; median 35 min, range 5–120). Verified quit data at 12 months were available for 219 (84%) of 261 usual care and 223 (84%) of 265 intervention participants. The proportion of participants who had quit at 12 months was higher in the intervention group than in the usual care group, but non-significantly (34 [15%] of 223 [13% of those assigned to group] <italic>vs</italic> 22 [10%] of 219 [8% of those assigned to group], risk difference 5·2%, 95% CI −1·0 to 11·4; odds ratio [OR] 1·6, 95% CI 0·9 to 2·9; p=0·10). The proportion of participants who quit at 6 months was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the usual care group (32 [14%] of 226 <italic>vs</italic> 14 [6%] of 217; risk difference 7·7%, 95% CI 2·1 to 13·3; OR 2·4, 95% CI 1·2 to 4·6; p=0·010). The incidence rate ratio for number of cigarettes smoked per day at 6 months was 0·90 (95% CI 0·80 to 1·01; p=0·079), and at 12 months was 1·00 (0·89 to 1·13; p=0·95). At both 6 months and 12 months, the intervention group was non-significantly favoured in the FTND (adjusted mean difference 6 months −0·18, 95% CI −0·53 to 0·17, p=0·32; and 12 months −0·01, −0·39 to 0·38, p=0·97) and MTQ questionnaire (adjusted mean difference 0·58, −0·01 to 1·17, p=0·056; and 12 months 0·64, 0·04 to 1·24, p=0·038). The PHQ-9 showed no difference between the groups (adjusted mean difference at 6 months 0·20, 95% CI −0·85 to 1·24 <italic>vs</italic> 12 months −0·12, −1·18 to 0·94). For the SF-12 survey, we saw evidence of improvement in physical health in the intervention group at 6 months (adjusted mean difference 1·75, 95% CI 0·21 to 3·28), but this difference was not evident at 12 months (0·59, −1·07 to 2·26); and we saw no difference in mental health between the groups at 6 or 12 months (adjusted mean difference at 6 months −0·73, 95% CI −2·82 to 1·36, and 12 months −0·41, −2·35 to 1·53). The GAD-7 questionnaire showed no difference between the groups (adjusted mean difference at 6 months −0·32 95% CI −1·26 to 0·62 <italic>vs</italic> 12 months −0·10, −1·05 to 0·86). No difference in BMI was seen between the groups (adjusted mean difference 6 months 0·16, 95% CI −0·54 to 0·85; 12 months 0·25, −0·62 to 1·13).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>This bespoke intervention is a candidate model of smoking cessation for clinicians and policy makers to address high prevalence of smoking. The incidence of quitting at 6 months shows that smoking cessation can be achieved, but the waning of this effect by 12 months means more effort is needed for sustained quitting.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">When first designing this study, we did a systematic review of key databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, HMIC, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, and The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) from database inception to Jan 5, 2008, for publications in English of smoking cessation studies and independently extracted data. We included randomised controlled trials done in any country or care setting with adult smokers with severe mental illness. We identified ten small-scale trials that highlighted the potential effectiveness of nicotine replacement, bupropion, and techniques to change behaviour to enable people with severe mental illness to quit smoking. Effect sizes were broadly in line with estimates of effect for non-severe mental illness populations in the ability of smoking cessation interventions to help people quit. We also found that smoking cessation is unlikely to cause deterioration in the mental health of people with severe mental illness. We repeated our review, from database inception to Sept 1, 2016, combining search terms for severe mental ill health, smoking cessation, and randomised controlled trials, adapted from terms developed by the Cochrane groups for schizophrenia and tobacco addiction (exact terms are listed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>). We found few trials of behavioural interventions, no placebo-controlled trials of nicotine replacement therapy alone, and an absence of research showing how smoking cessation services should be organised and delivered within existing mental health services. Furthermore, although some trials tested the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments, they did not test the effectiveness of behavioural interventions based on evidence-supported techniques to change behaviour.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">This trial shows that delivery of a bespoke smoking cessation intervention to people with severe mental illness is feasible, with good levels of engagement with services compared with usual care. The use of smoking cessation interventions was much higher for people who received the bespoke cessation programme than among those who had usual care. We biochemically verified that over twice as many patients who received the bespoke cessation intervention had quit smoking at 6 months than those who received usual care. At 12 months, more patients in the intervention group had quit than those in the control group had, but the difference was not significant. We also noted some short-term improvements in self-reported physical health and no deterioration in mental health.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Based on the results of our systematic reviews and this trial, clinicians should always ask people with severe mental illness about their desire to quit and ensure onward referral to the most suitable local smoking cessation service. Our research supports the provision of smoking cessation services specially designed for people with mental illnesses to address the high levels of smoking and the levels of unmet need for people with severe mental illness.</p>

              <p id="para100">Public health guidance issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> highlights the need for innovative approaches for this population to decrease this inequality. Guidance stresses that mental health services should become completely smoke free, and that all people who use mental health services should be given full access to smoking cessation interventions. However, little specific guidance exists on how smoking cessation services should be provided and in what way smoking cessation interventions might need to be adapted for those with severe mental illness. Trial-based evidence suggests that people with severe mental illness are able to give up smoking and that behavioural and pharmacological interventions to aid quitting might be as effective for people with severe mental illness as for the general population.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, people with severe mental illness do not generally access generic smoking cessation services when they have been offered in the UK National Health Service (NHS).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In the general population, the prevalence of smoking is decreasing, but little shift has been seen in the past decade in the prevalence among people with severe mental illnesses.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>

This diagnosis needed to have been made by a specialist in mental health services and documented in either primary care records or psychiatric notes before recruitment.

                <p id="para140">Participants were randomly assigned to either the bespoke smoking cessation service (intervention) or usual care (control). We used a secure telephone randomisation service run by the York Trials Unit (University of York, York, UK). Simple randomisation was used with a computer-generated random number sequence.

Once given the details of the participant's allocation, the researcher immediately informed them of their allocation. A letter was sent to the participant's primary care physician and mental health specialist detailing their allocation and subsequent smoking cessation management. Due to the nature of the intervention, participants, mental health staff, primary care physicians and researchers (PH, SC, TM, TS, EB, PB, SB, DBr, TC, AC, CC, DC, ED, KE, HH, WK, LN, EN, HO, JRea, C-BR-H, KS, AS, and CV) were not masked to treatment allocation.

                <p id="para160">All participants in the trial received usual care and had access to the full range of smoking cessation treatments that were offered by their local NHS trust. Under usual care, people with severe mental illness were able to access smoking cessation services provided by their primary care physician or in a locally-provided service not specifically designed for people with severe mental illness, at no direct cost. They were also able to access a free telephone helpline (the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/support" id="interrefs10">Smokefree National Helpline</ext-link>) that offers smoking cessation advice. All participants remained under the care of their primary care physician and continued to receive their usual service from the mental health team throughout the trial.</p>
                <p id="para170">Participants allocated to the bespoke smoking cessation group were offered a structured smoking cessation intervention delivered by a trained mental health smoking cessation practitioner. The smoking cessation practitioners were generally experienced mental health nurses who worked in conjunction with the participant and the participant's primary care physician or mental health specialist to provide an individually tailored smoking cessation service. The intervention was delivered according to the Manual of Smoking Cessation (developed by the National Centre for Smoking Cessation Training [NCSCT], UK)<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> with several adaptations to cater for people with severe mental illness. These adaptations included making several assessments before setting a quit date, offering nicotine replacement before setting a quit date (ie, cut down to quit),<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> recognising the purpose of smoking in the context of a person's mental illness, providing home visits, providing additional face-to-face support after an unsuccessful quit attempt or relapse, and informing the primary care physician and psychiatrist of a successful quit attempt, such that they can review doses of anti-psychotic medication if their metabolism changes. The smoking cessation practitioners were drawn from local NHS staff and attended one of a number of 2-day training events run by study staff at the University of York (York, UK), University of Manchester (Manchester, UK), and University College London (London, UK) based on the NCSCT's practitioner training with some additional training on specific adaptations for people with severe mental illness. The smoking cessation practitioner advised the patients on a range of pharmacological aids for smoking cessation (eg, nicotine replacement, varenicline) and liaised with their primary care physician to ensure that these options were offered in line with patient choice. The full range of nicotine replacement and smoking cessation products from the British National Formulary were made available to participants.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> However, the final prescription of treatments was left to the discretion of the primary care physician. Participants were offered up to 12 individual face-to-face sessions in their home or NHS premises lasting approximately 30 min.

                <p id="para180">SCIMITAR+ was a pragmatic trial,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and the comparator was the care that patients with severe mental illness would access under usual circumstances (ie, usual care). In the UK, all patients (including people with severe mental illness) have access to statutory smoking cessation services at no direct personal cost, which would include access to a smoking cessation counsellor who would administer evidence-supported treatments, including behavioural support and access to pharmacotherapy. Research has shown that the uptake of such services is quite low for patients with severe mental illness<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and we anticipated from the outset that treatment accessed under usual care would fall short of evidence-supported guidelines.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Participants allocated to the usual care group were advised to quit, see their primary care physician, and contact local NHS stop smoking services. Thereafter, no additional treatment was offered in the context of the SCIMITAR+ trial. We measured the degree of engagement with statutory smoking cessation services to see if control participants sought help to quit after they received this advice.</p>
                <p id="para190">12 months after treatment allocation, we contacted the primary care physician of each participant to obtain primary care records, which were screened for details of any nicotine replacement treatment or other smoking cessation products that had been prescribed to participants in the study. Participants were also asked about their purchase of over-the-counter products during follow-up, as part of the health-service use questionnaire, and we recorded nicotine therapy use via self-report.</p>
                <p id="para200">Participants were followed up at 6 and 12 months after treatment allocation. At the two follow-up timepoints, participants completed the same series of questionnaires as at baseline apart from the demographics questionnaire. Additionally, participants were asked to provide a carbon monoxide breath measure and have their height and weight measured. When possible, participants were followed up face to face, but if not possible they were followed up by phone or by postal questionnaire.</p>

The MTQ questionnaire<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> is a four-item questionnaire measuring an individual's motivation to quit smoking. Scores are from 4 to 19 by summing the responses to each item, where a higher score indicates greater motivation to quit. The PHQ-9<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> instrument measures severity of depression.

                <p id="para220">Adverse events were recorded at 6 months and 12 months. As part of the follow-up questionnaires participants were asked about their health service use, and if a participant reported having a suspected serious adverse event, an independent reviewer was contacted to provide a review of the events and determine whether the event was likely to have been related to the trial and whether or not it was expected. An event was classed as serious if it met any of the following criteria: life threatening (ie, event in which patient is at risk of death at the time of the event occurring); fatal; requiring unplanned admission to hospital resulting in an inpatient stay or extension of hospital stay beyond what was expected (ie, patient operated on as an outpatient but remains in hospital overnight); resulting in persistent or substantial disability or incapacity; resulting in a congenital abnormality or birth defect; or any other medical condition not listed here that might require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the above criteria occurring.</p>

This study was powered at 80% to detect a relative 1·7 times increase in quitting, assuming a 20% incidence of quitting among control participants, equal randomisation, and a two-sided α level of 0·05. Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up at 12 months, we calculated that 393 participants needed to be recruited and randomised.

This finding is in line with research in the general population that shows that long-term cessation of smoking is difficult to achieve and remains a challenge in treatment for nicotine dependence in any population.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para440">The influence of the bespoke smoking cessation intervention was seen in the secondary outcomes. We found that smoking cessation can be achieved among people with severe mental illnesses. Compared with usual care, the provision of a bespoke smoking cessation intervention increased engagement and the chances of successful quitting as estimated by a biochemically verified outcome measure. The chances of successful quitting at 6 months after randomisation among those who received the bespoke smoking cessation intervention were more than twice those who received usual care. We also found an improvement in short-term physical health (measured by use of the SF-12) and trend towards decreased numbers of cigarettes smoked per day at 6 months and increased motivation to quit at 12 months. We also found no differences between the groups on measures of mental health, which included depression and anxiety. These findings provide supportive evidence that offering a smoking cessation intervention is not detrimental to mental health</p>
              <p id="para450">SCIMITAR+ was a pragmatic trial<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and our comparator was therefore usual care. As such, the treatment that is offered under conditions of usual care will vary by site, and will often fall short of the ideal or that recommended in evidence-supported guidelines.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Previous research has shown that the uptake of smoking cessation services by people with severe mental illnesses is lower than that of the general population,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and we also found this lower uptake under conditions of usual care in the SCIMITAR+ trial. An important finding was that the provision of a bespoke service had a direct effect on the proportion of participants who engaged with the intervention and received effective pharmacotherapy. Notably, few participants were prescribed the most effective form of pharmacotherapy, varenicline, despite this medication having now been shown to be safe and effective among people with severe mental illness.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> This paucity of prescription might be because varenicline has been thought to be associated with suicidality or deterioration in mental health.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale randomised controlled trial in the UK of a combined behavioural and pharmacological intervention designed for people with severe mental illnesses. Trials to date have been small scale, with short periods of follow-up, and focused on pharmacological treatments with little consideration of behavioural approaches.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> We adapted and enhanced an evidence-supported smoking cessation strategy that was developed for and forms the mainstay of successful stop smoking services in the UK.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> This structured intervention was delivered by a mental health professional and a so-called cut down to quit approach was also offered.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> The results of the SCIMITAR+ trial, alongside other trials<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> and evidence from systematic reviews<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> of the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for nicotine dependence in people with mental illness, are accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for this disadvantaged group. Evidence is also emerging that smoking cessation can be delivered in inpatient settings,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> although the SCIMITAR+ trial did not include such populations. Further research is needed to examine whether this intervention could be adapted to be delivered in inpatient environments where patients often abstain from smoking for the first time.</p>
              <p id="para470">The results of the SCIMITAR+ trial will be helpful in informing clinical practice, since we have shown that quitting can be achieved for people who use mental health services just as it can for the general population of smokers. Clinicians should therefore ask all of their patients about smoking status and offer referrals to effective smoking cessation services, such as those described in this study. On the basis of the results of this trial and systematic review evidence,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> smoking cessation is likely to be either beneficial or not harmful to mental health. Decision makers should consider commissioning and providing intensive smoking cessation services as a core feature of comprehensive mental health care to ensure the needs of people within mental health services are met. Evidence-supported guidance, such as that offered by NICE regarding tobacco policies and the provision of smoking cessation interventions in mental health services,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> have not been widely implemented. The intervention described in this study (alongside other such models of care<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) could form a template for mental health services and would ensure that they are compliant with NICE guidance. We would also suggest that clinical services should ensure longer-term follow-up to maintain the proportion of patients who quit smoking in the short term observed in this study, although more research is still needed in this area. A further issue for implementation is the use of e-cigarettes. The SCIMITAR+ trial coincided with a general increase in the use of e-cigarettes throughout the population. This topic is one of substantial debate<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> and consensus is emerging that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para480">This trial had several limitations. First, 16% of participants were lost to follow-up or had missing data for the primary outcome at 12 months; however, this loss was lower than in our pilot trial<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and the loss to follow-up was non-differential. Second, more participants in the usual care group had quit smoking at 12 months than was hypothesised in the sample size calculation (10% <italic>vs</italic> 20%), and the actual percentage increase was lower (5% actual <italic>vs</italic> 14% predicted). Therefore, although the trial recruited more participants than originally planned and loss to follow-up was lower than anticipated (16% <italic>vs</italic> 20%), the trial was ultimately underpowered to detect a difference in the proportion of patients who quit from 10% to 15%. Third, difficulties in ensuring that some participants received pharmacological treatment because of changes in the way that smoking cessation services are commissioned and in some areas primary care physicians were unwilling to prescribe nicotine replacement therapy because of smoking cessation services being contracted out to third parties who were unwilling to prescribe for participants unless they entered their service. Such attitudes could lead to difficulties were in implementing the results of the SCIMITAR+ trial, and so we would recommend that local services put robust mechanisms in place to remove barriers to the provision of medication, including varenicline.</p>
              <p id="para490">In the face of substantial health inequalities for people with severe mental illness, smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for poor health and reduced life expectancy.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In this study, we have shown that people with severe mental illnesses more readily engage with a bespoke intervention than usual care, and that the intervention results in an increased proportion of patients who quit at 6 months. Health systems should provide smoking cessation interventions that are responsive to the needs of people who use mental health services. Further research is needed to establish how long-term quitting can be supported.</p>
