                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation) is the single most important contributor to neonatal death and morbidity, with lifelong repercussions. However, the majority of women who present with preterm labour (PTL) symptoms do not deliver imminently. Accurate prediction of PTL is needed in order ensure correct management of those most at risk of preterm birth (PTB) and to prevent the maternal and fetal risks incurred by unnecessary interventions given to the majority. The QUantitative Innovation in Predicting Preterm birth (QUIPP) app aims to support clinical decision-making about women in threatened preterm labour (TPTL) by combining quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) values, cervical length (CL), and significant PTB risk factors to create an individualised percentage risk of delivery.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>EQUIPTT was a multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving 13 maternity units in South and Eastern England (United Kingdom) between March 2018 and February 2019. Pregnant women (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1,872) between 23<sup>+0</sup> and 34<sup>+6</sup> weeks’ gestation with symptoms of PTL in the analysis period were assigned to either the intervention (762) or control (1,111). The mean age of the study population was 30.2 (+/− SD 5.93). A total of 56.0% were white, 19.6% were black, 14.2% were Asian, and 10.2% were of other ethnicities. The intervention was the use of the QUiPP app with admission, antenatal corticosteroids (ACSs), and transfer advised for women with a QUiPP risk of delivery &gt;5% within 7 days. Control sites continued with their conventional management of TPTL. Unnecessary management for TPTL was a composite primary outcome defined by the sum of unnecessary admission decisions (admitted and delivery interval &gt;7 days or not admitted and delivery interval ≤7 days) and the number of unnecessary in utero transfer (IUT) decisions/actions (IUT that occurred or were attempted &gt;7 days prior to delivery) and ex utero transfers (EUTs) that should have been in utero (attempted and not attempted). Unnecessary management of TPTL was 11.3% (84/741) at the intervention sites versus 11.5% (126/1094) at control sites (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–1.42, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.883). Control sites frequently used qfFN and did not follow UK national guidance, which recommends routine treatment below 30 weeks without testing. Unnecessary management largely consisted of unnecessary admissions which were similar at intervention and control sites (10.7% versus 10.8% of all visits). In terms of adverse outcomes for women in TPTL &lt;36 weeks, 4 women from the intervention sites and 12 from the control sites did not receive recommended management. If the QUiPP percentage risk was used as per protocol, unnecessary management would have been 7.4% (43/578) versus 9.9% (134/1,351) (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45–1.16). Our external validation of the QUiPP app confirmed that it was highly predictive of delivery in 7 days; receiver operating curve area was 0.90 (95% CI 0.85–0.95) for symptomatic women. Study limitations included a lack of compliance with national guidance at the control sites and difficulties in implementation of the QUiPP app.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This cluster randomised trial did not demonstrate that the use of the QUiPP app reduced unnecessary management of TPTL compared to current management but would safely improve the management recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Interpretation of qfFN, with or without the QUiPP app, is a safe and accurate method for identifying women most likely to benefit from PTL interventions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Symptoms suggestive of preterm labour (PTL) are one of the most common reasons for mothers presenting to hospital antenatally, although very few will deliver imminently [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Accurate prediction of PTL is needed in order to ensure correct management of those most at risk of preterm birth (PTB) and to prevent the maternal and fetal risks incurred by unnecessary interventions given to the majority of women who do not deliver within a week of presentation [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Clinical intervention “just in case” a woman may deliver early results in many women being transferred out of their local hospital unnecessarily and receiving unwarranted drugs, such as steroids [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It also prevents necessary transfers as neonatal cots are blocked needlessly, resulting in more potentially hazardous ex utero transfers (EUTs) [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>An increase in cervicovaginal quantitative fetal fibronectin (qfFN) and cervical length (CL) shortening are likely to represent a common pathway for pathological activation of labour and have the broadest evidence base [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our research group developed the “QUantitative Innovation in Predicting Preterm birth” (QUIPP) app, which is a clinical decision support tool based on qfFN values, CL, and risk factors of women with symptoms or those considered to be at high risk of PTB, which is an accurate indicator of PTB risk [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>While the QUIPP app has been shown to be accurate and downloaded and used widely by clinicians, it requires formal evaluation in routine clinical practice. Here, we present the results of a multisite cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the use of the QUiPP app and its subsequent impact on reducing unnecessary management for threatened preterm labour (TPTL). In addition, this study allowed for an external validation of the QUIPP app prediction models.</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p>The primary aim of the EQUIPTT study was to evaluate the use of the QUIPP app for management of TPTL and potential reduction of unnecessary management.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec011">
                <title>Hypothesis</title>
                <p>The implementation of the QUIPP app and management algorithm will decrease unnecessary management for TPTL (following the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE] guidance).</p>
                <p>A secondary aim was to externally validate the QUIPP app prediction models in an emergency obstetric setting.</p>

                <title>Trial design and participants</title>
                <p>EQUIPTT (REC reference 17/LO/1802) was a cluster RCT (with a parallel group design) across 13 obstetric centres. During the intervention phase, each maternity unit required capacity for quantitative assessment of qfFN and/or transvaginal ultrasonic CL measurement. A pragmatic approach was taken to introduce the intervention (i.e., use of the QUIPP app and related TPTL management guidance) to the entire hospital antenatal units as a standard practice for all clinicians and application to all affected pregnancies. However, since individuals in the same cluster tended to have more similar outcomes than those across clusters, an intra-class correlation coefficient was used, creating a larger sample size than would be required for an individual RCT.</p>

              <sec id="sec013">
                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation was performed at the cluster (maternity centre) level. A computer-generated random allocation sequence was used, stratified by the level of special care available. Randomisation was designed to allocate approximately equal numbers to each arm according to the level of care provided: neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) versus local neonatal unit or special care baby unit. Due to their being an odd number of centres, 7 sites were allocated to one group and 6 to the other.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec014">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>All 13 centres provided data related to the primary outcome under their current standard practice in a 6-week pre-intervention data collection period. The baseline data obtained described existing practices for triage of TPTL and were used for adjusting effects due to differences between clusters. Following randomisation, the centres were instructed to either implement use of the QUiPP app and management guidance (intervention) or to follow their current standard management (control) for a 9-month analysis period (March 26, 2018 to December 31, 2019). It was anticipated that this would be similar to current NICE guidance for the management of PTL. In the final phase of the trial, the intervention was introduced in the 6 control units, and data were collected to investigate the impact of the intervention in control sites.</p>
                <p>Eligible women were between 23<sup>+0</sup> and 34<sup>+6</sup> weeks of pregnancy presenting to labour ward or day assessment units with symptoms of TPTL (such as contractions or abdominal pain). Exclusion criteria were a definitive diagnosis of labour (i.e., regular painful contractions with cervical change &gt;3 cm on speculum or digital examination), confirmed ruptured membranes (on speculum examination), or significant vaginal bleeding.</p>
                <p>As with many cluster trials, since the QUIPP intervention was an educational decision-making tool rolled out once to all clinicians, implementation was at the institutional level, and individual consent was not appropriate or logistical. The no-consent model was specifically addressed in the ethics application, and the ethics committee waived the need for informed consent (REC reference 17/LO/1802).</p>
                <p>All intervention sites received face-to-face training on the use of the QUIPP app and management guidance prior to its introduction. Additional support (either face to face or via email/telephone) was also available throughout the trial. To use the QUiPP app, the doctor/midwife assessing the woman needed to input the gestation, previous history of late miscarriage or spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), qfFN value, and/or ultrasonic CL into the app. The output of the app then provided a % risk of delivery within 1, 2, and 4 weeks and before 30, 34, and 37 weeks. The exact QUiPP % thresholds for admission or treatment are gestation dependent, and, therefore, could be tailored to individual circumstances. However, the study guidance suggested a 5% risk of delivery within 7 days as a threshold for antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration, admission, and/or in utero transfer (IUT). A 5% threshold was chosen based on the minimum level regarded as warranting intervention in our Delphi consensus [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and the previous definitions of a low PTB risk provided by other preterm prediction studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
                <p>Only anonymised data were stored on the secure internet-based Preterm Clinical Network (PCN) Database (MedSciNet) (REC reference 16/ES/0093). All investigators and study site staff complied with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 with regard to the collection, storage, processing, and disclosure of personal information and upheld the Act’s core principles. Further details of trial recruitment and governance procedures are available in the published trial protocol [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                <title>Outcome measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome of unnecessary management for TPTL was defined by the number of unnecessary admission decisions: admitted and delivery interval &gt;7 days or not admitted and delivery interval ≤7 days, and the number of unnecessary IUT decisions/actions: IUTs that occurred or were attempted &gt;7 days prior to delivery and EUTs that should have been in utero (attempted and non-attempted). EUTs that should have been in utero were defined as babies transferred within 24 hours of birth.</p>
                <p>Secondary outcomes included all individual components of primary outcome, maternal clinical outcomes (e.g., new onset gestational diabetes, thromboembolic disease, and confirmed sepsis), neonatal clinical outcomes (e.g., neonatal death prior to discharge, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and days of supplemental oxygen), process measures (days of maternal hospitalisation, steroid, tocolytic and magnesium sulphate administration, and NICU admissions), and compliance with management recommendations.</p>

              <sec id="sec016">
                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Data analysis followed the intention to treat principle, according to the planned intervention. Data were analysed using Stata Version 15 software or later (Stata, College Station, Texas, United States of America) to estimate the size and test for statistical significance of any effects of the intervention on primary and secondary outcomes. While our protocol planned to express treatment effects as risk ratios (relative risk), at analysis, we opted for a multilevel model in Stata, which provides odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using binomial regression and adjusting for variables used in the minimisation process. Risk differences were also calculated for the primary outcome. The analysis model included a random effect for centre and standard errors adjusted for clustering by centre. Adjustments were also made for differences between cluster populations, such as ethnicity and maternal age. Our primary outcome of unnecessary decisions was planned to be measured per 1,000 deliveries. Unnecessary management was calculated per woman rather than per visit: a woman with any visit which resulted in unnecessary care being counted as having experienced unnecessary management. This approach avoided the clustering effects of counting all visits and the problems of selecting a single visit to represent the care for one woman.</p>
                <p>For unnecessary admission decisions, a total sample size of 580 was calculated; this equated to approximately 50 recruits per site, based on 12 sites (13th site added after power calculation performed). Data from our group’s prospective observational study into the ability of qfFN to predict sPTB in symptomatic women (PETRA REC reference 14/LO/1988) allowed us to estimate the likely treatment effect for the intervention reducing unnecessary admissions from 25% to 10% and intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.035. This treatment effect required 580 for 90% power. We were aware that the statistical power of EQUIPTT could be enhanced by more clusters, but for the present study, 12 to 14 centres was considered the limit of what was feasible [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] considering the parallel cluster design.</p>
                <p>We anticipated that the cluster design’s randomisation of the QUiPP intervention at the institutional level relies on high uptake and adoption of the intervention, which is not a problem for control sites continuing usual care. To estimate the contribution of this effect, we also planned a per-protocol analysis to evaluate how the primary outcome would be impacted by ideal use of the QUiPP app, i.e., on all eligible episodes of TPTL and with adherence to the 5% threshold to guide management decisions. We adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist (<xref rid="pmed.1003689.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>) for conduct and reporting of this trial.</p>
                <p>We have previously described the creation of the prognostic models for the QUiPP app v.2 symptomatic algorithms, the simple calibration of these models, and a temporal internal validation. Using % risk of ≥5% as an indication of a positive test, the area under the curve for prediction of PTB within 7 days using the qfFN algorithm was 0.893 [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, external validation was required to test the generalisability of the prognostic models and correct for overfitting. To calculate the performance of the QUiPP app symptomatic qfFN predictive model, a validation set was created from EQUIPTT participants with a qfFN value from the duration of the trial period across all 13 sites. Any qfFN values (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) documented as &gt;500 were changed to 500 (as the qfFN machine will not provide a value &gt;500 ng/mL).</p>

The lost to follow-up rate was 5% (37/761) in intervention sites and 3% (36/1,111) in control sites. Unnecessary management of TPTL was 11.3% at the intervention sites versus 11.5% at control sites (OR 0.972, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42). Unnecessary management largely consisted of unnecessary admissions that did not appear to be impacted by the intervention (10.7% versus 10.8% of all visits resulted in unnecessary admissions) (<xref rid="pmed.1003689.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The proportion of all admissions that were unnecessary was 43.8% (67/153) at intervention sites and 42.6% (84/197) at control sites.</p>

              <p>As per our prespecified per-protocol analysis, the proportion of unnecessary admissions and discharges was calculated for women as if the 5% threshold was always followed with the given QUiPP risks. Since 192 (27%) of women in the intervention arm did not have a QUiPP risk calculated at every visit, this reduced the number of women in the intervention arm with sufficient data for analysis to 519 across 761 visits. As for the primary outcome, we adjusted for baseline levels of unnecessary management using mixed effects logistic regression to account for errors between clusters and women. As described in <xref rid="pmed.1003689.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, unnecessary admissions and discharges would have been reduced in the intervention arm if the QUiPP risk was used as per protocol (7.4% versus 9.9%), but this did not reach statistical significance.</p>

In light of concerns around false-negative PTL predictive tests [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], all participants were reviewed who delivered &lt;36 weeks’ gestation and were not admitted and/or did not receive necessary ACSs (within 7 days of delivery) during the intervention period. Following intention-to-treat analysis, 4 women from the intervention sites and 12 from the control sites did not receive necessary management following one of their TPTL presentations (see <xref rid="pmed.1003689.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>

                <title>External validation of QUiPP app algorithms</title>
                <p>During the trial, there were 2,845 visits with a qfFN on 2,430 women including 45 twin pregnancies. Visits with a CL in addition to qfFN were excluded, and women without a documented onset of labour and a gestation of delivery were excluded, leaving a validation set of 2,285 visits on 2,031 women. Iatrogenic births (excluding preterm prelabour rupture of membranes [PPROM]) within the specified time period were treated as missing because it was not reasonable to expect QUiPP to predict induced deliveries within the time period of interest (e.g., before 7, 14, or 28 days), but if they were induced outside this timeframe, the QUiPP prediction remained relevant. The mean gestation of visit was 30.3 (SD 3.23) weeks’ gestation.</p>
                <p>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (<xref rid="pmed.1003689.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) demonstrate the high predictive accuracy of the QUiPP app across the risk range: for preterm delivery within 7 days (as used in EQUIPTT) as well as within 14 and 28 days. The QUiPP app predicted PTB within 7 days with ROC 0.898 (0.850 to 0.946). This cohort also provides further validation for qfFN, with ROC of 0.902 (95% CI 0.857 to 0.946) for delivery within 7 days. As anticipated, there is little difference between the curves, as the qfFN value is mainly driving the QUiPP score in the low-risk cohort without CL measurements. However, the app also provides validated estimates of the individual probability of delivery within a fixed time.</p>

                <title>Main findings</title>
                <p>The large sample of women with TPTL symptoms recruited in the EQUIPTT trial allowed extensive validation of the QUiPP app’s predictive performance and captured rare insights into actual management of TPTL in a 24–7 setting. Using qfFN combined with individual risk factors and gestation, the excellent ROC values for prediction of sPTB within 7, 14, and 28 days support the use of the tool to triage TPTL. However, despite the accuracy of its prediction of sPTB, in the current study, the clinical introduction of the QUiPP app did not demonstrate a significant impact on the primary outcome: unnecessary management of TPTL. The lack of effect on primary outcome was likely to be related to the unexpected low event rate in the control arm, which was similar to that anticipated as a result of the intervention and related to clinicians in the control arm not following national guidance but incorporating aspects of the QUiPP app available to them, e.g., fetal fibronectin.</p>
                <p>The use of CL in TPTL assessment was not frequent enough in these 13 hospitals to draw conclusions (it was only used in 5.5% of all visits). Contrary to NICE guidelines (which advises to not use predictive tests under 30 weeks’ gestation), the majority of the control sites still used qfFN, the most significant component of the QUiPP risk. The control arm offers important evidence that the NICE recommended “treat-all strategy” at early gestations is being safely ignored in practice; there were no adverse events. The proportion of imminent deliveries in pregnancies receiving low risk scores (&lt;5% within 7 days), representing “false-negative” assessments, was very low and corresponded to the app’s predicted rates (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6) (i.e., it never gives a risk of 0%). These are not true false negatives, as this low rate is in keeping with the low risk predicted. As was advised in the EQUIPTT protocol, in the rare cases recorded in the study, clinical acumen or the mother’s symptoms appropriately took precedence the low QUiPP scores and all the women received necessary and timely treatments for their preterm infants.</p>
                <p>The external validation of the symptomatic qfFN algorithm of QUiPP confirmed its accuracy and generalisability for PTB prediction. Our findings are similar to preliminary reports of the Quantitative Fibronectin to help Decision-making in women with Symptoms of Preterm Labour (QUIDS) prospective study (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2,924, 26 sites 85 sPTB within 7 days ISRCTN41598423), which also provide comparable accuracy for prediction with qfFN alone compared to qfFN and CL (ROC 0.89), and these 2 independent studies have real potential to influence revisions in the national PTB guidelines [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
                <p>Another important finding of this trial is how few mothers of preterm infants received necessary ACS, defined as administered within 7 days of delivery (23%), the most important antenatal intervention for preterm infants. QUiPP app use did appear to encourage necessary ACS administration (27.6% of infants &lt;35 weeks received necessary ACS at intervention sites versus 20.5%), but this was not a powered outcome. While the impact on neonatal outcomes is not possible to measure from these data due to event rates, the need for timely ACS to reduce respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal mortality is well established [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
                <p>This cluster design allowed us to reach large numbers of women and clinicians across many centres in a short time period and with relative efficiency. Recruiting the entire group of women in TPTL, rather than a consented subset, allowed insights into actual use in pragmatic clinical settings rather than ideal conditions associated with traditional RCT design, enhancing the generalisability of our findings.</p>
                <p>While total recruitment exceeded the target, there were disproportionately higher levels from the tertiary hospitals compared to smaller units with less established women’s health academic departments. The 2 most research-active tertiary maternity units were both randomised to control. This typifies the relationship between engagement with research and high-quality clinical care [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which, although beneficial for patients at research-active sites, can contribute to health inequalities across the National Health Service (NHS). Where there was less clinical or staffing capacity, reliance on pro formas over qfFN machine records may have led to selection bias and less representation of urgent and out-of-hours cases. Although statistical tests to allow for clustering did not alter the primary outcome, the variation in recruitment, TPTL management, and adoption of the QUiPP app between sites from the same region was profound. A larger number of centres from wider UK regions would be required to minimise this effect [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                <p>Our composite of unnecessary admissions, discharges, IUTs, and EUTs was a novel primary outcome aimed at measuring the true cost of either overly cautious (admitting too many women) or less careful practice (sending the wrong women home). Previous studies into the effectiveness of preterm prediction tests have chosen PTB rates as primary outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While PTB outcomes are easier to collect than management decisions, they are distant from the intervention and prone to influence by many confounding factors. However, the reasons for admission are more complex than our methodology allowed for. For example, some women were assessed primarily for TPTL, but additional concerns prompted admission. Furthermore, reducing the primary outcome to a binary threshold (e.g., admit if risk of delivery &gt;5% within 7 days), while necessary to measure impact, may not do justice to the QUIPP algorithms and grouping decisions around the 5% threshold classifies contrasting women together as low risk (e.g., 0.1% compared to 4.6%) or high risk (5.1% compared to 20%).</p>
                <p>An alternative explanation of why clinical introduction of the QUiPP app was ineffective regarding the primary outcome is that we overstated the scale of routine unnecessary management of TPTL. Given that the power calculation was based on an unnecessary admission rate of 25% (reported in PETRA study, REC reference 14/LO/1988), and the unnecessary admission rate at control sites was actually 10.8%, it was not possible for QUiPP to demonstrate a significant reduction based mainly on admission rate. The randomisation of the most research-active tertiary centres to the control arm is likely to have distorted this degree of necessary management, as many were using qfFN and components of the app already; we could not mitigate against the app being used informally in the control arm. It may be that QUiPP has less added value in sites which already use qfFN judiciously, relative to those using the qualitative fFN 50 ng/mL cutoff to direct management or those with a treat-all strategy. The scrutiny of participating in a research trial itself could also have enhanced the performance of clinicians regardless of the randomised intervention [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The observed practice at control sites also suggests how far UK maternity services are deviating from NICE guidelines (to admit all women in TPTL prior to 30 week’s gestation) [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and supports the utility of qfFN and its place in the majority of local protocols.</p>
                <p>The process outcomes of this trial, as well as women and clinician interviews (reported elsewhere), offered reassurance regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the QUiPP app in actual use. The per-protocol analysis suggests that closer adherence to QUiPP use and management guidance would have further improved TPTL management. Adoption and reach would have been enhanced by a more rigorous implementation strategy. It may not be the individual factors which hindered the ability of the innovation to deliver change but the dynamic interaction between them [<xref rid="pmed.1003689.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our belief in the simplicity of the tool may have clouded recognition that QUiPP is a complex intervention involving multiple interacting components that may have been difficult for unfamiliar users to appreciate without a more focused implementation training package. Understanding the causal assumptions that underpin decisions to change practice are key to understanding QUiPP’s mechanism to deliver change in the future.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>This cluster randomised trial did not demonstrate that the use of the QUiPP app reduced unnecessary management of TPTL compared to current management. However, the management of TPTL in the control arms was not according to national guidance and may not have reflected wider practice. The low rates of overtreatment or missed events in either arms support the interpretation of qfFN, with or without the QUiPP app, as a safe and accurate method for identifying women most likely to benefit from PTL interventions. It also highlights the need for greater consideration of implementation strategies for this type of research study.</p>

              </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>*As noted by one reviewer - can the ISRCSN registry details for the trial (id - ISRCTN17846337; link - <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17846337" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17846337</ext-link>) be included within the submitted paper (ideally at end of abstract) - this is our usual style.</p>
              <p>*The issue of individual informed consent (lack of) for this trial came up, and we recognise that the authors currently say in the paper that individual consent would not be feasible given the way the trial was conducted, and it's recognised for some cluster RCTs that individual consent can be waived. But it would be good as well to clarify (and state in the paper) whether the ethics committee specifically waived the need for informed consent.</p>
              <p>*We'd suggest revising the title per the journal style, where these normally have a two-part format separated by colon (question/objective: study design) - example <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002949" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002949</ext-link> (Implementing a structured model for osteoarthritis care in primary healthcare: A stepped-wedge cluster-randomised trial)</p>
              <p>*At this stage please now restructure the abstract into the journal style - the subheadings for research papers should be Background, Methods and Findings, Conclusions (Methods and Findings is a single subhead). Within each subsection please use full sentences rather than (partial) sentence fragments. </p>
              <p>*In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please include a note about any key limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
              <p>*We noticed a few typos/manuscript preparation errors, so please check through carefully before resubmitting the revision. Example in abstract - "Intervention sites were assigned to use the QUiPP app (with quantitative fetal fibronectin and/or or cervical length with history)in and suggested admission..." (the "in and suggested admission" part doesn't quite make sense. </p>
              <p>*Please refer to the CONSORT for cluster trials reporting guideline (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-cluster/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort-cluster/</ext-link>) and it might be helpful to add more detail on some aspects of reporting both to the paper (see reviewer 2's comments), and to the abstract, for example what the unit of randomization was (mat unit?) and how many were assigned to each arm. For submitted trials the journal normally wants to see a completed CONSORT checklist appended as supporting information - so we'd recommend adding this (and the CONSORT for cluster RCTs would probably be the most helpful here).</p>
              <p>*Some minor changes to the writeup would also be helpful, we'd suggest moving the "Aims and Objectives" subsection into Methods and also moving the Ethics Approval information from the end of the paper to the end of the Methods.</p>
              <p>*At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: It is a relevant study as presently, AI based algorithms are being used increasingly in medical practice to improve decision making. </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Statistical review</p>
              <p>This paper reports a cluster randomised trial comparing use of an app to guide decision about whether to admit pregnant women at risk of pre-term birth. There were no significant differences between the arms, which appears to be due to control sites using qfFN, which is a major contributor to the app risk score.</p>
              <p>I did not see a protocol provided, or details of whether the trial was registered on a repository such as clinicaltrials.gov, which is required for PLOS medicine. My other comments were more minor:</p>
              <p>1. Abstract - I found it hard to follow line 15 and 16 of the abstract, in particular the part outside the brackets.</p>
              <p>2. Abstract, main outcome measures - I think it's a bit unclear here whether the outcomes described here are separate primary outcomes or combined into one. Later in the paper it's clear it's the latter but here I was confused by 'main outcome measures' as the sub-title. </p>
              <p>3. Abstract, main outcome measures - it's also not too clear whether the outcome was binary, i.e. occurrence of one or both of the events, or as written, the sum of number of events. I would recommend this is made clearer. A similar comment applies to the methods section on page 7.</p>
              <p>4. Abstract - for the primary outcome I would recommend a p-value is included as well as the confidence interval.</p>
              <p>5. Page 5 - can more information be provided about the randomisation procedure and how it was performed?</p>
              <p>6. Page 8 - the statistical analysis says that risk ratios were calculated but the abstract reports odds ratios. This section also mentions 'minimisation process' which should be described more in the randomisation section as per previous comment.</p>
              <p>7. Page 8 - I would recommend providing more details of the statistical analysis for evaluating the predictive accuracy of the QUiPP app.</p>
              <p>8. Figure 1 - it would be of interest to know whether the loss-to-follow-up was similar between the two groups. Maybe this could be given by arm in the figure?</p>
              <p>9. Page 11 - the authors alternate between using 'cluster' period and 'analysis' period which I found a bit confusing - are these the same things?</p>
              <p>10. Table 3 - were the neonatal outcomes not planned to be analysed statistically? If so then I'd provide the results as in table 2.</p>
              <p>11. Page 13 - I found the per-protocol analysis difficult to follow: could this be described more in the methods section?</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>This cluster trial offers a deep insight on the clinical management of threatened PTL, in UK.</p>
              <p>The planning and execution of the study have been well performed.</p>
              <p>Overall, a 17% PTB rate in women presenting (admitted or not) for PTL are within expected range in settings of good quality of care, not being affected by excessive fear and anxiety.</p>
              <p>The trial demonstrated that clinicians behave better than guidelines provided for them! Certainly, app would warrant a more standardized application of risk factors.</p>
              <p>I congratulate Authors for this very interesting study.</p>
              <p>Few points to better understand data:</p>
              <p>1) There should be an explanation why lot of tertiary centres pertain to control. It was expected that standard of cares could be better than in other units. Thus we believe app will be less added value?</p>
              <p>2) How many centres used "old" yes/not fFN test? In the case, is possible a comparison between quali- and quanti-tative test on main outcome?</p>
              <p>3) How was steroids rate administered after 34 weeks? </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>The objective of this multi-centre cluster randomised-controlled trial was to investigate the impact of the use of the QUiPP app versus conventional management on inappropriate management for threatened preterm labour (TPTL). According to the intention to treat analysis, inappropriate management of TPTL was 11.3% at the intervention sites versus 11.5% at control sites (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.66-1.42). According to the per protocol analysis, inappropriate admissions and discharges were also not significantly reduced in the intervention arm (7.4% versus 9.9%).</p>
              <p>This is an interesting randomised-controlled trial which should be considered for publication. However, I have several comments.</p>
              <p>The methodology of this RCT is adequate with a low risk of bias:</p>
              <p>Internal validity:</p>
              <p>- A selection bias is very unlikely: EQUIPTT was a cluster randomised-controlled trial with a parallel group design across 13 obstetric centres: randomisation was performed at the cluster (maternity centre) level.</p>
              <p>- Because masking was not feasible, performance bias is possible but unlikely because the QUiPP app was only implemented in the intervention centres and management of women was similar between the two arms.</p>
              <p>- A detection bias is very unlikely because the composite primary outcome of inappropriate management for TPTL was objective and defined by the number of inappropriate admission decisions: admitted and delivery interval &gt;7 days or not admitted and delivery interval ≤ 7 days, and the number of inappropriate in-utero transfer decisions/actions: IUTs that occurred or were attempted &gt;7 days prior to delivery, and ex utero transfers that should have been in-utero.</p>
              <p>- An attrition bias is possible but also unlikely: indeed, 1872 women (761 intervention and 1111 control) were recruited but only 1799 women (724 intervention and 1075 control) were included in the ITT analysis.</p>
              <p>External validity : </p>
              <p>13 obstetric centres including Special Care Unit (level 1), local Neonatal Unit (level 2) and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (level 3) participated in this study, ensuring an excellent external validity.</p>
              <p>However, this paper presents several limitations that should be considered:</p>
              <p>The per protocol analysis is interesting to report. However, this analysis is not specified in the Methods section (Statistical Analysis). The authors should clarify whether this is a prespecified analysis or a post-hoc analysis.</p>
              <p>A main strong of this RCT is its pragmatic approach and the absence of significant statistical differences between the intervention and control arms, both in ITT analysis and per protocol analysis reinforces the reliability of the results. Therefore, the post-hoc analysis evaluating the impact of the QUiPP app compared with current UK national guidance is not consistent with the pragmatic approach of the authors and should be deleted. This post-hoc analysis could even be considered a "spin" leading the authors to consider the usefulness of the QUiPP app while their trial is negative and shows the lack of benefit to the use of the QUiPP app in real life.</p>
              <p>Therefore, The Results and the Discussion Sections should be reviewed, mainly focusing on the prespecified analysis reporting negative results. I understand that the authors are disappointed by this negative result but this "spin" has the effect of devaluing the methodological quality of this trial.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Watson,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Evaluating the use of the QUiPP app and its impact on the management of threatened preterm labour: a cluster-randomised trial." (PMEDICINE-D-20-06019R2) for consideration at PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with editorial colleagues and it was also seen again by two reviewers. I am pleased to tell you that, provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with, we expect to be able to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>Please let me know if you have any questions, and we look forward to receiving the revised manuscript shortly.   </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Please quote study dates in your abstract. </p>
              <p>Please quote aggregate demographic details for study participants in the abstract.</p>
              <p>Around line 17 of the abstract, please quote the number of women and hospitals in each group, and specify "randomly assigned". </p>
              <p>Where you quote the primary endpoint findings in your abstract, please add absolute numbers (e.g., "84/741 fetuses (11.3%) versus ...").</p>
              <p>After quoting the primary endpoint findings in your abstract, we suggest adding a sentence to quote findings of the prespecified per-protocol analysis.</p>
              <p>Around line 31 of the abstract, please add a sentence, say, to quote the absolute numbers of "adverse events" (i.e., 4 vs 12 women not receiving necessary management). </p>
              <p>A "close bracket" appears to be missing at line 33 of the abstract. </p>
              <p>The final sentence of the "Methods and findings" subsection of your abstract should begin "Study limitations include ..." or similar and quote 2-3 of the study's main limitations. Please either add a new sentence to achieve this or adapt the current relevant sentence in your abstract.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that "TPTL" is spelt out at first use (for example, it appears that "(TPTL)" needs to be added preceding the full point at line 41). </p>
              <p>Please also spell out "qfFN" at first use and use the abbreviation consistently. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the author summary to consist of three subsections, individually consisting of three short bulleted points each. You may find it helpful to consult one or two recent research papers in PLOS Medicine to get a sense of the preferred style. </p>
              <p>Please make that "data were" on p.7 of the PDF.</p>
              <p>Throughout the text, please style the reference call-outs as follows: "... prediction studies [18,19]." (noting the absence of spaces within the square brackets); and adopt journal style (e.g., "[23-25]" in the Discussion). </p>
              <p>Please remove the information on funding from the end of the main text. In the event of publication, this information will appear in the article metadata, via entries in the submission form. </p>
              <p>In the reference list, please convert all italics to plain text. </p>
              <p>Noting reference 5, please ensure that all references have full access details. </p>
              <p>Noting reference 31, please ensure that where appropriate 6 author names are listed, followed by "et al.".</p>
              <p>Please rename the attached CONSORT checklist "S1_CONSORT_Checklist" and refer to it by this label in your Methods section. Please adapt the checklist so that individual items are referred to by section (e.g., "Methods") and paragraph number rather than by line or page numbers, as the latter generally change upon publication. </p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>Thank you to the authors for responding to my previous comments well. I have no remaining issues to raise.</p>
              <p>*** Reviewer #4: </p>
              <p>The modifications made by the authors are satisfactory.</p>
              <p>The article is now suitable for publication.</p>

              <p>Dear Dr Watson, </p>
              <p>On behalf of my colleagues, I am pleased to inform you that we have agreed to publish your manuscript "Evaluating the use of the QUiPP app and its impact on the management of threatened preterm labour: a cluster-randomised trial." (PMEDICINE-D-20-06019R3) in PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>Prior to final acceptance, please: correct "ISRCTN" on the title page; check the quoted number of women in the intervention arm in the abstract ("762", quoted as "761" in the results, we think); make that "30.2 years" in the abstract; move the first point in the second subsection of the author summary to the first subsection; and add full access details to reference 6.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>medicinepress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
