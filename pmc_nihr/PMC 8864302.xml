                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The TRACT trial established the timing of transfusion in children with uncomplicated anaemia (haemoglobin 4–6 g/dL) and the optimal volume (20 <italic>vs</italic> 30 mL/kg whole blood or 10 <italic>vs</italic> 15 mL/kg red cell concentrates) for transfusion in children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL) on day 28 mortality (primary endpoint). Because data on the safety of blood components are scarce, we conducted a secondary analysis to examine the safety and efficacy of different pack types (whole blood <italic>vs</italic> red cell concentrates) on clinical outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study is a secondary analysis of the TRACT trial data restricted to those who received an immediate transfusion (using whole blood or red cell concentrates). TRACT was an open-label, multicentre, factorial, randomised trial conducted in three hospitals in Uganda (Soroti, Mbale, and Mulago) and one hospital in Malawi (Blantyre). The trial enrolled children aged between 2 months and 12 years admitted to hospital with severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;6 g/dL). The pack type used (supplied by blood banks) was based only on availability at the time. The outcomes were haemoglobin recovery at 8 h and 180 days, requirement for retransfusion, length of hospital stay, changes in heart and respiratory rates until day 180, and the main clinical endpoints (mortality until day 28 and day 180, and readmission until day 180), measured using multivariate regression models.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3199 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. 3188 children were considered in our secondary analysis. The median age was 37 months (IQR 18–64). Whole blood was the first pack provided for 1632 (41%) of 3992 transfusions. Haemoglobin recovery at 8 h was significantly lower in those who received packed cells or settled cells than those who received whole blood, with a mean of 1·4 g/dL (95% CI –1·6 to –1·1) in children who received 30 mL/kg and –1·3 g/dL (–1·5 to –1·0) in those who received 20 mL/kg packed cells versus whole blood, and –1·5 g/dL (–1·7 to –1·3) in those who received 30 mL/kg and –1·0 g/dL (–1·2 to –0·9) in those who received 20 mL/kg settled cells versus whole blood (overall p&lt;0·0001). Compared to whole blood, children who received blood as packed or settled cells in their first transfusion had higher odds of receiving a second transfusion (odds ratio 2·32 [95% CI 1·30 to 4·12] for packed cells and 2·97 [2·18 to 4·05] for settled cells; p&lt;0·001) and longer hospital stays (hazard ratio 0·94 [95% CI 0·81 to 1·10] for packed cells and 0·86 [0·79 to 0·94] for settled cells; p=0·0024). There was no association between the type of blood supplied for the first transfusion and mortality at 28 days or 180 days, or readmission to hospital for any cause. 823 (26%) of 3188 children presented with severe tachycardia and 2077 (65%) with tachypnoea, but these complications resolved over time. No child developed features of confirmed cardiopulmonary overload.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Our study suggests that the use of packed or settled cells rather than whole blood leads to additional transfusions, increasing the use of a scarce resource in most of sub-Saharan Africa. These findings have substantial cost implications for blood transfusion and health services. Nevertheless, a clinical trial comparing whole blood transfusion with red cell concentrates might be needed to inform policy makers.</p>

              <p id="para10">Most transfusions in sub-Saharan Africa are done using whole blood.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Reflecting international practice, blood transfusion services across sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly moving towards a wider provision of red cell concentrates, despite clear differences in the patient populations requiring transfusion.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Although red cell concentrates are more costly and time-consuming to prepare, these changes have mostly been justified on the grounds of maximising the use of a single blood donation. Data on the requirements for blood components are scarce for most countries in Africa. Studies published on this topic tend to be biased towards blood transfusion services,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and might not represent the needs of less-resourced hospital blood banks. Generally, requirements differ from those in high-income countries, in which oncology and surgery use most of the transfusion components; whereas in sub-Saharan Africa demand is predominantly centred around the high incidence of acute paediatric severe anaemia (mainly due to nutritional and infectious causes [malaria, sepsis, and helminths] and sickle cell disease), haemorrhagic complications of pregnancy, and trauma.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Transfusions required by these patient groups are mainly for emergency management in cases where whole blood needs to be replaced. Evidence supporting the superiority of red cell components (packed cells) over whole blood in children and pregnant women, the most common recipients in sub-Saharan Africa, is weak.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The use of whole blood for African children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia does not lead to fluid overload events<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and was shown to be safe, but the sample size in most studies is too small to provide reliable information for guideline recommendations. With respect to international guidelines for paediatric transfusion in children who are critically ill, in 2018, the international Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative developed consensus recommendations for red cell transfusion.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The guideline group noted the general paucity of published paediatric data to justify their recommendations. Moreover, there were no specific recommendations on the use of whole blood versus red cell concentrates.</p>

                  <p id="para40">In sub-Saharan Africa, blood transfusion services are moving towards provision of red cell concentrates rather than using whole blood for transfusion, reflecting practice in high-income countries. These changes have mainly been justified on the grounds of maximising the use of a single blood donation, despite red cell concentrates being more costly and time-consuming to prepare than whole blood. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for original articles and systematic reviews published between database inception and June 10, 2021, involving treatment recommendations for transfusion for paediatric severe anaemia in Africa, using the terms ”transfusion”, “severe anaemia”, “child”, and “guideline” with no language restrictions. A systematic review on transfusion practice in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 evaluated the recommendations and guidelines supporting whole blood and packed red cell transfusions for pregnancy-related indications and paediatric anaemia. From 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 32 guidelines in English were identified. Seven guidelines justified the use of red cell concentrates rather than whole blood, mostly on the basis of safety (whole blood was considered to increase the risk of volume-related complications). None of these guidelines cited research findings to support their recommendations. In 2018, the international Transfusion and Anemia Expertise Initiative developed consensus recommendations on red blood cell transfusion in children who were critically ill. Notably, one major challenge for developing and justifying their recommendations was the paucity of published paediatric data. No specific recommendations were made on the use of whole blood versus red cell concentrates. Before our TRACT trial, evidence to support the introduction of red cell concentrates for paediatric transfusion in Africa was scarce. Additionally, no clinical trials have compared whole blood and packed red cell transfusion with patient outcomes.</p>
                  <p id="para50">The multicentre, factorial, TRACT trial was designed to establish evidence-based transfusion practice. The trial investigated immediate transfusion versus no transfusion (standard of care) in children with uncomplicated severe anaemia (haemoglobin 4–6 g/dL) and whether a higher volume of whole blood (30 mL/kg or red cell concentrate equivalent) in children with haemoglobin lower than 6 g/dL would improve outcomes compared with the standard volume (20 mL/kg whole blood or red cell concentrate equivalent). Outcomes included mortality until day 28 (primary outcome) and day 180, readmissions, and relapse of severe anaemia. The trial showed that non-immediate transfusion in children with uncomplicated severe anaemia is safe; provided that children are monitored (for the development of severity). The TRACT trial also showed that higher volumes of blood transfusions reduced the number of deaths in children without fever (hazard ratio [HR] 0·43, 95% CI 0·27–0·69). Whereas in children admitted to hospital with fever (&gt;37·5°C) who received 30 mL/kg whole blood equivalent, the risk of mortality almost doubled (HR 1·91, 95% CI 1·04–3·49) compared with those who received a lower volume of 20 mL/kg. Transfusion with whole blood and red cell concentrates did not affect the primary or safety endpoints.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this research</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">The secondary analysis of the TRACT trial examined the optimal pack type in 3992 transfusions, of which 1632 (41%) were whole blood transfusions and 2360 (49%) were red cell concentrate transfusions (issued by the blood bank but not prespecified on the request form). The analysis of haemoglobin recovery by pack type at 8 h showed superior recovery in children initially receiving whole blood (p&lt;0·0001) versus red cell concentrates. Children who received an initial red cell concentrate transfusion had more second transfusion episodes and longer hospital stay than children who received whole blood initially. The pack type supplied for the initial transfusion did not predict any other clinical outcomes, including mortality at 28 or 180 days, or hospital readmissions. Transfusion-related adverse events, such as volume overload, were rare and unrelated to pack type. Although not randomised, observational analyses of trial data indicate that children who received red cell concentrates as the first transfusion had poorer haematological correction, additional transfusions (which increases infection risk because of increased donor exposure and further depletes scarce blood supplies), and longer hospital stays without any safety benefit than children who received whole blood.</p>

                  <p id="para90">Providing whole blood for paediatric transfusion, which accounts for a large proportion of transfusions in sub-Saharan Africa, could result in substantial cost and resource savings for blood transfusion and health services.</p>

              <p id="para100">In 2015, a multicentre, factorial, open-label TRACT trial was conducted to establish evidence-based transfusion and treatment strategies with the aim of improving early and long-term mortality and readmission to hospital.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> The trial was registered (ISRCTN84086586) in Feb 11, 2013.

                <p id="para170">Baseline characteristics were summarised and children's haemoglobin concentrations (mean and 95% CI) were plotted over time and stratified by blood pack type (first pack from the first transfusion). The effect of blood pack type on different clinical outcomes was measured using multivariate regression models. These models were either previously published (for mortality and readmissions; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 pp 6–7, 8–11</xref>)<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> or built using backwards elimination with a threshold of p&lt;0·1 and candidate covariates to enable adjustment for confounders, which were identified using clinical input, previous knowledge, reviewing literature, and checking for non-linearity of continuous variables with the Stata (version 16.1) multivariable fractional polynomial function (α=0·05). All models were adjusted for site, if not already included in model. Cox regression was used for mortality models and Schoenfeld residuals were tested and checked graphically for non-proportionality. Logistic regression was used to analyse children receiving a second transfusion during the initial hospital admission. Haemoglobin recovery at 8 h and 180 days was examined with normal linear regression, adjusted for baseline haemoglobin. Time to discharge was modelled using competing risks with the competing event defined as death during initial admission and a subhazard ratio of less than 1 indicating longer time to discharge; for time to readmission models, the competing event was defined as death post-discharge. Competing risk methods estimated the probability of an event (analogous to Kaplan-Meier) using cumulative incidence functions and the effect of each adjusted variable on the subdistribution hazard corresponding to the cumulative incidence function.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Blood pack type was then added into these models, if not already retained, to examine whether the pack type was independently predictive of the outcome. Possible interactions in outcome models for blood pack type and randomisation group were considered before analyses and tested using a likelihood ratio test or Wald test and p values, checked graphically from the ten models, and compared with Benjamini-Hochberg critical values to adjust for multiple testing.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para180">The p values from heterogeneity tests (likelihood ratio test or Wald test on two df) on the ten models were ranked and compared with critical values from the Benjamini-Hochberg method to account for multiple testing and strong evidence was found only in the model for change in haemoglobin at 8 h (p=0·0002; critical value p=0·0050), and thus, results were presented separately by volume randomisation for this model. All other models had p values higher than their corresponding critical value and thus effect estimates were presented overall.</p>
                <p id="para190">For models, we used complete case analysis because the missing data was less than 5% for baseline values. Absolute numbers and outcome events in children receiving different blood pack types were summarised with unadjusted effect estimates (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 pp 4–5</xref>). Respiratory rate and heart rate from randomisation to 48 h post-transfusion were modelled using change from baseline as the outcome in a normal generalised estimating equation model, adjusting for baseline values (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 pp 16–17</xref>).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Sensitivity analyses were carried out with data restricted to Soroti and Mbale (Uganda) for comparison of whole blood versus settled cells and restricted to Mulago (Uganda) and Blantyre (Malawi) for comparison of whole blood versus packed cells.

              <p id="para210">Between Sept 17, 2014, and May 15, 2017, 3199 children with severe anaemia were enrolled into the TRACT trial. Consent was declined by three participants post-randomisation (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 2 p 4</xref>) and 3196 children (1598 in each group [30 mL/kg versus 20 mL/kg whole blood equivalent groups]) were included in further analysis. 2418 (76%) participants had one or more severity feature (impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, haemoglobinurea, profound anaemia, or reported sickle cell disease), and 778 (24%) had uncomplicated severe anaemia. Seven children died before the transfusion and one had no form to confirm transfusion; thus, 3188 children were considered in our secondary analysis. 1338 (42%) of 3188 had a haemoglobin of less than 4 g/dL and 883 (28%) of 3160 had sickle cell disease confirmed by genotyping.</p>

Although statistically significant due to the trial size, differences in baseline characteristics between blood pack types were small.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para290">The multicentre TRACT trial investigated whether an initial transfusion with either whole blood or red cell concentrates (packed or settled cells) had an effect on clinical outcomes in children admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. We found that haematological correction at 8 h was substantially better in children who received whole blood than in those transfused with packed or settled cells, regardless of the volume of blood transfused (20 or 30 mL/kg). Children receiving red cell concentrates as their initial transfusion had a higher number of additional transfusions and longer hospital stay. There was no evidence that the type of blood was associated with mortality or readmissions.</p>
              <p id="para300">These findings have important implications for blood transfusion services in Africa that are promoting the use of blood components, particularly given the additional staff and equipment requirements and consequently overall cost of preparing red cell concentrates. The Blood Transfusion Safety Programme for WHO recommends that blood transfusions collected might be used more effectively if they are separated into components (red cell concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitates, and platelet concentrates), to be used by more than one patient. Moreover, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blood-safety-and-availability" id="interrefs10">Global Database on Blood Safety</ext-link> uses the proportion of components prepared per unit of whole blood collected as a general indicator of productivity for blood transfusion services. A 2016, report<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> indicated that 36% (15 of 41) of African countries contributing data to the audit had less than 25% of whole blood donations separated into components. Our findings indicate that achieving exclusive component preparation will have a negative effect on paediatric services, one of the largest users of transfused blood.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p id="para310">Potential volume overload is another reason for recommending red cell concentrates.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In our study, 42% of children had haemoglobin of less than 4 g/dL and 27% had sickle cell disease. These groups might be at risk of volume overload or transfusion reactions, or both, since children with profound anaemia are considered at higher risk of heart failure and many children with sickle cell disease have had multiple previous transfusions.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, we found no evidence of overload in children receiving whole blood compared with red cell concentrates, or with a larger volume of blood received, irrespective of the severity of anaemia or underlying sickle cell disease.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Most transfusion-related lung injuries or cardiac overloads were deemed by the endpoint review committee (who were unaware of treatment assignment) to be unrelated to the intervention.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In the TRACT trial, no child received a diuretic or heart failure medication, and although there were differences between pack types in heart rate and respiratory rate at 48 h, these were too small to be clinically meaningful.</p>
              <p id="para320">The major limitation of this study is that the trial data used for the subanalysis did not directly compare the use of whole blood with packed or settled cells using a specific randomisation. However, the large size of the trial, in which donor blood was sourced from three regional blood transfusion services in two countries and blood was issued based on availability rather than prespecified by request or clinician preference, provides some assurance against potential bias. One of the advantages of this study is that our models were also adjusted for site and other risk factors for each outcome. Moreover, recording of the donor blood haematological characteristics was mostly done by laboratory staff masked to the pack type.</p>
              <p id="para330">One of the most unexpected findings is that haematological correction was worse in children receiving packed or settled cells than in those receiving whole blood. Indeed, the opposite would be expected given that whole blood is likely to result in more haemodilution in the recipient than packed or settled cells. One obvious explanation is that the haemoglobin concentration of packed or settled cells in a pack was lower than the required range. However, our quality control measures showed that the median and IQR for haemoglobin concentration in packed cells, settled cells, and whole blood were all within the expected range, making this explanation unlikely.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We also weighed each pack and recorded the volume of blood transfused, allowing us to exclude non-adherence to transfusion volume. Therefore, we conclude that guidelines stating that 10 mL/kg of red cell concentrate (as packed or settled cells) is equivalent to 20 mL/kg of whole blood are not correct and should be reviewed. However, given the added expense of preparing components, the revision of guidelines to increase volume of red cell components to the whole blood equivalent would involve a more complex calculation; our data suggest that 30 mL/kg whole blood equates to approximately 20 mL/kg packed or settled cells. Moreover, we have shown that for children with severe anaemia, using red cell concentrates did not show evidence of improved safety in terms of fluid overload complications. At the current recommended volumes, children are exposed to additional transfusions and thus, more donor exposure with the inherent risk of adverse reactions and potential transfusion-transmitted infections. Detection of transfusion-transmitted infections were not included in the study protocol or the extended follow-up, which could have detected transfusion-transmitted infections,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> suggesting a possible limitation.</p>
              <p id="para340">The other major users of blood transfusion services in Africa are the maternity services for emergency management of mothers with bleeding complications. Treatment of anaemia by packed cells does not replace the volume deficit and mothers require additional intravenous fluids to maintain total blood volume. Transfusing whole blood could help to avoid this additional requirement.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Together with the findings from TRACT, our study suggests that component preparation to produce packed or settled cells might not be the optimal strategy for the two largest user groups of transfusion services (children and pregnant women). In Zimbabwe, a transfusion with whole blood is nearly 16% cheaper per pack than using packed cells,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> suggesting that transfusion with whole blood could lead to considerable savings. The current process of producing red cell concentrates for paediatric and neonatal transfusion (pedipacks) could be more readily replaced at the point of blood collection from a donor by directly splitting the donation into a number of smaller packs (whole blood pedipacks), which is now a standard practice within the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://vimeo.com/540381518" id="interrefs20">Malawi blood transfusion service</ext-link>.</p>
              <p id="para350">In conclusion, our study suggests that the use of packed or settled cells rather than whole blood leads to additional transfusions; thus increasing the use of a scarce resource in most of sub-Saharan Africa. Although further consideration should be given by blood transfusion services on how to streamline requirements to include whole blood, as well as when and for whom whole blood transfusion is most needed,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> rather than a one-size-fits-all policy for all regional blood transfusion services, a clinical trial comparing whole blood transfusion with red cell concentrates might be needed to inform policy makers.</p>
