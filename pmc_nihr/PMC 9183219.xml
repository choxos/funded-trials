                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Vaccination of children and young people against SARS-CoV-2 is recommended in some countries. Scarce data have been published on immune responses induced by COVID-19 vaccines in people younger than 18 years compared with the same data that are available in adults.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>COV006 is a phase 2, single-blind, randomised, controlled trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) in children and adolescents at four trial sites in the UK. Healthy participants aged 6–17 years, who did not have a history of chronic respiratory conditions, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, or previously received capsular group B meningococcal vaccine (the control), were randomly assigned to four groups (4:1:4:1) to receive two intramuscular doses of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or control, 28 days or 84 days apart. Participants, clinical investigators, and the laboratory team were masked to treatment allocation. Study groups were stratified by age, and participants aged 12–17 years were enrolled before those aged 6–11 years. Due to the restrictions in the use of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in people younger than 30 years that were introduced during the study, only participants aged 12–17 years who were randomly assigned to the 28-day interval group had received their vaccinations at the intended interval (day 28). The remaining participants received their second dose at day 112. The primary outcome was assessment of safety and tolerability in the safety population, which included all participants who received at least one dose of the study drug. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity, which was assessed in participants who were seronegative to the nucleocapsid protein at baseline and received both prime and boost vaccine. This study is registered with ISRCTN (15638344).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 15 and April 2, 2021, 262 participants (150 [57%] participants aged 12–17 years and 112 [43%] aged 6–11 years; due to the change in the UK vaccination policy, the study terminated recruitment of the younger age group before the planned number of participants had been enrolled) were randomly assigned to receive vaccination with two doses of either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=211 [n=105 at day 28 and n=106 at day 84]) or control (n=51 [n=26 at day 28 and n=25 at day 84]). One participant in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 day 28 group in the younger age bracket withdrew their consent before receiving a first dose. Of the participants who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 169 (80%) of 210 participants reported at least one solicited local or systemic adverse event up to 7 days following the first dose, and 146 (76%) of 193 participants following the second dose. No serious adverse events related to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 administration were recorded by the data cutoff date on Oct 28, 2021. Of the participants who received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, there were 128 unsolicited adverse events up to 28 days after vaccination reported by 83 (40%) of 210 participants. One participant aged 6–11 years receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 reported a grade 4 fever of 40·2°C on day 1 following first vaccination, which resolved within 24 h. Pain and tenderness were the most common local solicited adverse events for all the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and capsular group B meningococcal groups following both doses. Of the 242 participants with available serostatus data, 14 (6%) were seropositive at baseline. Serostatus data were not available for 20 (8%) of 262 participants. Among seronegative participants who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and pseudoneutralising antibody titres at day 28 after the second dose were higher in participants aged 12–17 years with a longer interval between doses (geometric means of 73 371 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [95% CI 58 685–91 733] and 299 half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>; 95% CI 230–390]) compared with those aged 12–17 years who received their vaccines 28 days apart (43 280 AU/mL [95% CI 35 852–52 246] and 150 IC<sub>50</sub> [95% CI 116–194]). Humoral responses were higher in those aged 6–11 years than in those aged 12–17 years receiving their second dose at the same 112-day interval (geometric mean ratios 1·48 [95% CI 1·07–2·07] for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 2·96 [1·89–4·62] for pseudoneutralising antibody titres). Cellular responses peaked after a first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 across all age and interval groups and remained above baseline after a second vaccination.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is well tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 6–17 years, inducing concentrations of antibody that are similar to those associated with high efficacy in phase 3 studies in adults. No safety concerns were raised in this trial.</p>

                  <p id="para50">Eight licensed vaccines to prevent COVID-19 have been approved by WHO for Emergency Use Listing (EUL): seven for use in adults aged 18 years and older, and one for use in adults aged 16 years and older. A further 28 vaccines have been approved for use in at least one country. Peer-reviewed clinical trial data describing safety and immunogenicity of EUL vaccines in children and adolescents have been published for four of these vaccines (CoronaVac [SinoVac], BBIBP-CorV [SinoPharm], BNT162b2 [Pfizer–BioNtech], and mRNA-1273 [Moderna]). Immunobridging studies have shown that two standard adult doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 generated neutralising antibody titres in adolescents aged 12–15 years comparable with adults aged 18–25 years and a formal phase 3 study of BNT162b2 in adolescents is now underway. Use of fractional dosing of 10 μg of BNT162b2 in children aged 5–11 years has an acceptable reactogenicity profile and induces neutralising antibody titres comparable with those in adolescents at the age of 12–15 years receiving an adult dose. Similarly, phase 1/2 data of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine supports phase 3 evaluation of the adult regimen (two 4 μg doses, four weeks apart) in children. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN.com on Feb 22, 2022, for all active studies of WHO-listed COVID-19 vaccines that had enrolled, or were enrolling, participants younger than 16 years. 34 trials were found, of which 17 are evaluating BNT162b2, ten evaluating mRNA-1273, ten evaluating CoronaVac, six evaluating ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, three evaluating Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen), and one evaluating each of BBIBP-CorV, NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax), and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech). Fourteen trials are taking place in Asia, 11 in North America, six in Europe, and five in South America. Trial start dates ranged from April, 2020, to Feb, 2022. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectored vaccines have previously been administered to more than 400 children from infancy to 6 years of age in trials of a malaria vaccine ChAd63 ME-TRAP. More recently, trials of an Ebola vaccine ChAd3-EBO-Z have shown acceptable safety and tolerability profiles in children aged 1–17 years at a dose similar to, or greater than, that of the currently licensed adult dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 5 X 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">We provide the first report of a paediatric clinical study of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 262 children aged 6–17 years. The vaccine was well tolerated when given in a two-dose schedule of 5 X 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles at either 28 days or 112 days apart. Adverse events following immunisation were short-lived. No serious adverse events related to vaccine administration occurred. A stronger humoral response was observed when the two doses were administered at the longer interval than the shorter interval and greater responses were seen in participants aged 6–11 years of age than in children aged 12–17 years. Humoral responses measured by anti-spike IgG and virus pseudoneutralisation were of a similar magnitude to those detected in adult studies of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Spike-specific T-cell responses were observed after a first dose.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>

                  <p id="para90">There are several active paediatric trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. This is the first report on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Our study shows ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is well tolerated and generates both cellular and humoral immunity in children aged 6–17 years. No safety concerns were raised in this study. Immunogenicity in those aged 12–17 years increased with a longer dosing interval and immunogenicity was greater in those aged 6–11 years than in children aged 12–17 years. The data support the further evaluation of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for use in paediatric populations.</p>

                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para120">This phase 2 single-blind, randomised, controlled trial was done at four study sites in the UK (Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford; University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton; St George's University of London, London; and University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol). Healthy participants aged 6–17 years were recruited through social media, websites, and local and national media. All participants, or their parents on their behalf, initially completed an online screening form, and any queries were clarified by telephone conversation before attendance at their first clinic visit. Participants who had a history of chronic respiratory conditions, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (either a history of a positive result on a validated test or known seropositivity before enrolment), or previously received capsular group B meningococcal vaccine were excluded (full inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the protocol, which is available on the ISRCTN website).</p>
                <p id="para130">A detailed medical history was obtained from each participant at the first visit, an examination done if clinically indicated, and written informed consent obtained from participants aged 16 years or older, or from parents or guardians if aged between 6 and 15 years. Written assent was obtained from participants aged 11 years or older. This study was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee. The protocol and amendments were approved by the UK National Health Service Health Research Authority before implementation. The trial was done in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p>
                <p id="para140">The trial was designed as an age de-escalation study, and participants aged 12–17 years were enrolled first. After an independent data safety and monitoring committee and the MHRA reviewed 7 days of safety data in this age group, the participants aged 6–11 years were enrolled.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para150">Computer-generated randomisation lists were prepared by the study statisticians (XL and NGM). Participants were randomly assigned (4:1:4:1) to receive a two-dose series of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine as a control with a 28-day interval, or a two-dose series of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine with an 84-day interval. An active control was used to maintain masking of participants who had local or systemic side-effects. Randomisation was stratified by age group (6–11 years and 12–17 years) and study site using a block size of 10, chosen to align with the study group sizes. The trial staff administering the vaccine prepared vaccines out of sight of the participants and syringes were covered with an opaque material until ready for administration to ensure masking of participants. Participants were observed for 30 min after vaccination. Clinical investigators involved in endpoint assessment and the laboratory team remained masked to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine group allocation.</p>

                <title>Amendment to the study design</title>
                <p id="para160">During the recruitment window for participants aged 6–11 years, the UK Government was advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that individuals younger than 30 years who had not yet received a first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine should be given an alternative COVID-19 vaccine following safety concerns of vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia syndrome. This recommendation led to the cessation of further recruitment of participants aged 6–11 years, although recruitment targets for participants aged 12–17 years had already been met. Second-dose vaccination was then paused pending an MHRA review. Only participants aged 12–17 years randomly assigned to the 28-day interval groups had received second doses by this time. By April, 2021, further safety data in adults who had received second doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the UK became available for review by the MHRA. The MHRA then authorised administration of second vaccine doses to those participants aged 12–17 years randomly assigned to 84-day interval groups and to all those aged 6–11 years. As the originally intended day 84 window for second doses had passed, the second dose of vaccine was given to those participants aged 12–17 years randomly assigned to 84-day interval groups and to all those aged 6–11 years at day 112. Hereafter, 84-day interval refers to the planned interval group to which participants were randomly assigned and 112-day interval to the interval at which participants in this group received the doses.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para180">All participants had blood tests taken at baseline to determine the presence of anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid IgG. The vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was supplied by AstraZeneca (Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, version 1.0; Jan 28, 2021). ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 5 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles, as per the standard adult dose. Capsular group B meningococcal vaccine was supplied by the UK Health Security Agency (previously known as Public Health England) and administered intramuscularly at a standard dose of 0·5 mL. Participants completed electronic diaries for solicited adverse events for the first 7 days after vaccination and for unsolicited adverse events until 28 days after vaccination. Safety blood samples were taken for a subset of up to 40 participants aged 6–11 years at day 2 and day 7 following the second dose (up to 20 participants per timepoint). Laboratory and clinical adverse events were graded on a scale of 0–4, which is described in the protocol. Study follow-up was 12 months from date of first vaccination.</p>
                <p id="para190">For participants aged 12–17 years, immunogenicity blood samples were taken at days 0, 28, and 56 in the 28-day interval groups and days 0, 84, 112, and 140 in those assigned to the 84-day interval groups. For participants aged 6–11 years, immunogenicity blood samples were taken at days 0, 84, 112, and 140 in those originally randomly assigned to the 84-day interval group. Because the study design amendments affected blood sampling visits for participants aged 6–11 years who were originally randomly assigned to the 28-day interval groups, immunogenicity blood samples were taken at days 0, 28, 84, and 112 for these participants and only a subset at day 140 to minimise blood sampling.</p>
                <p id="para200">Baseline and post-vaccination humoral responses were measured via the following assays: a multiplexed electrochemiluminescence immunoassay against both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor-binding domain done at Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) laboratories (Richmond, VA, USA), an in-house standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralisation assay done by Monogram Biosciences (South San Francisco, CA, USA), as previously described.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Anti-nucleocapsid IgG status at baseline was done at PPD laboratories (Zaventern, Belgium), by ECLIA (Cobas platform, Roche Diagnostics).

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para210">The primary objective of this study was to assess the tolerability of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in children aged 6–17 years, in a two-dose regimen with either a 28-day or 84-day dosing interval. This objective was assessed by recording the occurrence of solicited local and systemic adverse events up to 7 days after each vaccination, unsolicited local and systemic adverse events up to 28 days after each vaccination, serious adverse events throughout the study, and the occurrence of atypical laboratory findings (grade 3 or worse) on days 2 and 7 after the second dose in a subset of up to 20 participants aged 6–11 years. Secondary outcomes were humoral and cellular immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, assessed by anti-spike pseudoneutralisation and ELISpot assays; and cell analysis by flow cytometry, which will be reported at a later date.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para220">There was no formal hypothesis testing in this trial, and the sample size was determined on the basis of practical considerations with regards to site recruitment capacity. With 60 participants in each ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group, the study provides more than 90% probability of observing at least one participant with an adverse event if the underlying adverse event incidence is 5%.</p>
                <p id="para230">The population of trial participants included in our safety analysis consisted of randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study vaccine. The secondary immunogenicity analyses were done in baseline seronegative (defined by anti-nucleocapsid IgG negativity at the time of first vaccination) participants who received both doses of study vaccine for whom immunogenicity data were available. Both safety and immunogenicity analyses were done according to the actual vaccine schedule received. Frequencies and percentages are presented for safety endpoints, and geometric mean and 95% CIs were reported for immunogenicity endpoints. The effect of the interval between first and second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on immunogenicity was evaluated by the geometric mean ratio (GMR). The GMR was calculated as the antilogarithm of the difference between the mean of the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed titre (to render a normal distribution) in the 112-day interval group and the 28-day interval group as the reference. Similarly, the GMRs and 95% CIs were reported to compare immunogenicity measured in participants aged 6–11 years and 12–17 years in the 112-day interval group. Further sensitivity analyses were done in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 groups after excluding participants who had an increase in anti-nucleocapsid IgG (by the multiplexed electrochemiluminescence immunoassay at PPD laboratories) of at least two times, or self-reported COVID-19, between baseline and 28 days after the second dose. To assess the relationship between neutralising antibody titres against the ChAdOx vector before the second dose and immune response at 28 days after the second dose, Pearson correlation coefficients were reported after log transformation. Censored data reported to be below the lower limit of quantification were imputed with a value equal to half of the threshold before transformation. All statistical analyses were done using R (version 4.1.1). An independent data and safety monitoring board provided safety oversight for this trial.

              <p id="para250">Between Feb 16 and April 2, 2021, 262 participants aged 6–17 years were enrolled into the study and assigned to vaccination with either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine at a 28-day or 84-day interval. Participants aged 12–17 years were recruited between Feb 16 and Feb 26, 2021, and participants aged 6–11 years were recruited between March 13 and April 2, 2021. Study cohorts included 150 (57%) participants aged 12–17 years and 112 (43%) participants aged 6–11 years. The median age of participants in the 12–17-year age group was 15·1 years (range 12·0–17·7; IQR 13·8–16·6); 74 (49%) participants were girls, and ten (7%) participants were from a minority ethnic background (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>
). The 150 older participants were randomly assigned to receive either ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (59 [39%] participants) at a 28-day interval, capsular group B meningococcal vaccine (16 [11%]) at a 28-day interval, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (61 [41%]) at an 84-day interval, or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine (14 [9%]) at an 84-day interval. One participant in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 28-day interval group received their second dose 115 days after their first due to temporary exclusion criteria being met and was treated as a 112-day interval

              <p id="para350">This is the first reported study of immunisation of children and adolescents with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at different intervals and shows that the vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic in children and adolescents aged 6–17 years when given as a two-dose regimen. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose than after the first dose regardless of dosing interval, a finding also observed in adult studies.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Spike-specific cellular immune responses were observed following the first dose. The humoral immunity was greater in the 112-day dosing interval group than the 28-day interval group in participants aged 12–17 years, and greater in younger participants than older participants dosed 112 days apart.</p>
              <p id="para360">Consistent with previous clinical trials of ChAd-vectored vaccines in children, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 had an acceptable tolerability profile. Fever rates of 16% in participants aged 12–17 years after a first dose are similar to those reported after routine childhood immunisations and in an adult trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in which fever was reported in 87 (18%) of 487 participants.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> No serious adverse events or adverse events of special interest related to study vaccine administration occurred. Other trials have also assessed safety and reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents. A phase 2 trial of BNT162b2 in adolescents reported higher fever rates after a second dose than after a first dose, consistent with adult findings,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> but these events were not observed in our study.

              <p id="para370">Participants in our trial generated at least as great a magnitude of anti-spike IgG response as adults aged 18–65 years after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 given at an 8–12-week interval. However, there were insufficient data from adult participants aged 18–25 years matched for vaccination interval to allow a direct comparison of immune responses.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> As already described in adults,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> a greater humoral response was measured after a longer dosing interval of ChAdOx1 nCOV-19. Younger children aged 6–11 years produced greater anti-spike IgG titres and neutralising antibody concentrations than older children aged 12–17 years after both a first and second dose of vaccine with a 112-day interval. In seronegative participants, an increase in anti-spike IgG titres was measured after the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 regardless of dosing interval, but no rise in titres was seen in seropositive participants after a second dose. This finding suggests that when vaccine supplies are scarce, receiving only one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 could be sufficient to confer protection in children and adolescents with previous COVID-19.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The concentration of IgG titres observed in our trial are similar to those seen in a study done in Chile, Peru, and the USA, before the emergence of delta and omicron variants, in which receiving two adult doses 4 weeks apart was associated with 74% efficacy against symptomatic PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults aged 18–64 years.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>

              <p id="para380">Immunogenicity data from paediatric trials of other COVID-19 vaccines have also been published. Two separate phase 1/2 trials of CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV in children aged 3–17 years showed that two standard adult doses of vaccine given 28 days apart were as immunogenic in children as in adults, as assessed by neutralising antibody titres.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Greater immunogenicity in younger children aged 5–11 years has been observed after vaccination with adult doses of BNT162b2 than observed immunogenicity in the adult population, such that fractional doses of 10 μg are now recommended for use in this age group.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Phase 2/3 trials of BNT162b2 in children aged 6–15 years<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> reported preliminary efficacy results similar to adult trials; however, emerging real-world data suggest that protection against mild disease conferred by fractional dosing regimens might be less than that with adult doses.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 produced significant increases in spike-specific T-cell responses in our cohort, and this is the first study to describe the generation of cellular immunity in response to COVID-19 vaccination in healthy children. A direct comparison to responses measured in adults aged 18–65 years after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination is not possible due to the different spike peptide pooling strategy used in the IFNγ ELISpot assay done in this study. Although humoral immunogenicity differed significantly between younger and older age groups, T-cell responses were similar between children aged 6–11 years and 12–17 years after both first and second doses. As previously observed in the adult population,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> a second dose of vaccine did not further increase spike-specific T-cell responses regardless of the interval between doses.

              <p id="para390">Anti-vector immunity has been hypothesised to negatively affect the immunogenicity of ChAd-vectored vaccines. In our study, similar concentrations of anti-vector immunity were seen regardless of vaccination interval and age group. Therefore, anti-vector immunity is unlikely to be the main reason explaining the observed difference of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 immunogenicity between groups. Consistent with findings in adults, there was no strong correlation between the concentration of anti-vector immunity measured immediately before administering a second dose and humoral and cellular measures of immunogenicity 28 days after the second vaccination.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para400">The current study allows comparison of both humoral and cellular immunity with results from adult studies and indicates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is at least as immunogenic in the age groups studied and therefore could be expected to provide a degree of clinical protection similar to that observed in the adult efficacy trials and real-world effectiveness studies. However, this indication remains to be formally shown.</p>
