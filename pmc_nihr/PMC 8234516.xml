                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Renal stone disease is common and can cause emergency presentation with acute pain due to ureteric colic. International guidelines have stated the need for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether a non-invasive outpatient (shockwave lithotripsy [SWL]) or surgical (ureteroscopy [URS]) intervention should be the first-line treatment for those needing active intervention. This has implications for shaping clinical pathways.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To report a pragmatic multicentre non-inferiority RCT comparing SWL with URS.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design, setting, and participants</title>
                  <p>This trial tested for non-inferiority of up to two sessions of SWL compared with URS as initial treatment for ureteric stones requiring intervention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome was whether further intervention was required to clear the stone, and secondary outcomes included quality of life assessment, severity of pain, and serious complications; these were based on questionnaires at baseline, 8 wk, and 6 mo. We included patients over 16 yr with a single ureteric stone clinically deemed to require intervention. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were planned.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results and limitations</title>
                  <p>The study recruited between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017. We recruited 613 participants from a total of 1291 eligible patients, randomising 306 to SWL and 307 to URS. Sixty-seven patients (22.1%) in the SWL arm needed further treatment compared with 31 patients (10.3%) in the URS arm. The absolute risk difference was 11.7% (95% confidence interval 5.6%, 17.8%) in favour of URS, which was inside the 20% threshold we set for demonstrating noninferiority of SWL.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This RCT was designed to test whether SWL is non-inferior to URS and confirmed this; although SWL is an outpatient noninvasive treatment with potential advantages both for patients and for reducing the use of inpatient health care resources, the trial showed a benefit in overall clinical outcomes with URS compared with SWL, reflecting contemporary practice. The Therapeutic Interventions for Stones of the Ureter (TISU) study provides new evidence to help guide the choice of modality for this common health condition.</p>

                  <title>Patient summary</title>
                  <p>We present the largest trial comparing ureteroscopy versus extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for ureteric stones. While ureteroscopy had marginally improved outcome in terms of stone clearance, as expected, shockwave lithotripsy had better results in terms of health care costs. These results should enable patients and health care providers to optimise treatment pathways for this common urological condition.</p>

                <title>Take Home Message</title>
                <p>This level 1 evidence highlights only a slight difference between ureteroscopy (URS) and shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), supporting SWL as an outpatient treatment without anaesthetic or theatre requirements, particularly relevant after COVID-19. While URS had higher stone clearance, both modalities appear suitable for primary treatment choice.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0005">The rising incidence of renal stone disease is well documented globally, with concomitant increased pressure on health care resources and in particular for the emergency management of acute ureteric colic <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. While there has been a recent focus on conservative medical management (medical expulsive therapy) <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, the greater challenge is how to manage stones that do not pass spontaneously and need active intervention. These patients are often multiple attenders at emergency departments, frequently require admission to an inpatient ward, and ultimately may need active surgical management.</p>
              <p id="par0010">In the emergency setting, a kidney obstructed by a stone can be drained with a temporary nephrostomy or ureteric stent, while the definitive surgical management to fragment the stone involves either shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) or laser fragmentation with ureteroscopy (URS). The delivery of SWL can be in an outpatient setting (by the use of either a fixed-site or a mobile lithotripter), whereas URS typically requires general anaesthesia and is undertaken in an operating theatre. Despite the availability of both modalities for over 2 decades, the choice of modality is usually based on local resources and expertise, patient choice, and accessibility. This is due to the lack of high-quality evidence on which both patients and clinicians can base treatment choices <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0015">We describe and report the results of a large pragmatic randomised multicentre study comparing SWL with URS (Therapeutic Interventions for symptomatic Stones of the Ureter Stones of or TISU study) assessing clinical outcomes of importance to patients (ie, need for further intervention) and important secondary outcome measures such as quality of life, in order to provide guidance to patients, clinicians, and health care commissioners.</p>

                <p id="par0020">In this randomised, non-inferiority trial, we recruited patients with a diagnosis of a unilateral ureteric stone from 25 UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. A prerequisite for involvement was that the site had a “fixed-site” lithotripter. We included adults aged ≥16 yr with stones of any size, confirmed by noncontrast computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CTKUB) and deemed to require intervention, and satisfying the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:</p>

                <p id="par0090">We provided patients with a TISU patient information sheet, and if they decided to take part they were asked to provide written informed consent. Trained site personnel, research nurses, and clinicians enrolled participants to the trial.</p>
                <p id="par0095">The trial was approved by the North of Scotland Ethics Committee 1 (reference: 13/NS/0002), by the sponsors NHS Grampian and the University of Aberdeen, and by the R&amp;D departments of the NHS organisations at each participating site. We conducted the trial in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and registered it on the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio (UKCRN study ID 13979), and were assigned an International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial number (ISRCTN92289221). Full details of the methods are available in the published protocol <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="par0100">Participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either SWL or URS by a centralised randomisation system hosted at the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT) in Aberdeen. The minimisation covariates were centre, stone size (≤10 or &gt;10 mm), and stone location (upper, middle, or lower ureter).</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="par0105">We collected baseline clinical data and participant-reported quality of life and pain before randomisation. Following randomisation, patients were provided with a date for their allocated intervention. We asked participants to complete follow-up questionnaires at 8 wk and 6 mo after randomisation. Site staff provided clinical information via case report forms at these same time points.</p>
                <p id="par0110">The principal investigator at each site was responsible for grading and reporting suspected serious adverse events to the trial office for the chief investigator to confirm. The sponsor and research ethics committee monitored all safety events. We did not collect non-serious adverse events.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="par0115">The primary clinical outcome was the resolution of stone episode, defined as no further intervention required to facilitate stone clearance up to 6 mo from randomisation. However, when sharing results with collaborators, it became clear that results were easier to interpret in the non-inferiority framework using the complement of this binary outcome, that is, the need for further treatment, so we have expressed the results as such. All further interventions received (and any serious complications [Clavien-Dindo level ≥3]) were collected at 8 wk and 6 mo after randomisation. The secondary outcomes were pain (numerical rating scale), self-reported number of days of analgesic use, quality of life using EQ-5D-3L <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (using the UK value sets), and the Short Form (SF)-12 physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="par0120">Our sample size calculations assumed, based upon evidence from the most recent systematic review, that the stone-free without further intervention proportions were 0.75 (P1) in the URS arm and 0.65 (P2) in the SWL arm <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We used a noninferiority margin of 20% (so P2 – P1&gt; –0.20 to infer noninferiority). Simulation of thousands of trials of fixed sizes with the parameters P1 and P2 as above indicated that a trial of 450 per arm was required for the lower bound of the estimated 95% confidence interval (CI) to exclude –20% with 90% power. We increased this to 1000 for attrition to the primary outcome (due to potential for crossover) as our planned analysis approach was a per-protocol one (ie, excluding crossovers). The non-inferiority margin came from a survey of members of the British Association of Urological Surgeons Section of Endourology. Following slower than planned recruitment, our funders requested a reassessment of the assumptions behind the sample size calculation. This was done by discussing the trial-aggregated primary outcome from 267 participants with our independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and subsequently with the funders, and the sample size was revised from 1000 to 750. The view of the DMC and funders was that a per-protocol analysis was of secondary importance to the intention-to-treat (ITT) approach. Therefore, using all available data for the primary analysis (and with the original design of assuming that the stone-free proportions would be 65% in the SWL arm and 75% in the URS arm), the achievable sample size of 750 gave above 80% power (full details in the Supplementary material).</p>
                <p id="par0125">Treatment groups are described at baseline and follow-up using means (with standard deviations), medians (with interquartile ranges), and numbers (with percentages) where relevant. We analysed the primary outcome using a generalised linear model with a log-link function and robust error variance, to estimate covariate-adjusted relative risks and derive risk differences <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Models were adjusted for the design covariates of trial centre (random effect), stone size (≤10 and &gt;10 mm), stone location (upper, middle, or lower ureter), and age and gender. Our main approach to analysing the primary outcome was ITT given the pragmatic nature of TISU evaluating two care pathways. In the analysis ITT-1, all participants were included “as randomised”, including those passing their stone before their intervention (this reflects waiting times for both SWL and URS in the UK National Health Service) setting. A second analysis, labelled ITT-2, repeated this but excluded all participants who passed their stones before the first randomised intervention. An ITT approach can be conservative for a non-inferiority trial, so we also prespecified per-protocol analyses. Results labelled PP-1 and PP-2 mirror the ITT analyses above but included only participants who were treated in line with the care pathway they were allocated to (ie, excluding crossovers). The primary outcome reflects the number requiring further intervention; thus, a higher figure is a worse outcome. Consequently, in order to avoid double negatives, we used the upper bound of the confidence interval around the absolute risk difference (estimated from our models) ruling out the prespecified noninferiority margin of 20% to conclude noninferiority. We made no adjustment for missing data because we had complete outcome data (apart from six postrandomisation exclusions) on all participants who gave consent for their clinical data to be used.</p>
                <p id="par0130">Secondary outcomes were compared in a similar way using a generalised linear model appropriate for the distributional form of the outcome being analysed, but in a superiority framework. We used linear mixed models for repeated measures quality of life data, estimating treatment effects by including a time-by-treatment interaction for fixed (nominal) time points of 8 wk and 6 mo from randomisation. We used a multiple imputation approach to deal with missing EQ-5D-3L and SF-12 outcome data. For each of these outcomes, we generated 50 imputation sets for each arm of the trial separately. Our imputation model used the baseline and 8-wk scores, treatment received, stone size, stone location (upper, middle, and lower ureter), gender, age, centre, and primary outcome status to predict missing EQ-5D-3L and SF-12 scores.</p>
                <p id="par0135">We explored the moderating effect of three a priori subgroup variables on the primary outcome by including subgroup-by-treatment interactions in our primary outcome model. These were stone size (≤10 and &gt;10 mm), stone location (upper, middle, or lower ureter), and gender. We used Forest plots to summarise the within-subgroup treatment estimates using 99% CIs. We used Stata 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) for all our statistical analyses <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p>

              <p id="par0145">Between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2017, we randomised 613 (19% of 3209 screened) participants from 25 UK secondary care centres. A total of 306 were allocated to SWL and 307 to URS; the groups were well balanced at baseline (<xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the SWL arm, 37 (12%) patients did not receive allocated treatment and had URS (reasons for change from allocated treatment included medical reasons, stone not seen at the time of SWL, and patient choice). In the URS arm, 12 (4%) did not receive their allocated treatment and received SWL (reasons for change being medical reasons and patient choice). For 52 (17%) in the SWL arm and 36 (12%) in the URS arm, their stone passed prior to treatment (ie, pretreatment imaging showed no stone visible and symptoms had resolved). Participant flow through the trial is summarised in a CONSORT diagram (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0005"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics</p></caption><alt-text id="at0015">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Variable</th><th align="center">SWL</th><th align="center">URS</th></tr><tr><th align="left"/><th align="center"><italic>N</italic> = 303</th><th align="center"><italic>N</italic> = 306</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age (yr)</td><td align="left">52.1 (41.6, 61.7)</td><td align="left">50.0 (39.5, 60.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Male</td><td align="left">241 (80)</td><td align="left">234 (80)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ureteric stone size (mm)</td><td align="left">6.0 (5.0, 8.0)</td><td align="left">6.0 (5.0, 8.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Ureteric stone size ≤10 mm</td><td align="left">288 (95)</td><td align="left">292 (95)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Stone location</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left"> Upper ureter</td><td align="left">138 (46)</td><td align="left">139 (45)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Middle ureter</td><td align="left">47 (16)</td><td align="left">50 (16)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Lower ureter</td><td align="left">118 (39)</td><td align="left">117 (38)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Currently taking analgesic medications</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left"> Yes</td><td align="left">220 (73)</td><td align="left">193 (63)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> No</td><td align="left">64 (21)</td><td align="left">96 (31)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Missing</td><td align="left">19 (6)</td><td align="left">17 (6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Level of pain today</td><td align="left"><bold>301:</bold> 3.0 (1.0, 6.0)</td><td align="left"><bold>303:</bold> 3.0 (1.0, 6.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pain related to ureteric stone during last 7 d</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"/></tr><tr><td align="left"> Had pain</td><td align="left">236 (78)</td><td align="left">232 (76)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> No pain</td><td align="left">63 (21)</td><td align="left">69 (23)</td></tr><tr><td align="left"> Missing</td><td align="left">4 (1)</td><td align="left">5 (2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of patients taking pain medication during last 7 d</td><td align="left"><bold>298:</bold> 4 (2, 7)</td><td align="left"><bold>300:</bold> 3.0 (1, 6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">EQ-5D</td><td align="left"><bold>298:</bold> 0.796 (0.691, 1)</td><td align="left"><bold>297:</bold> 0.796 (0.689, 1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">EQ-5D visual scale</td><td align="left"><bold>283:</bold> 75.0 (50.0, 87.0)</td><td align="left"><bold>284:</bold> 75.0 (50.0, 90.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SF-12 PCS</td><td align="left"><bold>290:</bold> 44.1 (38.1, 50.5)</td><td align="left"><bold>289:</bold> 46.1 (38.2, 52.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SF-12 MCS</td><td align="left"><bold>290:</bold> 49.7 (40.9, 57.7)</td><td align="left"><bold>289:</bold> 52.2 (44.1, 57.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="spar0020"><p>SWL = shockwave lithotripsy; SF-12 MCS = Short Form-12 mental component summary score; SF-12 PCS = Short Form-12 physical component summary score; URS = ureteroscopy.</p></fn><fn id="spar0025"><p>Cells are <italic>n</italic> (%) or <italic>n</italic>: median (quartile 1, quartile 3).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram.

              <p id="par0155">The number of treatment-related complications was similar in both care pathways (<xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The frequency of serious complications was similar in each arm (3.6% [9/247] in the SWL arm and 2.7% [7/262] in the URS arm). There was only one death, which occurred in the URS group and was unrelated to the treatment; this low number (&lt;1%) is as expected, as these procedures are generally associated with extremely low mortality figures. There were two life-threatening complications, both in the URS group—one was cardiac (in a patient with a previous myocardial infarction) and the other pulmonary (pulmonary embolus, in a patient who had also undergone recent orthopaedic surgery); neither was assessed as attributable to the trial intervention (or anaesthesia). There were slightly fewer complications (in participants who received any treatment) in the URS pathway than in the SWL pathway, but with few events there was considerable uncertainty around the differences.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0015"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Treatment-related complications (secondary) up to 6 mo after randomisation by allocated and received treatment: comparing SWL with URS (reference)</p></caption><alt-text id="at0025">Table 3</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Participants with treatment-related complication</th><th align="center">SWL <xref rid="tblfn0015" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th><th align="center">URS <xref rid="tblfn0020" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></th><th align="center">ARD <xref rid="tblfn0025" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref>, <xref rid="tblfn0030" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref></th><th align="center">95% CI</th><th align="center">RR <xref rid="tblfn0025" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref>, <xref rid="tblfn0030" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref></th><th align="center">95% CI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>n</italic> (%)</td><td align="left">9/244 (4%)</td><td align="left">7/256 (3%)</td><td align="left">0.01</td><td align="left">(–0.02, 0.04)</td><td align="left">1.34</td><td align="left">(0.47, 3.80)</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="center">Received SWL</th><th align="center">Received URS</th><th align="left"/><th align="left"/><th align="left"/><th align="left"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>n</italic> (%)</td><td align="left">7/221 (3%)</td><td align="left">9/279 (3%)</td><td align="left">0.00</td><td align="left">(–0.04, 0.03)</td><td align="left">0.93</td><td align="left">(0.31, 2.81)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="spar0050"><p>ARD = absolute risk difference (SWL – URS); CI = confidence interval; RR = relative risk (URS is the reference category); SWL = shockwave lithotripsy; URS = ureteroscopy.</p></fn><fn id="spar0055"><p>Denominators are those participants who received any treatment.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn0015"><label>a</label><p id="npar0015">Excluding one who withdrew consent for use of their 6-mo clinical data.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn0020"><label>b</label><p id="npar0020">Excluding one who died before 6 mo and three who withdrew consent for use of their 6 mo clinical data.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn0025"><label>c</label><p id="npar0025">All treatment effect estimates adjusted for outcome at baseline, stone size, stone location, age, gender, and centre.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn0030"><label>d</label><p id="npar0030">Modified Poisson regression model with a log-link function and robust error variance.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
              <p id="par0160">Secondary outcomes are reported in <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. We found a similar pattern between care pathways for both the pain measures and the acceptability measure. At 8 wk, self-reported pain was low. The participants in the SWL arm reported taking pain relievers more frequently (incidence rate ratio 1.38 [0.93, 2.06]), but the number of days of taking pain relievers was small in both groups. Of those who responded, over 80% in each arm stated that they would recommend their treatment to a friend with ureteric stones, and there was no evidence that this differed between arms. Quality of life, as measured by EQ-5D-3L (the mean and visual scale) and the SF-12 PCS and MCS components are reported in <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The trial quality of life improved over the duration of the trial from baseline to 6 mo in both arms. Nonresponders tended to be male and younger in age. When we used observed data only, there were small but consistent effects favouring URS for both the SF-12 PCS and MCS and the EQ-5D-3L visual analogue scale with potentially more sustained improvements from 8 wk for the EQ-5D-3L score. However, these effects were attenuated when we used multiple imputation models. Waiting times in days are described in <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Over 90% of participants in the SWL care pathway received treatment within 8 wk, and a slightly lower proportion (86%) of participants in the URS care pathway were treated within 8 wk (excluding those

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0165">In our trial, we found that the further intervention rate at 6 mo in the SWL arm was 11.7% (95% CI 5.6–17.8%) higher than that in the URS arm, but this difference was non-inferior. That is, it was within the 20% limit set at the outset of the study to demonstrate non-inferiority, which would make it acceptable to patients and urologists as the initial treatment pathway. However, our results, as demonstrated by the per-protocol analysis on those who did not clear or pass their stone prior to treatment, corroborate previous findings in demonstrating better stone clearance with URS <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="par0170">Once the clinical decision to pursue active intervention is made, two main pathways are available: treatment that starts with SWL and treatment that starts with URS. There was uncertainty about the balance between clinical effectiveness and economic effectiveness when comparing the two treatments and TISU was designed to address that. This uncertainty reflects the differences in delivery of the two treatments, the clinical outcomes achieved, and the costs associated with each. It also reflects the fact that, for patients, there are major differences between the treatments in terms of waiting times for treatment, invasiveness, need for general anaesthesia, time in hospital, and time to full recovery.</p>
              <p id="par0175">A key factor in decision-making between these treatment pathways for both patients and clinicians is complications. For the purposes of this study, we did not collect data on the expected low-grade complications of these treatments, which have been well reported <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but focussed on serious complications, and these were very similar for SWL (4%) and URS (3%) pathways.</p>
              <p id="par0180">We assessed quality of life using two generic quality of life measures (EQ-5D-3L and SF-12). With these generic quality of life measures (not specific to this condition), there was improvement from baseline for both the URS and the SWL arms, which was maintained for up to 6 mo. We acknowledge the potential limitation in this regard. Firstly, the response rate to questionnaires was low at both follow-up time points, although this is not uncommon for ureteric stones trials. Estimates on observed data favoured URS, but these were attenuated when we accounted for missing data. However, CIs around imputed estimates rule out any clinically meaningful differences in quality of life. Secondly, given no condition-specific quality of life tool for ureteric stones, generic quality of life tools may be too blunt to pick up differences between care pathways at the earlier time point.</p>
              <p id="par0185">Blinding was not possible given the nature of the interventions in each care pathway. We do not consider this a weakness; rather it reflects the pragmatic nature of our trial, embedded in current urological practice across the UK. Our protocol allowed for “crossover” as both treatments are available and changes in the clinical condition of participants may dictate a change of approach, and indeed, as anticipated, this occurred. This reflects real-life clinical decision-making in symptomatic patients, and it is unlikely that this was affected by participants being recruited in the trial. Other factors may influence patient choice (as seen in the crossover patients, eg, need for anaesthesia) and clinician choice such as health care resource usage (access to operating theatre and beds). There were also a proportion of participants who passed their stones before treatment could occur, reflecting the real-life waiting times for these procedures. However, both ITT and per-protocol analyses—with and without participants who received either their allocated SWL or their allocated URS treatment—showed broadly consistent results. Our results on the comparative effectiveness of the URS and SWL pathways are generalisable to other settings because these two pathways are widely available and utilised in urological practice worldwide.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="par0190">Our primary analysis found that SWL can be considered non-inferior to URS. The broader picture over a range of sensitivity analyses is that URS is consistently better than SWL in terms of the need for further intervention, but that procedures can be included in care pathways, with decisions about which to use based on local stakeholders’ circumstances and preferences. The evidence from TISU provides a firm basis to inform decisions, at either individual patient level or health care commissioning level in general.</p>
