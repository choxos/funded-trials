                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The ProSPoNS trial is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the role of probiotics in prevention of neonatal sepsis. The present protocol describes the data and methodology for the cost utility of the probiotic intervention alongside the controlled trial.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A societal perspective will be adopted in the economic evaluation. Direct medical and non-medical costs associated with neonatal sepsis and its treatment would be ascertained in both the intervention and the control arm. Intervention costs will be facilitated through primary data collection and programme budgetary records. Treatment cost for neonatal sepsis and associated conditions will be accessed from Indian national costing database estimating healthcare system costs. A costâ€“utility design will be employed with outcome as incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted. Considering a time-horizon of 6 months, trial estimates will be extrapolated to model the cost and consequences among high-risk neonatal population in India. A discount rate of 3% will be used. Impact of uncertainties present in analysis will be addressed through both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>There is progress towards attaining the third Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of under-five (U5) mortality of 25 per 1000 live births by 2030, in India. Neonatal mortality rate is the most important contributing factor of the U5 mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Further decline in neonatal mortality may require newer interventions for prevention or treatment of neonatal infections like meningitis, pneumonia, septicaemia that result in more than a quarter of the 1â€‰million neonatal deaths every year in India.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>The ProSPoNS trial<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> proposes to evaluate the role of probiotics in prevention of neonatal infections (sepsis) among the vulnerable group of low-birth weight infants contributing the highest rates of morbidity and mortality. A larger sample size and precise outcome measures differentiate this trial from the earlier conducted pilot study that showcased a 21% non-significant decline in morbidity due to neonatal sepsis in the intervention arm. Considering the 30% prevalence of low-birth weight (LBW) in India and 30% mortality due to neonatal sepsis, even a small decline in the incidence of sepsis would translate to a large number of new born lives saved.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>If the intervention is proven to be efficacious, it would be important to know whether it is also a cost-effective intervention. There are few examples in the literature where economic evaluations have been conducted on other effective interventions to prevent neonatal sepsis.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> It cannot be overemphasised that along with clinical effectiveness of interventions, an estimate of economic effectiveness either in terms of costs or utilities (disability-adjusted life years; DALYs and Quality adjusted life years; QALYs) is required to make correct choices about their inclusion in public health programmes. This is of immense importance in presence of multiple competitive options where prioritisation is needed.</p>
              <p>Ranjeva <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have quantified the scope of the public health and economic burden of neonatal sepsis in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, evidence on the health economics aspect of neonatal sepsis prevention effect of probiotics has not been ascertained so far. We propose to evaluate the cost utility of probiotic intervention for prevention of neonatal sepsis within the ProSPoNS trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>ProSPoNS trial is a phase III multicentre randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, being conducted at six study sites across India. It is a global Health trial funded by the UK Research and Innovation.</p>
              <p>The Study is ongoing at six sites across India: Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), Wardha, King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEM Hospital), Pune, Asian Institute of Public Health (AIPH), Bhubaneswar (with recruitments from SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack), Subharti Medical College (SMC) and Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical (LLRM) College District women hospital, Meerut and Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC), Kalawati Saran Childrenâ€™s Hospital (KSCH), Delhi. The primary objective is to estimate a 30% reduction in the incidence of neonatal sepsis in the intervention arm with daily supplementation of 1â€‰mL (10â€‰billion CFU/mL) of Vivomixx drops over a period of 30 days in 0â€“2-month-old LBW infants. 6144 low-birth weight (between 1500 g and 2500â€‰g) infants would be recruited to the study from the six study sites located in Bhubaneswar, Meerut, New Delhi, Puducherry, Pune and Sewagram, between ages 3 and 7â€‰days of life.</p>
              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>Theory of change</title>
                <p>More than one-third of the estimated four million neonatal deaths around the world each year are caused by severe infections, and a quarterâ€”around one million deathsâ€”is due to neonatal sepsis/pneumonia alone. Panigrahi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> in their study which was conducted in the year 2017 reported that the Culture-confirmed incidence of sepsis as 6.7/1000 births with 51%â€‰Gram negatives (Klebsiella predominating) and 26%â€‰Gram positives (mostly Staphylococcus aureus). The SDG for child survival cannot be achieved without substantial reductions in infection-specific neonatal mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Due to non-specific signs and symptoms, sepsis is difficult to diagnose. The chances of recovery and survival depend on the correct diagnosis, referral, reaching a facility and adequate treatment by appropriately trained health workers and high-quality services.</p>
                <p>Low-birth weight is one of the important indirect causes of deaths in neonates accounting for 40%â€“80% of neonatal deaths worldwide.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> LBW neonates are immune compromised and manifest poor cognitive functions.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Since LBW infants are more prone to infections, neonatal mortality and morbidity may be decreased by preventing neonatal infection.</p>
                <p>Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of current therapeutic management of neonatal infections. For serious infections in new borns and young infants, there is a lack of guidelines on rational antibiotic use.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In the absence of rapid diagnostics, non-judicious use of antibiotics contributes to the rising antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotic overuse is linked with disturbing the gut ecosystem. The problem of drug resistance outweighs the fast pace of newer generation antibiotic production.</p>
                <p>Currently, there are no preventive interventions available for neonatal sepsis other than general measures of hand washing, exclusive breastfeeding, etc. However evaluating immunotherapy with immune globulin, probiotics, myeloid colony-stimulating factors, glutamine supplementation, recombinant human protein C and lactoferrin are being evaluated as adjuvants for the prevention of neonatal sepsis.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Probiotics are non-pathogenic microbes which are capable of exerting positive health effects in the host body through various mechanisms.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> It acts by suppressing the growth of potential pathogens and their epithelial attachment. It also works by secreting antimicrobial substances or by stimulating host expression of protective molecules. Besides, it can produce a barrier against the harmful pathogens at higher levels. It stimulates the process of immunosuppressive agentâ€™s production in the host which suppress the inflammatory responses or accelerate the immunologic mechanism that clears the infection. Probiotics stimulate normal microbeâ€“microbe and hostâ€“microbe interactions positively, thereby enhance the protection provided by commensal flora through competitive interactions, pathogenic antagonism and antimicrobial factors. We hypothesise that immunomodulation/immunopotentiation with probiotics may prove to be an alternative for the prevention of neonatal sepsis. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> depicts the conceptual framework to prevent sepsis episodes among 0â€“2 months neonatal population with use of probiotics.</p>

                  <title>Decision model</title>
                  <p>In view of the shortcomings of treatment effect measure coming from a single RCT, we also propose using a model-based approach which will allow synthesising information from all sources for a health technology enabling us to explore scenarios not explicitly found in the trial data. Moreover, the modelling approach would enable to estimate the long-term benefits of intervention incorporating quality of life measures. Furthermore, it allows accounting for uncertainties present in assumptions and data used for economic evaluation, which has implications for policy question under consideration. The clinical outcomes from trial would be sepsis episodes averted as an effect of probiotics use in the intervention arm. Quality of life (QUALY) is a preferred utility measure for economic analysis; however, there is no EQ-5D version for neonates. Therefore, in order to assess the long-term effects, we propose to use â€˜DALYâ€™ as the measure of health outcome, which accounts for both disability and quality of life. A decision-analytic model following a systematic approach in bringing together evidence on clinical effectiveness, health-related disability of life and costs associated with the probiotic intervention as compared with placebo will be used with the aim to provide information on whether the reduction in neonatal sepsis incidence justifies the incremental costs. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> depicts the decision model for the proposed study.</p>

                  <p>A health economic evaluation using CUA design will be conducted within the ProSPoNS trial. The results would provide the incremental costs and health gains of the probiotic intervention in absence of any prevention modality being implemented or available. Decision-analytical modelling using the trial results would be extrapolated to the target population and time horizon to inform policy on the potential for incremental costs offsets attributable to prevention of morbidity with the proposed intervention. The CUA will use the present results as cost per case of neonatal sepsis prevented. CUA will present the results as cost per DALY averted. Intervention costs and effects will be extrapolated to the Indian neonatal population. Modelling will be used for the target population, time horizon and the decision context to provide much required information for the policymakers. It would guide further decision for upscaling the intervention, if it is found to be efficacious. If the incremental costs of the intervention can be offset by the gains in terms of effectiveness (ie, DALYs), it may be presented for induction within the ambit of existing governmental programme. Modelled CUA results can be presented as health-adjusted life years saved and savings of the healthcare system by disease prevention. We will calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as the difference in the costs between the intervention and the comparator divided by the difference in health outcomes.</p>

                <p>Total of 6144 (N) new born babies with LBW would be screened for eligibility and randomly assigned to probiotic (n=3072) or placebo (n=3072) groups and administered 1â€‰mL of the probiotic suspension daily for 30 days. The study would use Interactive Web Respons System (IWRS) for the purpose of stratified randomisation by birth weight, sex and study site. Trained field workers will make home visits daily for first 7â€‰days and thereafter three times in a week till day 30 of the follow-up period to ensure and monitor adherence to the intervention and collect morbidity information. After the 30-day intervention period, home visitation will continue at weekly interval till day 60 of life. During home visitation as per schedule, trained fieldworkers would screen infants for symptoms/signs of possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI)/clinical illness/clinical severe infection. To record the adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) (if any), continuous monitoring and reporting of ongoing medical conditions, signs and symptoms will be conducted by field worker during their scheduled follow-up home visits using software on handheld device during the 2-month period of follow-up. Presence of any danger signs would be evaluated, and need for referral would be assessed: if a child is found to have any symptoms/signs from the list, the field worker will accompany the infant to facility for examination by study physician (referral). The study physician would examine the infant again for symptoms/signs of PSBI/clinical illness/clinical severe infection and confirm the diagnosis. Investigations such as blood culture, sepsis screen would be performed for suspected cases of neonatal sepsis by study physician. If required, the infant would be hospitalised for treatment. Data on outcomes, lab investigation and treatment during clinical management of the sick, new born will be collected and SAEs will be reported as per regulatory guidelines. Blood culture isolates will be shipped by site to microbiology lab at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for quality assurance purpose.</p>
                <p>The study will be implemented according to MRC guidelines for management of global health trials and will be governed by a Trial Steering Committee and a Data Management Committee.</p>

                  <p>A budget impact analysis is proposed to be conducted to estimate the financial consequences of increasing uptake of probiotic supplementation for LBW infants in the neonatal care under NHM, over the near future (3 to 5 years). Data regarding the target population of LBW infants will be available by extrapolating the data from the RCT, as will be other epidemiological inputs to populate the budget-impact model. At present, there are no alternative prevention modalities for neonatal sepsis present (other than hand hygiene and exclusive breastfeeding). Therefore, assumption would be made regarding the uptake of probiotic supplementation (based on the results of the study).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The ProSPoNS trial is evaluating the role of probiotics intervention in prevention of neonatal infections, a major cause for neonatal mortality. To date, no prevention modalities other than hand hygiene and exclusive breast feeding have been successfully incorporated in programmes for prevention of neonatal infections. Panigrahi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> established benefit of <italic toggle="yes">Lactobacillus planitarum</italic> with fructooligosaccharides intervention in prevention of sepsis and related deaths in new borns; however, the study did not assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. There is no study in the literature evaluating the cost-effectiveness of this novel disease prevention technology. We have proposed such evaluation alongside the ProSPoNS trial.</p>
              <p>An RCT design, considered a gold standard for such evaluations, is being used in the trial. However, there are disadvantages of using RCT data quoted in the literature. Data from a single RCT may not be adequate for estimation of cost utility as RCTs mainly focus on a single intervention and have small follow-up period, thus, lack to provide evidence on effectiveness of multiple alternatives and situations beyond the trial conditions. The treatment effect measured in a single study may be relevant for a particular setting but has limited generalisability of results in populations other than the one studied.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17â€“19</xref> We propose using a modelling approach to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings of RCT data.</p>
              <p>There are a few examples of estimation of cost-effectiveness of disease preventive technologies in the neonatal population. A study conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa estimated that neonatal sepsis resulted in 5.29â€“8.73 DALYs lost annually accounting for an economic burden from $10â€‰billion to $469â€‰billion (per annum). It was recommended that a strategic plan for the treatment and prevention of neonatal sepsis may reduce this burden.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A cost-effective analysis conducted in Ghana reported that alcohol-based hand rub (ABH) effectively reduced the patient cost of neonatal bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital cost associated with BSI, length of hospital stay and deaths due to BSI by 41.7%, 48.5%, 50% and 73%, respectively. It was also estimated that ABH reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired neonatal infections by 16%.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Current study would estimate the cost-effectiveness of a novel neonatal sepsis prevention modality.</p>
              <p>In considering cost-effectiveness, measures on treatment effect over longer time horizon than RCTs are often required. Therefore, we have proposed a modelling approach in addition to the use of primary data coming from the ongoing RCT. This approach would use and provide a wider range of assumptions/parameters from multiple data sources and evaluate the long-term utility of the probiotic intervention in disease prevention.</p>
              <p>Expected outcomes of study and policy implications: the health economic evaluation would generate data on cost involved with the new intervention as compared with the control arm with uncertainty range, incremental costs and health outcomes for both study arms with uncertainty range, ICER, sensitivity and threshold analyses. It would be helpful for the policymaker to understand the cost utility of the probiotic intervention in the presence of other competing priorities.</p>
