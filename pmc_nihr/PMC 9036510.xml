                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Renal colic is the pain experienced by a patient when a renal calculus (kidney stone) causes partial or complete obstruction of part of the renal outflow tract. The standard analgesic regimes for renal colic are often ineffective; in some studies, less than half of patients achieve complete pain relief, and a large proportion of patients require rescue analgesia within 4 h. Current analgesic regimes are also associated with significant side effects including nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory depression. It has been hypothesised that beta adrenoreceptor agonists, such as salbutamol, may reduce the pain of renal colic. They have been shown to impact a number of factors that target the physiological causes of pain in renal colic (ureteric spasm and increased peristalsis, increased pressure at the renal pelvis and prostaglandin release with inflammation). There is biological plausibility and a body of evidence sufficient to suggest that this novel treatment for the pain of renal colic should be taken to a phase II clinical trial. The aim of this trial is to test whether salbutamol is an efficacious analgesic adjunct when added to the standard analgesic regime for patients presenting to the ED with subsequently confirmed renal colic.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A phase II, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will be performed in an acute NHS Trust in the East Midlands. Patients presenting to the emergency department with pain requiring IV analgesia and working diagnosis of renal colic will be randomised to receive standard analgesia Â± a single intravenous injection of Salbutamol. Secondary study objectives will explore the feasibility of conducting a larger, phase III trial.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The trial will provide important information about the efficacy of salbutamol as an analgesic adjunct in renal colic. It will also guide the development of a definitive phase III trial to test the cost and clinical effectiveness of salbutamol as an analgesic adjunct in renal colic. Salbutamol benefits from widespread use across the health service for multiple indications, extensive staff familiarity and a good side effect profile; therefore, its potential use for pain relief may have significant benefits for patient care.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par6">Renal colic is the pain experienced by a patient when a renal calculus (kidney stone) causes partial or complete obstruction of part of the renal outflow tract. The lifetime incidence is approximately 12% in males and 6% in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] with recurrence rates approaching 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The Royal Derby Hospital Emergency Department treats approximately 400 patients a year with renal colic.</p>
                <p id="Par7">The standard analgesic regimes for renal colic are often ineffective; in some studies, less than half of patients achieve complete pain relief, and a large proportion of patients require rescue analgesia within 4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par8">Current analgesic regimes are also associated with significant side effects. Treatment strategies usually involve a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an opiate (e.g. intravenous morphine). Opiates are known to cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Oral absorption of NSAIDs in this cohort can be poor due to gastroparesis and vomiting; rectal administration is frequently felt by patients to be unpleasant.</p>
                <p id="Par9">The onset of action of the existing analgesic options is slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; NSAIDs require a period of absorption before they are effective, and intravenous opioids are controlled drugs, the administration of which is often delayed by practical concerns in their dispensing and prescription.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Our Patient and Public Involvement group has emphasised how intolerable renal colic is, how slow and inadequate the analgesic regimes can be and how unpleasant the side effects are. They have also noted the importance of remedying these factors with future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par11">It has been hypothesised that beta adrenoreceptor agonists may reduce the pain of renal colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Salbutamol is a beta adrenoreceptor agonist with widespread use across the health service for multiple indications, extensive staff familiarity and a good side effect profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par12">Beta adrenoreceptors agonists have been shown to impact a number of factors that target the physiological causes of pain in renal colic (ureteric spasm and increased peristalsis, increased pressure at the renal pelvis and prostaglandin release with inflammation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They are as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par13">Promote ureteral relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">Reduce frequency of ureteral contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Reduce renal pelvic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par16">Approximately 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] of an intravenous dose of salbutamol is excreted, unchanged, in the urine; there is therefore the potential for both systemic and local stimulations of beta adrenoreceptors to take place.</p>
                <p id="Par17">The protocol authors have completed a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; there have been no trials of beta agonists as analgesics in renal colic, and there are no registered clinical trials on this topic. However, there is extensive evidence (both in the laboratory and other clinical settings) suggesting it may be effective, and a number of authors have identified this as a promising research avenue.</p>
                <p id="Par18">There is biological plausibility and a body of evidence sufficient to suggest that this novel treatment for the pain of renal colic should be taken to a phase II clinical trial.</p>

                <title>Medical expulsive therapy and time to stone passage</title>
                <p id="Par19">Many studies have investigated agents which may decrease time to stone passage; this is not the primary outcome of interest in this trial but is included within the secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par20">It is worth noting that the previous research in this area supports the potential efficacy of salbutamol as an analgesic adjunct in renal colic via the process of ureteral relaxation (the same process thought to speed stone passage in the aforementioned studies).</p>
                <p id="Par21">The use of alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists as medical expulsive therapy to speed stone passage is a practice previously widely recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but more recently brought into question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The action of alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists in the renal tract is similar to that of beta agonists; they reduce the force and frequency of ureteral contractions.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Alpha adrenoreceptor antagonists have previously been shown to reduce the number of pain episodes during the management of renal colic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but this has never formed the main focus of research and their use is uncommon within emergency departments in the UK; the likely reasons for this are discussed below.</p>
                <sec id="Sec5">
                  <title>Onset</title>
                  <p id="Par23">The onset of action of salbutamol is measurable in minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] whereas tamsulosin reaches peak levels after 6âh and steady state after 5 days. Salbutamol is therefore much more appropriate as a potential analgesic for acute pain in the emergency department setting.</p>

                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Familiarity</title>
                  <p id="Par24">Emergency department staff administer salbutamol in inhaled, nebulised and intravenous forms on a regular basis. This means there will be fewer barriers to adoption.</p>

                <sec id="Sec7">
                  <title>Side effects</title>
                  <p id="Par25">The side effects of salbutamol (fast heart rate, tremor) are relatively minor compared to those of alpha blockers (low blood pressure, fainting, nausea), even at high doses, and are likely therefore to be better tolerated by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

                <title>Scientific justification</title>
                <p id="Par26">Pain in renal colic is caused first by ureteric peristalsis, followed by ureteral spasm and then subsequent inflammation and oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Î²-Agonists are known to reduce ureteric peristalsis and spasm, and it is therefore hypothesised that their use will reduce the pain associated with renal colic. Additionally, salbutamol is excreted unchanged in the urine and therefore has the potential for both systemic and topical action as detailed below.</p>

                <title>Potential benefits</title>
                <p id="Par42">Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) work conducted by the research team demonstrated the clear and urgent need for faster, more effective pain relief that causes fewer side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Salbutamol has the potential to fulfil that clinical and patient needs. If salbutamol is subsequently proven to be an effective analgesic in patients suffering from renal colic, the benefits are myriad:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par43">Improved analgesia: Pain in renal colic is caused by ureteric spasm and increased peristalsis, as well as increased pressure at the renal pelvis and prostaglandin release with inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Beta agonists relax the ureter, potentially providing physiologically targeted pain relief.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">Reduced time to pain relief: Salbutamol has an onset of action within 5âmin, with an early peak effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This is significantly quicker than all existing analgesic options, where peak effects occur between 20 and 60âmin after administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Route of administration: The need for parenteral administration was highlighted as a priority during the PPI work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], due to the frequent association of nausea and vomiting with both renal colic and opiates. Salbutamol is solely administered parentally, and its aerosolised form means it can be administered prior to securing intravenous access, further reducing the time to analgesia.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Better side effect profile: Salbutamolâs side effect profile is well recognised and relatively narrow, especially when compared to the combined components of the existing analgesic regime. The side effects of current treatments were also highlighted by the PPI group as a notably unpleasant part of treatment and any measures which reduce these were welcomed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">The use of salbutamol may reduce the need for other analgesic agents and their associated side effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Staff burden: Salbutamol is not a controlled drug, enabling nursing staff to access and administer it more readily. This reduces nursing and physician burden whilst decreasing time to administration when compared to intravenous opiates.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">Reduced admissions and length of stay: Patients with uncomplicated renal colic can be discharged once their pain is controlled; persisting pain is frequently the sole reason for continuing admission. A more effective analgesic regime may result in a shorter length of stay, whilst avoiding some admissions entirely. This has clear potential cost, service and patient benefits that will be investigated in the subsequent planned phase III trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">It is also possible that salbutamol may positively impact the time to stone passage.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Home use: Patients with known renal colic may be able to self-medicate with a salbutamol inhaler, avoiding the need for hospital attendance entirely.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Speed of adoption: Staff familiarity with salbutamol and its already widespread use means that subsequent translation into clinical practice will be easier and faster than if an alternative beta agonist were studied.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par53">Expert advice has already been sought on the route of drug delivery from both a phase II trial methodologist (Richard Jackson, Liverpool CTU) and a Professor of Drug Discovery (Patrick Barton, University of Nottingham).</p>
                <p id="Par54">Intravenous salbutamol is the IMP for this phase II trial. Inhaled salbutamol is certainly a feasible option (and will likely form part of the phase III trial design), but for the purposes of this phase II trial, it was felt important to maximise bioavailability and reduce confounding factors in terms of absorption in order to ensure maximal safe serum levels such that any potential efficacy signal on the primary endpoint is apparent.</p>
                <p id="Par55">This trial represents a re-purposing of an established treatment. We have therefore employed the established maximum safe and efficacious intravenous dose used for acute exacerbations of asthma; this dose is safe for patients who meet the inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A higher dose is possible but is associated with a greater frequency of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; this dose is employed in pregnant women in pre-term labour where the potential benefits outweigh the potential harms.</p>
                <p id="Par56">The frequently occurring side effects of tremor and tachycardia are very well tolerated by the majority of patients and were felt by our patient group to be acceptable if salbutamol is proven to be an effective analgesic. Patients with ischaemic heart disease tolerate tachycardia less well and for this reason are excluded from this trial. Rare occurrences of myocardial ischaemia with the use of high doses of salbutamol have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The dose being administered in this trial is the typical âloadingâ dose of intravenous salbutamol used when patients are having an acute, severe and/or life-threatening asthma attack. Such patients have typically already received large doses of inhaled beta-agonist in addition to this intravenous dose. It is therefore not thought that the proposed dose poses a significant risk in patients without known ischaemic heart disease.</p>
                <p id="Par57">The dose and rate of administration chosen are the same as that for the relief of severe bronchospasm: 250 Î¼g diluted to a total volume of 5âml with 0.9% sodium chloride and given by slow intravenous injection over 3â5âmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par58">Salbutamol is known to precipitate hypokalaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The literature assessing the magnitude of this effect suggests a drop of 0.87â1.4âmmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with a bolus dose of intravenous salbutamol. However, this trial data is largely obtained in patients with underlying hyperkalaemia, and it would appear that the lower the baseline serum potassium, the smaller the drop seen with intravenous salbutamol. Additionally, the doses used in studies identified in the review paper referenced use a higher dose of salbutamol than this trial protocol dictates. Finally, 40% of patients identified in the review paper were non-responders to salbutamol, i.e. intravenous salbutamol did not cause a fall in serum potassium. As such, we feel the potential side effect of hypokalaemia secondary to a single bolus dose of intravenous salbutamol is likely to be clinically insignificant. However, we dictate that serum potassium must be â¥ 3.7âmmol/l for a participant to be eligible for enrolment. Symptomatic hypokalaemia secondary to trial medication will be recorded as an adverse reaction.</p>
                <p id="Par59">Risks surrounding cannulation of the patient, taking of blood samples and preparation of the trial medication are covered by existing nursing staff training and procedures and provide no additional risk above normal patient care.</p>

                <p id="Par61">Type A = No higher than the risk of standard medical careâthe trial involves the use of a medicinal product licenced in an EU member state, used for an off-label indication, supported by extensive clinical experience with the product and no reason to suspect a different safety profile in the trial population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                  <p id="Par138">Approximately 34 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of renal colic were discharged from the Royal Derby Hospital Emergency Department per month prior to the start of the trial. We estimate a recruitment rate of between 18 and 30% of eligible patients. This figure is derived from the current department recruitment to a comparable CTIMP (ISRCTN 34153772), another trial in an ED setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and a discussion with the PPI group.</p>
                  <p id="Par139">Following 11âmonths of study recruitment, the average number of participants with confirmed renal colic recruited in the study per month was 4. In addition, the observed proportion of participants who subsequently were found not to have a renal calculus was 30% instead of 10% that was assumed at the start of the study.</p>
                  <p id="Par140">Therefore, we estimate that 106 patients with confirmed renal colic could be recruited in 31âmonths. This allowed for a slow start in recruitment (3âmonths to reach 20% recruitment rate) and recruitment plateau during the last 7 months (2 patients with confirmed renal colic recruited per month). This requires the recruitment of approximately 152 patients with suspected renal colic given that approximately 30% of patients with suspected renal colic are subsequently found not to have a renal calculus (local audit data, previous research, and first 6âmonths of recruitment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b}</title>
                  <p id="Par146">Unblinding of participants should only occur for valid medical or safety reasons, e.g. in the case of a severe adverse event where it is necessary to know which treatment the patient is receiving before they can be treated. All instances of unplanned patient unblinding should be clearly documented in the participantâs medical notes (together with the reasons for doing so) and recorded in the investigator site file. Details regarding the unblinding of participants must be forwarded to the chief investigator and the sponsor (via the Derby CTSU Trial Manager) without revealing the allocation.</p>
                  <p id="Par147">The responsibility for the emergency unblinding of any participant on the trial resides with the investigator. If emergency unblinding is required for clinical reasons, this can be initiated by any treating healthcare professional. They will not be required to discuss unblinding with anyone in the research team if they feel that unblinding is necessary. The sponsor is not required to be involved in the decision to unblind a patient in an emergency situation.</p>
                  <p id="Par148">The randomisation list for the trial must be held securely within the pharmacy department, in a controlled area, separate from the investigator site file and easily accessible by those authorised to reveal treatment allocation at the site.</p>

                  <p id="Par150">All pain score measurements for the trial will use a visual analogue scale [VAS] 0â100âmm (apart from the pre-enrolment score to ensure eligibility, which will be a NAS as per routine practice). The visual analogue scale will be a 100-mm line with cues at either end (0 = no pain, 100âmm = worst pain), and participants will be asked to mark their current pain score with a cross at each time point listed below. The qualitative assessment of participantsâ pain will be obtained using the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire.</p>
                  <p id="Par151">Participants will be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire regarding pain relief and their experience of the trial in the emergency department. The presence/absence of renal calculus will be determined by appropriate imaging (CT renal tract or XR KUB); this takes place during normal treatment and within 24âh of admission in routine practice. The research team will record trial-specific observations directly onto the eCRF.</p>
                  <p id="Par152">Information about AKI development within 7âdays from admission will be collected from the patientâs notes retrospectively.</p>

                  <p id="Par153">Participant dropout/loss to follow-up is not expected to present an issue due to the short duration of patient involvement; however, it is recognised that the frequency of assessments may result in a higher incidence of missing data. Participants will be actively monitored for safety reasons until 120âmin post-treatment administration and therefore the research staff should be able to ensure the completion of outcome data. Should the participant be transferred to a different department, they will be provided with a booklet containing the VAS pain score outcomes and asked to complete these. A timer will be provided to serve as a reminder for when assessments are needed.</p>

Therefore, the primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out within the âconfirmed renal colicâ group on the full data set, which will be defined on the âmodifiedâ intention-to-treat principle retaining patients in their initially randomised groups irrespective of any protocol violations. Analyses of the âsuspected renal colicâ and the âother diagnosisâ groups for all secondary endpoints will also be done on the âmodifiedâ intention-to-treat principle.</p>

Due to the fast-acting nature and short half-life of salbutamol, active monitoring for AEs and ARs is not required after 2âh post-administration. Following this, investigators are still required to record any ARs or SARs they become aware of.</p>

Substantial amendments will be submitted to the relevant regulatory bodies (MHRA, REC, HRA) for review and approval. The amendments will only be implemented after approval and a favourable opinion has been obtained. Non-substantial amendments will be submitted to the HRA for their approval/acknowledgement. Amendments will not be implemented until all relevant approvals are in place, including local site approval. As participants are in the trial for up to 24âh, it is not expected that participants will be asked to re-consent as a result of any protocol amendments.</p>

              <p id="Par217">The study remains ongoing but offered some logistical challenges identified during set-up which were addressed by the team.
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par218">The studyâs limited funding meant that pre-filled syringes could not be provided for the team therefore a different strategy to maintain the blind was required. As the trial medication is made up in a department, and not by a separate pharmacy, non-research team members are required to make up either the IMP or placebo and provide in a blinded syringe for the research team to administer. Designated members of a separate research team, not working on this trial, will be unblinded and support the SARC research team and R&amp;D Pharmacy team in monitoring drug accountability and re-ordering stock for the department. No one with knowledge of a participantâs allocation will be involved in data collection or patient monitoring for the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par219">Further to this, as non-research staff members will be randomising patients, a simple randomisation system was required that avoided the need for an additional log in or access to a computer as is the case with online randomisation systems. Building on work done in the Rapid Analgesia for Prehospital Hip Disruption (RAPID) study (ref) using scratch cards for concealment allocation, we decided to implement this as a simple method of randomisation for the SARC trial. We will monitor randomisation adherence and intend to report back on this alongside user acceptability in a separate study.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <p id="Par220">The trial began recruitment on 16th September 2019 and is anticipated to complete recruitment on 31st October 2022. Recruitment was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recommenced on 4th November 2020. An extension to the trial has been granted to take account of this pause and the slower than anticipated recruitment. The current protocol version is v4.0 dated 15th July 2021.</p>
