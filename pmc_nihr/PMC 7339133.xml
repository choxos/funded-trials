                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard operation for benign prostatic obstruction. Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) is a technique with suggested advantages over TURP, including reduced complications and hospital stay. We aimed to investigate TURP versus ThuVARP in men with lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this randomised, blinded, parallel-group, pragmatic equivalence trial, men in seven UK hospitals with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention secondary to benign prostatic obstruction were randomly assigned (1:1) at the point of surgery to receive ThuVARP or TURP. Patients were masked until follow-up completion. Centres used their usual TURP procedure (monopolar or bipolar). All trial surgeons underwent training on the ThuVARP technique. Co-primary outcomes were maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12-months post-surgery. Equivalence was defined as a difference of 2·5 points or less for IPSS and 4 mL per s or less for Qmax. Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN00788389.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between July 23, 2014, and Dec 30, 2016, 410 men were randomly assigned to ThuVARP or TURP, 205 per study group. TURP was superior for Qmax (mean 23·2 mL per s for TURP and 20·2 mL per s for ThuVARP; adjusted difference in means −3·12, 95% CI −5·79 to −0·45). Equivalence was shown for IPSS (mean 6·3 for TURP and 6·4 for ThuVARP; adjusted difference in means 0·28, −0·92 to 1·49). Mean hospital stay was 48 h in both study groups. 91 (45%) of 204 patients in the TURP group and 96 (47%) of 203 patients in the ThuVARP group had at least one complication.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>TURP and ThuVARP were equivalent for urinary symptom improvement (IPSS) 12-months post-surgery, and TURP was superior for Qmax. Anticipated laser benefits for ThuVARP of reduced hospital stay and complications were not observed.</p>

              <p id="para10">Benign prostatic obstruction is a common condition resulting from prostate enlargement, and can cause lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention, with a substantial effect on men's quality of life.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Surgery to relieve the obstruction is indicated after failure of medication to improve voiding and to prevent the complications associated with benign prostatic obstruction. Bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic obstruction affect around 3% of men aged 45–49 years in the UK, increasing to more than 30% of men aged 85 years and older.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> With an ageing population in the UK, the number of patients with benign prostatic obstruction is expected to grow, increasing the need for surgery.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Around 25 000 prostate operations are done annually in the UK to relieve benign prostatic obstruction. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) has been the gold standard of surgery for over 40 years, accounting for around 80% of operations. TURP is generally a successful procedure but is associated with small but significant mortality (0·3% within 30 days) and morbidity risks including transurethral resection syndrome (absorption of irrigating fluid causing confusion and collapse), haemorrhage during the operation, and subsequent urinary tract infections.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para30">Various alternative surgeries, including laser techniques, have been developed over the past 20 years.

                  <p id="para60">Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard operation for men with benign prostatic obstruction. This procedure is generally considered to be successful; however, it is associated with small but clinically significant risks of morbidity and mortality. Thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) is a laser procedure that vapourises and resects the prostate using a technique similar to TURP. The 2013 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for the treatment and follow-up of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms, including benign prostatic obstruction, formed the evidence base for the UNBLOCS study. The guidelines were based on a literature search including all articles published in English in PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Based on the one randomised controlled trial and one non-randomised prospective controlled trial that had been done with small and medium-sized prostates, the EAU guidelines stated that ThuVARP showed equivalent efficacy to TURP. Moreover, ThuVARP achieved shorter catheterisation and hospitalisation times, with a lower level of adverse events than TURP (intra-operative and postoperative bleeding; level of evidence 1b). The 2010 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline recommended that laser vapourisation or vaporesection techniques should only be offered as part of a randomised trial comparing these techniques with TURP because of the limited evidence base.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">To our knowledge, the UNBLOCS trial is the largest randomised trial to compare ThuVARP to standard TURP. This masked trial included patients with urinary retention, who are frequently excluded from benign prostatic obstruction surgery trials, and made extensive use of patient-reported outcome measures. In contrast to previous studies, the trial showed that ThuVARP and TURP procedures achieve equivalent patient-reported urinary symptoms after surgery (International Prostate Symptom Score), but that TURP is superior in the urinary flow rate achieved (Qmax). TURP and ThuVARP had similar results across almost all other clinical operative outcomes, including bleeding and complication rates, length of stay in hospital, and patient-reported urinary symptoms, sexual symptoms, quality of life, and satisfaction after surgery. Patients with urinary retention had similarly positive outcomes after benign prostatic obstruction surgery as patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, contrary to the commonly held urological belief that this population has poorer outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="para100">Overall, both ThuVARP and TURP can be recommended as clinically effective procedures for relieving benign prostatic obstruction; however, TURP achieved a superior urinary flow rate. The potential advantages of ThuVARP in reducing blood loss and shortening hospital stay were not observed in this study. Our results suggest that it is appropriate that new treatment alternatives continue to be compared with the current standard of TURP, as per the NICE guidelines. Our trial results can be used to update the literature and urology guidelines, allowing patients to be more informed at the point of consent on the risks and benefits of such procedures, especially with regard to side-effects.</p>

                <p id="para140">The UNBLOCS study is a multicentre, pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group equivalence trial of ThuVARP versus standard TURP. We aimed to determine whether ThuVARP was equivalent to TURP in men with benign prostatic obstruction, in terms of the patient-reported International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urine flow rate (Qmax). The trial was done in four university teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals in the UK. Men presenting in secondary care with either bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms or urinary retention, secondary to benign prostatic obstruction, and suitable for TURP surgery (having failed conservative and medical therapy), were recruited. Men were excluded if they had neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms, prostate cancer, previous prostate or urethral surgery, a prostate specific antigen level outside the normal age-related range without prostate cancer excluded, or were unable to give informed consent or complete trial documentation.</p>

Randomisation was done after the patient was anaesthetised to facilitate patient blinding and to conceal allocation until the patient was in surgery.

Participants were informed of the type of surgery received after completion of their 12-month follow-up. Patient masking was assessed by asking patients whether they knew their allocation in their 12-month questionnaire. Surgeons doing the interventions and outcome assessors were not masked.</p>

                <p id="para260">The sample size calculation assumed that men randomly assigned to ThuVARP should have clinical outcomes equivalent to those who were randomised to TURP. For primary outcomes, differences in IPSS score of no more than 2·5 points and no more than 4 ml per sec for Qmax were hypothesised as suggesting equivalence. These hypotheses were based on the minimally clinically important differences in the literature and discussions with urologists on clinically relevant cutoffs. Further details on these justifications can be found in the statistical analysis plan.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Assuming SDs of 9 ml per sec for Qmax and 5 units for IPSS, the target sample size for patients needed to complete the 12-month follow-up was 163 per group. This sample size provided 85% power to show equivalence for Qmax and just over 90% power for IPSS, at a two-sided α of 5%. Assuming 20% loss to follow-up, we needed to recruit 410 men.</p>

We analysed time to successful trial without catheter using a Cox proportional hazards model. Where continuous outcomes were skewed, the median and IQR are presented. We used linear regression to allow adjustment; however, relevant model assumptions were checked along with comparisons to a non-parametric approach.

The adjusted p value from each regression model on skewed data was also compared with the one achieved from the Mann-Whitney test to ensure consistency. Where ordinal outcomes were dichotomised, to aid interpretation results were also compared on an ordinal scale to ensure consistency.

ThuVARP had a lower mean Qmax at 12 months compared with TURP (adjusted difference in means of −3·12, 95% CI −5·79 to −0·45), with the lower CI outside the equivalence range (–4 to 4), indicating the treatments are non-equivalent. Changing to superiority testing (without statistical penalty after an equivalence analysis),<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> suggested that TURP was superior to ThuVARP for Qmax (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>).

We also saw no evidence that any prespecified subgroups altered these results (eg, age, lower urinary tract symptoms <italic>vs</italic> urinary retention, comorbidities, or prostate size; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>).

The occurrence of new onset erectile dysfunction is commonly reported as between 2% and 10% when patients are informed of surgical risks.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> When comparing IIEF scores by severity at baseline, surgery results in variable outcomes for individual patients, including some patients having improvements in their sexual function. The high level of sexual symptoms in patients at baseline supports the routine measurement of baseline sexual function in benign prostatic obstruction trials, and the variable outcome after surgery should be included by clinicians in patient discussions.</p>
              <p id="para480">The exploratory finding that the treatments differed in pathology diagnostic detection of prostate cancer might have been due to the reduced amount of tissue for histology from ThuVARP due to tissue vaporisation. The clinical significance of this finding is that a prostate cancer diagnosis might be missed because of the restricted histology available, although TURP is not part of the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer.</p>
              <p id="para490">A clinically important strength of UNBLOCS is the inclusion of patients with urinary retention (catheterised), who are usually excluded from benign prostatic obstruction surgical trials. To our knowledge, our study is unique in including patients with urinary retention and not restricting inclusion on prostate size. Therefore, published data on surgical outcomes for patients with urinary retention are scarce, with no comparative studies evaluating ThuVARP identified in a meta-analysis, and have been highlighted as a gap in the evidence base.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, our results show that patients with urinary retention do as well with de-obstructing surgery as men with lower urinary tract symptoms, contrary to the belief that such surgery might not improve symptoms, possibly because of a higher prevalence of detrusor underactivity or acontractile bladder in men with urinary retention. As detrusor contractility cannot be measured in men with urinary retention, it is reassuring that the catheter-free rate was 98% at 3-months and 12-months postsurgery. This trial highlights the importance of including patients with urinary retention in all trials of new benign prostatic obstruction surgical techniques, as they comprise 50% of the patient population.</p>
              <p id="para500">Another strength of our study was participant masking, with only 10% of patients reporting active unmasking, minimising bias. Masking is often considered unfeasible for surgical trials;<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> however, it is particularly important with a patient-reported co-primary outcome (IPSS). Additionally, as all surgeons could do both ThuVARP and TURP, surgeons were also masked to the randomised allocation until the time of surgery. This strategy reduced bias in subjective assessment of symptoms, and we would recommend randomisation at the point of patient anaesthesia for masking in future surgical trials, where logistically possible.</p>
              <p id="para510">Further strengths of this study were the large sample size compared with previous trials, the European setting, and successful recruitment despite the logistics of randomisation at the point of surgery. The number of patients who withdrew was low and follow-up was high for a surgical trial with a patient-reported primary outcome.</p>
              <p id="para520">The breadth of patient-reported outcomes has also produced novel findings, including data on incontinence in the ICIQ-MLUTS, which is absent from IPSS. Inclusion of the more comprehensive ICIQ-MLUTSsex adds value to the generalisability of the IIEF and allows patients to express the effect of their urinary symptoms on sexual function without the assumption of an active sex life. As only 218 (53%) of 410 patients responded for IIEF, data should be treated with caution because of a potential risk of bias. However, this trial presents a comprehensive account of sexual function before and after benign prostatic obstruction surgery, identified as being poorly reported in trials of emerging procedures, in which prevalence rather than incidence data are reported because of a lack of preoperative data.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Inclusion of the ICIQ-Satisfaction questionnaire also provided insight into the patient experience of, and satisfaction with, surgery.</p>
              <p id="para530">Limitations of the trial were the inevitable inability to collect some baseline data from the catheterised population with urinary retention, preventing adjustment for baseline in the analysis. However, this limitation is outweighed by increased generalisability of the results. Before surgery, prostate volume was estimated by digital rectal examination rather than measured using transrectal ultrasound and prostate-specific antigen testing and invasive urodynamics were not routinely done; however, this strategy mimics routine pragmatic clinical practice in the UK. The small number of men of non-white race included in the study is also a limitation.</p>
              <p id="para540">The rate of conversion from ThuVARP to TURP during the trial could also be considered a limitation; however, this pragmatic trial reflects the real-life scenario should this laser technique be introduced into clinical practice. Additionally, per protocol and complier average causal effect sensitivity analyses accounted for crossover and had similar results to the main analysis. The size of the prostate also resulted in nine conversions to TURP, which might reflect the lack of trial exclusion criteria for patients with large prostates. Future research into the comparative effectiveness of ThuVARP and TURP in large prostates would be useful.</p>
              <p id="para550">A further potential limitation was the differential previous experience of the surgeons of TURP and ThuVARP, with trial surgeons having done over 100 TURP procedures, but only between five and 12 ThuVARP procedures.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> However, all surgeons were independently assessed before undertaking trial laser procedures and we have shown that ThuVARP has a short learning curve,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> with surgical skills similar to TURP. In comparing the conversion rates of ThuVARP to TURP during the trial, there was no evidence of a learning curve effect, with the rate of conversions actually increasing as surgeons conducted more cases.</p>
              <p id="para560">In conclusion, both ThuVARP and TURP can be recommended as clinically effective procedures for relieving benign prostatic obstruction, however TURP achieved a superior maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). The potential advantages of ThuVARP in reducing blood loss and shortening hospital stay were not observed in this study. Our results suggest that it is appropriate that new treatment alternatives continue to be compared with the current standard of TURP, as per NICE guidelines. Our trial results could be used to update the literature and urology guidelines, allowing patients to be more informed at the point of consent on the risks and benefits of such procedures, especially with regard to side-effects.</p>
