                  <title>Background
</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Community pharmacies serve people with high levels of tobacco-related illness, but throughput in NHS Stop Smoking Services in pharmacies remains relatively low. We investigated the effectiveness of a complex intervention to increase service uptake and retention.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">We randomised 60 pharmacies in England and Wales to the STOP intervention or usual practice in a pragmatic, parallel-group, controlled trial over 11 months. Smokers were blind to the allocation. The intervention was theory-based consultation skills training for pharmacy staff with environmental prompts (badges, calendars and behavioural cues). The primary outcome was the number of smokers attending an initial consultation and setting a quit date.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The intervention made no significant difference in setting a quit date, retention or quit rate. A total of 631 adult smokers (service users) enrolled and set a quit date in intervention pharmacies compared to 641 in usual practice pharmacies, a rate ratio of 0.75 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.23) adjusted for site and number of prescriptions. A total of 432 (68%) service users were retained at 4 weeks in intervention and 500 (78%) in usual practice pharmacies (odds ratio 0.80, 0.41 to 1.55). A total of 265 (42%) service users quit smoking at 4 weeks in intervention and 276 (43%) in usual practice pharmacies (0.96, 0.65 to 1.43). The pharmacy staff were positive about the intervention with 90% (56/62) stating that it had improved their skills. Sixty-eight per cent would strongly recommend the training to others although there was no difference in self-efficacy for service delivery between arms. Seventy of 131 (53%) service users did not complete the 6-month follow-up assessment. However, 55/61 (90%) service users who completed follow-up were satisfied or very satisfied with the service. All usual practice arm service users (<italic>n</italic> = 33) and all but one in the intervention arm (<italic>n</italic> = 27) would recommend the service to smokers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">We found high levels of retention and acceptable quit rates in the NHS pharmacy stop smoking service. Despite pharmacy staff providing positive feedback on the STOP intervention, it made no difference to service throughput. Thus, other factors may currently limit service capacity to help smokers to quit.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par12">Tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], causing more than seven million deaths each year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Around 1.2 million of these deaths are from environmental exposure to tobacco smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In England, smoking killed 78,000 people in 2018, and 670,000 had increased social care needs from smoking-related illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] In Wales, where smoking accounts for one in six deaths of all adults aged 35 and over, approximately 5000 premature deaths in Wales are attributable to smoking-related diseases annually[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thirty-seven per cent of all deaths from respiratory disease and 27% of all deaths from cancer are attributable to smoking in high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Smoking costs the UK economy almost £12 billion each year: employers £5.3 billion, societal costs £4.1 billion and National Health Service (NHS) £2.5 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Stopping smoking, however, is a very effective way of reducing the risk of tobacco-related illness and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Whilst sustained smoking from early adulthood may triple age-specific mortality rates, cessation at age 50 halves the risk, and those who stop aged 30 can avoid almost all the increased mortality due to smoking[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recent work shows that smoking cessation is effective in reducing premature mortality at all ages, even for those in older age groups[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par13">NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSS) were rolled out across England and Wales in 2000 aiming to provide free medication and behavioural support to help people to stop smoking[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The NHS SSS are available from a number of providers such as GP surgeries, community pharmacies and specialist clinics. In 2018/2019, 236,175 people set a target date for quitting smoking in the service; of these, 123,800 (52.4%) stopped smoking at 4 weeks measured by self-report. However, quit rates in community pharmacies are 19%, lower than those in other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that pharmacies only target smokers perceived as likely to quit and that smoker retention is poor with about a third lost to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the community pharmacy staff have contact with people less likely to attend more formal healthcare settings who may suffer a heavy burden of smoking-related disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, optimising community pharmacy stop smoking services could help address health inequalities by reducing morbidity and mortality from tobacco use.</p>
              <p id="Par14">The Smoking Treatment Optimisation in Pharmacies (STOP) programme aimed to develop an intervention to increase throughput in the stop smoking services in community pharmacies and to improve quit rates by providing training including motivational interviewing and communication skills to pharmacy staff (STOP intervention) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We conducted extensive qualitative research with both pharmacy staff and users of stop smoking services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and took into account the factors associated with successful quit attempts and successful outcomes in other behavioural interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We incorporated the findings from research into communication strategies used in community pharmacies that were associated with successful quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and grounded the intervention in social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using validated behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We piloted the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and refined it based on feedback from pharmacy workers and treated smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a further pilot study, we focused on optimising pharmacy staff attendance at the STOP training and developed ways of using simulated patients to assess intervention fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. We drew from the diffusion of innovations theory to plan the implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par15">Here, we report the evaluation of the STOP intervention in a cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in community pharmacies in east London, Coventry and South Wales. These areas have similar profiles with pockets of high deprivation and residents more likely to work in routine and manual jobs, together with higher smoking prevalence compared to the UK national average. Research on adult smoking habits indicates strong links between smoking and deprivation with those in more deprived areas more likely to smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Optimising pharmacy-led stop smoking services in these areas could bring substantial health benefits from quitting on both individual and broader population levels. Findings from the process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and economic assessment will be published separately.</p>

                <title>Setting, participants and consenting</title>
                <p id="Par17">The STOP Trial was approved by the South Central—Hampshire A NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) reference number 17/SC/0067 on 3 April 2017.</p>
                <p id="Par18">This study had two types of participants: staff working in community pharmacies (stop smoking advisors and support staff) and people who used the service (treated smokers). Eligible community pharmacies were those providing stop smoking services and were identified from lists provided by NHS service commissioners in each recruiting area.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Pharmacy owners were initially approached by email invitation, with an enclosed participant information sheet, then followed up with a phone call after a few days. For consenting pharmacies, a meeting was scheduled with the lead pharmacists and their staff (stop smoking advisors and support staff) to discuss the study in detail and obtain written informed consent for participation. Stop smoking advisors are the people who run the stop smoking service within the pharmacy including providing one to one consultation sessions with clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The support staff, typically known as counter assistants, are the initial point of contact with pharmacy clients and are the point of first contact with smokers enquiring about stop smoking services.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Sixty community pharmacies in London (29, 24% of total eligible) and Coventry (19, 33%) in England and Cwm Taf, southeast Wales (12, 22%) agreed to participate and were randomised by cluster (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Pharmacy characteristics (whether the pharmacy is a chain or independent) and pharmacy staff data (demographics, work role and experience, training needs) were collected after obtaining written consent.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>STOP Trial flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12916_2022_2412_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par21">All self-reported current smokers aged 18 years and older who joined the stop smoking services in participating pharmacies and attended their first stop smoking session were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. For clarity, we call this group ‘treated smokers’. Anonymised routine data were collected on treated smokers from returns to service commissioners or from manual records under the gatekeeper agreement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Willing treated smokers gave individual, written, informed consent for additional data collection procedures and were contacted at 6 months to ascertain continuous abstinence status and satisfaction with NHS SSS.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p id="Par22">WYJ, SJ and TY recruited community pharmacies and emailed an independent statistician in the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit, who was not part of the STOP team, with relevant information. The unit of randomisation was the community pharmacy. Pharmacies were allocated to the STOP training intervention or usual practice (control group) in a 1:1 ratio using block randomisation, stratified for pharmacy commissioner and an average number of prescriptions dispensed per month per pharmacy—(1) = 0–3000 and (2) =  &gt; 3000 based on dispensing data summaries extracted from publicly available data for England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and for Wales, respectively, as a proxy for pharmacy size/footfall. Three thousand was the median number of prescriptions dispensed per month per pharmacy. The independent statistician used an online randomisation system to ensure allocation concealment.</p>
                <p id="Par23">There were three types of community pharmacies: independent, small chains and large chains. To reduce contamination due to staff crossover, pharmacy chains where the owner had fewer than five pharmacies (small chains) were randomised as one unit. For large pharmacy chains, each outlet was randomised as a separate unit. Owners of large pharmacy chains or the head office confirmed to the study team at recruitment and during subsequent trial monitoring visits that there would be no staff crossover.</p>

                <title>Blinding</title>
                <p id="Par24">Treated smokers in both intervention and usual practice pharmacies were informed that their community pharmacy was taking part in a research study but remained unaware of the pharmacy allocation status. It was not possible to blind either participating pharmacies or pharmacy staff (i.e. advisors, support staff) to the intervention because the intervention involved staff training. The trial statistician (VM) remained blind to the allocation status until the analysis plan was signed off. Commissioners who collected and sent electronic routinely collected SSS data were also blinded to the allocation status.</p>

                  <title>Intervention</title>
                  <p id="Par35">A programme theory based on findings from our literature reviews, qualitative and pilot studies was developed to inform intervention development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Guided by the COM-B framework for behaviour change[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we drew upon social cognitive theory and self-determination theory to target capability and motivation among pharmacy staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The assumption was that addressing pharmacy workers’ skills, attitudes and motivation towards smoking cessation through practice-based training sessions would lead to more effective engagement of smokers and better quit rates in the stop smoking service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par36">The original design was for training to be delivered over two sessions with opportunities to practice skills learnt during training in between. However, based on feedback from pharmacy workers who took part in pilot studies, the STOP training intervention was offered as a face-to-face, single, off-site, half-day session on a pharmacy closure day (Saturday or Sunday), lasting approximately 3 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Pharmacy stop smoking advisors and support staff (e.g. counter assistants) were trained together to encourage team working and to facilitate role modelling by more experienced staff. The STOP training involved role-plays and videos targeting the engagement of smokers and optimising the delivery of smoking cessation counselling. The training also focused on communication skills based on motivational interviewing and practising key phrases such as ‘all quit attempts are a success’, ‘our service is free, delivered with an expert’ and ‘you can come back anytime for support’, to facilitate better engagement with potential SSS clients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Training sessions were facilitated by a health psychologist experienced in behaviour change (SJ), an experienced respiratory nurse (WYJ) and a community pharmacy stop smoking adviser (DA). We chose venues commonly used for other pharmacy staff training courses (i.e. existing pharmacy training rooms, university premises, local community health centres or local council premises). We established a WhatsApp group to facilitate contact between the staff after the training sessions. Training attendance was incentivised by providing £40 to counter assistants and £80 to pharmacists/stop smoking advisors to cover time spent and travel expenses (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1).</p>
                  <p id="Par37">Attendees were given a certificate of completion, alongside training handouts, badges, a STOP poster and a specially designed desk calendar to act as prompts and reinforcers of the training within the pharmacy environment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Badges were intended to be worn by the staff during the working day and the desk calendars to be kept in the pharmacy consulting room. WhatsApp groups were set up for communication, signposting training materials and other smoking cessation resources to participants. The control arm also had a WhatsApp group solely for communication purposes.</p>
                  <p id="Par38">STOP training is complementary to the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], mandatory training for stop smoking advisers. NCSCT training is a competence-based programme aiming to impart knowledge and skills in smoking cessation. The support staff had no previous smoking cessation training since only stop smoking advisors are eligible for the NCSCT programme.</p>

                  <title>Control group</title>
                  <p id="Par39">Control pharmacies did not receive STOP intervention training and continued to deliver the NHS SSS as usual. In theory, stop smoking advisers from pharmacies commissioned to deliver NHS SSS would have had NCSCT equivalent skills-based training (possibly over 2 days) that would cover a large element of behavioural support and recruitment in addition to the online NCSCT core knowledge and skills online assessment. The STOP training aimed to bolster this among NCSCT-trained stop smoking advisers and introduce cessation concepts to untrained staff within intervention pharmacies.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par44">Because the primary outcome was at the level of the pharmacy, we conducted the sample size calculation at the pharmacy level. On average, 165 smokers were expected to join stop smoking services in a control cluster pharmacy over 11 months (based on pilot data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We considered that an increase of 33% in the intervention clusters to 220 smokers per pharmacy would be sufficient to change commissioning policy. Based on historical service commissioner data from the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and NHS dispensing data for pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the standard deviation of throughput was expected to be approximately 63 in both groups. To detect this difference at the 5% significance level and 90% power, we needed 56 clusters. We added two clusters to each arm to allow for dropout, which increased the number of community pharmacies required to 60.</p>

                <p id="Par45">Analysis was performed on intention-to-treat (ITT) principles, where all pharmacies were included for analysis in the trial arm to which they were randomised. Data from pharmacies and treated smokers who withdrew were included in the analysis up to the point of withdrawal. By definition, there was no withdrawal for the primary outcome.</p>
                <p id="Par46">An estimate of treatment effect on the primary outcome (i.e. the numbers of smokers enrolled in the stop smoking services) was obtained by fitting a Poisson regression model with numbers of ‘treated smokers’ per pharmacy as the dependent variable. The two stratification factors, pharmacy commissioner and average number of prescriptions (i.e. forms) per month (3000 or less, more than 3000) which is a proxy for a number of smokers using stop smoking services, were included as categorical variables. Pharmacy was included as a random effect to allow for clustering.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Four-week retention and quit rates (CO-verified) for treated smokers were assessed using generalised estimating equations which included these as the dependent variable in the xtgee command in Stata with a logit link. Again, pharmacy was included as the random effects variable to account for clustering. Other covariates included in the models were two stratification factors—pharmacy commissioner and the average number of prescriptions/forms per month (3000 or less, more than 3000)—gender and age. Exchangeable correlation matrix and robust standard errors were used.</p>
                <p id="Par48">The number and percentage of treated smokers who quit (CO-verified) smoking by their 4 weeks quit status assessment and remained so at 6 months (continuous abstinence at 6 months) from the date of consent were summarised descriptively (due to the small number treated smokers (<italic>n</italic> = 5) providing data, no statistical modelling was performed) by intervention arm.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Stop smoking advisor and pharmacy support staff self-efficacy in delivering stop smoking services, acceptability of the STOP training intervention (applicable to intervention arm only) and treated smoker satisfaction with stop smoking services (collected from consented treated smokers at 6 months follow-up) were summarised descriptively by intervention arm. Changes in stop smoking advisor overall self-efficacy and self-efficacy in delivering core competency skills were assessed using longitudinal linear mixed effects models. Pharmacy and advisor were included as random effects to allow for clustering.

The intervention arm had more large chain pharmacies than the control arm (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Nearly half of the recruited pharmacies had only one trained stop smoking advisor. Two-thirds of consenting pharmacy staff were stop smoking advisers; the remainder were support staff. Fewer support staff consented to participating in the trial in the control arm compared to the intervention arm (20% vs 43%).

                <title>Primary outcome</title>
                <p id="Par62">The STOP Trial aimed to find out whether a behaviour change and communication skills intervention to complement NCSCT training could improve throughput in community pharmacy NHS Stop Smoking Services. Although the intervention was comprehensive, theoretically grounded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and well-received, we found no evidence that the STOP intervention increased throughput.</p>
                <p id="Par63">We consider several reasons why there was no difference in throughput between the two arms, despite pharmacy staff finding the STOP training acceptable and useful. Firstly, from 2017, budgets for services were cut by 50%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. These funding cuts have forced local authorities to decommission many SSS in community pharmacy settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. During our study period, we observed several changes in contracting processes and significant staff turnover which interrupted service activity. These changes and uncertainties in staffing and regarding service commissioning may have affected the capability and motivation of pharmacy staff to offer stop smoking services and implement the intervention. More details will be available in our forthcoming process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Secondly, fewer smokers joined the service over the course of the trial recruitment period than we expected based on our pilot trial and historical commissioner data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, from 2016/2017 to 2018/2019, the number of people approaching pharmacies decreased from 19.1 to 18.5%. In the context of the programme theory for the STOP intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], reduced smokers visiting pharmacies and signing up to the SSS gave pharmacy staff less opportunities to practice knowledge and skills learnt during training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent review found that new skills acquired through training, require considerable practice time to embed those skills in day-to-day clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The study also found pharmacies to be particularly challenging settings for behaviour change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] will provide a more in-depth understanding of the challenges in the pharmacy context.</p>
                <p id="Par64">Another reason for the general low throughput in pharmacies during the trial may be the increasing use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. E-cigarette use among adults in Great Britain between 2017 and 2019 (study period) increased from 2.9 million to 3.6 million users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. E-cigarettes entered the market in the UK in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and these devices may help some smokers quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. During our study period, smokers may have independently tried e-cigarettes rather than accessing support from the NHS SSS. E-cigarettes have been cited as a reason for the decline in services but to a lesser extent than budget cuts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Up to 2015, however, there was no clear association found between e-cigarette use and change in behavioural support to quit, but smokers trying to quit with e-cigarettes were less likely to obtain NRT on prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>

                <title>Secondary outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par65">The STOP intervention was highly acceptable to pharmacy staff, who found the sessions useful and enjoyable and felt that it improved their skills in helping people to stop smoking. This suggests that the STOP intervention model may be effective in facilitating the development of behaviour change skills in pharmacy staff in the context of smoking cessation and could therefore be useful for other health promotion initiatives. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess stop smoking adviser behaviour post-training because they were unwilling to record their smoker consultations. Moreover, 50% of staff felt that it was hard to implement skills learnt in practice. So, there are questions regarding the fidelity of intervention delivery that will be addressed in the process evaluation paper. Levels of self-efficacy for smoker recruitment, engagement and retention were high among staff in both arms of the trial suggesting that the workforce has a high level of belief in their ability to perform these tasks which may increase their motivation to engage with smokers. Recruitment and retention of smokers in the service were high at 4 weeks, and quit rates were acceptable in both study arms. Taken as a whole, we do not know whether the STOP intervention improved the behaviour change skills of pharmacy staff enough to increase throughput in the SSS. The process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] will provide a more in-depth understanding of the challenges to the fidelity of intervention delivery.</p>

                <title>Comparison with other studies</title>
                <p id="Par66">To our knowledge, this is the first trial focusing on improving smoker uptake and retention in NHS community pharmacy stop smoking services and one of the few randomised controlled trials conducted in community pharmacies in the UK.</p>
                <p id="Par67">Another study that developed a behaviour change app (StopApp) to optimise uptake and attendance of NHS Stop Smoking Services more generally, also reported declining service uptake in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. StopApp used the Capability Opportunity Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) behaviour change framework which also informed the STOP intervention. We do not know if the StopApp was successful because the trial results are not yet published. However, the StopApp feasibility trial identified several barriers to attending SSS, including lack of knowledge about what happens in the SSS (capability), the belief that the SSS is not easy to access (opportunity), that there would be ‘scare tactics’ or ‘nagging’, and no knowledge of success quit stories (motivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. These barriers are similar to those we found when developing the STOP intervention and which our intervention was designed to circumvent. We trained the pharmacy staff to proactively promote their service structure to smokers from the counter to increase knowledge (capability), encourage an ‘open door’ policy (opportunity) and approach each smoker and peers in a non-judgmental positive mindset to facilitate change (motivation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>

                <title>Strengths of this study</title>
                <p id="Par68">The STOP intervention was theory-based and piloted and repiloted during the course of development. We involved smokers, pharmacies and service commissioners from an early stage as part of patient and public involvement, using their feedback to adapt the content and mode of delivery to suit the community pharmacy environment. The STOP intervention was well received, and the pharmacy staff found it useful in improving their behaviour change skills. Thus, the methods and programme theory underlying the intervention may be useful in the future as more clinical tasks are taken up by pharmacists and new services are developed. Similarly, the methods developed for data analysis and evaluation of outcomes may be helpful in the design and evaluation of new programmes for health promotion in community pharmacies.</p>
                <p id="Par69">Using routinely collected data directly from service commissioners to assess smoker throughput and quit rates in the trial was a novel approach, done once before in the ‘Evaluating longer-term outcomes of the National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services’ (ELONS) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This approach reduced the additional burden of collecting data on stop smoking advisors in busy community pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Routinely collected data has substantial potential to improve conduct and reduce costs of RCTs although it is important to address potential practical barriers such as location and access to routine data, availability of IT infrastructure, and data quality assessment. Routine data trials also present different issues regarding informed consent, confidentiality risk management in the regulatory and ethical approval process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par70">We achieved our recruitment targets for community pharmacies and pharmacy staff using a hierarchical or ‘Russian doll’ approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], where the study team sought approval from high-level decision-makers (SSS commissioners, pharmacy owners) first before approaching the individual pharmacies and managers about trial participation.</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par71">Fewer people were enrolled in the pharmacy-led SSS than anticipated over the trial duration which limited the participant recruitment pool. Midway through the STOP Trial, pharmacy-led SSS had reduced to such an extent that we had approximately the same number of smokers using the services from 60 pharmacies over 11 months as we had from 12 pharmacies over 5 months in the pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On average, only 21 smokers joined the stop smoking services per pharmacy instead of the expected 165. This decline occurred within a very short period, limiting our ability to make contingency plans. The reasons for this rapid decline are uncertain. However, cuts to the public health funding and to wider local authority spending in recent years have had a major impact on local authority budgets for stop smoking services and wider tobacco control. In 2018, 38% of local authorities in England that still had a budget for stop smoking services cut this budget, following similar cuts in 50% of local authorities in 2017 and in 59% of local authorities in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par72">The power calculation for our study was made at a cluster level based on average recruitment rates from historical data and from our pilot trial. Whilst smaller numbers would not affect the power of our study directly, this decrease in recruitment was not uniform across pharmacies, thus greater variability gave less power to detect the 33% increase in throughput.</p>
                <p id="Par73">Pharmacy withdrawals and staff turnover were high which limited data collection on self-efficacy at follow up. Participating pharmacy staff lacked experience in conducting clinical trials and needed additional training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), informed consent and sample collection. This affected number of smokers consenting for additional data collection at 6 months and resulted in low numbers of baseline saliva samples. Pharmacy staff were resistant to the saliva collection process as they felt it would deter clients from joining their SSS. These factors limited our ability to validate self-reported quit rates in a subgroup of participants as we had intended. The lack of research readiness in community pharmacies will need to be addressed in future clinical trials in this setting.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Treated smokers provided contact details on their consent forms but very few responded to emails from STOP researchers. Those who did respond and completed a 6-month assessment were not willing to provide saliva sample. Very few were also willing to participate in an interview regarding their experience of using the service. Low response rates limited evaluation of long-term outcomes/abstinence. An explanation might be that researchers were too detached or distanced from the treated smoker group from the onset as they were recruited to the trial by adviser. More proactive communication by the study team after consent might have improved follow up rates.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par75">Within the STOP Trial, we found high levels of retention and acceptable quit rates in the NHS pharmacy stop smoking service. Pharmacy staff found the STOP training helpful in improving behaviour change skills, and service users were highly satisfied despite no increase in service throughput being detected among participating community pharmacies in the trial’s intervention arm. If health policy is to continue expanding the role of pharmacy in primary healthcare delivery, then pharmacy staff need increased levels of funding and training. UK qualitative research studies indicate enthusiasm among pharmacists for new extended primary care roles but highlight a need for clear definitions of the knowledge, skills and attributes required and provision of training that addresses these needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par76">The lack of consistent long term funding may be a potential barrier to the wider implementation of this extended role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Given that participants in both trial arms had acceptable quit rates we call for commissioners to reprioritise funding into pharmacy-led SSS. Commissioners may need to consider uniformity of systems used for smoking cessation data capture to facilitate prompt remuneration to community pharmacies, and easier evaluation of outcomes on micro and macro levels across the service. Currently, the processes may be more complicated than necessary which can deter pharmacy staff from delivering the service, affecting smoker throughput. The NHS Stop Smoking Service remains an effective route for facilitating cessation if smokers can be engaged effectively.</p>
