                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Child and family social workers in the UK work closely with other agencies including schools and the police, and typically they are based in local authority offices. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of placing social workers in schools (SWIS) on the need for social care interventions. SWIS was piloted in three local authorities in 2018–2020, and findings from a feasibility study of the pilots suggests SWIS may operate through three key pathways: (1) by enhancing schools’ response to safeguarding issues, (2) through increased collaboration between social workers, school staff, and parents, and (3) by improving relationships between social workers and young people.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The study is a two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial building on three feasibility studies which found SWIS to be promising. Social workers will work within secondary schools across local authorities in England. 280 mainstream secondary schools will be randomly allocated with a 1:1 ratio to SWIS or a comparison arm, which will be schools that continue as normal, without a social worker. The primary outcome will be the rate of Child Protection (Section 47) enquiries. Secondary outcomes will comprise rate of referrals to children’s social care, rate of Child in Need (Section 17) assessments, days spent in care, and educational attendance and attainment. The study also includes an economic evaluation, and an implementation and process evaluation. Social care outcomes will be measured in July 2022, and educational outcomes will be measured in July 2023. Days in care will be measured at both time points.</p>

The funder gave feedback on early drafts of the protocol and had some input into the statistical analysis plan, to ensure it aligns with their statistical analysis guidelines (available on request from <email>programmes@whatworks-csc.org.uk</email>). They requested the use of cluster standard errors instead of multi-level modelling for the primary analysis in order to maintain consistency across their portfolio of funded trials, as well as the use of Hochberg’s step-up procedure to correct for multiple testing across secondary outcomes.

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>This study will evaluate a programme that aims to embed social workers into schools (SWIS) so that they can work more effectively with education colleagues and with children and families. Education and Children’s Social Care (CSC) have an important inter-agency relationship, and both play a vital role in keeping children safe and promoting their wellbeing. Schools have long been among the major sources of referrals to CSC in the UK, contributing the second highest proportion (18%) of all referrals in 2018/19, behind the police (29%) [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Yet the two agencies have different roles and priorities, and significant cultural and organisational differences add to the complexity of working effectively together. SWIS was conceived before Covid-19, but the impact of the pandemic is also putting additional pressure on both schools and social workers [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265354.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Policymakers have been increasingly interested in finding ways to improve how education and CSC work together to respond to safeguarding concerns and protect children, and in this context these efforts are likely to intensify.</p>
                <p>SWIS may be a promising approach to doing this. The central idea is that having a social worker linked to and based within a secondary school can have a range of benefits. In particular, to improve the service delivered to children and families, enhance interagency working, reduce risks to children and lead to better outcomes. Building on a recent set of three pilot studies [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], this project is an evaluation of the next stage of development of SWIS: a scaling up trial involving 280 schools in 21 local authorities (LAs) across England, with half of these schools receiving a social worker. Aside from the SWIS pilots, there are several examples of social workers working in schools [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0265354.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the scale of the SWIS programme makes this the largest example of the approach.</p>
                <p>The three pilot studies have been central to the development of the SWIS study. They took place in Southampton, Lambeth and Stockport in 2018–20. The pilot evaluation generated qualitative and limited quantitative evidence that the intervention was positively received by schools, social care, children and families [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A range of benefits were evidenced, including the opportunity for social workers to do more meaningful direct work with children, help a wider range of children and families than they otherwise would, and support schools to work through safeguarding issues. The evaluation also found indications of a reduction in Child in Need and Child Protection assessments carried out. However, the strength of the evidence was limited by the quasi-experimental design, small sample size, low incidence rates of key outcomes, and short follow-up. Taken together, the qualitative and quantitative findings from the pilots prompted the Department for Education to fund this larger trial of SWIS. Delivered through What Works for Children’s Social Care, this scale-up allows us to understand the potential effectiveness of SWIS more robustly.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Mainstream secondary schools are places of education for children aged between 11 and 18 (Years 7 to 13). They are funded by the Government and provide a free education for children, though a number of models exist, such as academies, free schools, and faith schools. All children attending the schools are eligible for the trial. Schools may opt-out of participation in the Implementation and Process Evaluation (IPE) while remaining in the trial.</p>

                <p>The intervention physically locates social workers within schools with the aim to build better working relationships with school staff, students and families. Rather than working with students and families from a LA office base, and liaising with and providing advice to education professionals remotely, the social worker is embedded in the school. <xref rid="pone.0265354.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref> shows a logic model that describes three hypothesized mechanisms of impact:</p>
                <list list-type="alpha-upper">

                </list>
                <p>Pathway A is based around regular, good quality, communication between the social worker and school staff. The advice and support given to school staff is hypothesized to increase staff confidence in safeguarding issues and improve the quality of school referrals. Pathway B is about working directly with families and improving relationships between social workers and parents. Pathway C is about working with children and young people directly. Frequent interactions with the social worker enable the young person to trust the social worker and to feel understood and supported. This is theorised to lead to improved school attendance and participation, better management of a young person’s risks and improved outcomes. In all three pathways, improved child and family outcomes are theorized to lead to a reduction of the number of children in care.</p>
                <p>Following the pilot evaluations, an intervention manual has been developed (WWCSC, 2020 –available on request from <email>programmes@whatworks-csc.org.uk</email>). This distils the key messages from the pilots into a practical format designed to assist the 21 LAs in delivering SWIS. Its stated aim is to provide “a framework to refine the SWIS Scale-up programme and encourage more consistent and effective integration of social workers into schools”, although the need for flexibility is acknowledged. The manual offers a number of recommendations for implementers. Among them, the following relate to programme delivery:</p>

                </list>
                <p>The control group will receive service as usual. Children who are deemed by school staff to require the involvement of CSC will be referred to the LA, usually via telephone call or email to a Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub arrangement or a referral and assessment team. Children judged by CSC to meet the threshold for involvement will be allocated a social worker as usual, but social workers will not be based in the school. This was chosen as the comparator because it is the status quo that the intervention can be distinguished from, and the system that SWIS needs to perform better than if it is to be considered worthwhile. Children who are deemed to require the involvement of CSC will continue to be eligible for this across all schools, including the control group. LAs will make case by case judgements about the best interests of children who were receiving a service prior to the trial. For example, a child on an existing child protection plan may retain their previously allocated social worker to avoid disruption, rather than transferring to the SWIS worker.</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions</title>
                <p>We anticipate good adherence to the intervention, as the funding for the trial intervention (i.e. the social worker) is provided to participating LAs and schools on the basis of compliance with the intervention guide supplied by the funder, and LAs have committed to delivering SWIS as described. All schools also confirmed their commitment at the outset. However, the adverse circumstances of Covid-19 may mean that some sites need to adapt SWIS, for example to accommodate social distancing or increased remote working. The IPE is designed to capture such adaptation and secondary analyses will explore the impact of varied levels of adherence.</p>

Child protection (s.47) enquiries are investigations CSC carry out when they have “reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives, or is found, in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm” (Children Act, 1989). This is a key point in the work of CSC; an enquiry would normally involve an assessment of the child’s needs and the ability of family members or carers to meet them. Social workers would normally interview family members, children (if they are old enough), and use information from other agencies such as schools and health. This data will be collected from LA CSC departments, based on a data sharing agreement between each LA and the research team.</p>

Assuming an average of 925 students per school, an average base rate of 12.6 s.47 enquiries per 1000 students per school year under usual practice conditions, and a between-school coefficient of variation of 0.45 within LAs (these estimates are all based on comparator school data from the three pilot studies in Lambeth, Stockport and Southampton) [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], randomising 140 mainstream schools to each group provides 90% power to detect a decrease in rates from 12.6 to 10.48 per 1000 pupils per school year (i.e. a rate ratio of 83.2%).

                <p>Mainstream schools were allocated to SWIS or usual practice in a 1:1 ratio whilst minimising covariate imbalance within and across blocks using a balancing algorithm for cluster randomised trials with multiple blocks [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with LAs acting as blocks. This was implemented in R version 3.6.0 [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using code provided as supplementary material to [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For the first block, the standard imbalance metric (Equation 1 in [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]) was used. The allocation of subsequent blocks was conditional on blocks already allocated, using a modified imbalance metric (Equation 2 in [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Balancing variables were school size (total number of students enrolled in year 7 and upward) and proportion of students eligible for free school meals (FSM). Both balancing variables were weighted equally, and will be adjusted for in the final statistical analysis. The rationale for selecting these variables is as follows:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p><bold>School size (total number of students enrolled).</bold> The size of the school and number of students is likely to have an effect on how the social worker engages with and works within the school. In a larger school their time and resources may be spread across more students, and there may be more professionals to work with. It is reasonable to expect that this is a factor that will shape the implementation of SWIS and therefore balancing school size between groups is sensible.</p>

Eligibility for FSM is a reliable indicator that a child is from a low income household [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is important because the work of CSC tends to be focussed on children from lower income households, and it is these children who are more likely to require a service from CSC [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Data for the IPE will be collected primarily through online surveys and interviews. Online surveys of social workers and school staff (five surveys, one at the end of each term, all school social workers and all head teachers in intervention group invited; n = 144 social workers and circa 100–200 school staff) to gather programme-level data on implementation and attitudes and to assess how SWIS is implemented in each school (RQ6 and 8). These will be short, taking no more than fifteen minutes to complete, and administered via Qualtrics online survey platform. Interviews will form part of purposive LA case studies (n = 9; one set of 3 in terms 1–3).</p>

                  <p>Data sharing agreements will be set up between LAs (Data Controller) and Cardiff University to enable sharing of data related to CSC. Data fields will be included in this data sharing agreement, data will contain no identifiers except for a school ID and/or trial allocation. A data lead will be identified at each LA, and the trial data manager will liaise with each data lead to confirm required fields. Building on our learning from the pilot, each LA will pilot data transfer during the set-up phase to ensure the data can flow and is in the correct format. These checks will be detailed in the data management plan. Once any issues are addressed in this pilot, data will be shared quarterly up to the end of the intervention (July 2022). A final data extract will be requested Summer 2023 for the days in care outcomes. Data will be reported by school year group and by month and provided to the Cardiff team in a proforma developed and agreed during the pilot. Data will be aggregated, and no individual-level data will be sent. These data will be securely transferred to Cardiff University and checked by the data manager. All data will be stored on Cardiff University servers in restricted folders available only to those on the trial team who require access. This will be detailed in the delegation log.</p>

                  <title>Statistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes</title>
                  <p>All primary analyses will be ‘intention to treat’ i.e. schools will be analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, regardless of adherence to the intervention. Missing outcome data will not be replaced. For the primary outcome analysis, a quasi-Poisson regression model will be fitted with fixed effects for LAs and cluster robust standard errors reflecting the clustering structure (schools within LAs) to compare rates of s.47 enquiries at 23 months by arm, using the number of students per school as the exposure scaling variable, and s.47 enquiries for 2018/19 (baseline) and % eligible for FSM as fixed-effect covariates. Using a quasi-likelihood model accounts for possible over- or underdispersion i.e. variance in the data that is higher or lower than expected under the standard Poisson model. Allocation will be included in the model as a fixed effect, and the intervention effect (model coefficients transformed into rate ratios) will be presented as point estimate with two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. If the estimated rate is lower in the SWIS arm than in the comparator arm and the 95% CI around the estimated rate ratio excludes the null effect (rate ratio = 1), effectiveness of SWIS at the 5% level will be concluded.</p>
                  <p>Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar way as the primary outcome, by fitting regression models with cluster robust standard errors depending on the type of outcome: quasi-Poisson for rates (referrals to CSC, s.17 assessments) and linear for continuous variables (days in care, educational attendance and attainment). For the school-level variables (referrals to CSC, s.17 assessments, days in care) we will include the same fixed-effect covariates in the model as for the primary outcome (allocation, LA, baseline outcome from 2018/19, % eligible for FSM) and also use the number of students per school as the exposure scaling variable. For the student-level variables (educational attendance and attainment) we will additionally include gender and ethnicity as covariates, and the baseline outcomes used will be 2018/19 attendance (for attendance) and KS4 results (for attainment). The p-values generated from the secondary outcome analyses will be adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s step-up procedure.</p>

                <sec id="sec035">
                  <title>Other secondary analyses</title>
                  <p>A secondary analysis will use per-term (or per-month, if available) outcome data and include term (or month) as an additional covariate in the model to explore potential implementation effects and/or seasonality. Another secondary analysis will assess the hypothesised mediators of change outlined in logic model (<xref rid="pone.0265354.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>) at the 23-month follow-up by fitting an interaction term between allocation and category of implementation fidelity (a Gold, Silver, Bronze categorisation will be developed based on a re-analysis of pilot data and other insights from the IPE). Any other subgroup analyses (e.g. by age group) will be agreed with service user input. The p-values generated from these secondary and subgroup analyses will also be adjusted for multiplicity using Hochberg’s step-up procedure. We will fit a two-level mixed-effects model with random LA effects as an additional robustness analysis.</p>
                  <p>Missing outcome data will not be replaced in the primary analysis, but we will perform null imputation for missing covariates, where we will replace missing values with 0, and create a dummy indicator for the covariate coded 1 if the value was missing, and 0 otherwise, and include the dummy in the regression. If more than 5% of outcome data are missing, we will consider repeating the primary analysis after multiple imputation. To assess the impact of non-compliance (if present), we will exclude intervention arm schools that did not adopt the intervention at all and then repeat the primary analysis, and we will also perform a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis. Statistical code and anonymised data can be provided upon reasonable request, in line with Centre for Trials Research policy.</p>

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p>The study has ethical approval from School of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee of Cardiff University (Ref: SREC/3865, approval date: 26.08.2020). Written, informed consent to participate will be obtained from all participants. Due to the use of remote methods, and in case consent forms are not returned, verbal consent will be audio recorded in interviews with professionals in addition to written consent.</p>
                <p>If interviewees say anything that makes the researcher concerned about harm to the participant or another person, then they have a duty to take appropriate action. In the first instance, usually this would involve discussing the concern with the Chief Investigator or a co-investigator. Depending on the nature of the harm, referrals to agencies may be appropriate, for example a referral to the LA CSC may be deemed necessary if a child was thought to be at risk.</p>

Recruitment was completed in February 2021.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The SWIS trial is the largest and most rigorous study of school based social work in the UK, and will be a significant addition to the international evidence base. It will contribute to our understanding of how multi-agency responses may help protect children and reduce the need for CSC involvement, and investigate whether working in this way has an impact on educational outcomes for vulnerable children. However, this is a time of great disruption as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and our findings will need to be considered in light of this.</p>
              <p>Covid-19 is likely to present ongoing challenges for both the implementation of SWIS and our efforts to study it. As the implementation guide states, the intention is that “face to face contact should be the basis for the intervention” but this may simply not be possible. Although most schools remained open for ‘vulnerable’ children at the start of 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], many children in this category were not attending school [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Schools involved in the trial also introduced measures to make schools safer and reduce the chances of disease transmission, including limiting numbers of staff on site. This will almost certainly affect the way social workers are able to engage with children, families and professionals.</p>
              <p>Moreover, some of the outcome indicators we intend to use may not be comparable to the same measures in previous years. Attendance and attainment measures, for example, appear especially incomparable with pre-pandemic times. For example, whether or not an absence is unauthorised will be more difficult to record, and Key Stage 4 examinations will be replaced with teacher assessed grades in 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0265354.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>At a broader level, the amount of disruption implementers face will make the results of our between groups analysis difficult to interpret. Covid-19 has increased the risk of misleading results, as (1) the implementation of SWIS is likely to be more variable and (2) exogenous factors may override the impact of the intervention. The IPE is designed to insure against these risks, and in this context the secondary and exploratory analyses that it will feed into will gain importance. It would be easier to address these challenges if the trial ran for more than a single academic year. However, as it is linked to a policy initiative the study is limited to the timescale set out by the funder.</p>
