                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Dental service provision in the care home sector is poor, with little emphasis on prevention. Emerging evidence suggests that the use of Dental Care Professionals (dental therapists and dental nurses) as an alternative to dentists has the potential to improve preventive advice, the provision of care and access to services within care homes. However, robust empirical evidence from definitive trials on how to successfully implement and sustain these interventions within care homes is currently lacking. The aim of the study is to determine whether Dental Care Professionals could reduce plaque levels of dentate older adults (65 + years) residing in care homes.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This protocol describes a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial that will be undertaken in care homes across Wales, Northern Ireland and England. In the intervention arm, the dental therapists will visit the care homes every 6 months to assess and then treat eligible residents, where necessary. All treatment will be conducted within their Scope of Practice. Dental nurses will visit the care homes every month for the first 3 months and then three-monthly afterwards to promulgate advice to improve the day-to-day prevention offered to residents by carers. The control arm will be ‘treatment as usual’.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">Eligible care homes (<italic>n</italic> = 40) will be randomised based on a 1:1 ratio (20 intervention and 20 control), with an average of seven residents recruited in each home resulting in an estimated sample of 280. Assessments will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months and will include a dental examination and quality of life questionnaires. Care home staff will collect weekly information on the residents’ oral health (e.g. episodes of pain and unscheduled care). The primary outcome will be a binary classification of the mean reduction in Silness-Löe Plaque Index at 6 months. A parallel process evaluation will be undertaken to explore the intervention’s acceptability and how it could be embedded in standard practice (described in a separate paper), whilst a cost-effectiveness analysis will examine the potential long-term costs and benefits of the intervention.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par39">Poor oral health, including dental caries and periodontal disease, is a very common problem for older adults residing in care homes and the issue is increasingly becoming a significant public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Amongst older adults, 40% of the 75–84 age group and 33% of the 85 + age group have dental caries, whilst periodontal disease affects 69% of those over 65 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The oral health of care home residents is much worse than their community living peers. With increasing dependency, the ability for self-care deteriorates, poly-pharmacy leads to dry mouth and diets become rich in sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. All these factors significantly increase residents’ disease burden and the risk of future problems. Oral conditions impact on their quality of life, self-esteem, general health and diet, exacerbating underlying medical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Income-related inequality in oral health of older adults is also a major issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par40">Despite this high level of need, dental service provision in residential care is poor, with little emphasis on prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Access to domiciliary services is difficult and unscheduled care for dental problems (including hospital admissions) is common, complex to deliver and expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) argue that the design of long-term care systems that are fit for ageing populations should take priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], Public Health England (PHE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE NG48) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have all called for more high-quality research. Recently, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) have also highlighted the paucity of dental care in care homes in their Oral Health Care in Care Homes report published in June 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par41">There is increasing evidence that Dental Care Professionals (DCPs) offer an alternative to using dentists to meet the future challenges in dental public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. DCPs are a broad range of professionals, which include dental therapists (DTs) and dental nurses (DNs). Previous research has demonstrated that DTs can identify and screen for dental caries and periodontal disease and are safe as front-line health care workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The feasibility, productivity and effectiveness of using DTs has been tested in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but little has been undertaken in a care home environment. Emerging evidence suggests that the use of DCPs (DTs and DNs) within care homes has the potential to improve preventive advice, the provision of care and access to services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par42">Following a retrospective analysis of the 2010 Welsh dental care home survey data, Monaghan &amp; Morgan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] concluded ‘a large proportion of need in care homes could be wholly provided by hygienists or therapists’ and an ‘efficiency gain of direct access arises from individuals who do not need to see a dentist for any aspects of their care’. It is also argued that DTs can lead examinations in care home settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, robust empirical evidence from definitive trials about how best to successfully implement and sustain DCP interventions within care home environments is currently lacking.</p>
                <p id="Par43">The aim of this study is to determine whether DCPs could reduce plaque levels (improve the oral cleanliness) of dentate older adults (over 65 years of age) residing in care homes over a 6-month period, when compared to ‘treatment as usual’ (commonly a reactive and ad hoc service provided by dentists), and also to determine whether this effect is sustainable over a further 6-month follow-up period.</p>

                <p id="Par53">This is a multi-centre, two-armed, cluster-randomised trial, based on a superiority design, to determine whether DCPs could reduce levels of dental plaque of dentate older adults residing in care homes over a 6-month period, when compared with ‘treatment as usual’. Residents will be followed for a further 6 months to determine whether this effect is sustainable. Care homes (<italic>n</italic> = 40) will be randomised based on a 1:1 ratio (20 intervention and 20 control), with an average of seven residents recruited in each care home resulting in an estimated sample size of 280.

                <p id="Par54">A cost-effectiveness analysis from a NHS perspective will examine the potential long-term costs and benefits of the intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par55">A process evaluation involving semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders will be undertaken alongside the trial to explore the intervention’s acceptability and treatment fidelity (subject of an additional paper). It will also capture the contextual factors that shape the intervention, mechanisms that sustain or potentiate effects, unexpected pathways and consequences and the contextual factors that shape implementation. A semi-structured interview schedule will be developed in collaboration with the patient and public involvement (PPI) group. Audio-taped interviews will be conducted both in person and using virtual technology. Data will be anonymised, fully transcribed and analysed by the researchers using thematic analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par70">Consent into the study will follow guidance laid down within the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Potential participants will be assumed as having capacity to consent for themselves unless formally assessed as lacking capacity, in which case the views of a Personal Consultee (usually a relative) will be sought. If no Personal Consultee can be identified, a Professional Consultee who is (a) independent of the study and (b) knows the participant well enough to consider their views will be approached. If the participant’s lack of capacity is considered temporary, capacity will be reassessed prior to each contact with the researcher. If a participant communicates his/her objection to a research assessment or intervention, either verbally or non-verbally, the intervention will cease immediately. Further attempts will be made at a later time; however, if the participant continues to object then he/she will be withdrawn from the study. The safety and well-being of residents will be paramount at all times.</p>

                <p id="Par73">The description of the intervention below has been reported in accordance with the TIDieR (Template for Intervention Description and Replication) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par74">DTs will visit care homes in their locality every 6 months, and the DNs will visit every month for the first 3 months and then 3-monthly afterwards. This approach builds on the existing Gwên am Byth programme (which has not been empirically evaluated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this manner, DTs will proactively oversee the clinical management of eligible dentate residents. The DTs will provide any simple operative treatment for individual residents, within their Scope of Practice (referring onto dentists within the CDS when necessary) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Monaghan and Morgan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] found that these management strategies would address the majority of cases that are likely to be seen in residents based in care homes. Extractions will need to be referred to dentists and DTs will act to sign-post residents to the CDS. Other clinical cases which may require onwards referral are fractured dentures, crowns and bridges, but these are less likely to warrant further intervention, given the focus on palliative management in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par75">The DNs will promulgate advice to improve the day-to-day prevention offered to residents based on Delivering Better Oral Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

                <p id="Par80">The visits from the DNs will form an important function in terms of championing oral health amongst care home managers and staff. This element of the complex intervention is just as important as the 6-monthly clinical management of dental need by the DTs. As highlighted by Brocklehurst et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], ‘there is growing support for the use of change agents in implementation processes’. Human agency where clinical or non-clinical staff act as change agents to facilitate the enactment of complex interventions is increasingly seen to be key [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. To facilitate this process, training materials will be provided using the All-Wales Faculty of Dental Care Professionals platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This will include dedicated documents for care home staff, based on a funded study that has utilised co-production and co-design principles to adapt NICE guidelines NG48 (TOPIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hard-copy training manuals will also be provided to care homes.</p>
                <p id="Par81">The local study team will be responsible for reviewing the delivery of the intervention so that it meets the criteria of the trial, i.e. a visit by the DT at least once every 6 months and by the DN once a month in the first quarter and then 3-monthly afterwards.</p>

                  <p id="Par86">The Primary Outcome Measure (POM) for this study will be the Silness-Loë Plaque Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The index is a 4-point scale (measuring the amount of dental plaque present on six index teeth) ranging from 0-no plaque to 3-abundance of dental plaque within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin. In accordance with the index, the mean will be calculated from these ordinal scores on the six index teeth. The prevailing model in the dental literature is to measure the change in this mean score. However, this model is difficult to infer clinical significance at a population level. To this end, the proportion of individuals in each arm that have demonstrated a 50% reduction in their mean Silness-Loë Plaque Index from baseline will be calculated. This will enable the change in the mean plaque index at the individual level to be measured, whilst providing a meaningful primary outcome measure at a population level.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">The sample size calculation (see section ‘<xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">Sample size {14}</xref>’) is based and powered on changes to the POM at 6 months. This takes account of the ‘time-to-effect’ of the intervention on the POM and the pragmatic consideration of the length of stay of eligible residents. However, a follow-up at 12 months will be undertaken to determine whether the effect seen at 6 months can be sustained. This aligns with the eligibility criteria and the estimated length of stay that the residents have in a care home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par97">The primary outcome will be based on a binary outcome using a superiority design, with a successful case demonstrating a 50% reduction in their mean Silness-Löe Plaque Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] over a 6-month period, i.e. the relative proportion of the residents whose Silness-Löe Plaque Index have been halved as a result of the intervention will be compared across the two arms. This concurs with two relevant studies, which tested the implementation of an oral hygiene guideline in a comparable population. Khanagar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] demonstrated a 50% reduction in the mean Silness-Löe Plaque Index (3.17 to 1.57), and the mean reduction amongst residents found by van der Putten et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] was from 2.36 to 1.58. Assuming the proportion of the control group that will halve their mean Silness-Löe Plaque Index over 6 months is 0.10 (given the halo effect of participating in a trial), a sample of 280 (20 care homes per arm with five completers per care home plus attrition at 28%) will provide 90% power to detect a 0.19 difference in proportions between the arms at a 5% significance level (i.e. 0.29 of intervention group will see a 50% reduction in their mean Silness-Löe Plaque Index). This incorporates an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05. The measurements taken at 12 months will determine whether this effect (the primary end point being 6 months) can be sustained for a further 6 months.</p>
                <p id="Par98">It is likely that care homes will be able to recruit a variable number of participants due to their relative size and differing populations. Therefore, a coefficient of variation has been included in the sample size to accommodate this. Taking the approach of Campbell and Walters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and assuming that recruitment will vary between 5 and 15 participants within a home the sample proposed will accommodate this and still retain 90% power.</p>

Eligible care homes will be informed about the study through the standard communication routes (letter/email/phone call or in person) and in collaboration with Care Forum Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], ENRICH-Cymru [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and ENRICH in London [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The research team will also use the footprint of participating CDSs across Wales, Northern Ireland, Central and North London and the North of England. If eligible care homes want further information, a member of the local study team will arrange a visit in person to provide the care home managers with an information sheet, further discuss the study and answer any questions about participation. At least 48 h after discussing the study, eligible care homes will be contacted by the researcher to confirm whether they would like to take part or not.</p>
                <p id="Par100">The second stage will be the recruitment of eligible residents in participating care homes.

The care home managers will be responsible for initially screening the residents to determine who meets the eligibility criteria. All staff involved in the recruitment of participants will be trained on the eligibility criteria prior to site activation. A short presentation about the study will be provided to potentially eligible residents and/or their Personal Consultees. Those interested in participating will be given a PIS and an ICF. The local study team will attend the care home at least 48 h after discussing the study so that potential participants can ask questions about the study and express their interest in taking part.

Face-to-face trial visits that need to be performed will only be undertaken where care homes have been COVID-free for at least 14 days. Care homes (on behalf of the staff and residents) and researchers will be required to complete a COVID-19 screening tool prior to face-to-face visits to ensure risk is minimised. Visits will then be booked. During the visit, researchers will wear a mask and ensure social distancing and handwashing/hand sanitisation are performed, in line with local rules and national regulations. Before conducting any trial visits at the care home, the researchers will provide their details and a declaration of their own COVID status (no symptoms or contact with known COVID cases for 14 days). The provision of the details of the researchers will enable ‘track and trace’ to be performed, should this be necessary. Due to the sensitive patient population, every precaution will be taken to minimise the risk of infection, with decontamination taking place prior to entering and leaving the resident and the care home.</p>

                  <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par137">Costs will be aggregated for the individual residents based on their consumption of resources under each heading and in total. Relevant costs will be differentiated between those required to ‘treat’ an individual and those required to set up the study. Total treatment costs will be related to outcomes in a series of cost-effectiveness ratios, for oral cleanliness, pain, oral and general health-related quality of life. As analyses are confined to 6 months in the base-case, no discount rate will be applied. In order to quantify the uncertainty associated with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), a stochastic analysis will be undertaken, with the results presented as a series of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). The CEACs will show the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared to usual care for a range of maximum monetary values that decision-makers may be willing to pay for the outcome concerned.</p>
                  <p id="Par138">Sensitivity analyses will explore variations in unit costs and in the value set used to estimate generic health-related quality of life using a series of deterministic analyses where ICERs will be recalculated. The analysis of costs will be used to identify key drivers of cost and the potential to reduce data collection in future studies. This information will be examined collectively, discussed and used as the basis for recommendations on future data collection and whether and/or which outcomes focus further cost-effectiveness analyses.</p>

It is the charity responsible for the Northern Ireland Pensioners Parliament. Age Sector Platform has a membership of individuals and older people’s groups across Northern Ireland, representing approximately 200,000 people. These networks will complement BELONG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and PARC-Bangor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], to ensure strong PPI representation. Informal dissemination networks will be made by these PPI groups, who will also link to the Patient and Client Council [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. This will ensure dissemination of information directly to dependent older people and their carers/relatives and care home managers/staff. Our PPI co-applicants will also ensure a strong patient-facing dissemination strategy. Patient-facing materials will be developed (and also produced in audio-format).</p>

              <p id="Par157">The health needs of the population are changing. Many older adults are now retaining their dentition for longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and this presents significant challenges to dental services. In many countries, the provision of dental services currently adopts a ‘one-size-fits-all’, where the dentist is the main caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. DCPs offer an alternative to using dentists to meet the future challenges in dental public health. DCPs have the potential to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of service provision, which ultimately can help to release resources to improve access to oral health care. The feasibility and effectiveness of using DCPs has been tested in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but little has been undertaken in a care home environment where dental service provision is often poor with little emphasis on prevention. Evidence on how best to successfully implement and sustain DCP interventions within the care home environments is warranted.</p>
              <p id="Par158">This protocol paper describes the design of a cluster RCT, based on a superiority design, that will be used to determine the effectiveness of using DCPs (DTs and DNs) in the care home environment. The study will help strengthen the evidence base regarding the use of DCPs as an alternative to dentists in the care home environment. Furthermore, the parallel process evaluation will provide valuable information on how the intervention could successfully be embedded in standard practice.</p>
