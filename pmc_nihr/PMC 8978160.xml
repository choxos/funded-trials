                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide and is a leading contributor to suicide. However, first-line antidepressants are only fully effective for 33%, and only 40% of those offered psychological treatment attend for two sessions or more. Views gained from patients and primary care professionals are that greater treatment uptake might be achieved if people with depression could be offered alternative and more accessible treatment options. Although there is evidence that the Alpha-Stim Anxiety Insomnia and Depression (AID) device is safe and effective for anxiety and depression symptoms in people with anxiety disorders, there is much less evidence of efficacy in major depression without anxiety. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Alpha-Stim AID device, a cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment that people can safely use independently at home. The device provides CES which has been shown to increase alpha oscillatory brain activity, associated with relaxation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID in treatment-seeking patients (aged 16 years upwards) with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms in primary care. The study is a multi-centre parallel-group, double-blind, non-commercial, randomised controlled superiority trial. The primary objective of the study is to examine the clinical efficacy of active daily use of 8 weeks of Alpha-Stim AID versus sham Alpha-Stim AID on depression symptoms at 16 weeks (8 weeks after the end of treatment) in people with moderate severity depression. The primary outcome is the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at 16 weeks. All trial and treatment procedures are carried out remotely using videoconferencing, telephone and postal delivery considering the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This study is investigating whether participants using the Alpha-Stim AID device display a reduction in depressive symptoms that can be maintained over 8 weeks post-treatment. The findings will help to determine whether Alpha-Stim AID should be recommended, including being made available in the NHS for patients with depressive symptoms.</p>

                  <title>Existing research: prevalence and treatment of depression</title>
                  <p id="Par14">Major depression is the second leading cause of years lost to disability in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. From 2007 to 2014, the United Kingdom National Household Survey showed an escalating demand for the treatment of depression and anxiety (1 in 6 adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Clinically effective, cost-effective and safe management of common mental illness, such as depression and anxiety, using a variety of approaches in integrated care systems is a priority for the NHS10 year long-term plan, as is addressing inequalities such as those associated with poverty and ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Almost a quarter of 17–19-year-old women meet the diagnostic criteria for an emotional disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), the rates of depression in the community have more than doubled; around one in five (21%) aged 16 years and over in Great Britain experienced some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms) in early 2021 (27 January to 7 March) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The rates were more than double those observed before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, when 10% of adults experienced some form of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The impact was felt more greatly in younger adults, women and people who live alone—with 43% of women aged between 16 and 29 reporting some form of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par15">Currently, the two main forms of treatment offered for depression by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom (UK) are antidepressant medications and psychological treatments. However, first-line use of antidepressants is only effective for 1 in 3 of those who try them, and over 1 year, approximately 66% remit. Furthermore, antidepressants are associated with a range of side effects, e.g. sedation, weight gain, cardiac arrhythmia and falls, suggesting that they may not be tolerated by some people, particularly those with physical ill health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Psychological treatments are as effective as antidepressants; however, only 40% of those offered psychological treatments attend for two sessions or more, and of those treated, 49% do not progress or recover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite a large increase in the prevalence of depression and evidence of increased mental health burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant reductions in contact with primary services in the UK for mental illness from April 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, subsequently, primary care mental health demands have risen since the early period of the pandemic, and there has been a rapid transition to virtual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par16">The current increase in depression rates, coupled with challenges in accessing existing psychological treatments, suggests a need for the availability of novel treatments for depression to be offered as part of routine NHS care. Our consultation with patient and public involvement and engagement (PPI/E) representatives and primary care practitioners indicated that novel treatment approaches that were effective, easily accessible and could be used at home with minimal supervision may increase treatment uptake without overburdening primary care services.</p>

                  <title>Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES)</title>
                  <p id="Par17">CES is an established form of non-invasive low alternating current neuromodulation treatment. It is related to other forms of transcranial electrical stimulation, including electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial direct current stimulation. CES was developed in Russia in 1900 and was first used to induce sleep and relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] by applying small electric currents to the head. Since the 1970s, CES has been used increasingly in clinical settings. In America, one of the most commonly used CES devices since the 1980s is Alpha-Stim (Electromedical Products International, Inc.). Alpha-Stim AID is the latest model of electrotherapy device for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and depression. Alpha-Stim AID was CE marked in 2012 as a class IIa medical device. It is a small mobile phone-sized device powered by two AAA batteries and is attached by leads to both earlobes. It delivers a patterned, subsensory (cannot be felt or detected), electrical waveform and has been associated with a reduction in delta (0–3.5 Hz) and beta (12.5–30 Hz) frequency brainstem and cortical electroencephalography (EEG) activity and an increase in alpha (8–12 Hz) activity (associated with states of relaxation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It can be used daily for 20–60 min. The device with a 5-year maintenance package retails at approximately £500 with a 5-year warranty. However, since depression is associated with social deprivation, the cost of the device is a significant barrier to its uptake for the treatment of depression with the majority of people with depression unable to afford the device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Evidence base for Alpha-Stim AID</title>
                  <p id="Par18">A systematic review carried out by the US Veterans Administration identified 5 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 198 participants for anxiety or mixed anxiety and depression disorders comparing CES to sham CES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The review concluded that there was low-quality evidence of the effectiveness of CES in relation to anxiety and depression symptoms. A previous study reported that Alpha-Stim AID significantly reduced depression from baseline to endpoint of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, in a trial of 115 participants with primary anxiety disorder, 5 weeks of active Alpha-Stim AID 100 was shown to be more effective than sham devices in reducing depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, researchers in England carried out an implementation study in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The findings indicated that, in 161 patients with moderate to severe generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) who had not responded to first-line psychological treatment, the mean PHQ-9 scores of self-rated depression dropped from 16.1 to 11.2 by week 4. Furthermore, the mean PHQ-9 scores dropped to 10.4 at week 6, and by week 12, PHQ-9 scores were at normal levels (8.9) indicating remission of symptoms at week 12, which was maintained to week 24. There was slippage in the mean score of depression by less than 1 point on the PHQ-9 at 24 weeks suggesting that a course of 8 weeks of using Alpha-Stim AID rather than 6 weeks CES may be optimal for the treatment of depression symptoms. There was similar moderate to large improvements in anxiety symptoms. Only four (2.5%) participants withdrew from treatment because of side effects. Compared to individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Alpha-Stim AID provided a cost saving of £540.88 per patient (95% confidence interval £327.12, £648.69). Cost modelling by the company suggests that the cost of Alpha-Stim AID could be as low as £40 in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, there are no trials of cost-effectiveness of Alpha-Stim AID for depression in primary care settings. Furthermore, there is a need for further sham-based RCTs, since the daily routine of using a device might in itself have benefits on depression since structuring the day is a technique used in some behaviour therapy treatments for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The device might therefore seem to be effective through an active placebo effect.</p>
                  <p id="Par19">The NHS in the UK and other health services require more evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness in a primary care setting, where similar devices are routinely used for other long-term ‘physical health’ conditions and where the majority of treatment for depression takes place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although the evidence base, tolerability, patient preference and ease of use are promising, a recent report by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] recommends that there is a need for a further randomised controlled trial of the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness in treatment-seeking patients with moderate depression in primary care. This research will investigate if offering Alpha-Stim AID to people with moderate depression in primary care can reduce depression, provide more evidence of tolerability and examine cost-effectiveness.</p>

                <p id="Par30">The study is a multicentre study based on primary care GP practices in three regions of England, the East Midlands and the Thames Valley and South Midlands. This may extend to additional sites in other regions in England. GP practices are primarily identified via the NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN). The study is promoted on their website, and GP surgeries expressing an interest are contacted. Practices include a range reflecting differing registered patient list size, patients of differing social and ethnic diversity and affluence or deprivation. The initial approach is from a member of the patients’ usual clinical care team in primary care during routine appointments (face-to-face, over the telephone or video consultation) or via a practice database search and mail out. Information about the trial is also displayed in relevant clinical areas. Participants may also directly contact the research team to be screened to participate in the study, but the appropriateness of their participation is checked with a clinician from their GP surgery to ensure they meet the eligibility criteria.

                  <p id="Par107">In developing this trial, we have consulted with a number of Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPI/E) representatives, and the intervention was co-designed through PPI/E input. PPI/E representatives have been integral in shaping the design of the study, supporting documents and the design of the recruitment strategy. They will continue to be involved throughout the study and in the interpretation and dissemination of findings. Involvement in this trial is supported and facilitated by PPI/E representatives Rebecca McNaughton, Debbie Butler and Fred Higton. The PPI/E representatives have provided input on all our patient-facing documents, including the PIS, and consent forms and have shared feedback on using the Alpha-Stim AID device. Refinements and alterations to documents were made based on their suggestions. PPI/E representatives have also reviewed our outcome measures to ensure acceptability. We collaborated with PPI/E representatives on the development of the instructional video which was produced in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and to reduce face-to-face contact. Our PPI/E panel will play a pivotal role in the dissemination of findings and will be involved in the interpretation of results. Their perspectives will form an essential part of all analysis; without their input, such analysis will be regarded as incomplete.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par108">Although the evidence base, tolerability, patient preference and ease of use are promising, there is a need for a further RCT of the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness in treatment-seeking patients with moderate depression in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Alpha-Stim AID is rarely used in NHS care in the UK, but it is used privately. Thus, there is a growing issue of inequity, as depression disproportionately affect the poorest in society, yet Alpha-Stim AID is primarily only available to people who can afford to purchase it but not to the majority of people who cannot afford it. During the early stages of project development, PPI/E representatives from NIHR MindTech MedTech Co-operative and a PPI/E representative from NIHR ARC East Midlands expressed that restricted options for interventions (antidepressants and psychological treatment as the only options) may deter people with depression from getting help. This is corroborated by previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. PPI/E representatives expressed that they would get the help they needed if there were accessible alternative safe, efficacious, cost-effective, easy to use NHS treatments.</p>
              <p id="Par109">The Alpha-Stim AID device has the potential to increase choice which in turn could mean improving access. Many people have negative thoughts of antidepressants and may also have negative experiences of psychotherapy. Therefore, they deny themselves treatment. Given the high volume of patients with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] but the high rate of spontaneous remission and responsiveness to first-line antidepressant treatments, we think the likely place for Alpha-Stim AID would be the primary care clinical pathway. It could be for patients with moderate to severe depression who have not responded to a first-line antidepressant given at a therapeutic dose for 6 weeks or more or those who have been offered an antidepressant but are unwilling to take it, or unable to tolerate it. Such patients are unlikely to remit, justifying the use of an alternative treatment approach such as Alpha-Stim AID should it prove clinically effective in this research. It could also be a more favourable treatment option for patients from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, who may not wish to or may be less readily able to access psychological therapy. Alpha-Stim AID is now starting to become established for the treatment of anxiety through direct sale to the public but it is also CE marked for direct sale to the public for depression with evidence only of effectiveness against depression symptoms in people with primary anxiety disorders. There is an urgent need to address depression in young people and adults because of the increased presentation of patients with depression in primary care, reflected in the rising use of antidepressants to 71 million prescriptions in 2018 in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the rising demand for talking therapies but also evidence of a rising demand for other effective alternatives. Alpha-Stim AID meets policy priorities for offering choice for the treatment of depression at a cost similar to antidepressants and at a lower cost than psychological treatment. However, most people who might benefit from this treatment cannot afford to pay for it. Hence, further research is required to explore its long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness for managing depression in NHS primary care.</p>
              <p id="Par110">Following on from a successful RCT conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic by our research team using remote assessment, consent, treatment delivery and follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], we had already planned to use these methods in addition to face-to-face contact before the onset of the pandemic which severely restricted face-to-face contact with patients for non-essential care, including a period of 6 months when the recruitment to this study was delayed. With minimal changes to our protocol (delivery of the device directly to the patient’s home and an instructional video rather than the GP practice providing delivery and instructions), we have been able to successfully deliver this trial despite a national lockdown on movement throughout most of the study period. Participants are now also familiar with videoconferencing in their private lives and as a means of consulting about their health. Therefore, when feasible and allowed by regulatory bodies, we will continue to use remote methods for many of our trials regardless of pandemic restrictions.</p>

              <p id="Par111">The trial is currently actively recruiting via GP surgeries. The first 150 participants were randomised to the trial as of 27 September 2021. Recruitment is due to end early 2022. The trial was registered on ISRTCN Registry (ISRCTN11853110 10.1186/ISRCTN11853110) in August 2020. If significant changes requiring the modification of this protocol are required, the changes will be submitted for approval to the HRA and REC.</p>
