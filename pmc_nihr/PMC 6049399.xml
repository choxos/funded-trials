                  <title>Purpose</title>
                  <p>Estimating risk of late distant recurrence (DR) is an important goal for managing women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer after 5 years of endocrine treatment without recurrence. We developed and validated a simple clinicopathologic tool (Clinical Treatment Score post–5 years [CTS5]) to estimate residual risk of DR after 5 years of endocrine treatment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods</title>
                  <p>The ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) data set (N = 4,735) was used to create a prognostic score for post–5-year risk of DR. Validity of CTS5 (ATAC) was tested in the BIG 1-98 data set (N = 6,711). Time to late DR, 5 years after finishing scheduled endocrine therapy, was the primary end point. Cox regression models estimated the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>CTS5 (ATAC) was significantly prognostic for late DR in the ATAC cohort (hazard ratio, 2.47; 95% CI, 2.24 to 2.73; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and BIG 1-98 validation cohort (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.88 to 2.28; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). CTS5 (ATAC) risk stratification defined in the training cohort as low (&lt; 5% DR risk, years 5 to 10), intermediate (5% to 10%), or high (&gt; 10%) identified 43% of the validation cohort as low risk, with an observed DR rate of 3.6% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.9%) during years 5 to 10. From years 5 to 10, 63% of node-negative patients were low risk, with a DR rate of 3.9% (95% CI, 2.9% to 5.3%), and 24% with one to three positive nodes were low risk, with a DR rate of 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5% to 3.8%). A final CTS5 for future use was derived from pooled data from ATAC and BIG 1-98.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>CTS5 is a simple tool based on information that is readily available to all clinicians. CTS5 was validated as highly prognostic for late DR in the independent BIG 1-98 study. The final CTS5 algorithm identified 42% of women with &lt; 1% per-year risk of DR who could be advised of the limited potential value of extended endocrine therapy.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Women with estrogen receptor (ER) –positive primary breast cancer are generally offered adjuvant endocrine therapy for 5 years. More than 50% of recurrences occur after that time, and several studies have indicated that extending treatment beyond 5 years can improve disease outcome.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, this improvement is relatively modest, and extended therapy carries a risk of adverse effects. Few tools have been developed for selecting patients as candidates for extended endocrine therapy or alternatively identifying those who might be spared such therapy. One approach is to identify patients whose risk after 5 years is so low that any benefit would be outweighed by potential adverse effects.</p>
              <p>Clinicopathologic parameters such as tumor size, nodal status, and histopathologic grade are routinely used to estimate risk of breast cancer recurrence at diagnosis; we previously reported a clinical treatment score that integrates these factors to estimate prognosis.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Some of these factors have been reported to be associated with risk after 5 years; for example, we found nodal status was a powerful prognostic marker for late recurrence,<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> whereas tumor size and particularly grade were less prognostic after 5 years. Recently, an overview analysis of &gt; 60,000 women with ER-positive disease, who were scheduled to receive 5 years of endocrine therapy and remained disease free at 5 years, reported the subsequent risk of distant recurrence.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Even in patients with T1N0 disease, the estimated risk of distant recurrence between years 5 and 20 was 10% for those with low, 13% for those with intermediate, and 17% for those with high histologic grades, respectively. Although these data unequivocally demonstrate the importance of these clinicopathologic factors, they include studies from 40 years ago, possibly limiting their relevance for contemporary patients with breast cancer. The data were presented largely as categories (eg, T1, T2), limiting precise estimates of risk for individual patients. Lastly, the largely tamoxifen-treated population did not allow assessment of possible differences between tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) with regard to long-term risk.</p>
              <p>We aimed to develop and test the validity of a simple prognostic tool to estimate risk of late distant recurrence (Clinical Treatment Score post–5 years [CTS5]) on the basis of clinicopathologic parameters measured in virtually all patients with breast cancer at diagnosis. We used data from the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> as the training set and from the BIG (Breast International Group) 1-98 trial as the testing set.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>

                <title>Study Populations</title>
                <p>CTS5 (ATAC) was trained using data from the ATAC trial (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial identifier ISRCTN18233230), in which postmenopausal women with ER-positive or ER-unknown early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole 1 mg per day, tamoxifen 20 mg per day, or a combination for 5 years.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The combination arm was discontinued after the first report of trial results.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> We included data from women with ER-positive breast cancer randomly assigned to receive anastrozole alone or tamoxifen alone, who were distant recurrence free after 5 years of follow-up and for whom all clinicopathologic data were available (N = 4,735; Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Fig A1</xref>, online only). Median follow-up was 9.8 years. Data from BIG 1-98 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT00004205) was used to validate CTS5 (ATAC). BIG 1-98 initially (1998 to 2000) randomly assigned postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive early-stage breast cancer to receive 5 years of letrozole 2.5 mg per day or tamoxifen 20 mg per day. Later (1999 to 2003), sequential therapy was also randomly assigned (2 years of letrozole followed by 3 years of tamoxifen or opposite sequence).<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Median follow-up was 8.1 years. For this analysis, all women were included who were distant recurrence free at 5 years and for whom all clinicopathologic data were available (N = 6,711; Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Fig A1</xref>). For both trials, women were included in the analysis regardless of whether they received chemotherapy.</p>
                <p>Prognostic value of the following variables for post–5-year (late) distant recurrence was determined by univariable Cox regression analyses: nodes, tumor size (in millimeters), grade (1, 2, or 3), age at start of endocrine therapy (years), and type of assigned endocrine treatment. Type of endocrine treatment was not significant for late distant recurrence in univariable analyses and not included in the final model. The log hazard was almost linear for five nodal status groups (negative, one positive, two to three positive, four to nine positive, and &gt; nine positive) but not for continuous tumor size alone. Therefore, a negative quadratic term was introduced, and tumor size was capped at 30 mm, where risk plateaued. The final CTS5 (ATAC) model included age (continuous), tumor size (continuous), quadratic tumor size, nodal status (five groups: 0, negative; 1, one positive; 2, two to three positive; 3, four to nine positive; and 4, &gt; nine positive), and grade (three groups: 1, low; 2, intermediate; and 3, high) and is given by:</p>
                <p>CTS5 (ATAC) = 0.471 × nodes + 0.980 × (0.164 × size − 0.003 × size<sup>2</sup> + 0.312 × grade + 0.03 × age)</p>
                <p>A shrinkage factor of 0.980 for the nonnodal part of the score was calculated using a nested Cox model<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and applied to allow for the small amount of overfitting. Separate models developed for patients receiving chemotherapy or not did not perform significantly better for either group than a single model including all patients (data not shown).</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>Analyses were performed according to a prespecified analysis plan, approved by both trial groups, and are summarized here. Full details are provided in the Appendix (online only). The primary end point was time to distant recurrence, defined as metastatic disease, excluding contralateral disease, and locoregional and ipsilateral recurrences. The end point was censored at last follow-up visit or death before distant recurrence such that risk is a pure risk calculation ignoring deaths.</p>
                <p>Cox proportional hazards models were used to create the model in ATAC, and the CTS5 (ATAC) score was tested in BIG 1-98. Likelihood ratio statistics (LR-χ<sup>2</sup>) and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates with corresponding 95% CIs were used to determine the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC) in BIG 1-98. The 5- to 10-year distant recurrence risk groups were determined in ATAC and defined as: low risk, &lt; 5%; intermediate risk, 5% to 10%; and high risk, &gt; 10%. To compare the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC) between ATAC and BIG 1-98 trials, CTS5 (ATAC) was normalized to have unit variance, and hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs were estimated from Cox models. All statistical analyses were two sided, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant. We compared the newly developed CTS5 (ATAC) with the published CTS (termed CTS0 here) developed for estimating prognosis from the time of disease presentation.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> All analyses were performed with STATA software (version 13.1; College Station, TX).</p>

              <p>The ATAC training set and the BIG 1-98 test set consisted of 4,735 and 6,711 postmenopausal patients, respectively, assigned to receive 5 years of endocrine therapy (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Women in the ATAC cohort were significantly older by an average of approximately 3 years and had more node-negative disease (68% <italic>v</italic> 61%) and more grade 3 tumors (25% <italic>v</italic> 20%), and fewer women received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with women in the BIG 1-98 set (19.5% <italic>v</italic> 24.2%). Tumor size was similar between the two trials. In the training set, 330 (7.0%) late distant recurrences were recorded, with an annual hazard rate of 0.79% (95% CI, 0.71% to 0.88%). In BIG 1-98, a total of 370 (5.5%) late distant recurrences occurred, with an annual hazard rate of 0.66% (95% CI, 0.60% to 0.73%), which was significantly lower than in ATAC (<italic>P</italic> = .014; <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>CTS5 (ATAC) performed non-significantly better in the validation BIG 1-98 cohort than CTS0 (CTS5 [ATAC]: HR 2.07; 95% CI, 1.88 to 2.28; LR-χ<sup>2</sup> = 212.1 [1 <italic>df</italic>] <italic>v</italic> CTS0: HR 1.84; 95% CI, 1.70 to 1.98; LR-χ<sup>2</sup> = 214.9 [1 <italic>df</italic>]). CTS5 (ATAC) was significantly prognostic in women who did not receive chemotherapy (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.96 to 2.47; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; LR-χ<sup>2</sup> = 168.7 [1 <italic>df</italic>]) and more so when compared with those who did (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.46 to 2.13; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; LR-χ<sup>2</sup> = 34.7 [1 <italic>df</italic>]; Appendix <xref rid="TA.1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>), but the interaction with chemotherapy was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .06).</p>
                <p>The number of observed distant recurrences was compared with those expected by CTS5 (ATAC) in deciles of risk for node-negative and node-positive patients, separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 3A and 3B</xref>). There was a significant difference between the observed and expected numbers for just one of the deciles (9<sup>th</sup> decile for node-positive). The correlation (<italic>r</italic>) between the observed and expected numbers across the deciles was 0.88 for node-negative and 0.94 for node-positive groups. Using CTS0, a number of deciles showed significant χ<sup>2</sup> values (Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.2">Fig A2</xref>, online only), and the <italic>r</italic> values were also lower, at 0.78 and 0.87, respectively. Concordance between the estimated and actual distant recurrence rates was also shown to be better with CTS5 using the Goran-Heller C-index (CTS5 [ATAC], 0.678; CTS0, 0.656).</p>

                <p>We used predefined cutoff points of 4.35 and 5.02 from ATAC to determine risk groups for late distant recurrence in BIG 1-98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1A and 1B</xref>). These cut points intersected the risk curves for BIG 1-98 at 5.4% and 9.9% for node-negative patients and 5.5% and 9.5% for node-positive patients, respectively, and therefore were strongly validated by this test set. The distribution of patients in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was also similar in the BIG 1-98 data set to that observed in the training set (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The mean 5- to 10-year distant recurrence risk of patients in BIG 1-98 in those three categories was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.7% to 4.9%), 6.9% (95% CI, 5.6% to 8.5%), and 17.3% (95% CI, 14.8% to 20.1%), respectively (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Thus, for each category, the actual mean risk for each category fitted well with that of the predicted risk. The curves for node-negative and node-positive women were almost identical in the CTS5 (ATAC) regions of overlap in BIG 1-98.</p>
                <p>Significant separation between low- versus intermediate-risk groups (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.98) and low- versus high-risk groups (HR, 5.33; 95% CI, 4.02 to 7.07) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). Notably, only four of 304 patients with one to three positive nodes and categorized as low risk had a recurrence between years 5 and 10. As with the ATAC data set, in BIG 1-98, virtually all patients with ≥ four positive nodes were categorized as high risk (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The distribution of patients in the risk categories across histologic grades and nodal categories was similar between ATAC and BIG 1-98. Again, approximately one fifth of patients with two or three positive nodes had risk categorized as low or intermediate, but a somewhat smaller proportion of patients with one positive node were categorize as high risk (29.7% <italic>v</italic> 42.9%). In BIG 1-98, 62.5% of node-negative patients were categorized as low risk, compared with 57.7% in ATAC.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Over the last three decades, there have been major increases in invasive breast cancer incidence in Western countries; in the United States, it was estimated that &gt; 250,000 women would be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2017,<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> with a large majority of cases localized to the breast. Approximately 80% of patients are now diagnosed as ER positive, and almost all of these are prescribed 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. Although such treatment markedly reduces mortality (eg, by approximately 30% with 5 years of tamoxifen and approximately 40% with an AI in postmenopausal women), recurrences continue to occur after the 5-years treatment ends. The observation that these events can be decreased by continued treatment<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> means that decisions about whether to continue with therapy at 5 years are at the forefront of patient management at that time. We expect that the CTS5 tool reported and validated here will prove helpful to oncologists and patients in making a decision about continued treatment. The integration of clinical pathologic features that are measured in all patients at diagnosis should mean that risk is calculable at little expense globally; the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> will allow a direct readout, and an online tool will be provided to facilitate estimates of continuous risk.</p>
              <p>Strengths of the study include its use of two large sets of registration-standard randomized clinical trial data with detailed clinical follow-up for 10 years. The ATAC training set included the AI anastrozole as well as tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment, and although the specific endocrine adjuvant therapy did not feature in the algorithm, this allowed us to infer that the score would be valid for both tamoxifen- and AI-treated patients. This is consistent with the overview analysis of AIs versus tamoxifen.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Median 5-year follow-up for the two trials combined occurred approximately 12 years ago. Therefore, it is possible that our risk estimates may not accurately reflect those of current patients reaching 5 years. However, the only major change to the management of primary ER-positive breast cancer since the completion of recruitment to ATAC and BIG 1-98 has been the introduction of trastuzumab for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive disease. CTS5 should be applied with caution in such patients until validated specifically for that population. All patients in the two cohorts were postmenopausal at diagnosis. Although risk of distant recurrence post–5 years has been reported to be similar across age groups, other than for the small group of patients diagnosed at age &lt; 35 years,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> the present algorithm cannot be extended to premenopausal patients without further validation.</p>
              <p>Neither trial collected complete information on the use of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, the first significant data supporting the use of an AI after tamoxifen<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> emerged close to the end of the treatment period for the trials, and we estimate that &lt; 1% of tamoxifen-treated patients in ATAC and &lt; 5% in BIG 1-98 received such extended therapy. This would be expected to have minimal impact on our estimates of risk when extended therapy is not used.</p>
              <p>Also similar to the report by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group, we found that whether patients had received chemotherapy at presentation had no significant impact on residual risk of recurrence when taking the other factors into account. This may relate in part to the observation that the bulk of the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy is shown over the first 5 years of follow-up.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The categories of low, intermediate, and high risk were chosen to closely parallel those defined by several molecular profiling tools for managing patients with ER-positive breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, those tools are applied immediately after surgery, largely in making the decision of whether to administer adjuvant chemotherapy; what is considered low or high risk in that setting may not be the same when considering the appropriateness of extended adjuvant therapy. In discussions with individual patients whose preferences for continuing or ceasing endocrine therapy at 5 years are likely to vary markedly, the use of a continuous risk estimate from CTS5 is likely to be more informative than the categorical estimates (ie, low, intermediate, and high) used here for illustrative and comparative purposes.</p>
              <p>The agreement between the ATAC and BIG1-98 data was almost complete within the low- and intermediate-risk categories but somewhat less beyond the intermediate/high cutoff. Thus, the instrument may be used with greatest confidence in defining 5- to 10-year distant recurrence risk when &lt; 10% and will be of greatest use in assessing the potential value of extended therapy on the basis of risk estimates below that level.</p>
              <p>Our report deals only with clinicopathologic profiles. Multigene expression profiles have significantly increased the ability to predict distant recurrence over 10 years after diagnosis in ER-positive breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Several of these signatures, such as the Oncotype Dx recurrence score,<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> PAM50-based Prosigna risk of recurrence score,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Breast Cancer Index,<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> EndoPredict test,<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and Netherlands Cancer Institute 70-gene signature,<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> are commercially available and endorsed by several guidelines.<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Although a number of them estimate risk of late as well as early recurrence, these tests were developed to manage patients with breast cancer at diagnosis and have not been calibrated for application 5 years after diagnosis. Over the first 10 years of follow-up, clinicopathologic and molecular factors have nearly completely independent prognostic value, and their optimal use for prognosis requires their integration.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> It is near certain that the same is true for the 5- to 10-year period. CTS5 provides a straightforward starting point for combining with molecular scores.</p>

                <p>The primary end point was time to distant recurrence (DR). DR was defined as metastatic disease, excluding contralateral disease, and locoregional and ipsilateral recurrences. The end point was censored at last follow-up visit or death before DR such that risk is a pure risk calculation ignoring deaths.</p>
                <p>Cox proportional hazards models were used to create the model in ATAC (Arimidex Tamoxifen Alone or Combination), and the Clinical Treatment Score post–5 years (CTS5; ATAC) was tested in BIG (Breast International Group) 1-98. A shrinkage factor of 0.980 for the nonnodal part of the CTS5 (ATAC) score had been calculated during its derivation using a nested Cox model<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>and applied to allow for the small amount of overfitting. We estimated the shrinkage factor with the following equation:</p>
                <p>γ = ([model χ<sup>2</sup> − <italic>df</italic>]/model χ<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>where model χ<sup>2</sup> is the likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> statistic for testing all predictors, and <italic>df</italic> is degree of freedom.</p>
                <p>To define the relation between CTS5 and 5- to 10-year DR risk, the logarithm of the baseline cumulative hazard function was fitted. Baseline risk at 5 years was calculated using the stcox/basesurv command in STATA (College Station, TX) to implement the Breslow method. Five- to 10-year DR risk was then calculated for each participant by adjusting the baseline risk: </p>
                <p>risk(5-10 years) = 1 − ([baseline risk]<sup>linear prediction CTS5</sup>)</p>
                <p>Proportional assumptions were verified using Schoenfeld residuals.</p>
                <p>Likelihood ratio χ<sup>2</sup> statistics and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates with corresponding 95% CIs (calculated from the standard error of the cumulative hazards on the basis of a normal approximation) were used to determine the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC) in BIG 1-98. The risk of DR of events for individual patients in BIG 1-98 was estimated using CTS5 or the published Clinical Treatment Score (CTS0) and the expected risk compared with the observed events in deciles of expected risk. The observed and expected numbers were compared by the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Overall agreement was assessed by calculating the correlation coefficient across the deciles. Concordance between expected and actual outcomes was also calculated by computing the Goran-Heller C-index.</p>
                <p>The 5- to 10-year DR risk groups were determined in ATAC and defined as: low-risk group, &lt; 5%; intermediate-risk group, 5%-10%; and high-risk group, &gt; 10%. To compare the prognostic performance of CTS5 (ATAC) between ATAC and BIG 1-98 trials, CTS5 (ATAC) was normalized to have unit variance, and the hazard ratios and associated 95% CIs were estimated from Cox models. All statistical analyses were two sided, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant. We also compared the newly developed CTS5 (ATAC) with CTS0, which was developed for estimating prognosis from the time of disease presentation<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> to determine whether an improved prognostication for late DR had been achieved. All analyses were performed with STATA software (version 13.1).</p>
