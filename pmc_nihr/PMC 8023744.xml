                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The prevalence of at-risk drinking is far higher among those in contact with the criminal justice system (73%) than the general population (35%). However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) in reducing risky drinking among those in the criminal justice system, including the prison system and, in particular, those on remand. Building on earlier work, A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE) is a pilot study designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an ABI, delivered to male prisoners on remand. The findings of APPRAISE should provide the information required to design a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>APPRAISE will use mixed methods, with two linked phases, across two prisons in the UK, recruiting 180 adult men on remand: 90 from Scotland and 90 from England. Phase I will involve a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomised pilot study. The pilot evaluation will provide data on the likely impact of A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE), which will be used to inform a future definitive multicentre RCT. Phase II will be a process evaluation assessing how the ABI has been implemented to explore the change mechanisms underpinning the ABI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) and to assess the context within which the ABI is delivered.</p>

                <title>Background/Rationale</title>
                <p>The prevalence of at-risk drinking, which is defined as drinking at levels that harm a person’s health, is far higher among those within the criminal justice system (73%)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref> than the general population (35%).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In the United Kingdom (UK), between 51% and 83% of incarcerated people are classified as risky drinkers,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and for those on remand in prison, the prevalence is between 62% and 68%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, alcohol dependence among those incarcerated (43%) is 10 times higher than the general population.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The impacts of risky drinking are significant, resulting in significant health, economic and social burden on individuals, families and society as a whole.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Addressing alcohol harm in prisons, at what can be considered a ‘teachable moment’, could reduce the risk of reoffending, reduce costs to society and help address health inequalities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>There is currently robust evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, indicating that alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) are effective in reducing alcohol consumption among at-risk drinkers in healthcare settings.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> However, there is little evidence of the effectiveness of ABIs in reducing risky drinking among those incarcerated, particularly those on remand,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> despite there being evidence in the UK that ABIs can reduce recidivism.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
                <p>In addition, ABIs have been shown to reduce recidivism within the probation setting.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Our systematic review of the efficacy of psychosocial alcohol interventions for incarcerated people<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> found that interventions within prison have the potential to impact alcohol use positively; however, because of small numbers and different outcome measures, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis or generalise findings. Notably, none of the studies focused on men on remand, with remand referring to individuals who are unconvicted or convicted and unsentenced, held in custody awaiting trial and/or sentencing. The intervention in this proposed study builds on previous research exploring the theoretical validity of a self-efficacy enhancing ABI.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> This intervention was initially tested within a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), in a general hospital setting, and provided evidence of a potential effect.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
                <p>In the recently completed Alcohol Brief Interventions (ABIs) for male remand prisoners: an Medical Research Council (MRC) complex intervention framework development and feasibility study (PRISM-A), an ABI was developed and refined within the prison setting, working with men on remand to include a synthesis of their views, with reviews of the evidence base and theoretical underpinnings.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> The findings also showed a high prevalence of at-risk drinking, with 82% of participants scoring ≥8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Test (AUDIT).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This is comparable with other findings in the prison system in the UK<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref> but is more than three times higher than primary care settings.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The study results indicated high levels of willingness of both staff and participants to engage with the intervention. Also, support was shown for an extended intervention, which helped men on remand to develop skills and strategies that would be useful for liberation. The feedback regarding frequency and intensity of contact identified a preference for more than one session, including additional community-based sessions, to allow participants to put their skills into practice when alcohol is more widely available. Based on learning from interviews within the PRISM-A study, the intervention for the APPRAISE pilot study includes three post-release booster sessions.</p>
                <p>However, there is limited evidence around the optimum timing of delivery, recommended length, content, implementation and economic benefit of an ABI in the prison setting. Furthermore, there are weaknesses within the current evidence base, with interventions not having theoretical underpinnings.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 18</xref> This risks an intervention being used with a weak theoretical base, poorly specified ‘active’ ingredients and less likely to deliver the desired outcomes.</p>
                <p>Following on from the positive results from the PRISM-A study, the MRC framework suggests the next step is to conduct a pilot study.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, the APPRAISE pilot trial has been proposed to strengthen the evidence around ABIs targeted at male remand prisoners. It will seek to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the ABI, in comparison to usual care, and it will explore the potential effectiveness of the key parameters. It will also aim to provide the information required to be able to design a definitive RCT.</p>

                <p>A total of 180 adult men (18 years and over) on remand will be recruited from two sites: one within the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) (n=90); and the second from Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service (HMPS) in England (n=90). These sites were purposively selected following PRISM-A, as they offer geographical, socioeconomic and ethnic diversity, along with differing procedures and structures.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Both prisons provide alcohol services via external agencies who engage with people in custody and following release. Prisons have varying induction procedures, communication mechanisms and processes, and available, secure space to engage participants. Understanding the different approaches and dynamics will be important when designing a future RCT.</p>
                <p>The target population is men on remand in prison, who have been in prison for 3 months or less. The average time on remand is approximately 9 weeks in England<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and 4 weeks in Scotland.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We estimate that approximately 50% of participants will be released, while the rest will remain incarcerated; leaving 45 participants per study arm (90 in total) across the two sites.</p>

                <title>Informed consent</title>
                <p>All participants will be required to provide informed consent before taking part; their decision will be entirely voluntary and based on a clear understanding of what is involved. To ensure this, all participants will receive a verbal explanation of the study, in addition to a PIS. The verbal explanation will be given by the researcher and will cover all elements in the PIS and the consent form. Each willing participant will sign a consent form to ensure that informed consent has been obtained. Each participant will receive a copy of the form, and a copy will be filed in the Investigator Site File (ISF). All participants will be given sufficient time to consider the information provided, ask questions and clarify anything they do not understand. Participants will be reassured that they can withdraw their consent at any time, without loss of benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled.</p>

                <title>The APPRAISE intervention</title>
                <p>The ABI has four sessions to be offered to all participants in the intervention arm. It will be delivered by existing staff at the voluntary sector organisation (VSO) who are currently engaged in alcohol service delivery in the prison and community setting. The ABI comprises nine elements (see <xref rid="T1 T2" ref-type="table">tables 1 and 2</xref>) and will be delivered in four steps: Step 1 is 1×40 min, face-to-face session, covering nine elements, delivered by a trained (VSO) staff member within the prison. Steps 2, 3 and 4 are 20-minute sessions, by phone, on or as close to day 3, 7 and 21 post-liberation. Exact days will be recorded to inform the process evaluation. The post-liberation sessions will include elements 1 (preliminary discussion), 5 (situation-appraisal), 6 (goal setting), 7 (relapse), 8 (self-evaluation/self-reinforcement) and 9 (culmination).</p>

These parameters will inform the power calculations for a future RCT and confirm or identify the need for modifications in relation to other aspects of the trial design, particularly the acceptability of study processes and outcome measures to participants and staff. Data about the flow of participants through the APPRAISE pilot trial will include numbers screened, the prevalence of the target condition, numbers providing contact details, numbers eligible and willing to consent and numbers followed up successfully at TP1 and TP2. In addition, data completeness for each of the instruments and any potential bias in the follow-up data will be ascertained.</p>

A complete case analysis will be used, but a sensitivity analysis will also be incorporated to explore the effects of missing data. This will involve using multiple imputations for the primary outcome in a supplementary analysis, provided that the valid sample size is sufficient to support this. In addition, we will add and subtract one-unit difference (alcohol units) to the missing data as part of a sensitivity analysis to explore how the 95% CIs change depending on our assumptions about the missing data (bearing in mind that the imputed data cannot be less than zero). This is similar to the sensitivity analysis method suggested in White <italic>et al</italic> (2011) which involves determining how large an amount can ‘<italic>be added to or subtracted from the imputed data without changing the clinical interpretation of the trial’</italic>.

                <title>Data management</title>
                <p>Data from both study sites will be anonymised, and individuals’ data will only be identifiable by their unique screening number. All of the hard copy data from the England site will be sent to the coordinating site, The University of Edinburgh, by secure courier, where all of the data will then be stored in a locked filing cabinet, with restricted access. Personal or sensitive data will be transported separately between sites securely, using password-protected files. No personal data will be transferred outside the UK, or stored or collected on computer servers outside the UK.</p>
                <p>Audio files will be uploaded securely to a password-protected site by the researchers, where the approved transcription company will be able to access the files. Transcribed files will be returned to the researchers using the same secure platform and downloaded and stored securely in folders on the University of Edinburgh’s password-protected server. Following a quality check to ensure the transcribed files’ accuracy, all audio recordings will be securely destroyed.</p>

                <title>Confidentiality and data protection</title>
                <p>All study staff will comply with the requirements of the appropriate data protection legislation (including the General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act) concerning the collection, storage, processing and disclosure of personal information. All evaluation forms, reports and other records will maintain participant confidentiality and only be identifiable via a unique participant identification number. All written records will be kept in a secure storage, and computers used to collate the data will be password protected. Published results will not contain any personal data to ensure that individuals cannot be identified. Personal data will be stored for 24 months after the study completion, and following this will be securely destroyed.</p>

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p>Ethical approval has been obtained from the East of Scotland NHS Research Ethics Committee, the Scottish Prisons Service Research Ethics Committee, Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service and the University of Edinburgh School of Health in Social Science Research Ethics Committee.</p>
                <p>Due to the high-risk population group, study staff will document any occasions where a session has had to be stopped due to participant distress or where the session is terminated because the researcher or prison staff identify a risk to the researcher. This information will be communicated to the chair of the TSC within a week of it occurring. In Scotland, it will be possible to identify and document whether participants are put on a suicide risk management strategy while they are in prison. This will be monitored and any participant put onto this strategy within a week of being in contact with study staff will be flagged and reported to the chair within 24 hours.</p>

                <title>Dissemination</title>
                <p>Our dissemination plan will include local, national and international avenues. The findings will be prepared for publication via open access, peer-reviewed journal articles. Also, the APPRAISE pilot trial findings and any plans for a future RCT will be presented to Health and Justice Teams at Scottish Government and Public Health England, the National Prisoner Healthcare Network (Scotland) and the WHO (Health in Prisons Programme Collaborating Centre). We will ensure participants can engage with research findings through infographics and will feedback to the participating sites. Other dissemination opportunities include presentations at meetings, workshops, national and international conferences, or at relevant organisations and events, such as Scottish Alcohol Research Network, Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems and Offender Health Research Network.</p>
