                <p id="Par1">The care home staff influenza vaccination rate in England is significantly lower than the 75% World Health Organisation recommendation. This represents a substantial potential for resident harm. Barriers to staff vaccination stem from individual and organisational levels. Existing interventions address some but not all barriers and are not underpinned by behavioural science theory. This study aims to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a theory-informed intervention to improve care home staff vaccination rates compared to routine practice.</p>
                <p id="Par2">Set in care homes with both nursing and residential focus, and a range of ownership status, only homes providing long stay care to older people with a staff vaccination rate below 40% are eligible to participate. Participation expressions of interest will be sought using a variety of approaches prior to seeking consent.</p>
                <p id="Par3">The primary outcome measure is the proportion of staff vaccinated at 6 months, with secondary outcome measures being proportion vaccinated at 3 months, numbers of staff sick days, general practitioner and nurse visits to care home, care home resident hospitalisations and mortality.</p>
                <p id="Par4">Based on the assumptions that the mean cluster (care home) size is 54 staff, a coefficient of variation of 0.48, control vaccination rate is 55%, intervention 75%, intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.2 and with 90% power, and 20% attrition, we require 39 care homes per arm.</p>
                <p id="Par5">Blocked randomisation will be at the level of care home, stratified by the proportion of non-white care home staff, and implemented by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit.</p>
                <p id="Par6">The intervention comprises co-designed information videos and posters, provision of in-house staff vaccination clinics, and incentive scheme and monthly data collection on trial outcomes. Beyond usual practice, the control arm will additionally contribute monthly data.</p>
                <p id="Par7">Data will be collected at the start, monthly and at 6 months, and analysis will be blind to allocation. Statistical analysis will use the intention-to-treat principle with the difference in vaccination rates between groups compared using a random effect logistic regression model at the staff-level.</p>
                <p id="Par8">This will be the first study to use a theory-informed intervention designed to comprehensively address identified barriers to care home staff influenza vaccination.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par18">In 2020/2021, care home staff flu vaccination levels were reported at 30% in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This was against a backdrop of the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommending at least 75% of health and social care staff are vaccinated against influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There is a direct relationship between resident health outcomes and staff influenza vaccination rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with evidence that both staff health and resident care are improved given higher staff vaccination rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is therefore an urgent need for an intervention to improve influenza vaccination rates in care home staff.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The WHO’s 3Cs model of vaccine hesitancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] identifies the main barriers of vaccine uptake as convenience, complacency and confidence. Providing vaccination in-house for care home staff directly addresses barriers of convenience and is considered one of the most effective methods for enhancing uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A recent UK-based study reported a 30% increase in vaccination rate for care home staff, from 10 to 40%, through the provision of in-house clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, whilst confirming the potential benefit of a convenience-based approach to vaccine hesitancy, this study suggests that providing in-house clinics in isolation is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the WHO target of 75% of staff vaccinated.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Between 23 and 67% of care home staff perceive no need for the vaccine as they are healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] (Complacency), and 34 to 60% of care home staff believe that vaccines are either ineffective or cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] (Confidence). The negative influence of peers is well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and is also understood to be a barrier to vaccine uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Consequently, most interventions targeting staff flu vaccine uptake include an information provision component to address barriers of complacency and confidence. Again, whilst information alone is rarely effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], if tailored to address the identified barriers, the effectiveness of the intervention can be enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par21">Despite the recognition that multi-component interventions are needed to increase vaccine uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the recommended use of behavioural science theory to develop them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. To address individual-level barriers, it is therefore necessary to provide access to vaccines in a convenient manner and address individual complacency and confidence regarding vaccination use through the provision of appropriately tailored information.</p>
              <p id="Par22">We therefore developed our intervention by first mapping the known individual-level barriers to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which is a synthesis of several behavioural science theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Using an evidence-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], we identified 31 potentially appropriate behaviour change techniques (BCTs), the active ingredients of interventions, which could potentially form part of the final intervention. A Nominal Group Technique stakeholder consensus group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] of care home staff and organisational representatives selected those BCTs which met the APEASE criteria (affordable, practicality, effectiveness, acceptability, side-effects, equity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and described how they could be operationalised in practice. This formed the basis of our intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par23">In addition to addressing individual-level barriers, it is widely recognised that for staff to undertake a behaviour, they must feel it aligns with the priorities of their organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Employer encouragement is a known enabler of staff vaccination uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Although there is government-issued guidance for employers, a lack of employer encouragement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and direct institutional involvement means that implementation of this guidance is variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Evidence suggests that incentivisation, performance monitoring and feedback are effective at facilitating managerial support for staff vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Whilst financial inducements are frequently used in the UK to improve the quality of healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], there is no evidence reporting their effectiveness in care homes to encourage staff vaccination.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Addressing both individual and organisational barriers to staff vaccination, the final model for our intervention is described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. No trials registered on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] exhibit significant overlap with the proposed intervention.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Proposed intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6925_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par25">When considering interventions to enhance care home staff vaccination rates, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England found no cost-effectiveness studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Consequently, any trial of a complex intervention to enhance care home staff vaccination rates should additionally include this element. In line with national guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], feasibility tested the intervention and trial design before finalising our definitive trial protocol.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Our aim therefore is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention operationalised at both individual and organisational levels to improve care home staff vaccination rates. The overall objectives of this study are to estimate the effect of the intervention on staff vaccination rates (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes identified in the logic model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and explore the economic impact of the intervention (e.g. cost per vaccination percentage point increase).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Logic model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2022_6925_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
              <p id="Par27">Based on our feasibility trial, we propose a two-arm parallel group trial design with a usual care plus monthly data collection control arm. Such a control arm was found to improve data quality without introducing reactivity bias (relatively to other potential control arms) in our feasibility trial.</p>

This would also provide 80% power to detect the same difference in the caregiving (non-caregiving) staff subgroup, assumed 40 per care home (14 per care home). We recruit an additional 8 homes per arm to allow for 20% attrition making the final intended sample size of 78 homes in total. The effect of COVID on the control vaccination rate is uncertain. Our sample size also provides over 90% power to detect a difference between a control rate of 40% and intervention rate of 60%. This would still represent a 50% relative increase in vaccination rates than these homes have achieved historically.</p>
                <p id="Par91">An assumed mean number of 54 staff members is used in the sample size, although it is possible that true number will be larger than this. However, the sample size is relatively unchanged by this and does not reduce to less than 90% until the number of staff members reaches 49. In addition, as the study allows for 20% drop-out of care homes the number of staff members can be reduced even further if the drop-out rate is lower.</p>

If staff data are missing, then the results’ sensitivity will be assessed by imputation with two strategies: missing data will be assumed to be not vaccinated; multiple imputation will be attempted using iteratively chained equations. Given the amount of data to base the imputation model on, the primary analysis will remain the observed data analysis. Secondary outcomes will also be compared using random effect models. Assumptions will be checked and if violated then either a nonparametric bootstrap or cluster-summary approach will be used. The analysis will consider firstly, all staff; then all care-giving and non-care-giving staff groups separately. A subgroup analysis will investigate if there is a differential effect in the ethnic minorities staff group. We shall also examine for subgroup effect from selected characteristics of the care home using SPQ responses. Full details will be agreed and documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) before the final analysis. Where there is a discrepancy between the SAP and protocol, the SAP will have priority.</p>

                  <p id="Par105">We will conduct a within-trial cost-consequences analysis (CCA) comparing costs and outcomes between trial arms across different perspectives/stakeholders (e.g. care homes, NHS and staff). CCA is a standard evaluation approach recognised as being particularly useful for evaluating interventions that have impacts on multiple domains of outcome and perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par106">We will determine the resources involved in, and associated costs of, delivering the FluCare intervention. Resources required for intervention delivery are expected to consist primarily of clinician time to deliver the FluCare clinics and the vaccinations. Information on these and other resources will be collected from clinic logs, process evaluation and augmented with expert opinion as need. Resources will be costed in the most recent cost year for which published NHS and PSS unit costs are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par107">If the intervention is effective, we will determine the cost per increased percentage point of vaccination rate. We will also consider impacts on care home staff (staff sickness and agency staff utilisation) and resident health (rates of GP visits, nurse visits hospitalisation, and all-cause mortality). Secondary analysis will disaggregate appropriate results by staff type (e.g. care home versus agency employed) and role. We will explore if the intervention costs may be offset by reduction in the use of other resources (e.g. fewer resident GP and nurse visits). Additionally, we will also explore crude valuations of life years gained (for example, noting any differences in resident mortality multiplied by typical survival periods).</p>
                  <p id="Par108">The analysis will adopt a ‘within trial’ approach, i.e. up to 6 months of the trial. Given the duration of less than a year, discounting will not be required. In line with the statistical analysis, we will analyse patterns of missing data, and where appropriate, multiple imputation will be used to impute data. Decisions relating to the treatment of missing data will be made in consultation with the study CIs and statisticians. If data is imputed, then results will be presented for both the imputed data as well as a complete case analysis (CCA). Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. If adjustment for other factors is needed (e.g., care home size), costs and effects will be analysed using appropriate regression-based methods. Analyses will be performed in a variety of packages, likely to include: MS Excel; R; and STATA.</p>
                  <p id="Par109">In accordance with NCTU practice, we will draft a health economic analysis plan (HEAP) prior to conducting the economic analysis. This will be shared and discussed with members of the Trial Management Group and other key personnel before analysis is undertaken. Where there is a discrepancy between the HEAP and protocol, the HEAP will have priority.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par110">We believe this to be the first study to develop a care home staff vaccination intervention using behavioural science, and as such has been designed to robustly address barriers at both individual and organisational levels.</p>
              <p id="Par111">Having conducted a feasibility study we are confident of our optimised study design and approaches for data collection. We had assumed that regular data collection in usual-care control arm homes may affect managerial behaviour and cause an increase in staff vaccination rates (reactivity bias); however, this was not proven to be the case when tested. Study data collection may be perceived by care homes as performance monitoring, but according to our outcome measures, this seems to have had no impact when collected in isolation. This could reflect a general lack of vaccination communication and care prioritisation in our sample, which specifically targets care homes with low staff vaccination rates.</p>
              <p id="Par112">Within our feasibility study we identified potential barriers in care home recruitment caused by low care home capacity, and consequently, report a wide range of approaches to improve this. It will be interesting to identify which approaches are most effective as this knowledge will be useful for individuals operating in this context in the future.</p>
              <p id="Par113">The study has been powered on the assumption that there will be some increase in staff vaccination rates in the control arm from previous low levels and such that we have sufficient power to detect a reasonably large change in vaccination rate as a result of our multi-layered intervention. It could be argued that we should have powered our study on a 40% change in vaccination rate such that we demonstrate that the intervention care homes achieve the WHO target i.e., from less than 40% to more than 75%. However, we are firstly comparing the difference in change between the two arms, which may be less, but still sufficient to achieve 75% in the intervention arm. Secondly, the number of homes required to detect such a potentially large difference would be very small and we may then not detect a significant but meaningful difference of 20%.</p>
              <p id="Par114">The planned health economic component will be a CCA, rather than the more common cost-utility analysis (CUA), in which cost impacts are compared to impacts measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the UK, CUAs typically adopt the perspective of the national health service and personal social services. Here, CCA is more suited to this evaluation context where the intervention impacts on multiple domains and perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, to ensure acceptability and feasibility of trial delivery in this setting, primary data collection — such as asking staff or residents to complete measures that would allow calculation of QALYs — needed to be kept at a minimum. The proposed analysis draws on data that can be provided by a few key staff at each home, reducing the trial impact in this already resource-stretched setting.</p>
              <p id="Par115">We are also confident that data collection is both feasible and practical, only requiring care home managers to complete the Site Profile Questionnaire at the start and end of the trial, and to provide monthly data only on number of staff, staff leavers and starters, plus vaccination status and aggregate resident data. In our feasibility trial, the remuneration offered for participation was found to be sufficient to encourage data provision. Similarly, the financial model for encouraging a vaccine provider to engage with in-house vaccination clinic provision was shown to be sufficient.</p>
              <p id="Par116">Active involvement of our Expert Advisory Group, which consists of a range of healthcare professionals with expertise in care homes, individuals from a range of national care home representative organisations plus experts in Social Care operating at the government level was central to the design of our final research protocol. Our patient and public involvement members have been involved in all stages of the project, from inception to providing advice on the different elements of the intervention e.g., poster and video, providing guidance on how to enhance our approach to recruitment and how to communicate effectively with care homes and in the qualitative analysis of the data from our process evaluation. This regular input provides greater confidence in the potential for our intervention to be effective and in the delivery of our research project.</p>
              <p id="Par117">The trial results will be published in an open access, peer-reviewed journal and we will work with our public and patient involvement group and expert advisory panel to develop a dissemination strategy appropriate to reaching relevant target audiences. All members of the FluCare team that have contributed to the protocol design and written or commented on the paper will be eligible for authorship of outputs.</p>
