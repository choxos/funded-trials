                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Multimorbidity is common in older adults and associated with high levels of illness burden and healthcare expenditure. The evidence base for how to manage older adults with multimorbidity is weak. Yoga might be a useful intervention because it has the potential to improve health-related quality of life, physical functioning, and several medical conditions. The British Wheel of Yoga’s Gentle Years Yoga© (GYY) programme was developed specifically for older adults, including those with chronic medical conditions. Data from a pilot trial suggested feasibility of using GYY in this population, but its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness remain uncertain.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multi-site, individually randomised, superiority trial with an embedded process evaluation and an economic analysis of cost-effectiveness. The trial will compare an experimental strategy of offering a 12-week GYY programme against a control strategy of no offer in community-dwelling adults aged 65 or over who have multimorbidity, defined as having two or more chronic conditions from a predefined list. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life measured using the EQ-5D-5L, the primary endpoint being the overall difference over 12 months. Both groups will continue to be able to access their usual care from primary, secondary, community, and social services. Participants, care providers, and yoga teachers will not be blinded to the allocated intervention. Outcome measures are primarily self-reported. The analysis will follow intention-to-treat principles.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This pragmatic randomised controlled trial will demonstrate if the GYY programme is an effective, cost-effective, and viable addition to the management of older adults with multimorbidity.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par27">Multimorbidity, defined as when a person has two or more long-term medical conditions, is one of the biggest challenges facing health systems internationally as multiple disease care becomes commonplace in an ageing society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is highly prevalent in older adults, with one study showing 65% of adults aged 65–84 years to be multimorbid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Multimorbidity leads to poorer health outcomes: it is associated with reduced life expectancy, quality of life, and physical and mental well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Multimorbid individuals also consume a disproportionally large share of healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par28">The evidence base for enhancing the care of patients with multimorbidity is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A 2016 Cochrane review found only 18 randomised controlled trials that had evaluated interventions for improving outcomes in patients with multimorbidity in primary care and community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 12 studies, the interventions were primarily organisational, e.g. case management or addition of a pharmacist to the clinical care team. In the other six studies, the interventions were primarily patient-oriented, e.g. self-management support groups. Across all studies, there was moderate certainty evidence of little or no difference in clinical outcomes and high certainty evidence of mental health outcomes improving (in the intervention versus control). There was moderate certainty evidence of a small improvement in patient-reported outcomes, and two trials that specifically targeted patients’ functional difficulties showed positive effects on functional outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There was limited data on costs. This review highlighted the need for further research to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions that are ideally simple, generalisable, and which can address several medical conditions simultaneously. Yoga is a candidate intervention.</p>
                <p id="Par29">Yoga originated thousands of years ago in India as an integrated mind-body practice based on ancient Vedic philosophy. During the twentieth century, yoga became increasingly recognised outside India, and over the past decades, it has continued to grow in popularity worldwide as a system for promoting health and well-being. Whilst modern yoga often focuses on physical poses and is sometimes thought of as a type of exercise, the practice usually incorporates one or more of the mental or spiritual elements that are traditionally part of yoga, such as relaxation, concentration, or meditation. There are currently many different styles or schools of yoga, each with a variable emphasis and approach to practice. Research evidence suggests that some of these yoga practices may help to prevent and treat various physical and mental illnesses and improve the overall quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">In November 2017, the Cochrane Library published a special collection of 14 systematic reviews that focused on the effectiveness of yoga for improving physical or mental symptoms and quality of life in a range of health conditions, including musculoskeletal, pulmonary, cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, and mental health. A summary of four of these reviews is as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par31">Yoga for chronic non-specific low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]: For yoga compared to non-exercise controls (9 trials; 810 participants), there was moderate certainty evidence that yoga produced small-to-moderate improvements in back-related function (standardised mean difference [SMD] −0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.66 to − 0.22) and pain (mean difference [MD] −7.81, 95% CI − 13.37 to − 2.25) at 6 months. The authors recommended additional high-quality research to improve confidence in estimates of effect and to evaluate long-term outcomes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Yoga for asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]: There was some evidence that yoga may improve quality of life (MD in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score per item 0.57 units on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.77; 5 studies; <italic>n</italic> = 375) and symptoms (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.65; 3 studies; <italic>n</italic> = 243) and reduce medication usage (risk ratio 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 to 22.11; 2 studies) in people with asthma. The authors concluded that large high-quality trials are needed to confirm the effects of yoga on asthma.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Yoga for improving health-related quality of life, mental health, and cancer-related symptoms in women diagnosed with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]: Seventeen studies that compared yoga versus no therapy provided moderate-quality evidence showing that yoga improved health-related quality of life (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40; 10 studies, <italic>n</italic> = 675), reduced fatigue (SMD −0.48, 95% CI − 0.75 to − 0.20; 11 studies, <italic>n</italic> = 883), and reduced sleep disturbances in the short term (SMD -0.25, 95% CI − 0.40 to − 0.09; six studies, <italic>n</italic> = 657). No serious adverse events were reported. Additional research is needed to assess the medium- and longer-term effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par34">Yoga for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]: Yoga was found to produce reductions in diastolic blood pressure (MD − 2.90 mmHg), triglycerides (MD − 0.27 mmol/L), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD 0.08 mmol/L). There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, although there was moderate statistical heterogeneity. Adverse events, occurrence of type 2 diabetes, and costs were not reported in any of the studies. No study reported cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, or non-fatal events, and most studies were small- and short-term.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par35">Elsewhere, studies have sought to determine the effects of yoga in older populations. For example, a 2012 systematic review of 16 studies (<italic>n</italic> = 649) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and a more recent trial of 118 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] demonstrated that yoga may provide greater improvements in physical functioning and self-reported health status than conventional physical activity interventions in older adults. More recently, a systematic review of six trials (<italic>n</italic> = 307) of relatively high methodological quality reported that yoga interventions had a small beneficial effect on balance (SMD 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.65, 6 trials) and a medium effect on physical mobility (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.95, 3 trials) in people aged 60 and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">In summary, these data offer support for the beneficial effects of yoga in older adults and for several long-term medical conditions. However, many of the previous studies had limitations, including small sample sizes, a single yoga teacher delivering the programme, and short-term follow-up. Robust economic evaluations of yoga are also limited, although a recent systematic review concluded that ‘medical’ yoga is likely to be a cost-effective option for low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Very little research has specifically focused on older adults with multimorbidity.</p>
                <p id="Par37">In 2009, the Gentle Years Yoga (GYY) programme was developed by the Yorkshire Yoga &amp; Therapy Centre to cater specifically for the needs of older adults, including those with long-term medical conditions such as osteoarthritis, hypertension, and cognitive impairment. As part of the pilot research study conducted at Yorkshire Yoga in 2016, a standardised GYY teacher training programme was manualised with the creation of a quality-assured teacher training course which became the British Wheel of Yoga (BWY) Gentle Years Yoga© (GYY) programme that is being delivered by the BWY. BWY is the national governing body of yoga in Great Britain with a nationwide network of &gt; 5000 qualified yoga teachers. GYY is based on standard Hatha Yoga, incorporating traditional physical poses and transitions as well as breathing, concentration, and relaxation activities. Adaptations to challenging Hatha Yoga poses have been made so that older adults can safely participate whilst still obtaining the fitness, health, and well-being benefits of yoga. Each programme involves one group-based session per week for 12 weeks (each session including a 75-min chair-based yoga class and after-class social time) and promotion of regular self-managed yoga practice at home.</p>
                <p id="Par38">In a pilot trial of the GYY programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], 82 potential participants (community-dwelling inactive older adults) expressed an interest within a 2-month recruitment period, of which 52 (mean age 75 years) were recruited and randomised. Participants had up to six long-term medical conditions, the most common of which were osteoarthritis, hypertension, and depression. Trial yoga courses were delivered across four community venues by four yoga teachers. Two thirds (67%) of participants had an acceptable attendance of ≥80%. Feasibility was demonstrated, with potential for a positive clinically important effect on health status (EQ-5D-5L utility score) at 3 months after randomisation (MD 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.21). We are now conducting a larger trial over a wider geographical area to ascertain the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in older adults with multimorbidity.</p>

                <title>Objectives {7}</title>
                <p id="Par39">The primary objective is to establish if the offer of a 12-week GYY programme in addition to continued access to usual care is more effective compared with usual care alone in improving health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility index score) over 12 months in adults aged 65 years or over with multimorbidity.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Secondary objectives include the following:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par41">To explore the effect of the GYY programme on health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, and loneliness at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par42">To explore the effect of the GYY programme on the incidence of falls over 12 months after randomisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">To explore the safety of the GYY programme relative to control in terms of the occurrence of adverse events over 12 months after randomisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">To assess if the GYY programme is cost-effective, measured using differences in cost of health resource use between the intervention and control groups and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EQ-5D-5L measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">To undertake a qualitative process evaluation to describe the experience of the intervention, explain the determinants of delivery (including treatment fidelity), and identify the optimal implementation strategies for embedding and normalising the GYY programme in preparation for a wider roll-out</p></list-item></list></p>

Both trial arms will continue to be able to access their usual care from primary, secondary, community, and social services.</p>
                <p id="Par47">The research design also includes a qualitative process evaluation, an economic analysis of cost-effectiveness, and four methodological sub-studies that will address the following questions:

                <p id="Par90">GYY is a yoga programme for older adults, including those with long-term medical conditions. It is based on standard Hatha Yoga and incorporates traditional physical postures and transitions as well as breathing, concentration, and relaxation activities. Each class also includes additional time immediately following the class for participants to stay on and socialise. The main aims of the programme are to strengthen the muscles, increase flexibility, balance, and mobility, and improve mental and social well-being. Chairs are used for seated exercise and can be used to provide support when standing, although the whole session can be carried out on a chair. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows examples of seated poses that are commonly used. The yoga practices are modified, where necessary, to allow individuals with varying medical conditions and functional abilities to participate safely. Props are also sometimes used to modify some of the postures and concentration activities. The physical challenge of each posture will be progressed throughout the course as participants become more able and confident. The following bullet points summarise how the GYY classes differ from standard Hatha Yoga classes:

                <p id="Par100">Participants will be invited to take part in 12, free of charge, 75-min group-based GYY classes. Each class is immediately followed by an optional 15–30-min period of socialising. All courses will commence within 3 weeks after randomisation. There will usually be one class per week for 12 consecutive weeks; however, there is an allowance for a gap during public holidays or if the teacher needs to be away for a week or two. Before the first class, participants are required to complete and submit a BWY Health Questionnaire. The questionnaire is needed for BWY teaching insurance purposes and so that the teachers are aware of each participant’s medical conditions and activity status. After the course starts, each class will include the following: (i) ‘housekeeping’ activities, such as completing the class register and discussing any home practice or health issues (5 min); (ii) introduction to the theme and practices of the class, basic breathing, and focusing activities (5 min); (iii) extended warm-up/mobilisation, preparatory postures (30–35 min); (iv) focused postures and restorative activities (10–15 min); (v) breathing exercises (5–10 min); and (vi) relaxation and concentration activities (5–10 min), followed by after-class social time (15–30 min).</p>
                <p id="Par101">In addition to lessons modified for the individuals within the class, the participants are instructed in chair-based yoga activities selected for safe self-practice at home. Participants are encouraged to practice at home each day using a home practice sheet. As the class-based activities become more challenging, students are given new home practice sheets to allow the progression of their home yoga routine. Each yoga participant will receive four home practice sheets in total, covering weeks 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, and 10–12. Each sheet includes at least five practices, and each home practice session is expected to last 10–20 min. Towards the end of the course (i.e. class 11 or 12), the yoga teachers will provide participants with general verbal advice about continuing yoga practice (including home practice) and a written or electronic one-page handout sign-posting participants to suitable yoga classes (i.e. GYY or similar) in their local community or online, which they may want to attend on a self-pay basis.</p>
                <p id="Par102">The delivery mode of the 12-week intervention will be either face-to-face or online. Online classes address the need for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial classes will comprise intervention participants only, with each 12-week course having 12 participants allocated if delivered online and up to 15 participants if delivered face-to-face. Face-to-face classes will be conducted in non-medical community-based facilities (e.g. yoga studio, community hall, leisure centre) following checks of venue suitability by the trial team. Accessibility factors to consider include close proximity to public transport links, parking facilities, and disability access. Online classes will be conducted via Zoom, an online livestream platform freely accessible to participants using a computer or tablet. Participants will be advised to activate their cameras so that the teacher is able to view them and provide feedback on their technique. Prior to online classes commencing, the yoga teacher will conduct one-to-one Zoom meetings with their students to optimise the set-up of their equipment and environment and to discuss any health issues or course queries. Participants will also be able to ask questions throughout the course.</p>

                  <title>Yoga teacher training</title>
                  <p id="Par103">Approximately 24 yoga courses will be delivered within the trial by approximately 12 yoga teachers (i.e. each teacher delivering two separate courses). The teachers will all have the GYY qualification, appropriate insurance, and experience of working with older adults. They will also receive specific training in the trial background and procedures.</p>
                  <p id="Par104">The GYY programme is copyrighted by the BWY and since 2017 has been providing training in GYY to qualified yoga teachers. Training for the GYY qualification takes place over approximately 12 months and covers the National Occupational Standards for understanding the principles of adapting physical activity for older adults and the planning, adaptation, and delivery of sessions to meet the requirements of participants with specific needs. This includes information on ageing, exercise barriers and motivators, ethical and legal responsibilities, the physiology of ageing and common chronic conditions, and how to modify yoga for different health states. After distance learning modules and face-to-face instruction, the teachers demonstrate their understanding through worksheets, multiple-choice questions, two case studies, designing a GYY programme, and being observed and assessed on their teaching of GYY sessions on two occasions.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">To minimise inter-teacher variation and enhance the fidelity of intervention delivery, the yoga teachers will receive standardisation training from the trial team via a 1-day interactive workshop. The training will include clinical reasoning for the GYY programme, clarification of the standardised class content and structure, and practical delivery tips including intervention progression and provision of home practice sheets. It will also stress the importance of only allowing people in the trial’s intervention group to access the classes and other trial processes such as adverse event reporting and class attendance monitoring. To supplement this training day, teachers will also receive a standardised research training manual. The yoga teachers will have continued access to the intervention supervisors who developed the GYY teacher training course during their delivery of the 12-week intervention. The intervention supervisors will be responsible for supporting intervention delivery and sharing of best practice. Additional training and support will be available from the wider trial team as required, and this will be documented.</p>

                  <p id="Par110">The primary outcome will be health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the EQ-5D-5L utility score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This will be assessed according to current EuroQol guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomisation. The primary endpoint will be the overall difference over the 12 months. There is a valuation set for the EQ-5D-5L available for England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; however, this is currently under revision. Meanwhile, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that utility values should be calculated using the crosswalk developed by van Hout et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Utility scores will be calculated following the NICE guidance at the time of the analysis.</p>
                  <p id="Par111">The EQ-5D™ is a widely used self-reported generic measure of HRQoL which comprises two parts: the classification of 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a visual analogue scale (VAS), which records participants’ overall evaluation of their health on a scale from 100 (best imaginable health) to 0 (worst imaginable health). The EQ-5D has been validated in many different patient populations including diabetes, cardiovascular problems, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are currently two versions of the instrument that can be used for adults: the original EQ-5D-3L with five dimensions of health and 3 levels of problems, and the more recent EQ-5D-5L that has the same five dimensions of health and 5 levels of problems (1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, and 5 = unable/extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L helps overcome problems with ceiling effects and has greater sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It showed evidence of good sensitivity in our pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and has been the primary outcome measure in other primary care-based multimorbidity trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides being used as the primary outcome measure in the analysis, the EQ-5D-5L will be also used to estimate QALYs for our economic evaluation.</p>

To be conservative, we took the lowest estimate (0.06) with an estimated standard deviation of 0.20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Accounting for loss to follow-up of 20%, we need to recruit and randomise 586 participants for the study to have 90% power with 5% significance (two-sided).</p>
                <p id="Par125">Although this is an individually randomised trial, there is a possibility of potential clustering within the intervention arm by yoga class. If we assume an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.04 and an average class size of 12 in the intervention arm, then with the proposed sample size, we would still retain 84% power to detect the same magnitude of effect (ceteris paribus). In this calculation, we considered the level of clustering at the yoga class level, rather than at the level of the yoga teacher, since we believe this will be the most influential level of clustering. Accounting for potential clustering within the intervention arm only leads to small reductions in power, which could potentially be recovered in the analysis of the repeated measures which is not currently accounted for in the sample size calculation.</p>

                  <p id="Par128">For the main recruitment method, each participating practice will be asked to search their practice database using an electronic search process provided by the research team to identify potentially eligible patients who are aged 65 years or older and have two or more chronic conditions as defined by the inclusion criteria. If there are more potentially eligible patients than required (e.g. &gt; 500 for a recruitment mail-out from a single practice required to cover one course/site), a sub-sample of these patients will be randomly selected. GPs will be asked to review the resulting list to screen out patients meeting the exclusion criteria. The practice or Docmail (a third-party information handler) will mail out a recruitment pack to the remaining patients, which will include a covering invitation letter, a participant information sheet (which includes a link to an audio version on the trial website), a consent form, a screening questionnaire, and two prepaid envelopes for returning the completed forms.

                  <p id="Par155">Statistical analyses will be described in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will be agreed upon with the Trial Steering Committee before all data has been collected. Any subsequent amendments will be clearly stated and justified. The trial will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Baseline data will be summarised using descriptive statistics with no formal statistical comparisons of the baseline data undertaken. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and using two-sided significance tests at the 5% significance level, unless otherwise stated.</p>
                  <p id="Par156">The primary outcome will be analysed using a linear mixed model, including all available follow-up time points. The model will adjust for EQ-5D-5L at baseline and include as fixed effects: time point, trial arm, arm by time interaction, and other covariates specified in the SAP. Patient (to account for the repeated measures) and site will be included as random effects. The overall difference between the two groups over the 12 months from randomisation will be the primary endpoint, but differences at each time point will be extracted for secondary investigations aimed at determining the potential pattern of change. Adjusted mean differences will be presented with an associated 95% CI and <italic>p</italic> value. Different covariance patterns for the repeated measurements will be explored, and the most appropriate pattern will be used for the final model. Model assumptions will be checked, and if they are in doubt, transformations of the outcome data will be considered. Analyses to account for possible clustering by yoga class will also be undertaken by including the class as a random effect, nested within the treatment arm. We shall explore the impact of differing modes of delivery (face-to-face, or online) within subgroup analyses.</p>
                  <p id="Par157">The anxiety, depression, loneliness, and PROMIS-29 data will be analysed in the same way as described for the primary outcome. The number of falls experienced by participants over the 12 months will be analysed using a negative binomial regression model.

                  <p id="Par158">There are no planned interim analyses for the trial or stopping guidelines. There is, however, an internal pilot study from which data will contribute to the final analyses. The primary reason for this pilot study will be to check the assumptions about recruitment and feasibility of the trial. The period covering the two waves of yoga courses at the four pilot sites will form the internal pilot phase. Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the four following progression criteria and inform study continuation beyond the pilot phase:

Interviews will, with consent, be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and edited to ensure respondent anonymity. Contemporaneous field notes from observations will also be edited to ensure participant anonymity. The analysis will be theoretically informed by the Normalisation Process Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and will be conducted according to the standard procedures of rigorous qualitative analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] including open and focused coding, constant comparison, memoing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], deviant case analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

                  <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par178">The economic analysis will assess the relative cost-effectiveness of the GYY programme in addition to continued access to usual care compared with usual care alone. Costs and health outcomes will be evaluated from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services, consistent with that used by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Data on healthcare resource use, intervention costs, and health outcomes will be collected during the 1-year trial period. Costs components will comprise primary and social care consultations (e.g. with a GP, nurse, or physiotherapist), hospital visits (e.g. inpatient episodes, outpatient visits, and accident and emergency admissions), and private treatments. Prescription data will also be obtained from GP practice records for up to 100 participants and covering the 15-month period before the 12-month follow-up. Trial records will be used to estimate the cost of the yoga intervention. Private expenditures related to treatment will also be recorded, and these costs will be included in a secondary analysis. We will estimate the cost per participant by multiplying the use of resource use by their associated unit cost, which will be valued using national published sources such as NHS reference costs and the British National Formulary. Health outcomes will be expressed in terms of the QALY using the EQ-5D data collected at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. QALYs will be calculated by plotting the utility scores at each follow-up point and estimating the area under the curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Costs and QALY data will be synthesised to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is defined as the ratio of the mean difference in costs to the mean difference in QALYs between both arms of the trial. For the analysis, regression methods will be used to allow for differences in prognostic variables. The pattern of missing data will be analysed and handled by means of multiple imputations if deemed appropriate according to the missing data pattern in the dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the robustness of the results, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The uncertainty will be presented using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, which shows the probability of the yoga intervention plus usual care being more cost-effective than usual care alone. The probability that each intervention is cost-effective will be reported at the cost-effectiveness thresholds applied by NICE of £20,000 to £30,000/QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and also £13,000/QALY as suggested by recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A cost-consequence analysis will also be conducted to capture the wider consequences of the yoga intervention in terms of the full breadth of outcomes measured in the trial. A detailed health economics analysis plan will be agreed upon with the Trial Steering Committee before all data has been collected.</p>

                <p id="Par179">In the primary clinical analysis, the impact of missing EQ-5D-5L outcome data will be minimised to some extent by using the mixed-effects, repeated measures model, as it allows the inclusion of intermittent responders under the assumption that data are missing at random. Nevertheless, the extent and pattern of missing data for each outcome will be explored and predictors of missingness examined, especially if these vary by intervention. If necessary, multiple imputations will be utilised to impute missing data and explore deviations from the missing at random assumption.</p>
                <p id="Par180">Complier average causal effect (CACE) analyses for the primary outcome will be undertaken to explore the impact of non-compliance on treatment effect estimates. Three analyses are proposed. The first CACE analysis will be conducted on the data of participants who are fully compliant, defined as attendance at three or more of the first six sessions and at least three other sessions. The second CACE analysis will define compliance as attendance at one yoga session or more (i.e. any compliance), which will include participants who are fully and partially compliant. The final CACE analysis will include the number of sessions attended in its continuous form.</p>

              <p id="Par190">Multimorbidity is common in older adults and associated with high levels of illness burden and healthcare expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We know from previous work and from reviews that there is a lack of evidence-based interventions for older adults with multimorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Yoga might be a useful intervention because it is low-cost, simple, and can address several medical conditions simultaneously. However, many of the previous research studies on yoga have limitations, including small sample sizes, a single yoga teacher delivering the programme, and short-term follow-up. In addition, few studies have focused on older adults with multimorbidity. We have successfully completed a pilot trial that demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the GYY programme in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The current full-scale trial will build on this previous work by evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par191">Should the trial demonstrate the GYY programme to be clinically and cost-effective, we will have the necessary information from our process evaluation to identify optimal implementation strategies for embedding and normalising the intervention beyond the study. Easy integration into routine care pathways should be possible, potentially using models and referral processes adapted from those used in exercise referral and social prescribing schemes.</p>
