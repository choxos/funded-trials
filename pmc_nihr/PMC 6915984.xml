                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Urinary incontinence (UI) is highly prevalent in nursing and residential care homes (CHs) and profoundly impacts on residents’ dignity and quality of life. CHs predominantly use absorbent pads to contain UI rather than actively treat the condition. Transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) is a non-invasive, safe and low-cost intervention with demonstrated effectiveness for reducing UI in adults. However, the effectiveness of TPTNS to treat UI in older adults living in CHs is not known. The ELECTRIC trial aims to establish if a programme of TPTNS is a clinically effective treatment for UI in CH residents and investigate the associated costs and consequences.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a pragmatic, multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised parallel-group trial comparing the effectiveness of TPTNS (target <italic>n</italic> = 250) with sham stimulation (target <italic>n</italic> = 250) in reducing volume of UI in CH residents. CH residents (men and women) with self- or staff-reported UI of more than once per week are eligible to take part, including those with cognitive impairment. Outcomes will be measured at 6, 12 and 18 weeks post randomisation using the following measures: 24-h Pad Weight Tests, post void residual urine (bladder scans), Patient Perception of Bladder Condition, Minnesota Toileting Skills Questionnaire and Dementia Quality of Life. Economic evaluation based on a bespoke Resource Use Questionnaire will assess the costs of providing a programme of TPTNS. A concurrent process evaluation will investigate fidelity to the intervention and influencing factors, and qualitative interviews will explore the experiences of TPTNS from the perspective of CH residents, family members, CH staff and managers.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">TPTNS is a non-invasive intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing UI in adults. The ELECTRIC trial will involve CH staff delivering TPTNS to residents and establish whether TPTNS is more effective than sham stimulation for reducing the volume of UI in CH residents. Should TPTNS be shown to be an effective and acceptable treatment for UI in older adults in CHs, it will provide a safe, low-cost and dignified alternative to the current standard approach of containment and medication.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p id="Par53">The highest prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), defined by the International Continence Society as ‘any involuntary loss of urine’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is found in residential or nursing care homes (CHs). UI is distressing for older adults and profoundly impacts on dignity and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is associated with impaired physical functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], sleep disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], urinary tract infection (UTI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and hygiene and tissue viability problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. UI affects social participation and is a major cause of clinical depression and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. UI is costly to CH providers, healthcare services and the individual older adult. Direct personal and treatment costs are high. Intangible costs associated with social isolation and withdrawal from community participation also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] but have not been quantified.</p>
                <p id="Par54">The most common type of UI experienced by older CH residents is mixed UI, combining symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB): urgency, frequency, nocturia with or without urgency UI, with stress UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For most this is exacerbated by functional losses of urine associated with frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. No evidence of the effects of conservative interventions directly addressing mixed incontinence in CH populations is yet available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is also a dearth of published evidence on interventions to promote recovery of bladder continence in the CH context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or for people living with dementia, even though the CH population is three times more likely to have UI or faecal incontinence (FI) than people of equivalent age and characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The burden of UI in the CH population is significant and increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], yet evidence suggests that even intractable UI is amenable to interventions that may improve urinary function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Currently CHs use containment approaches, predominantly absorbent pads, rather than active treatment as the mainstay for managing UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Other non-pharmacological options include bladder training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and pelvic floor muscle training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] as well as toileting programmes, signage and environmental adaptations for people with dementia. However, evidence indicates these are rarely used, have limited effectiveness in the CH environment and are labour intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which impacts on sustainability in the longer term. They also require a degree of cooperation, engagement and activity by the resident, which can be prohibitive for people with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Antimuscarinic drugs may be used to reduce urge/OAB problems; however, these drugs are associated with significant adverse effects in frail older people and should be avoided in those with dementia, as they may also counteract the functional benefits of anticholinesterase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Newer β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist drugs with potential benefit such as mirabegron are available, but the frail CH population has not been included in drug trials and, with prevalent polypharmacy in such contexts, any additional medication may increase adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par55">Transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (TPTNS) is a simple, non-invasive, safe and low-cost intervention with promising effectiveness, directly targeting urgency or mixed UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It uses a portable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) machine to stimulate the posterior tibial nerve using surface electrodes placed adjacent to the medial malleolus. It does not require the resident to actively engage in order to receive the intervention, and so is suitable for those who are physically and cognitively frail. It is comfortable to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and promotes dignified care, as only access to the resident’s ankle is required. It has been shown in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce UI in community-living older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (including multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Parkinson’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]); however, no definitive RCTs have focused on treating UI in the CH population. A small randomised feasibility study indicated the safety, acceptability and potential effects of TPTNS in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par56">Although the exact mechanism of action has yet to be fully understood, TPTNS is believed to restore the balance between excitatory and inhibitory bladder functioning by modulating the signal traffic to and from the bladder through the sacral plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is hypothesised that stimulating afferent sacral nerves in the lower extremities increases the inhibitory stimuli to the efferent pelvic nerve, suppresses bladder afferent nerve activity, reduces detrusor contractility and increases bladder capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and by these means TPTNS reduces the sensation of urgency and the frequency of micturition, thus enabling improved bladder control. These mechanisms may also reduce the volume of urine retained in the bladder after voiding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. For the CH residents who wear absorbent pads because of mixed/urgency UI, TPTNS may reduce the sudden urge to urinate and frequency of voiding, allowing residents more time to reach the toilet, which in turn will enable more appropriate use of the toilet, generating respect and enhancing the person’s dignity.</p>
                <p id="Par57">As a potentially therapeutic modality, TPTNS could occupy a unique position in the CH care pathway for UI, as it provides active treatment of the mixed/urgency UI condition without requiring any active contribution by the resident. Thus, unusually, it is as likely to be of benefit to those with cognitive impairment as those without, and has been shown to be safe and not associated with any severe or limiting adverse effects. Skin redness and potential skin allergy are the only mild adverse effects reported.</p>
                <p id="Par58">A systematic review of TPTNS for UI identified ten RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A total of 472 participants were included, only 30 of whom were from a single CH population. All studies reported improvements in bladder condition with TPTNS, in terms of symptom improvement and/or UI-related quality of life, although no one trial was definitive. A meta-analysis (two trials) found a mean difference between TPTNS and control group in the self-reported International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence (ICIQ-UI) short-form score of − 3.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] – 5.82, – 1.76), which was considered a clinically meaningful effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. There were no significant adverse events (AEs), and TPTNS was consistently reported as safe. However, the studies in the meta-analysis were small (outcomes from 79 participants), with methodological weaknesses and a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] rating of ‘low quality’. With the increases in the older adult population and concomitant multimorbidities including dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], together with the associated increase in numbers with UI, especially OAB/urgency incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], there is a pressing need to investigate interventions to treat UI to reduce the burden on CH residents and care providers.</p>

                <title>Who will take informed consent?</title>
                <p id="Par81">Processes for identifying eligibility and participant recruitment will differ in England and Scotland according to relevant legislation on capacity to provide informed consent to participate. In both countries the local Principal Investigator (PI, senior clinical nurse or manager) in each CH will identify potentially eligible residents, provide study information to all those with capacity and seek agreement from the residents for them to be approached by the Regional Research Assistant (RRA-registered nurses working in trial regions in Scotland and England) to receive further information about the study. All resident recruitment will be undertaken by the RRAs. In CHs in England in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], where the local PI believes a resident’s capacity is in question, they will identify and provide the information to the resident’s personal consultee (usually a family member or friend), or if one is not available, a nominated consultee identified by the CH study team, and seek their agreement for an approach from the RRA. The RRA will provide a full explanation of the study, ensure eligibility and seek the consultee’s advice on what they feel the resident’s wishes would be about taking part in the trial, if they had capacity. The consultee will sign a declaration form if they believe the resident would choose to agree to participate. In CHs in Scotland, in accordance with the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], where a resident has a certificate of incapacity the local PI will identify and provide the study information to the resident’s welfare attorney (if one has been appointed) or their nearest relative. If there is no welfare attorney identified, or the resident does not have a relative who can be consulted, they will be considered ineligible to participate in the study. The local PI will seek agreement from the welfare attorney/nearest relative for the RRA to speak to them. The RRA will provide a full explanation of the study to the welfare attorney/nearest relative, ensure eligibility and seek written consent for the resident to participate. Written consent to participate in the process evaluation interviews will be sought by the RRA from the individual family carers or CH staff prior to the resident taking part.</p>

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators</title>
                <p id="Par83">To ensure the resident and their relatives are blind to the allocated intervention group, a sham stimulation intervention rather than a no-treatment comparator will be used. The sham stimulation will comprise low-intensity, subclinical stimulation of the lateral submalleolar area, positioned specifically on the lateral aspect of the ankle in order to avoid the tibial nerve, which runs close to the skin surface behind the medial malleolus. The cathode electrode will be positioned behind the lateral malleolus and the anode 10 cm cephalad to it. The stimulation parameters will be identical to the TPTNS stimulation other than the intensity of the current, which will always be set at 4 mA, not adjusted to individual comfort levels as it is in the TPTNS intervention group. The current will be initially increased until the resident reports feeling some sensation, following which the current will be reduced to 4 mA. All residents will be informed that they may not feel anything with this intervention and that this is quite normal. A previous pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] found that older residents were unable to accurately identify their allocated group and confirmed the integrity of the sham stimulation protocol.</p>

                <title>Intervention description</title>
                <p id="Par84">TPTNS is a form of peripheral neuromodulation. The tibial nerve, which lies immediately posterior to the medial malleolus, will be stimulated electrically using a portable TENS machine and two surface electrodes. The cathode electrode will be positioned behind the medial malleolus and the anode 10 cm cephalad to it. Standardised stimulation parameters will be applied of 10 Hz frequency, and a pulse width of 200 μs, in continuous stimulation mode. Intensity of stimulation (mA<sup>-1</sup>) will be adjusted on a session-by-session basis according to individual resident highest tolerated intensity below the motor threshold that remains comfortable. Both intervention and placebo/sham groups will receive an electrical stimulation programme comprising a total of 12 sessions of 30 min duration each, delivered twice weekly over 6 weeks. The stimulation equipment and method of delivery will be identical in everything but the intensity of electrical stimulation applied and the positioning of the surface electrodes. The electrical stimulators will be programmed to the set parameters and locked prior to individual use so that the only adjustable parameter will be the intensity of stimulation. The intervention will be delivered by CH registered nurses and senior carers who will receive specific training and support to undertake this role. No strict TPTNS/sham intervention timetable will be set, and individual CHs will have flexibility around where, how and when they deliver the sessions, bearing in mind that they should occur twice weekly for 30 min each, over a 6-week period. A proposed schedule for each home and resident will be agreed between the resident, registered nurse/senior carer and local PI at the point of treatment inception. The allocated treatment (TPTNS or sham) will be offered to the resident a maximum of two times in any 24-h period. If refused when first offered (verbally or by non-verbal behaviour), the treatment will be postponed for at least an hour and then offered one further time. Records of acceptance and refusals will be documented in the resident’s treatment diary. Adherence to the TPTNS or sham stimulation programme will be one of the progression criteria to full-scale trial from the internal pilot. While aiming to complete a full 12-session programme over the 6-week intervention period, contingency measures will be implemented if four or more sessions are refused or missed by the resident. Such measures will include approaching the resident at a later time, a different place or on a different day.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions</title>
                <p id="Par85">There will be no special criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions. Residents will remain in the trial unless they (or their welfare attorney/nearest relative in Scotland) choose to withdraw consent, or if their personal or nominated consultee (in England) advises that they believe the person’s wishes about participation have changed, or they are unable to continue for a clinical reason or if they die.</p>

                <p id="Par86">An individual resident stimulation diary will be completed by the registered nurse/senior carer following each session, recording date, time, intensity of electrical stimulation and any comments on the process of delivery. The locked stimulation machines will automatically record the total stimulation time in use and the average stimulation intensity of all recorded sessions, thus providing an objective record of the stimulation programme provided to each resident. This recorded data will be compared against the individually written stimulation diary completed by the staff after each session. The fidelity comparison will be performed by an Implementation Support Facilitator (ISF) whose role will be to provide support and ongoing training to CH staff and ensure they are competent and confident to deliver the stimulations. Electrode positioning, indicating accuracy of the allocated intervention, will be recorded using a digital photograph taken by staff every 2 weeks during the intervention delivery period, and will be viewed by the ISF.</p>

                <p id="Par102">A total of 500 residents will be recruited. It was believed that the intervention may result in a worthwhile difference of a reduction of 200 ml/24 h in UI, equivalent to 200 g in pad weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. There is a lack of data available on the standard deviation (SD) of Pad Weight Tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] (PWTs) in CH residents; however, a small RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] reported results on this outcome. The SD from the trial was 450 ml, but given the small and selected sample included, the upper 95% CI around the SD was estimated and found to be approximately 570 ml/24 h, hence resulting in a standardised effect size of 0.35 (i.e. 200/570). To detect that difference with 90% power at the two-sided 5% alpha level, primary outcome data on 344 participants will be required. The limited data available suggested that the intra-class correlation (ICC) for any possible clustering effect was likely to be negligible. However, the sample size will be inflated to 500 to compensate for attrition in the primary outcome due to death of CH residents and potential transfers to other CHs, estimated conservatively to be 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>

The minimum population of residents will be 1700, although the expected number will be considerably higher. Approximately 70% will have UI, and 10% will be in receipt of palliative care or do not use the toilet/toilet aid for elimination. Thus, there will be an estimated minimum total pool of 1071 eligible residents from whom 500 will be recruited. Assuming similar recruitment rates to the Health Technology Assessment (HTA)-funded Dementia Care Mapping (DCM)-EPIC study undertaken in CHs of 60% of eligible CH residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], this would provide at least 643 residents from whom to recruit a sample of 500. Recruitment will be undertaken over an 18-month period, commencing with month 6 and completed by month 24. At least four new CH sites will be established every 3 months during the recruitment period, depending on CH size and location.</p>

                <title>Plans for assessment and collection of outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par112">Outcomes will be measured at 6, 12 and 18 weeks post randomisation. The primary outcome is the volume of urine leaked in 24-h at 6 weeks post randomisation, as measured by a 24-h PWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. PWTs at 12 and 18 weeks measure the sustainability of any effect. The test is based on the premise that 1 g fluid weight = 1 ml urine and is thus an objective measure of urine leakage. The PWT involves the resident emptying their bladder, applying a clean, dry pad at an agreed set time and retaining all pads used between this time and 24 h later. To maintain the moisture in the removed pads and prevent evaporation, all collected pads will be individually sealed in a small plastic bag and then placed in a larger re-sealable bag, which is weighed onsite by the RRA after the 24-h collection ends. The dry weight of the equivalent pads to those collected will be deducted from the total weight to provide the 24-h volume of UI leaked. Secondary outcome measures will include the number of pads used in 24 h, which may be expected to reduce if TPTNS is effective in reducing volume of UI and will be reflected in the economic evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par113">PVRU will be measured using a non-invasive portable ultrasound bladder scanner. A pilot study conducted with CH residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] suggested a potential mean decrease of 55 ml in PVRU following a TPTNS programme compared to the sham stimulation group. It is thus worth investigating whether this was an artefact, or whether TPTNS impacts on urinary retention in the frail older adult population. Additionally, it is important to ensure that any effect of TPTNS in reducing bladder leakage is not as a result of an increase in retained urine volume.</p>
                <p id="Par114">The PPBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] is a single-question global patient-reported outcome measure of perceived bladder condition with six possible responses, ranging from ‘My bladder condition does not cause me any problems at all’ to ‘My bladder condition causes me many severe problems’. It has good construct validity and responsiveness to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and is recommended as a global outcome measure for UI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It will be used at each time point with residents. However, it will also be adapted in this study for use by family carers as the Family Carer Perception of Bladder Condition (FC-PBC) and by the CH staff as the Staff Perception of Bladder Condition (S-PBC) to offer a perspective on how they believe the resident feels about their bladder condition.</p>
                <p id="Par115">The MTSQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] is a five-question patient-reported outcome measure of degree of difficulty on a scale of 0 to 4 for completing five tasks involved in toileting. Scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more difficulty. The MTSQ is a reliable and valid interviewer-administered measure of toileting skills in physically frail older women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It will be completed at all time points by the resident and/or staff member.</p>
                <p id="Par116">Quality of life is measured using the DEMQOL and DEMQOL-Proxy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], valid and reliable measures of health-related quality of life in people with dementia. The DEMQOL-Proxy will be completed by a single identified proxy for the resident. Both measures will be completed at the primary outcome point (6 weeks post randomisation) and at the 18 weeks follow-up assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par117">Economic evaluation will be undertaken using routine data available in CHs as well as information from the RUQ designed for this study (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The RUQ will be administered by the RRA, who will record at baseline the usual continence care pathway including details on usage of pads and other equipment, medication which may affect continence level and (if appropriate) number of staff required to assist residents to use the toilet. At the primary outcome point (6 weeks) and at the 18 weeks follow-up time point, the RRA will use the RUQ, in combination with the 24-h bladder diary, to update the continence care pathway. If residents have required any care from health professionals external to the CH as a result of their UI, this is also recorded on the RUQ. Staff time required for training and the delivery of the intervention will be recorded by each CH, including the number of hours and the staff grade.</p>

The objectives will be to explore the experiences of the TPTNS intervention from the perspectives of residents, family carers and CH staff and to explore factors affecting intervention implementation in the CH context and optimisation for sustainability. Additionally, data on stimulation time and intensity with individual residents will be automatically recorded by the stimulation machines, which will be allocated for use by a single resident only, in order to ensure accurate information on stimulation is collected. This objective information will be compared with diary information completed by staff.

                  <p id="Par121"><italic>For CH nurses/senior carer interviews</italic>, focus group (or small group) interviews will be undertaken with CH nurses and senior carers involved in the direct delivery of the TPTNS/sham intervention.

One focus group per CH or, where for staffing reasons this is not possible to organise, two to three small group interviews, will be held during the month following the intervention completion. This will result in the equivalent of 20 focus group interviews involving 60–100 CH staff. Additionally, up to 20 individual interviews will be undertaken with nurses/senior carers delivering the intervention, to explore and elicit views which staff may be reluctant to share in a group interview.</p>

Characteristics of residents and the stimulation programme received will be described using appropriate summary measures, and the proportion who received the therapeutic minimum (&gt; 8 stimulation sessions) and the full 12-session programme will be presented. Overall fidelity to the allocated group will also be assessed and presented to illuminate resident elements of the outcome analysis, including total stimulation time, mean intensity of stimulation and accuracy of electrodeposition. Stimulation diaries will be analysed to inform understanding of when, how and who delivers the electrical stimulation in practice.</p>

                  <p id="Par144">The economic evaluation will compare the costs and outcomes of TPTNS compared with usual continence care pathways and present these in a cost consequence analysis. Unit costs will be attached to the individual resources identified in the RUQ (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) using standard sources (including National Health Service [NHS] Reference Costs, Unit Costs of Health and Social Care and British National Formulary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). Staff training time will be costed using the appropriate pay scales for each site. The costs of the trainer and the materials (TPTNS machines, handbook and training DVD) will be based on the market rates for these items. Data on costs will not be combined directly with the primary study outcome, as it is likely that this will not provide a representative reflection of the impact of the TPTNS intervention on this older group of CH residents. Relevant outcomes, including the trial primary and secondary outcomes, along with important issues from the process evaluation will be presented alongside the costs in a cost consequence analysis. Here the costs will be presented alongside the effects, both quantitative and qualitative, in a disaggregated format to allow flexibility in presenting which costs/effects are relevant to different stakeholders.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par156">UI is highly prevalent in residential and nursing CHs and has a profound impact on dignity and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, CHs use a containment approach to managing UI, predominantly using absorbent pads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These are not only uncomfortable and undignified for the individual but are costly to the CH and health service providers. Anticholinergic drugs can also be used to treat UI, but they may have significant adverse effects in older adults and can adversely interact with drugs used to treat dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par157">TPTNS is a non-invasive intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness at reducing UI in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, there is a lack of evidence-based research into the safety, acceptability and effectiveness of its use in frail older adults. The ELECTRIC trial will test the feasibility and effectiveness of CH staff delivering TPTNS to adults in CHs. Economic evaluation will assess the costs of providing a programme of TPTNS, and the process evaluation will provide valuable information on the experiences of TPTNS from the point of view of CH residents, family members, CH staff and managers.</p>
              <p id="Par158">Should TPTNS be shown to be an effective and acceptable treatment for UI in older adults in CHs, it will provide a safe, low-cost and dignified alternative to the current standard approach of containment and medication.</p>
