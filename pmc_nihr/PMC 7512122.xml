                  <p>Between October 24, 2013, and September 27, 2016, the EVRA randomized clinical trial enrolled 450 participants (450 legs) with venous leg ulceration of less than 6 months’ duration and superficial venous reflux. Initially, 6555 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 6105 were excluded for reasons including ulcer duration greater than 6 months, healed ulcer by the time of randomization, deep venous occlusive disease, and insufficient superficial venous reflux to warrant ablation therapy, among others. A total of 426 of 450 participants (94.7%) from the vascular surgery departments of 20 hospitals in the United Kingdom were included in the analysis for ulcer recurrence. Surgeons, participants, and follow-up assessors were not blinded to the treatment group. Data were analyzed from August 11 to November 4, 2019.</p>

                  <p>The early-intervention group consisted of 224 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.0 [15.5] years; 127 men [56.7%]; 206 White participants [92%]).

Of the 426 participants whose leg ulcer had healed, 121 (28.4%) experienced at least 1 recurrence during follow-up. There was no clear difference in time to first ulcer recurrence between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.17; <italic>P</italic> = .28).

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Venous leg ulceration is the most extreme manifestation of chronic venous disease, and worldwide prevalence is increasing.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Compression therapy has been shown to improve ulcer healing, and 1-year outcomes from the Early Venous Reflux Ablation (EVRA) trial revealed that early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux (varicose veins) accelerated healing of venous leg ulcers compared with deferred intervention.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Early intervention was also shown to be cost-effective in the short term.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In the Effect of Surgery and Compression on Healing and Recurrence (ESCHAR) study, superficial venous surgery reduced venous ulcer recurrence at 4 years from 56% in participants treated with compression alone to 31% in the group treated with compression and varicose vein surgery.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Ulcer recurrence rates are likely to be higher than the 56% in the ESCHAR trial because compression is often not prescribed and compliance is poor, particularly outside clinical trials. Superficial venous surgery has largely been superseded by endovenous ablation procedures (ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and thermal and nonthermal ablation), but long-term outcomes in patients with venous leg ulcers are unknown.</p>
              <p>Extended follow-up was performed for participants in the EVRA trial to evaluate the influence of early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux on outcomes up to 5 years for participants with venous leg ulcers.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Population</title>
                <p>This parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 centers in the United Kingdom (trial protocol in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 1</xref> and eTable 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>), where potential participants were screened from October 24, 2013, to September 27, 2016. Eligible participants had venous leg ulceration that had been present for 6 weeks to 6 months in addition to significant superficial venous reflux as assessed by the treating clinician. All trial centers had established leg ulcer referral and treatment pathways and were able to provide endovenous intervention within 2 weeks.</p>
                <p>The study design and 1-year outcomes of the EVRA trial have been published previously.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Extended follow-up was approved by the South West-Central Bristol Research Ethics Committee on May 24, 2017. The independent trial steering committee and independent data and safety monitoring committees were retained to provide ongoing oversight for the study extension. All patients provided written informed consent for long-term follow-up at randomization, and this consent was reaffirmed for all participants contacted for long-term data collection. The EVRA trial was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme, and the funder of the study had no role in design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. During protocol development, a patient focus group was used to guide study design, and a patient was also included as a member of the trial steering committee. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/consort/">CONSORT</ext-link>) reporting guideline.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to receive compression therapy and endovenous ablation within 2 weeks (early-intervention group) or to receive compression therapy alone with deferred endovenous ablation once the ulcer had healed, or after 6 months if the ulcer had not healed (deferred-intervention group). Randomization sequences were created in advance for each center by a trial statistician, and randomly permuted blocks were used with 2 block sizes. Surgeons, participants, and follow-up assessors were not blinded to the treatment group. Photographic verification for healing of primary ulceration was performed by clinical experts blinded to treatment allocation.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="H2-3-SOI200064">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>Wound care and compression therapy were guided by local protocols, and multilayer elastic compression (2, 3, or 4 layers), short-stretch bandaging, and compression hosiery were all accepted. The endovenous treatment was left to the discretion of the responsible clinical teams, with endovenous thermal ablation modalities (laser or radiofrequency ablation), ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, or nonthermal nontumescent endovenous interventions performed alone or in combination. Decisions regarding treatment of branch varicosities or perforators were left to physician choice. EVRA trial centers had extensive experience in performing endovenous ablation procedures. Participants in the early-intervention group underwent follow-up duplex ultrasound assessment 6 weeks after endovenous ablation, and additional interventions for superficial venous reflux in either group were performed at the discretion of the treating clinical teams. All participants were advised to use compression hosiery after ulcer healing, guided by local policy; additional duplex ultrasound assessment was not in the study protocol.</p>
                <p>Telephone follow-up for all living participants was performed between October 2018 and March 2019 to obtain primary and secondary end point data. Where possible, participants in the EVRA trial were reminded at the 12-month visit to record any recurrent ulcers and health care visits in a participant diary to aid in subsequent recall. In the extended-phase follow-up, participants were asked on the telephone (using a standardized questionnaire) about ulcer recurrences (defined as any wound on the study leg) and asked to recall dates of recurrence, subsequent healing, and details of additional treatments. Hospital and community clinical records were reviewed for further verification, and further calls were made to participants to clarify discrepancies.</p>
                <p>A disease-specific quality-of-life assessment (Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire) and 2 generic quality-of-life assessments (the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) (eTable 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) were performed between October 2018 and March 2019 (either on telephone or by mail). Adverse events were recorded in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses of the data were performed from August 11, 2019, to November 4, 2019. The trial was designed to detect a 15% absolute difference in ulcer-healing rates at 24 weeks (assuming a 60% rate of ulcer healing in participants randomized to compression alone) with 90% power and 2-sided alpha level of 5%. Assuming 90% of the participants in the EVRA trial would achieve ulcer healing and 15% losses to follow-up, death, or withdrawal from the study, we estimated that 344 participants would be available for analysis of ulcer recurrence. For extended follow-up analysis, we calculated that this was sufficient to detect a 15% difference in ulcer recurrence (30% in the early-intervention group vs 45% in the deferred-intervention group) with 82% power or a 20% difference in ulcer recurrence (30% in the early-intervention group and 50% in the deferred-intervention group) with 97% power.</p>
                <p>The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in time to ulcer recurrence between the early-intervention group and the deferred-intervention group. This was tested using Cox regression with center as a random effect and participant age, ulcer size, and chronicity as fixed effects. We used Cox regression, adjusted as mentioned, to test for differences in time to healing of primary ulcer and recurrent ulcers. Ulcer recurrence rates (unadjusted) were calculated at annual time points up to 4 years with 95% CIs using the Kaplan-Meier method.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Moreover, the incidence rate of recurrent ulcers (ulcers per person-years) and incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs were calculated. Ulcer-free time was defined as the total number of days that the reference leg remained healed during the entire follow-up period. We used a Cox regression model adjusted for center, patient age, ulcer size, and ulcer chronicity, as mentioned, as well as length of follow-up (as a fixed effect) to test the hypothesis that there was no difference in ulcer-free time between the early-intervention and deferred-intervention groups. Participants who did not consent to the extended follow-up are included to 12 months only. Adverse events were recorded.</p>

All analyses were performed on intention-to-treat. Participants whose primary ulcer did not heal were not eligible for analysis for ulcer recurrence, but were included in all other secondary analyses. There were no statistical adjustments for multiple testing. We performed per-protocol analyses for time to ulcer healing and time to first ulcer recurrence, and statistical significance was set at 5%.</p>

                <p>Of the 426 participants whose leg ulcer had healed, 121 (28.4%) experienced at least 1 recurrence.

Early intervention was therefore a dominant strategy, with lower mean cost and greater mean QALY benefit. Findings were similar for 4-year and 5-year horizons (eTable 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>) and with a per-protocol analysis (eTable 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>), although the difference in QALY was smaller at 3 years using an alternative tariff for EQ-5D-5L (eTable 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-SOI200064-1-s">Supplement 2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>One-year results from the EVRA trial showed that early ablation of superficial venous reflux accelerated healing of venous leg ulcers.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Longer-term follow-up in this study demonstrated that fewer recurrent ulcers per year of follow-up occurred in the early-intervention group, even though the time to first ulcer recurrence did not differ between the groups. The total mean costs were lower in the early-intervention group, and participants reported higher QALYs, indicating that early intervention is highly likely to be cost-effective irrespective of the willingness-to-pay threshold used by the health care system.</p>
              <p>Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy was the most common endovenous treatment in this trial, and some studies have reported high rates of technical failure compared with other endovenous modalities or open varicose vein surgery.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The 4-year ulcer recurrence rates in this trial are comparable to those of previous studies evaluating ulcer recurrence after open varicose vein surgery, and outcomes in both groups of the EVRA trial are favorable compared with outcomes with compression alone.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> These findings support the strategy adopted in this study, where the choice of endovenous modality was left to the discretion of the treating clinician. Ablating superficial venous reflux is likely to be more important than the choice of modality.</p>
              <sec id="H2-11-SOI200064">
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>The health economic benefits of early intervention demonstrated in this trial are particularly compelling because the premise of a less costly treatment strategy that offers more QALYs is an important driver for change in behavior irrespective of the country or health care system. The method of follow-up is a limitation of this study, as only telephone follow-up at a single time point after 1 year was possible owing to funding limitations; photographic assessment was not deemed feasible. However, most participants in this trial were kept under regular surveillance by recruiting centers as part of normal clinical care, resulting in accurately recorded outcome data. One-fifth of the participants in the deferred-intervention group did not undergo endovenous intervention at all. It is difficult to predict whether clinical outcomes would have been better if all participants had been treated, but delaying intervention was associated with fewer participants undergoing endovenous ablation. The results of this study reinforce the conclusions from the 1-year EVRA results, that early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux is highly beneficial for both patients and health care professionals. These observations indicate that a policy of deferred or delayed endovenous intervention is illogical for patients with venous ulceration.</p>
                <p>Long-term outcomes beyond 4 years remain unknown. Because chronic venous hypertension is multifactorial, ulcer recurrence is likely to be a common event in this population, despite endovenous ablation. Thirty percent of participants recruited to the EVRA trial suffered recurrent ulcers during follow-up. Aggressive investigation and treatment of venous outflow obstruction have been advocated, and the use of venous stents to correct nonthrombotic and post-thrombotic deep venous occlusive disease is increasing in popularity but requires robust evaluation.<sup><xref rid="soi200064r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="soi200064r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although there may be a role for deep vein stenting in some patients with venous ulceration, excellent healing outcomes were achieved in the EVRA trial cohort with combined good compression therapy and superficial venous ablation. It should also be noted that patients with concomitant arterial disease, foot ulceration, or those not compliant with compression were not included.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In this randomized clinical trial, early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux in addition to compression therapy reduced time to ulcer healing for primary ulcers. We found no statistical evidence that early endovenous ablation reduces time to first ulcer recurrence, but it was associated with a reduced incidence rate of recurrent ulcers and is highly likely to be cost-effective in the management of venous leg ulceration.</p>
