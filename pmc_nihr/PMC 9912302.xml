                  <title>Main measures</title>
                  <p>Feasibility measures included recruitment and retention rates, intervention
fidelity and attrition. Outcomes collected at baseline, 3 weeks and 12 weeks
tested measures including Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living
Scale. Acceptability was explored through qualitative interviews and
structured questions.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Eighty (31%) patients were eligible, 57 (71%) consented, 54 randomised
(40:13, +1 exclusion) and 39 (74%) completed 12-week outcomes. Treatment
fidelity was good: participants received median eight intervention sessions
(IQR: 5, 12) lasting 4.7âmin (IQR: 4.1, 5.0). All six serious adverse events
were unrelated. There was no signal that patients allocated to intervention
did better than controls. Twenty five of 35 recruited carers provided
outcomes with excellent data completeness. Therapists, patients and carers
found prism adaptation training acceptable.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>It is feasible and acceptable to conduct a high-quality definitive trial of
prism adaptation training within occupational therapy early after stroke in
usual care setting, but difficult to justify given no sign of benefit over
standard occupational therapy.</p>

              <p>There is no robust evidence that any therapy reduces the disabling effects of spatial
inattention (also known as spatial neglect), a cognitive syndrome affecting
awareness towards one side of the body or environment.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> National UK audit data from
88,000 hospitalised stroke survivors suggests at least a third screen positive for
inattention.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The latter have a longer length of stay and greater
dependency at discharge than those screening negative.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Neglect/inattention (hereafter
referred to as inattention as preferred by our patient advisory group) may hinder
active participation in rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> An ideal intervention would be
an adjunct that, if added at the start of regular occupational therapy sessions,
primes the attentional system, enabling patients to engage in therapy.</p>
              <p>Prism adaptation training is purported to show short-term relief of spatial deficits
but clinical effectiveness has not been evaluated within adequately powered
trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> During prism adaptation, patients point at targets wearing prism
glasses which shift their vision laterally. After initially misreaching, they
compensate, recalibrating their pointing movements (adaptation). Prisms are then
removed and the resulting improvement in cognitive tests and behavioural
tasks<sup><xref rid="bibr9-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> can persist

This paper reports A Study of Prisms And Therapy In Attention Loss after stroke
(SPATIAL), a study investigating the feasibility and acceptability of prism
adaptation training as an adjunctive intervention early after stroke. Specific
objectives were: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Determine the feasibility of a future Phase III randomised controlled

              <p>This was a pragmatic, feasibility Phase II multi-centre stratified randomised
controlled trial with nested process evaluation, designed with collaborative level
patient involvement. The study was approved by the Yorkshire and the Humber NHS
Research Ethics Committee (18/YH/048) and entered on the ISRCTN registry, <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN88395268" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN88395268</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>We monitored trial quality and conduct with a Trial Management Group and an external
Trial Steering Committee. ABa, a stroke survivor, worked with the research team in
designing the study and was a co-applicant on the grant. ABa identified and chaired
a dedicated Patient Carer and Public Involvement advisory group of six stroke
survivors, which met ten times during the study. The advisory group provided input
on all research activities, from documentation through to dissemination. ABa also
represented the group on the trial management group. Two stroke survivors,
independent of the advisory group, were members of the trial steering committee.</p>
              <p>Participants were recruited between March 2019 and January 2020 with phased site
opening. Data collection ended in April 2020. Follow-up assessments took place 3 and
12 weeks after the start of intervention. Reporting follows the CONSORT 2010
statement: extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692155221134060" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental material</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>We recruited participants from NHS in-patient stroke services (provided across 10
acute hospitals and linked rehabilitation facilities) in England. Patients were
eligible if they were over 18 years old; had a confirmed stroke (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic); positive for spatial inattention at routine screening; had spatial
inattention impacting on functional performance; at least one week post-stroke;
eligible for standard occupational therapy (for at least one session); able to
provide informed consent (or personal/professional consultee available); able to sit
with support and perform brief research intervention (e.g. sufficient vision,
physical mobility and cognition to be able to participate).</p>
              <p>Initially we only included in-patients who were one to four weeks post-stroke but in
August 2019 obtained approval for an amendment to widen eligibility beyond four
weeks post-stroke. Staff taking consent followed the Mental Capacity Act
(2005)<sup><xref rid="bibr14-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> principles and British Psychological Society guidelines when
recruiting participants who lacked capacity to consent.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Participants were excluded if
they were receiving or expected to receive end of life care; or discharge
anticipated before at least one therapy session. Adult informal carers of patient
participants were also invited to participate.</p>
              <p>NHS occupational therapists identified in-patients with spatial inattention as part
of routine clinical care, screening patients for inattention on admission as per
each local site practice. NHS research support staff then screened patients for full
trial eligibility and gained consent. We used accessible information sheets and
consent forms designed with our patient advisory group, alongside consultee
declarations for participants deemed unable to give informed consent. NHS research
support staff collected standard demographic and clinical data following recruitment
including National Institutes of Health Scale (NIHSS). Occupational therapists
completed baseline assessments as soon as possible after consent. Occupational
therapists also provided a subjective assessment of the severity of patient's
inattention on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) using a combination of
functional observations and their clinical judgement. Participants no longer
displaying inattention at the baseline assessments were withdrawn prior to
randomisation.</p>

              <p>We allocated treatment using a 3:1 ratio stratified by site (3 intervention: 1
control), using an independent, web-based, third-party (<ext-link xlink:href="www.sealedenvelope.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>) randomisation service. NHS research support
staff performed randomisation following consent and baseline assessment and informed
the participant and treating occupational therapist of allocation. Patient
participants, treating therapists, the study team and randomising member of NHS
research support staff were therefore unblinded to treatment allocation.</p>
              <p>For participants in the intervention arm, prism adaptation training was offered once
a day at the start of routine occupational therapy sessions, for up to three weeks,
five days a week. The training lasted no more than 5âmin plus set up time (seating
the participants and fitting the glasses). Participants sat at a table in front of a
semi-circular board raised approximately 18â26âcm off the table. Participants wore
25 dioptre (12.5Â°) wedge prism glasses adjusted for left or right sided inattention
as appropriate. Occupational therapists or therapy assistants presented a target at
the opposite end of the board and asked the participant to reach under the board to
touch the target, concealing all but the terminal part of the patient's arm. The
therapist presented the target in an unpredictable order and participants pointed to
the target for a maximum of 90 movements, or if movements were slow for â¤5âmin. The
prisms were removed after the pointing task. Details of the prism adaptation session
were recorded, including location, delivering staff member, number of movements and
length of session.</p>
              <p>We trained in-patient occupational therapists and therapy assistants in intervention
delivery. We also trained community staff to provide the intervention on discharge
if required. A member of the research team was present for the first prism
adaptation training session for each participant. See Template for Intervention
Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692155221134060" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental material</ext-link>) for additional detail on the
intervention.</p>
              <p>Following prism removal, participants then received standard occupational therapy. In
consultation with therapists, we specified that therapy following prism adaptation
should be patient-facing activities in which inattention would affect participation.
These were either activities focused on reducing inattention or, for example,
functional activities of daily living training in which inattention would affect
performance. Non-patient facing therapy activities (e.g. family meetings) were not
performed following prism adaptation and staff were asked not to perform prism
adaptation prior to standardised or functional assessments where the intervention
could impact performance. The treating occupational therapist recorded the
frequency, amount and content of each occupational therapy session the participant
received during the three-week period using a study-specific data collection
form.</p>
              <p>The control group received standard occupational therapy (with no prism adaptation
training), using the same type of patient-facing activities as the intervention
group. Therapy staff recorded the sessions in the same way as the intervention group
for the three-week period. In both groups therapy was personalised in line with the
National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> which suggest patients who
need and can tolerate it should accumulate at least 45âmin of each appropriate
therapy every day. Participants in both groups also received other recommended
rehabilitation based on individual need (e.g. physiotherapy, speech and language
therapy) as per the Guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> We did not collect data on
additional therapies received.</p>
              <p>We collected data on candidate outcome measures at three time points. Occupational
therapists completed the baseline assessment; NHS research support staff or the
study research team collected 3- and 12-week outcomes, either in hospital or at the
participant's residence if transferred from in-patient care. The COVID-19 lockdown
prevented face-to-face collection of the last few outcome measures however it was
possible to collect some by phone. We trained all staff required on baseline and
outcome assessment delivery. Outcomes were collected by staff unaware of the patient
group where possible.</p>
              <p>We collected the following assessments from patient participants at all three

              <p>We collected data to support the process evaluation through brief structured verbal
questions with all patient participants receiving prism adaptation training at 3
weeks post-intervention; and a purposive sample of face-to-face qualitative
interviews with seven patient and five carer participants at 12 weeks; and telephone
interviews with a purposive sample of 10 occupational therapists following delivery
of at least one prism adaptation training session.</p>
              <p>Responses to structured questions were coded by PM and JW to identify key phrases and
frequency of these across the data. We uploaded transcribed qualitative interview
data to NVivo (version 13). Through repeated reading of the transcripts ED and JT
familiarised themselves with the data to identify initial codes. Following initial
coding, a discussion and comparison was undertaken whereby a consensus was reached,
and six themes identified using thematic analysis.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p>
              <p>As a Phase II feasibility trial, we did not have a predetermined sample size.
Instead, we predicted a recruitment total of 60â80, based on 1â2 participants per
month from each site for 12 months (allowing for phased site opening). We reported
percentages to assess recruitment, fidelity and attrition. We calculated mean
difference and 95% confidence interval for our primary and secondary outcomes on an
intention-to-treat basis. We sought outcome data for all participants regardless of
treatment adherence unless consent to follow-up was explicitly withdrawn. As there
were small numbers of participants, we could not adjust analyses for site
(stratification criteria) and baseline severity as planned. Therefore, we used
unadjusted regression to obtain the mean difference and 95% CI of the difference for
each outcome assessment at T2. We used Stata 14 statistical software.</p>

              <p>Thirty-five carers consented to take part in the study. One of these was a carer for
a patient who was ineligible at baseline; the carer was therefore also ineligible.
Of eligible patient participants, 34 (64%) had an identified and recruited carer
(see <xref rid="fig2-02692155221134060" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Baseline patient participant characteristics are presented in <xref rid="table1-02692155221134060" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The groups were similar in terms
of demographic and clinical variables at baseline. The sample had predominantly left
inattention (48/53, 91%) and moderate stroke severity on admission with a median
NIHSS of 13 (IQR: 6, 17). Participants were recruited from in-patient services a
median 15 (IQR: 11, 21) days post-stroke. Two patient participants were discharged
prior to the start of the intervention period. Missing data at baseline was minimal,
however routinely collected NIHSS sub-score for inattention was missing for eight
(15%) patient participants.</p>
              <p>Prior to the stroke, eight (24%) carers were not living with the patient participant.
Carers were recruited early post-stroke; 13 (38%) were carers of patient
participants who had not been discharged to the patient's own home at the 12-week
time point. Patient and carer participants generally found recruitment early after
stroke acceptable, however some mentioned in the qualitative interviews that
deciding to participate was difficult whilst adapting to the stroke. Occupational
therapists found the process of identifying participants acceptable and found
training beneficial to support study processes.</p>
              <p>Prism adaptation training was delivered by occupational therapy staff at all eligible
in-patient sites and at three of the six trained community stroke services as part
of standard occupational therapy. Two of the three community services provided prism
adaptation in participantsâ own homes (nine sessions in total) and one provided it
(two sessions in total) in a care home where the participant was residing. Prism
adaptation training was generally well recorded and delivered as intended: it took a
median of 4.7âmin (IQR: 4.1, 5.0) and participants made approximately 71.4 (SD 20.0)
pointing movements per session. Participants received a median of eight sessions
(IQR: 5, 12). Of 322 prism adaptation training sessions offered, only 11 (3%) were
declined. Most prism adaptation training sessions took place at the bedside (median
50%, IQR: 13, 77). Minor clinical protocol deviations were that one participant was
recorded as having prism adaptation training twice in one day and six participants
had it for more than three weeks (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692155221134060" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental material</ext-link>). Of the 40 eligible participants randomised
to prism adaptation training there are data for 38 (one withdrawal prior to first
intervention, one became unwell).</p>

              <p>We found patient participants generally reported the intervention to be acceptable.
In qualitative interviews, patient participants spoke enthusiastically about prism
adaptation with a theme of being motivated by an element of personal
challenge/competition through repeated intervention sessions. Interviews with
occupational therapists confirmed patients found the intervention enjoyable. We
identified a theme of perceived benefits of prism adaptation training, with some
patients and carers reporting patients were focussing better and having increased
awareness following prism adaptation. Seven of 31 participants who completed the
structured questions reported finding prism adaptation training tiring, which was
also mentioned by one occupational therapist in the qualitative interviews. Both
patients and occupational therapists commented on the need for a quiet environment
to facilitate concentration on prism adaptation training (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692155221134060" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental material</ext-link> for thematic table).</p>
              <p>Standard occupational therapy sessions lasted a mean (SD) of 33.3 (13.1) and 36.4
(12.6) minutes in the intervention and control group, respectively. However, data
collection for standard occupational therapy included missing, incomplete and
inconsistent data so we are not certain participants in the two arms of the study
received equal amounts of therapy time. Sessions were most frequently carried out at
the bedside delivered by an individual occupational therapist and included the
expected range of therapy activities the most common being ADLs, process training,
mobility and upper limb (see <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/02692155221134060" ext-link-type="uri">Supplemental material</ext-link>).</p>
              <p>Attrition was low with three-week outcomes collected from 47 (89%) and 12-week
outcomes from 39 (74%) patient participants (see <xref rid="fig1-02692155221134060" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). NHS research support staff
completed 23 (49%) of the three-week outcomes; and 11/39 (28%) of the 12-week
assessments. The University team completed the remaining assessments. Some sites
were unable to offer any support with outcome assessments and few were able to
assess participants in the community post-discharge.</p>
              <p>Forty-one (87%) of 3-week assessments and 31 (79%) at 12 weeks were completed by
assessors who recorded that they were unblinded. It was not possible for the NHS
research support staff to remain blinded to the study arm as in most instances they
were performing the randomisation. Staff were mostly unblinded by the fact that they
had been involved in the randomisation process or were members of the University
team who had been present at the first prism adaptation training session.</p>
              <p>The candidate primary outcome measure, the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily
Living scale at 12 weeks was carried out with all 39 patient participants followed
up, with excellent data completion (only missing data for one participant on one of
21 items). Approximately one-third (36%) of participants assessed at 12 weeks were
not in their own home (i.e. they were in hospital, rehabilitation unit or care home)
and thus not performing many of the extended activities of daily living covered by
the measure. Mean differences and confidence intervals on outcome measures are
reported in <xref rid="table2-02692155221134060" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.

outcome assessments.</p>
              <p>There were six serious adverse events affecting five participants (four intervention;
one control), all of which were assessed by the local Principal Investigators and
Chief Investigator as unrelated to the study.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We demonstrated that it would be feasible and acceptable to conduct a definitive
trial of a rehabilitation intervention for stroke survivors with inattention,
delivered by NHS occupational therapists, beginning very early after stroke in the
inpatient usual care rehabilitation setting. We established realistic estimates of
recruitment (maximum 2 patients per site per month), retention, data completeness
and participant characteristics, and provided data to inform the primary outcome
measure and calculate sample size for future trials in this population.</p>
              <p>It was not possible for NHS research support staff to complete all outcome
assessments, nor for outcome assessors to remain blinded. Attrition in the study was
low. Treatment fidelity for prism adaptation training was good in terms of duration
and timing of delivery, however recording of the content of occupational therapy
sessions was incomplete and needs some revision. Study procedures and prism
intervention delivery were acceptable to patients, carers and therapists.</p>
              <p>Although the study was not powered to give a conclusion on the effectiveness of prism
adaptation training, none of the outcome measures showed any sign of benefit from
intervention. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept study (reported separately) did not
find evidence to suggest improved engagement in occupational therapy following one
session of prism adaptation training. Thus, we cannot justify taking prism
adaptation training, provided as per this study and with this early post-stroke
population, to a definitive trial.</p>
              <p>There are several potential explanations for our findings. There is no standard
protocol for prism adaptation delivery, for example, some studies delivered 10 or
more sessions per day over two weeks<sup><xref rid="bibr28-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> whilst others used a single
session.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Length of session also varies, ranging from 5<sup><xref rid="bibr30-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> to
30âmin.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Participants in our study received a median of eight sessions
lasting just under 5âmin each over three weeks. Other randomised controlled trials
using a similar dose found no immediate<sup><xref rid="bibr31-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> nor lasting effects<sup><xref rid="bibr13-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> on cognitive
or functional outcomes, however no trial has used it as adjunctive to routine
therapy as in this study. It appears that the longer and more frequent the
treatment, the more lasting the effects, therefore more intensive treatment may be
required for carryover to subsequent therapy sessions.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> This may be impractical in
real-world inpatient settings as part of routine therapy.</p>
              <p>In addition, time since stroke and physical ability early post-stroke may influence
the effect of prism adaptation. Fatigue early post-stroke may mean a higher
dose/intensity of prism adaptation is not well tolerated, particularly because
people with inattention often have more severe strokes and premorbid
difficulties.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Equally, one-third (33%) of patients who screened positive
for inattention were ineligible for our study because they were physically unable to
carry out the intervention. Participants in studies suggesting effectiveness with
intensive treatment were longer post-stroke than our study,<sup><xref rid="bibr34-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> therefore
level of physical ability may be a limiting factor of usefulness for prism
adaptation training in the early stroke population.</p>
              <p>Although the sample size of this feasibility study lacks statistical power to
identify small but realistic and potentially worthwhile effects, our conclusions are
underpinned by our adequately powered proof of concept analysis (reported
separately) which ruled out a measurable effect on immediate patient engagement in
occupational therapy. The study targeted a potential sample size of 60â80
participants, which resulted in 53 eligible and consenting people. This demonstrated
it would be feasible to recruit to a definitive study in the post-acute stage with a
slightly longer recruitment window. Whilst our study reflects some existing
findings, most existing randomised controlled trials have small samples, many with
less than 50 participants, and therefore comparisons should be treated with
caution.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-02692155221134060" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Our choice of outcome assessments may provide limitations. Many participants assessed
at 12 weeks were still in hospital, limiting the number of activities of daily
living they could report completing on the primary outcome. This also impacted on
the relevance of collecting outcome data from carer participants. Despite training,
some assessments were not carried out in line with standardised instructions,
particularly at baseline (e.g. asking participants to cancel large rather than small
stars).</p>
              <p>Despite concluding that prism adaptation training, as provided by this study, is not
a candidate intervention for a definitive trial, we stress alternative
rehabilitation interventions for people with inattention early after stroke are
needed. We recommend exploring how patients assessed as physically or cognitively
unable to participate in the intervention might be able to benefit from future
interventions for inattention. We identified several methodological changes for a
future trial, including: choice or timing of most appropriate primary outcome early
post-stroke; facilities such as quiet space away from the bedside to facilitate
effective intervention delivery; and a need for outcome assessors employed as part
of the research team. Blinded assessors are expensive to achieve in rehabilitation
trials and trade-offs are required.</p>
