                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Shoulder pain due to irreparable rotator cuff tears can cause substantial disability, but treatment options are limited. A balloon spacer is a relatively simple addition to a standard arthroscopic debridement procedure, but it is costly and there is no current randomised trial evidence to support its use. This trial will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a subacromial balloon spacer for individuals undergoing arthroscopic debridement for irreparable rotator cuff tears.</p>
                  <p>New surgical procedures can provide substantial benefit to patients. Good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed, but trials in surgery are typically long and expensive, exposing patients to risk and the healthcare system to substantial costs. One way to improve the efficiency of trials is with an adaptive sample size. Such methods are well established in drug trials but have rarely, if ever, been used in surgical trials.</p>

                  <p>Subacromial spacer for Tears Affecting Rotator cuff Tendons: a Randomised, Efficient, Adaptive Clinical Trial in Surgery (START:REACTS) is a participant and assessor blinded, adaptive, multicentre RCT comparing arthroscopic debridement with the InSpace balloon (Stryker, USA) to arthroscopic debridement alone for people with a symptomatic irreparable rotator cuff tear. It uses a group sequential adaptive design where interim analyses are performed using all of the 3, 6 and 12-month data that are available at each time point. A maximum of 221 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio), this will provide 90% power (at the 5% level) for a 6 point difference in the primary outcome; the Oxford Shoulder Score at 12 months. A substudy will use deltoid-active MRI scans in 56 participants to assess the function of the balloon. Analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis and reported according to principles established in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement.</p>

                <p>Shoulder pain is a common and disabling problem. The UK population prevalence of shoulder pain is approximately 16%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Rotator cuff disease accounts for 70%–85% of this.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref> People with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear typically have pain, restricted movement, loss of strength and disability. The condition is associated with substantial expense to society through both costs of treatment and loss of work (both paid and unpaid).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> Rotator cuff repair is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic rotator cuff tears.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Some tears cannot be surgically repaired, these are called irreparable tears.</p>
                <p>Symptomatic irreparable rotator cuff tears are a challenging condition to treat. Treatment options including physiotherapy, injections, arthroscopic debridement, partial repair, muscle transfers, interposition grafts and even shoulder replacements.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref> Arthroscopic debridement is commonly used and case series suggest it may be beneficial, but it remains a controversial option, with little randomised controlled trial (RCT) data on its use in the irreparable tear population.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref>
</p>
                <p>In 2013, the InSpace subacromial balloon spacer (Stryker, Michigan, USA) was introduced into UK orthopaedic practice as a potential treatment option for people with irreparable tears of the rotator cuff. In May 2016, an interventional procedure guidance document was published by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which found that there was very limited evidence for its use. Therefore, the device was limited to research use only and a recommendation was made to assess its effectiveness.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It has not yet received US Food and Drug Administration clearance in the USA, but it is a widely used treatment elsewhere in the world.</p>
                <p>The InSpace device is a saline-filled balloon made of biodegradable (dissolvable) synthetic material. It is inserted above the main joint of the shoulder at the end of an arthroscopic debridement after an irreparable tear has been identified. It is simple to deploy and adds relatively little time to the operation.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> It cushions the humerus from pressing on the bone above it (the acromion) when the deltoid is active and during abduction of the arm, potentially reducing pain. It may also assist in the biomechanics of the shoulder, resisting proximal migration of the humerus under deltoid activity. The device begins to degrade and deflate from 3 months after surgery. During this time, it is thought to improve rehabilitation of the remaining rotator cuff and deltoid, so that when the device deflates, the biomechanics of the shoulder are better preserved.</p>
                <p>The safety of the device in rodents has been established, with only one adverse event (AE): a fibrosarcoma that was thought to be unique to rodents.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Proof of concept has been established in a series of 24 irreparable cuff tear cases in Slovakia in 2012, with 5-year follow-up results published in 2016.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> The device has been used in a number of centres across the UK, with multiple conference abstracts from the UK.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> These have demonstrated improvements in outcomes from baseline. Complications such as balloon displacement and non-cyst forming synovitis have been reported in a small number of cases (3 out of 61). One retrospective non-randomised study of 23 patients (12 with the balloon) showed an improvement in outcomes compared with debridement alone.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There are no completed RCTs.</p>
                <p>The benefits found in case series may not be unique to the InSpace balloon, although the relative effectiveness of the balloon in comparison to non-operative care or acromioplasty is not known and it could give substantial improvements.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
                <p>There is one other RCT in progress for this device—a company funded study in the USA which will recruit 184 participants, comparing partial cuff repair with balloon as a stand-alone intervention. Results are expected in mid-2020. Partial cuff repair is not a technique that is widely used in the UK and is not an appropriate comparator in a UK context.</p>

                <title>Trial designs in new surgical procedures</title>
                <p>The safe introduction of new surgical procedures are essential to the delivery of high quality surgical care for patients. New procedures can result in a step-change improvement in treatment, but also introduce new risks and substantial costs. Major harm can be done when a misunderstood or well-intentioned intervention is used widely across the health service before it is formally evaluated.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref>
</p>
                <p>While pharmaceuticals must undergo rigorous clinical trials before introduction, this is not the case for surgical procedures.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> When surgical procedures are assessed rigorously, studies tend to be large multicentre, randomised trials which typically need to recruit over extended time periods.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 31</xref> Improvements in the efficiency of delivering trials of surgical interventions would provide earlier answers to these important clinical questions, providing benefits to patients and making better use of healthcare resources.</p>
                <p>The use of adaptive trial designs has been encouraged by major journals, the US Food and Drug Administration, and National Institute of Health Research panels.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–34</xref> Adaptive trial designs allow prospectively planned modifications, such as stopping the study early or dropping an intervention, based on emerging findings as the trial proceeds, while preserving the scientific validity and integrity of the trial. This flexible strategy typically reduces costs and shortens time scales, without compromising the integrity, statistical power or rigour of the study.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 35–37</xref>
</p>
                <p>In this trial, we are using a novel statistical adaptive design approach for the assessment of a new surgical procedure. The statistical principles are laid out in a 2019 methodology paper.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Briefly, the design uses early (3 and 6-month Oxford Shoulder Score, OSS) endpoint data to support emerging outcome data for the primary endpoint (12-month OSS) to make decisions about stopping for either futility or efficacy at preplanned interim analyses that occur before the end of recruitment. In the current study, we will apply these design principles to a multi-centre clinical trial of a new surgical procedure.</p>

                <p>Patient involvement has been a core part of the design and delivery of the study, and will remain so, including in the interpretation and dissemination of results. In the planning stages, we engaged with multiple patients who had previously undergone rotator cuff surgery and their insights helped establish the design of the study, especially the outcomes. We reviewed patient facing materials with many shoulder patients before they were finalised. One of the coauthors is a patient and represents the patient view in trial management meetings, two patients sit on our steering committee. We will produce patient and public-focused summaries of the research and disseminate this widely.</p>

                  <p>The OSS at 12 months. The original study design was based around the Constant score, however the trial management group decided in March 2020, in light of the coronavirus outbreak, to revise this to the OSS. As the Constant score is a face-to-face measure usually taken in hospital clinics, it would have exposed participants to unnecessary risk during the height of the pandemic. The decision was agreed by both the TSCs and DMCs prior to the change.</p>
                  <p>The OSS has been well validated and used in high-impact randomised trials previously, it correlates well with the Constant score, both are similarly responsive and have comparable effect sizes in rotator cuff pathology.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39–43</xref> Based on our meta-analysis of outcomes for randomised trials, shoulder scores typically reach a plateau at 12 months after any intervention for a rotator cuff tear.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The 24-month scores do not give sufficient additional value to justify the increase in costs and delay in the trial result that would be required had 24 months been used as the primary outcome.</p>

A minimisation algorithm is used to determine participant allocation, using site, gender, age group (&lt;70 years and ≥70 years) and cuff tear size (as assessed by the operating surgeon, ≥3 cm or &lt;3 cm) as factors, with a random element included to provide a 70% chance that the participant will receive the treatment that minimises the imbalance, to ensure unpredictability.</p>

                <p>Treatment allocation will be blinded for both patients and assessors, only the surgical teams at the time of the operation will be aware of the allocation. Theatre staff are asked not to discuss the balloon and to communicate the allocation by using methods such as holding up a piece of paper on which the allocation is clearly written. If participants are awake, drapes are used to obscure the participant’s view and arthroscopic screens will be positioned in such a way that the patient is unable to see the procedure.</p>
                <p>The incisions required for the two operations are similar and there is no external way in which the patients will be able to detect the presence or absence of the balloon, except for the size of the lateral portal. One of the incisions (the lateral portal) will need to be slightly larger to insert the balloon—1.5 cm as opposed to 1 cm. A 1.5 cm incision will be used for all participants, which is a very small change from standard care and is very unlikely to have a negative effect on any participant. Incisions will therefore be the same for both groups.</p>
                <p>The operation note will be blinded to prevent accidental unblinding of the patient (eg, in the discharge information or during postoperative physiotherapy). A standard recommended operation note template will be given to all sites adjusted to fit their local operation note systems. The details of the operation related to the balloon will be recorded in a secure online form easily accessible to the surgeon.</p>
                <p>Unblinding may very rarely be required in an emergency situation, such as an overnight admission for suspected postoperative infection. Unblinding will be performed only by NHS staff in an emergency situation, by using a predefined web-based system, from a link inserted in the operation note. A two-way secure verification process will be performed using email, and an access code will be emailed only to an active NHS email address. A full explanation of the clinical circumstances and the need for access to data will be requested by the trial team for audit and monitoring purposes from the person who performed the unblinding, and the principal investigator for the site will be informed. The system has been designed and tested by the WCTU programming team to ensure that it is both secure and fully functional.</p>
                <p>Participants will be asked at the 12-month time point, after collection of the primary outcome, if they were aware of their allocation.</p>

                <title>MRI substudy</title>
                <p>Participants selected for inclusion in the MRI substudy will undergo two research MRI scans at 8 weeks and 6 months post-operatively. MRI scans were preferred to X-rays for this purpose as measures taken from X-rays would be prone to error, primarily due to variation in the angle between the shoulder joint and the beam of the X-ray. This will assess the mechanism of action of the balloon, when the balloons are likely to be still inflated (but when acute postoperative pain has subsided), and when they are likely to have fully deflated, to see if the proposed mechanism for ongoing improvement is maintained. Passive imaging alone will not be adequate to demonstrate the function of the balloon and imaging will also need to be performed when the deltoid muscle is active, producing a proximally directed force on the humerus.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref>
</p>
                <p>For this study, we have developed (and piloted) a novel dynamic approach to assessing the function of the rotator cuff using MRI imaging under a mild deltoid load, to specifically assess the mechanism of the balloon. A separate paper on the pilot study for the trial is in preparation and will describe these methods in more detail.</p>
                <p>All participants will be eligible (unless they have a contraindication to MRI, or do not want to take part in the substudy), but the substudy will only be undertaken at a proportion of participating sites. The primary outcome will be the minimum acromiohumeral distance on the ‘deltoid-active’ coronal sequences at 6 months, a reliable and proven measure.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55–57</xref> The balloon is expected to have deflated by 6 months.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Secondary measures will be acromiohumeral distance on passive images, and the change in acromio-humeral distance between active and passive images.

An unanticipated SADE (USADE) is defined as an SADE which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of this trial, AEs will be recorded for any participant where it is thought there may be a relationship between the trial interventions or the condition being studied (in this case, any shoulder condition or related to the anaesthetic).

Events will be followed up until the event has resolved or a final outcome has been reached.</p>
                <p>Where participants have been lost to follow-up at or beyond the 12-month time point, and data on AEs can therefore not be recorded, the participants general practitioner (GP) will be contacted and a short form requesting any information or health record that could be an AE will be requested from the GP, as well as confirmation of the current contact details of the participant.</p>

                <title>Power and sample size</title>
                <p>The initial sample size calculations were based on the Constant Score. The target difference that was chosen for the Constant Score was 10 units, as has been widely used for other trials, and the SD was taken to be 20, giving a moderate standardised mean difference of 0.5.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 23 59 60</xref> Anchor-based studies have estimated the target difference for the OSS as 6 and an SD of 12 has been observed in multiple studies, therefore, a moderate standardised mean difference of 0.5 remains appropriate.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41–43 60</xref>
</p>
                <p>For a costly invasive procedure of this nature, a smaller standardised mean difference is unlikely to be considered worthwhile. For a power of 90% and a (two-sided) type I error rate of 5% a study with a conventional fixed design (ie, with no possibility of stopping early), assuming an approximate normal distribution for the score data, would require 170 participants.</p>
                <p>In order to assess the design characteristics and estimate the required sample size for the planned adaptive design, we undertook a large simulation study (see Parsons <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As we expect correlations between time points (based on Karthikeyan <italic>et al)</italic> and effect sizes to be equivalent between the Constant Score and Oxford Scores, these simulations remain valid, despite the change of primary outcome score.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 60</xref> The simulations showed that an adaptive design that allowed the possibility of early stopping for efficacy and/or futility, was feasible for the START:REACTS study.</p>
                <p>Based on an assumed modest correlation between 3-month, 6-month and 12-month OSSs equal to 0.5, and SD of 12 for both three and 6-month scores, the simulations for the selected adaptive design indicated that 188 participants would be sufficient to detect a 6 point difference in OSS between treatment arms with 90% power, and 5% (two-sided) type I error rate. Allowing for 15% lost to follow-up, while striving to keep this below 10%, gives a maximum study sample size of 221.</p>
                <p>The sample size for the MRI substudy is based on the study by Gumina <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, where the minimum acromiohumeral distance had an SD of 1.72 mm. To observe a minimum important difference of 1.5 mm (larger than the minimum detectable change of 1.3 mm established elsewhere<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) with an alpha of 0.05 at 80% power, assuming a lost to follow-up at 6 months of 20%, requires 56 participants for the MRI substudy.</p>

                <p>The primary analysis will investigate differences in the OSS 12 months after surgery between the two treatment groups.

Briefly, if the study recruits to target, the method set out by Parsons <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> will be used to calculate the boundaries and if the study stops early, testing will proceed using boundaries calculated by the deletion method for overrunning analysis, described by Whitehead, with clinical inferences following directly from widely used methods for unbiased estimates and confidence intervals in group sequential trials.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64–66</xref>
</p>
                <p>The primary analysis will be augmented by calculating adjusted estimates of treatment group differences (with 95% CIs) for the OSS using a mixed-effects model.

The clinical question and adaptive design components were developed by AM, TL, SD, MU, HP, NP, NS, RSK, JM, IK and SG in close collaboration with JF throughout. These same coauthors developed the study methodology with EGM, JB, KM, HB and CEH. CEH leads the MRI substudy with AM. This protocol was written following the SPIRIT protocol guidance. AM is the chief investigator and main grant holder for this study.</p>

                <p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> Stryker is providing 50 free InSpace balloons for the study, to offset some of the costs of delivery of the study in participating hospitals. Contracts are in place to ensure the full independence of the trial team with regard to study design and delivery, analysis and reporting of results, aligning to the NIHR standard agreement. The chief investigator and multiple coauthors (HP, EGM, JB, JF, JM, CEH and MU) are applicants on another NIHR grant with similar contractual relationships with Stryker to support treatment costs but not research costs, in which the full independence of the trial team is protected by mutually agreed contracts. MU was Chair of the NICE accreditation advisory committee until March 2017 for which he received a fee. He is chief investigator or coinvestigator on multiple previous and current research grants from the National Institute for Health Research. He is an NIHR Senior Investigator. He is an editor of the NIHR journal series, and a member of the NIHR Journal Editors Group, for which he receives a fee.</p>
