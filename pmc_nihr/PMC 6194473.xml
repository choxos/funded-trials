                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>In adults, muscle disease (MD) is often a chronic long-term condition with no definitive cure. It causes wasting and weakness of the muscles resulting in a progressive decline in mobility, alongside other symptoms, and is typically associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). Previous research suggests that a psychological intervention, and in particular Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), may help improve QoL in MD. ACT is a newer type of cognitive behavioural treatment that aims to improve QoL by virtue of improvement in a process called psychological flexibility. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy of a guided self-help ACT programme for improving QoL in people with MD. Main secondary outcomes are mood, symptom impact, work and social adjustment and function at 9-week follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Muscle Disease is an assessor-blind, multicentre, two-armed, parallel-group RCT to assess the efficacy of ACT plus standard medical care (SMC) compared with SMC alone. Individuals with a diagnosis of one of four specific MDs, with a duration of at least 6 months and with mild to moderate anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score ≥8) will be recruited from UK-based MD clinics and MD patient support organisations. Participants will be randomised to either ACT plus SMC or SMC alone by an independent randomisation service. Participants will be followed up at 3, 6 and 9 weeks. Analysis will be intention to treat, conducted by the trial statistician who will be blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

                  <p>The study has received full ethical approval. Study results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and journal articles. Data obtained from the trial will enable clinicians and health service providers to make informed decisions regarding the efficacy of ACT for improving QoL for patients with MD.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Muscle diseases (MDs) are a group of primary disorders of the muscle, the majority of which are chronic and progressive. They affect approximately over 70 000 people (children and adults) in the UK.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The diagnosis of a specific MD is based on several criteria including the pattern of the muscle weakness, the muscle biopsy appearances and in some cases genetic testing. Four MDs, namely limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), Becker’s muscular dystrophy (BMD) (dystrophin deficiency), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), comprise a significant proportion of those seen in an adult muscle clinic. They are characterised by progressive limb muscle wasting and weakness that cause difficulties with mobility and physical functioning. Some MDs also involve bulbar muscles causing dysphagia, respiratory muscles causing respiratory compromise and cardiac muscle causing cardiac symptoms. As well as weakness, commonly reported symptoms include chronic pain, sleep disturbance and fatigue.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Unlike some MDs, these four MDs do not have additional multisystem or central nervous system involvement. At present, most MDs are without disease-modifying treatments or cures.</p>
                <p>Typically, people with MD report reduced quality of life (QoL) and may experience increased levels of anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> A systematic review of 26 studies highlighted that, compared with controls, people with MD had compromised QoL in all areas of functioning.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The degree of physical disability is a determinant of QoL in MDs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, clinical treatment is often directed at maintaining physical functioning. For example, physiotherapy and occupational therapy are applied to maximise remaining muscle function, and patients are monitored for any cardiac or respiratory problems that may need supportive treatment.</p>
                <p>However, physical disability does not explain all the variance in QoL.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 6 7</xref> Psychological variables such as illness beliefs,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> coping methods<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> and psychological flexibility<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> have been shown to account for variance in QoL. These findings are in line with a biopsychosocial model<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> where QoL is theorised to depend on the interaction of psychological factors with biological and social factors.</p>
                <p>The relationship between QoL and psychosocial factors in MD provides a treatment opportunity. In the absence of a direct cure for MD, psychological interventions may offer a way to enhance QoL. Encouragingly, a recent small randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a traditional cognitive behavioural intervention for improving fatigue in FSHD showed a beneficial effect on fatigue and QoL.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                <title>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</title>
                <p>Dependent on treatment aims, several types of psychological interventions may be helpful for people with MD.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a newer form of cognitive-behavioural approach that focuses on improving a process called psychological flexibility.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Psychological flexibility is “[…] the capacity to persist or to change behaviour in a way that includes conscious and open contact with thoughts and feelings, appreciates what the situation affords, and serves one’s goals and values”.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In observational studies, psychological flexibility has been shown to be predictive of positive outcomes (QoL and mood) and better functioning across a range of challenging contexts, such as living with chronic illness and chronic pain. A 4-month prospective observational study with a group of people with MD observed that psychological flexibility was predictive of change in life satisfaction and anxiety.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
                <p>Given its focus on improving psychological flexibility, ACT may prove beneficial for those with MD. In ACT, a number of treatment techniques are used to improve psychological flexibility including therapist interaction, mindfulness and functional analysis. These aim to: (1) help individuals become more aware of thoughts and feelings and their relationship to, in this case, their MD; (2) broaden the range of behaviours (often to include open and willing responses) that can be applied when in the presence of difficult thoughts and feelings and (3) help them to flexibly choose those behaviours that help them to make progress on their overarching goals and values.</p>
                <p>Several recent meta-analyses have suggested that ACT is an efficacious treatment for improving mood and QoL in mental health conditions<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> and chronic pain.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In chronic diseases, there is a growing evidence base,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> with encouraging results for trials with cancer,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> diabetes<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and epilepsy<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> populations. However, to date, most studies of ACT for chronic diseases have been of a preliminary nature (ie, small, uncontrolled and/or lower quality).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Thus, an adequately powered, rigorous evaluation of ACT for improving QoL in chronic diseases will be a helpful addition to the literature.</p>

                <title>The selection of a guided self-help approach</title>
                <p>The one comprehensive trial of a psychological intervention in MD<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> tested the efficacy of a 16-session traditional cognitive behavioural therapy for improving fatigue. While results were encouraging, on both fatigue and secondary outcomes such as QoL and mood, for several reasons (including the time spent travelling), uptake was low, and a proportion (24%) struggled to achieve even a minimal level of adherence to the intervention. This suggests that issues, perhaps mobility difficulties and treatment length, may hinder face-to-face treatment options for many with MD. A further problem with the development and implementation of any new treatment concerns the resource limitations common to many health service providers, including the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK.</p>
                <p>A practical solution to this problem could be the implementation of an intervention delivered remotely through online and computerised self-guided resources aided by telephone or video calls. Such methods of delivery are increasingly feasible given that the majority of UK households now have web access. In addition, recent systematic reviews suggest that promising results can be obtained from web-based interventions for adults with chronic illnesses and depression.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–27</xref> Web-based interventions not only remove the burden of travel but also allow the completion of material at a convenient place, time and pace. Remotely delivered interventions can be a cost-effective approach for providing treatment, increasing its chances of wider implementation.</p>
                <p>Given the potential benefits of using ACT within an MD population and taking into account potential barriers to participation, we developed, for this population, a brief self-guided intervention that can be supported remotely via email and telephone contact with a therapist. We assessed this in a preliminary multiple-baseline case series with seven participants.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The results of this case series suggested that such an approach was practicable and acceptable, and that mood and QoL might respond to this treatment. Given this promising evaluation, we plan to conduct an RCT, to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention for improving QoL in people living with MD.</p>
                <p>This protocol describes a multicentre, two-armed, parallel-group RCT to assess the efficacy of self-guided ACT in improving QoL in individuals with MDs. A total of 154 people referred from MD clinics, Muscular Dystrophy UK (MD-UK) and specific MD registries will be randomly allocated to receive either self-guided ACT plus standard medical care (SMC) or SMC alone. We hypothesise that the group who receive self-guided ACT plus SMC will report an improved QoL at the primary endpoint of 9 weeks follow-up compared with those receiving SMC alone.</p>

This includes time to read the modules, listen to the audio files and work through tasks and exercises. During the first call, prior to receiving the first module (by either telephone or video call), the therapist will provide a 15-minute introduction then email the first module. The subsequent three phone calls will each last 30 min and will be followed by the next module. The telephone sessions provide participants with a chance to discuss the modules they have read, including their experiences of the exercises, and receive help with difficulties encountered. A 15-minute phone call will follow the final module to conclude the treatment.</p>

                <p>The clinical psychologist delivering the ACT support sessions will attend a 3-day training session prior to the start of recruitment. The first day will cover the rationale behind the study and insights into MD diagnosis, symptoms and impact on QoL (led by MR, a consultant neurologist). Details of the study protocol will be reviewed as well as the role of the therapist, standard operating procedures, recording and storage of the support sessions and confidential information, deviations, drop-outs and adverse event procedures (led by TC, professor of cognitive behavioural therapy). The ACT training including presentations, exercises and role plays will last 2 days. This will be led by LM, a clinical psychologist and expert in ACT, assisted by CDG, an ACT-trained clinical psychologist. Obstacles to patient engagement with ACT as well as the difficulties of delivering the sessions remotely and within a brief time frame will be discussed. The therapist will attend monthly supervision meetings with a clinical supervisor (LM) to develop their skills and to ensure therapy fidelity and adherence to trial protocol. The therapist’s treatment competence will be periodically assessed with an ACT fidelity scale. This will inform monthly supervision sessions between therapist and clinical supervisor throughout the trial.</p>

                <p>All ACT support sessions will be audio-recorded to assess treatment fidelity. At the end of the trial, a random sample of recordings will be analysed for overall fidelity by two independent researchers. A fidelity measure is currently being developed by CDG and LM. This comprises a basic therapeutic competence scale and an ACT-specific fidelity scale informed by guidelines provided by Plumb and Vilardaga.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>

SMC would be (1) review of functional impairment arising from their muscle weakness and measures suggested to ameliorate the resulting disability with home adaptations and assistive devices, (2) monitoring for respiratory or cardiac complications and appropriate referral for their management if required, (3) recommendations for local physiotherapy, (4) recommendations for falls management where appropriate and (5) answering queries about their condition usually using information leaflets from the national organisation MD-UK or from disease support groups.</p>

Participants will also complete a participant details form to provide demographic data as follows: age, gender, ethnicity, occupation status, education level, marital status, living arrangements and dependants. Clinical information will also be collected, including age of onset and duration of MD, additional diagnoses, experience of psychological therapies as well as prior treatment of anxiety or depression. Adverse events will be recorded at each assessment point of the trial.</p>

Participants respond using a seven-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater symptom impact. The primary outcome measure for this study will therefore be the change in the overall QoL score, derived from these five life domain scores, from baseline up to 9 weeks.</p>

                <p>Randomisation will be conducted by an independent randomisation service at the UK Clinical Research Collaboration registered at the King’s Clinical Trials Unit. Randomisation will be at the level of the individual, using block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes stratified by recruiting centre. Allocation confirmation will be generated automatically and sent to unblinded research members, including the trial coordinator and clinical psychologist.</p>

                <p>A position of equipoise will be maintained, but blinding of the patients and therapist to the treatment condition will not be possible. The RA contacting participants and inputting data will be blind to group allocation to reduce the risk of introducing bias. To protect against unblinding, all follow-up questionnaires will be completed by participants on Bristol Online Survey (BOS) which is specifically designed for academic research and fully compliant with UK data protection law. All questionnaires will be identical for both arms and designed not to reveal treatment allocation. The trial statistician will be blind to treatment group when conducting the main data analysis.</p>

                <p>Baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation and consist of self-report questionnaires and objective assessments with the physiotherapist. Follow-up data (3, 6 and 9 weeks) include self-report questionnaires that will be completed remotely. At each follow-up point, participants will be emailed a link to BOS along with their unique identification number. If participants are unwilling or unable to complete all the questionnaires, they will be given the option of going through them on the phone or a reduced questionnaires pack with the primary outcomes (INQoL).</p>

                <title>Data management</title>
                <p>All trial data will be stored in line with the Data Protection Act 1998 and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice and King’s College London data management procedures. Any identifying data will be anonymised through use of unique identification numbers separated from identifying data. Data will be entered onto password-protected trial databases either on a shared hard-drive accessible only to assigned team members or in a locked cabinet in a room only accessible to staff with designated access cards. All source documents will be retained for a period of 10 years following the end of the study.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p>Statistical analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted after the database has been locked, with no interim analyses. All analyses will adopt the intention to treat principle. The main statistical analyses will estimate the difference in mean outcomes between patients randomised to ACT plus SMC and SMC alone at the primary endpoint of 9 weeks and at the two other postrandomisation time points. Group difference estimates, associated CIs and standardised effect sizes will be reported. Significance testing will be performed where the significance level will be 5% (two-sided). Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of conclusions to missing outcome data using a pattern mixture model approach and to departures from randomised treatment in a per protocol analysis excluding those not receiving. Loss to follow-up, departures from randomised treatment and the prevalence of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome is the INQoL QoL score. Quality of life at all three postrandomisation time points (3, 6 and 9 weeks after randomisation) will be modelled simultaneously using a linear mixed-effects model. A random intercept will account for the non-independence of observations across individuals. Trial arm and indicator-coded time will be included as covariates along with arm by time interaction terms to allow the treatment effect to vary at each time point. In addition, included in the model will be the baseline level of the QoL score and a stratification indicator variable for centre. Missing data at follow-up assessments are allowed where at least one observation per participant is available under the missing at random assumption.</p>
                <p>Secondary patient outcomes (3, 6 and 9 weeks after randomisation) relating to symptom severity and functioning (WSAS and HAQ-DI), distress (HADS), impression of change (PGIC) and putative mediators of the intervention (CAQ, AAQ-II and MAAS) will be analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Random effects for the intercept and time will be included in the model.</p>

                <p>Adverse events will be recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 weeks. We define adverse events as “any clinical change, disease or disorder experienced by the participant during their participation in the trial, whether or not considered related to the use of treatments being studied in the trial”.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Adverse events will also include any other events that might have affected the health status of a participating patient (eg, increased work stress).</p>
                <p>The team will also monitor SAEs, serious adverse reactions (SAR), suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) and active withdrawals from treatment. An SAE constitutes any adverse event or reaction that: results in death or a new persistent or new significant disability or incapacity, is life threatening or requires hospitalisation, any new episode of deliberate self-harm or any other important medical condition which may jeopardise the participant and requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</p>
                <p>An SAR can be defined as an SAE as a reaction to the intervention. An SUSAR is any SAR that is suspected to be caused by the intervention but was not expected. All SAEs, SARs and SUSARs will be reported immediately by the chief investigator to the study sponsor and REC. The TSC-DMEC will be responsible for the independent investigation of SAEs.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Experiences of psychological distress and reduced QoL are common in people with MD. A brief, guided self-help ACT intervention with telephone support sessions has been designed for remote delivery, offering a potential solution to mobility issues inherent with MD and under-resourced healthcare services. This is the first study to evaluate whether ACT can help improve QoL for individuals with MD. It will also be one of the largest RCTs of ACT for improving outcomes in chronic diseases/long-term conditions. If the intervention proves to be efficacious, this treatment delivery could facilitate participation for those individuals whose impaired mobility prevents travelling to face-to-face sessions. As the main barrier to the adoption of any psychological intervention is the paucity of psychological services, the ACT intervention has been designed to be a self-guided programme requiring minimal support from highly qualified professionals.</p>
