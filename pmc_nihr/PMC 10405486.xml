                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Cervical traumatic spinal cord injury is a devastating condition. Current management (bony decompression) may be inadequate as after acute severe TSCI, the swollen spinal cord may become compressed against the surrounding tough membrane, the dura. DISCUS will test the hypothesis that, after acute, severe traumatic cervical spinal cord injury, the addition of dural decompression to bony decompression improves muscle strength in the limbs at 6 months, compared with bony decompression alone.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a prospective, phase III, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial. We aim to recruit 222 adults with acute, severe, traumatic cervical spinal cord injury with an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale grade A, B, or C who will be randomized 1:1 to undergo bony decompression alone or bony decompression with duroplasty. Patients and outcome assessors are blinded to study arm. The primary outcome is change in the motor score at 6 months vs. admission; secondary outcomes assess function (grasp, walking, urinary + anal sphincters), quality of life, complications, need for further surgery, and mortality, at 6 months and 12 months from randomization. A subgroup of at least 50 patients (25/arm) also has observational monitoring from the injury site using a pressure probe (intraspinal pressure, spinal cord perfusion pressure) and/or microdialysis catheter (cord metabolism: tissue glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate to pyruvate ratio, glutamate, glycerol; cord inflammation: tissue chemokines/cytokines). Patients are recruited from the UK and internationally, with UK recruitment supported by an integrated QuinteT recruitment intervention to optimize recruitment and informed consent processes. Estimated study duration is 72 months (6 months set-up, 48 months recruitment, 12 months to complete follow-up, 6 months data analysis and reporting results).</p>

                  <p id="Par3">We anticipate that the addition of duroplasty to standard of care will improve muscle strength; this has benefits for patients and carers, as well as substantial gains for health services and society including economic implications. If the addition of duroplasty to standard treatment is beneficial, it is anticipated that duroplasty will become standard of care.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par45">Cervical traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) is a devastating condition that causes partial or total limb paralysis, loss of sensation below the injury, difficulty breathing, problems maintaining blood pressure and body temperature, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of sexual function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients with TSCI are vulnerable to complications including pressure ulcers, chronic pain, spasticity, joint stiffness, muscle contractures, delayed neurological deterioration from enlarging cord cyst (syrinx), pneumonia, and urosepsis.</p>
                <p id="Par46">We propose that, after acute severe TSCI, the swollen spinal cord becomes compressed against the surrounding tough membrane (dura) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This suggests that bony decompression alone (current management) may be inadequate and that bony decompression + duroplasty (opening the dura longitudinally and suturing a dural patch to expand the space around the injured cord) is required. DISCUS is a randomized controlled trial aiming to investigate whether the addition of duroplasty to bony decompression improves outcome after TSCI, compared with bony decompression alone. DISCUS includes an optional mechanistic study to determine whether duroplasty reduces cord compression, improves cord perfusion, reduces cord ischemia, and reduces cord inflammation. Given the potential challenges of recruiting following emergency admission, DISCUS includes an integrated QuinteT recruitment intervention (QRI) to optimize recruitment and informed consent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par47">The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that, in patients with severe cervical TSCI, bony + dural decompression, compared with bony decompression alone, improves American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) motor score (AMS) at 6 months.</p>

              <title>Trial design {8}</title>
              <p id="Par49">DISCUS is a randomized, controlled, multi-center trial with two trial arms: (1) surgical decompression including laminectomy (standard of care, control), and (2) surgical decompression including laminectomy + duroplasty. It is a superiority trial, i.e., aims to show that the trial arm that includes duroplasty improves outcome compared with the control arm. It has a parallel group design, i.e., participants are randomized 1:1 to receive only one of the two treatments: standard of care with laminectomy vs. standard of care with laminectomy + duroplasty. The trial is patient- and assessor-blinded, i.e., neither the patient nor the assessor of the primary outcome at 6 months know the trial treatment. We excluded thoracic TSCIs because most have severe injuries with complete paralysis without any significant spontaneous motor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and because the AMS are not sensitive to segmental recovery in the thoracic region.</p>

                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par52">In the UK, there are two types of participating centers: (1) recruiting centers (major trauma centers), where surgery and post-operative care take place, and (2) rehabilitation centers (spinal injury units), where the participants are transferred, once the acute care has finished. For the 6-month assessments, most patients are expected to be at the spinal injuries units. DISCUS started as a UK study but has now expanded to international centers. UK and international centers use the same protocol of patient assessment, follow-up, investigations, outcomes, etc., and randomize via the same process using RedCap. The currently registered centers are listed at the DISCUS trial website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par55">The local principal investigator (P.I.) retains overall responsibility for obtaining consent from participants at their site. Anyone delegated responsibility to obtain consent, typically a neurosurgeon, must be duly authorized, trained, and competent according to the protocol, principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Declaration of Helsinki. The operating surgeon does not have to be GCP-trained. Informed consent must be obtained before the participant undergoes trial procedures and before randomization. At least 2 h are allowed between explaining the study; that includes providing the patient information sheets, and obtaining consent, to enable the person giving consent to consider the information provided. Participants are free to withdraw at any time from the trial without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment. All participants will continue to be followed up as per routine standard of care. Withdrawn participants will be asked whether the data acquired up to the point of withdrawal can be retained. The reason for withdrawal is recorded in the case report form (CRF). Wherever possible, informed consent is obtained from the patient. If the patient verbally consents to participate, but is unable to sign because of hand weakness as a result of the TSCI, then the form is signed by an independent healthcare professional as a witness. Some patients may have impaired consciousness from sedative drugs. In these cases, DISCUS allows proxy consent, depending on the rules and regulations of the country. Patients who enter DISCUS via proxy consent and who regain capacity in hospital are informed about the trial and retrospective consent to continue participation is sought from them. The consent form is approved by the ethics committee of each participating country and follows GCP, local regulatory, and legal requirements.</p>

MD specimens may be analyzed on site for standard metabolites. Leftover MD samples are stored on site and periodically shipped (anonymously) to St. George’s Hospital for further assay of cytokines. MD samples are not human tissue as they are fluid collected through a 20-kDa dialysis membrane.</p>

The length of the duroplasty spans the length of the swollen cord estimated from the preoperative MRI. Duroplasty is performed by suturing an elliptical patch of artificial dura about 1 cm longer than the dural incision and about 2 cm wide to the dural edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. We recommend the following: (1) a wound drain be placed on gravity, (2) the skin be sutured and covered with waterproof adhesive iodine-impregnated dressing to minimize the risk of wound infection and of CSF leak, (3) the wound drain and dressing be removed at 1 week and the sutures at 2 weeks, and (4) CSF leak be treated by placing extra sutures ± lumbar drain.</p>

For intubated patients, sedation is lightened sufficiently to allow assessment at the discretion of local doctors. Participants have the AIS done on admission before randomization and before surgery (by neurosurgeon or physiotherapist) and at 6 months (by physiotherapist, rehabilitation doctor, or neurosurgeon). AIS motor scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</p>

We will investigate if dural + bony decompression more effectively decompresses the swollen cord than bony decompression alone (lower ISP, higher SCPP, CSF around injured cord on MRI). More effective decompression by duroplasty is predicted to improve cord metabolism, compared with bony decompression alone (higher glucose, lower LPR, lower glutamate, lower glycerol) and reduce cord inflammation (lower pro-inflammatory and higher anti-inflammatory cytokines). On the 6-month MRI, the extra space created by duroplasty is predicted to reduce cord tethering and syrinx.</p>

The assumed difference in ΔAMS and SD are based on our exploratory study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and are supported by data from the European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI) database and other published series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in which ΔAMS is between 15 and 18 with SD ranging from 15 to 25.

                <p id="Par78">DISCUS may face challenges to successful recruitment and consent processes because the pool of eligible patients is relatively small (9–13 patients per year per center), recruitment is led by busy neurosurgical trainees who may not prioritize trial recruitment in high-pressure surgical environments, consent may be by proxy at a stressful time for family members, and there may be issues with equipoise if surgeons favor an anterior approach and if patients or families favor the novel procedure (bony decompression + duroplasty) over standard procedures. Given these challenges, we have integrated a QRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] during the first 15 months of recruitment to the main trial for UK centers. QRI is a two-stage intervention to identify then address recruitment and consent challenges: Phase 1: understanding recruitment, involves collection and analysis of basic screening log data (numbers screened, eligible, approached and recruited to the trial) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], alongside collection and analysis of qualitative data (healthcare professional and/or participant interviews and/or recruitment discussions). Findings are triangulated to develop hypotheses regarding recruitment and informed consent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Phase 2: Feedback to the CI/TMG and TSC and plan of action. In practice, these two phases will run in tandem, with QRI findings fed back iteratively to the CI/TMG to agree appropriate actions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par106">Several lines of evidence suggest potential benefits of duroplasty: (1) <italic>Exploratory studies</italic>. One study assessed safety and the effect on intraspinal pressure (ISP) and spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) of duroplasty after TSCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Duroplasty was found to be safe: 50% patients had non-compressive pseudo-meningocele that disappeared at 6 months, with no wound infection, no persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and no worsening neurology. Compared with bony decompression, bony + dural decompression reduced ISP by about 10 mmHg and increased SCPP by about 15 mmHg. Publications of TSCI patients treated with bony decompression + duroplasty report generally favorable outcomes and no complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Duroplasty is commonly performed for Chiari I malformation, with ample evidence of safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. (2) <italic>ISP monitoring</italic>. A key finding of the Injured Cord Pressure Evaluation study is that ISP remains high with low SCPP even after anterior + posterior bony decompression; this suggests that the dura contributes to cord compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. (3) <italic>Evidence from MRIs</italic>. In a cohort of 65 TSCI patients without bony compression, dural compression was evident on MRI as lack of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the injured cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The extent of dural cord compression increased with increasing severity of TSCI and resolved slowly (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 9 days). (4) <italic>Animal studies</italic>. Reducing ISP by duroplasty or genetic manipulation to limit cord swelling improved outcome in numerous rodent TSCI models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These studies show that, after TSCI, the cord swells against the dura from cord hematoma and edema. In rats, duroplasty has beneficial effects other than lowering ISP, including less cord inflammation, less cord scarring, and smaller syrinx. The studies suggest that fibrin sealants may cause cord compression, and we have, therefore, avoided their use in our duroplasty trial. (5) <italic>Analogy with traumatic brain injury</italic>. The dura is unstretchable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It is established that the dura compresses swollen brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; thus, decompression for traumatic brain injury is bony + dural decompression, shown to lower mortality in the RESCUEicp randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par107">For these reasons, neurosurgery centers worldwide are currently performing duroplasty in TSCI patients without robust randomized evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; DISCUS is the first prospective trial to address this question.</p>

              <p>The chief investigators, Professor Marios C. Papadopoulos and Dr Samira Saadoun, are the custodians of the data. The DISCUS database is completely in the hand of the Oxford Surgical and Interventional Trials Unit (SITU) and therefore separated from the investigators and from the participating sites. During the trial, access to the trial data will be limited to the monitoring and data cleaning activities required to deliver the trial objectives and for the purposes of regulatory and safety reviews. After database closure, the responsible statistician will provide the calculations (details of the analyses will be determined in the statistical analysis plan) without interaction with the chief or principal investigators. DISCUS trial data will be accessible to sponsor representatives, representatives of the Surgical Intervention Trials Unit and the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit at the University of Oxford, and responsible individuals identified by the sponsor, including representatives of regulatory authorities and NHS trust.</p>
              <p>The DISCUS trial data is stored on the trial database and any paper documents are stored in a locked filing cabinet at the trial office. The final dataset will be archived electronically on a University of Oxford Server. Participating sites will store their site and patient files in accordance with the requirements stipulated by their local governance policies.</p>
