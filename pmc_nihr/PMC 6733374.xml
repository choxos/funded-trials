              <abstract>
                <p><bold>Background: </bold>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) often fail to recruit to target, resulting in a lack of generalisability of findings. A wide range of strategies for potentially increasing recruitment have been identified; however, their effectiveness has not been established. The aim of this study within a trial (SWAT) was to evaluate the effectiveness of handwritten personalisation of an invitation letter as part of a trial recruitment pack on recruitment to a host RCT.</p>
                <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A pragmatic, two-armed RCT was conducted, embedded within an existing falls prevention trial (OTIS) in men and women aged 65 years and over living in the community. Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive an OTIS recruitment pack containing an invitation letter on which their name was handwritten (intervention group), or one on which it was printed (control group). The primary outcome was randomisation into the host trial.  Secondary outcomes related to trial eligibility and retention.  Analyses were via logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards regression.</p>
                <p><bold>Results: </bold>Of the 317 SWAT participants, 12 (3.8%) were randomised into the OTIS trial: 3 (handwritten: 3/159 [1.9%]; printed: 9/158 [5.7%]; difference -3.8%, 95% CI -8.0% to 0.4%). There was weak evidence, against the intervention, of a difference in the likelihood of participants being randomised into the host trial between the two groups (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.20, p=0.09). There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups on any of the secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There was no evidence that personalisation of invitation letters improved recruitment to the OTIS trial. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution. These findings need to be replicated across larger studies and wider populations.</p>

              <p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the gold standard design to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in health research
<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. However, a recent review of RCTs funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) in the UK found that only 56% of RCTs reviewed achieved their planned sample size
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Trialists are well aware of recruitment challenges and have adopted a wide range of strategies to achieve and retain their sample size, including gifts, reminders and enhanced cover letters
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. A recent Cochrane review has evaluated strategies used to improve recruitment to RCTs
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. This review identified 68 trials involving more than 74,000 participants. The key conclusions from this review were that there was high-certainty evidence for three methods. The first is that informing participants what they will receive in the trial improves recruitment. The second is that phoning people who do not respond to postal invitations can be effective. Finally, using a tailored, user-tested information sheet makes little or no difference to recruitment. The review found that of the 72 strategies evaluated, only seven involved more than one study; therefore, additional studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to improve recruitment.</p>
              <p>One potential strategy that has been found to be effective at improving the responses to postal questionnaires
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> is making trial documentation more personal. In a review by Edwards
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, data from 58 trials demonstrated that the odds of returning a questionnaire was increased by more than one tenth (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22) when questionnaire material was made more personal. However, there was a wide range of ‘personalisation’ investigated within these trials (e.g. hand-addressing envelopes, signing letters personally etc.). Another systematic review looked specifically at the effect of personally addressed and/or hand-signed letters on questionnaire response. This review found that there was a positive effect on response rates when letters were personally addressed, which increased when letters were also hand-signed

              <p>Our aim was to undertake a study within a trial (SWAT) to determine whether the number of participants recruited to a trial can be improved by writing the potential participant’s name by hand, versus printing the name, on the invitation letter. By embedding a study within a RCT currently being coordinated by the York Trials Unit (YTU; University of York), the NIHR-funded OTIS study
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, the effects of the intervention could be tested within a pragmatic context without the additional costs of participant recruitment.</p>

                <p>The OTIS trial is a modified cohort
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, pragmatic, multicentre, two-armed RCT. Detailed methods of the main trial have been published elsewhere
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Participants for OTIS were recruited by mail out of recruitment packs to: i) participants in the Yorkshire Health Study (YHS)
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>; ii) cohorts of previous trials held by the YTU
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>; iii) potentially eligible patients identified in GP practice databases; and iv) via opportunistic screening. This embedded trial involved potential participants who were approached in the first mail out from the YHS (see
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> for a participant flow diagram). Recruitment to the embedded trial began on the 20
<sup>th</sup> of April 2017 and follow-up ended on the 22
<sup>nd</sup> August 2018.</p>
                <p>After receiving a recruitment pack (consisting of an invitation letter, participant information sheet, consent form, contact form and screening questionnaire) participants were asked to return their completed screening questionnaire and consent form to researchers based at the YTU if they wished to take part in the study. Participants were eligible to take part in the OTIS trial if they were aged 65 years or over, lived in the community, had fallen in the past 12 months or had a fear of falling, and were willing to receive a home visit from an OT. Participants were ineligible if they were unable to walk 10 feet (even with a walking aid), had dementia, lived in a residential or nursing home, had poor levels of English (with no access to assistance), had received an OT assessment for falls prevention in the last 12 months or were on a waiting list for an assessment, or had not returned a completed falls calendar. Participants who were eligible except for the fact that they had not fallen in the last 12 months and did not report a fear of falling were rescreened at intervals until they asked not to continue participation or they became eligible. Once eligible, participants were sent a baseline questionnaire and pack of falls calendars. Participants who completed their baseline questionnaire and falls calendars then became eligible for randomisation into the OTIS trial. For the main OTIS trial, participants were randomised to an environmental assessment by an OT or to the control group.</p>

              <p>This trial was embedded in the OTIS trial, and included potential OTIS participants sent a recruitment pack as part of the first mail out to consenting members of the YHS. Recruitment packs were assigned a unique identification number. Block randomisation was used to allocate the recruitment packs in a 1:1 ratio to either the control group or the intervention group, using one large block the size of the mail out (n=317). Generation of the allocation sequence was undertaken by the OTIS trial statistician, who was not involved with the production of the recruitment packs, using Stata version 13.</p>

Categorical data were compared using logistic regression models and time to response data using a Cox proportional hazards model. An additional logistic regression model used to analyse whether participants remained in the trial 3 months post-randomisation was adjusted for the OTIS main trial group allocation (usual care or intervention). The odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) from each model associated with the embedded trial allocation is presented along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We found that recipients of a personalised invitation letter, on which their name had been handwritten, were three times less likely to be randomised into the host OTIS trial, and this difference was statistically significant at the 10% level.</p>
              <p>Finding that personalisation did not increase recruitment to the OTIS trial provides a significant contribution to the limited literature on improving randomisation and recruitment to RCTs. The outcomes of the trial do not support the review by Edwards
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, which found that personalisation increased the odds of participants’ returning a questionnaire. However, not all of the studies included in the review observed an increase in response rate using personalisation. Moss and Worthern
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> found that writing the potential participant’s name by hand significantly reduced response rates when compared to typing the name. The review by Edwards
<italic>et al</italic>.
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> included a wide range of studies within a wide range of contexts (e.g. teachers, students and individuals selected at random from the telephone directory). Moss and Worthern
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> invited psychologists to provide their views on standardised assessments. They suggest that the reduction in response rates may have been due to handwriting being perceived as more personal but less professional. This supports Linsky’s theory that there are complex interactions between methods used to increase recruitment and the context in which they are used
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Our findings may also provide additional evidence for Linsky’s
<sup><xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> recommendation that in contexts requiring higher levels of confidentiality and professionalism, such as health research, personalisation may be contra-indicated.</p>
              <p>There are some limitations to the study. Only a small number of potential participants were recruited and randomised to the OTIS study, indeed far fewer than anticipated, and so the embedded trial is severely underpowered. This reduces the reliability of our findings. This highlights the value of repeating this investigation with larger sample sizes and reviewing findings across similar studies. Potential participants were limited to individuals over the age of 65 years living in the community, as such the results are only applicable to this population. Further studies should substantiate the study results in other populations.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our findings that personalisation does not improve recruitment lend weight to the argument that methods to improve recruitment may well be context specific. Given the small sample size the results should be interpreted with caution and highlight the need to replicate and extend this work across larger studies and wider populations.</p>

              <p>This SWAT (Study within a Trial) is a useful addition to the literature on trials recruitment methodology, and is no less valuable for attempting to replicate a previously tested intervention.</p>
              <p> The methods are appropriately described and there are links to the intervention and comparator letters as well as to the underlying data.</p>
              <p> The numbers are small, but the results are reported appropriately and the small numbers are acknowledged in the discussion. Limitations are appropriately discussed and conclusions are appropriately cautious.</p>
              <p> Points for consideration:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I would like to know who actually wrote the participant name on the letters and produced the mailout packs; in particular, it needs to be clear if they had any role in the SWAT or the main trial beyond generating the mailout packs? This would reassure readers that the analysis was masked and that the allocation of packs did not influence any other study processes. A statement about who was masked (analysis team, main study team) and who wasn’t masked would also be helpful.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The choice of a 10% significance level is non-standard (but is not inappropriate given the small anticipated sample size) – please could the authors explain and justify this choice to readers though?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Ref 16 in the reference list is a reference to this paper, but without the hyperlink to the supplementary data to which the in-text reference seems to apply. Could this be fixed please?</p></list-item></list>
</p>
              <p>I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.</p>

              <p>This is a useful trial within a trial to explore different invitation methods. The report clearly describes what was done and presents clear conclusions.</p>
              <p> Comments:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The intervention appears to be under-theorised as a behaviour change intervention. It might be useful to cross reference the behavioural insights approach (e.g. publications by Anna Sallis) as well as using the TIDIER checklist.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the analysis, the paper presents both a difference in proportions and an odds ratio, though the P value is not given for the former. The odds ratio appears to be considered the primary analysis, though the difference in proportions is more relevant. It is not clear that both analyses are needed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In the Discussion, where it reads 'and this difference was statistically significant at the 10% level.' The ASA guidelines suggest that bright lines such as 0.1 or 0.05 should not be used. This P value does not appear to provide evidence of any real effect.
