                  <p>Electronic health records are frequently used for cancer epidemiology. We report on their quality for ascertaining colorectal cancer (CRC) in UK women.</p>

                  <p>Population-based, retrospective cohort study nested within the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS). Postmenopausal women aged 50–74 who were diagnosed with CRC during 2001–11 following randomisation to the UKCTOCS were identified and their diagnosis confirmed with their treating clinician. The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of cancer and death registries, hospital episode statistics, and self-reporting were calculated by pairwise comparisons to the treating clinician’s confirmation, while specificity and negative predictive value were estimated relative to expected cases.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Notification of CRC events were received for 1,085 women as of 24 May 2011. Responses were received from 61% (660/1,085) of clinicians contacted. Nineteen women were excluded (18 no diagnosis date, one diagnosed after cut-off). Of the 641 eligible, 514 had CRC, 24 had a benign polyp, and 103 had neither diagnosis. The sensitivity of cancer registrations at one- and six-years post-diagnosis was 92 (95% CI 90–94) and 99% (97–100), respectively, with a PPV of 95% (95% CI 92/93–97). The sensitivity &amp; PPV of cancer registrations (at one-year post-diagnosis) &amp; hospital episode statistics combined were 98 (96–99) and 92% (89–94), respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Cancer and death registrations in the UK are a reliable resource for CRC ascertainment in women. Hospital episode statistics can supplement delays in cancer registration. Self-reporting seems less reliable.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="par0025">Electronic health records (EHRs) are datasets created for routine administrative purposes. Increasingly, however, they are used to assess health outcomes in large observational studies and randomised controlled trials [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Evaluating their quality is therefore crucial.</p>
              <p id="par0030">National registries are responsible for cancer registration (CR) in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, while cancers diagnosed in England are registered by one of eight regional hubs. English registries have been shown by one-directional comparisons to capture 98% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) recorded in routine healthcare databases [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, such estimates are likely overestimated since it is unlikely for an individual database to have complete coverage of all events, while iterative refinements to the registration process require ongoing evaluations.</p>
              <p id="par0035">Hospital episode statistics (HES) is an administrative dataset that documents all admissions and attendances to NHS Trusts in England. Its secondary uses for research has been reviewed [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HES is appealing since the compulsory recording of hospital events, each year, amasses ∼125-million diagnostic and procedural records amenable to digital analyses [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while their coding from case notes by dedicated professionals is generally accurate [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the extensive coverage of CRC events recorded in HES [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], its reliability has not been determined.</p>
              <p id="par0040">Self-reporting (SR), meanwhile, remains an option for identifying events where EHRs are unavailable or inaccessible. However, the reliability of self-reporting is currently unclear, particularly in spite of increased detection of adenomatous polyps [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and potential confusion resulting from repeat testing due to technical issues and false positive screening tests [<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="par0045">We herein determined the feasibility of using EHRs and self-reporting for CRC ascertainment in UK women. We report on the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of cancer and death registrations, HES, and self-reporting relative to treating clinician’s confirmation. We also explore the reliability of self-reporting of CRC and the factors that determine the accurate self-reporting of CRC.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p id="par0050">The present retrospective cohort study was nested within the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Screening (UKCTOCS). During 2001–05, 202,638 postmenopausal women aged 50–74 were randomised to UKCTOCS trial centres across England, Northern Ireland, and Wales following an invitation from health authorities [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All were asked to provide their ethnicity, postcode, height, and weight by postal questionnaire at recruitment. Postcodes were updated throughout the trial. The study cohort were women who were identified as having been diagnosed with CRC since randomisation (see <italic>Data sources</italic>) and gave consent for access to their medical records (see <italic>Clinician’s confirmation</italic>).</p>

                  <title>Electronic health records</title>
                  <p id="par0055">Women were linked to their EHRs by NHS number. CRs were up-to-date until 19 May 2011 for England &amp; Wales and 23 February 2010 for Northern Ireland. DCs were up-to-date until 19 May 2011 for England &amp; Wales and 9 March 2011 for Northern Ireland.

In May 2012, a postal questionnaire (CRCQ) was sent to the treating clinician (GP by default or treating hospital consultant if self-reported in the FUQ I), requesting the diagnosis date, primary site, stage, grade, morphology, and treatment details (Supplementary Fig. S1). The CRCQ requested details of a specialist if the initial contact was unable to provide complete data, who was contacted if necessary. Reminder CRCQs were sent to non-responding clinicians. Questionnaire outcomes (confirmed CRC, benign polyp, no CRC or benign polyp) were captured in the UKCTOCS Trial Management System. Where multiple CRCQs per women were obtained, a confirmed CRC superseded one which reported a benign diagnosis. The earliest of two cancer diagnosis dates was used where necessary. Cancers without a diagnosis date and those diagnosed after 24 May 2011 were excluded.</p>

These included 814 CRs, 233 DCs, 625 HES, 400 SRs (FUQ I only), and 145 notifications via the trial database. Clinicians of all 1,085 women were sent a CRCQ. Responses were received from 660 (61%). Nineteen women were excluded as 18 of the confirmed cancers had no diagnosis date on the returned CRCQ and one cancer was diagnosed after May 2011 (self-reported in 2006). Overall, 641 women were eligible for analysis. Of these, 514 had a verified CRC, 24 had a benign polyp, while 103 had never been diagnosed with malignant or benign colorectal disease. Histology reports were disclosed for 15% (75/514) of verified CRCs. There were 1,173 TP notifications and 152 FP notifications (38 for benign disease, 114 for no malignant/benign diagnosis).<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study overview.</bold> All women enrolled in the UKCTOCS were monitored for CRCs diagnosed since being randomised via linkage to electronic health records, self-reporting, and by information discerned via the trial itself.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0165">Advances in healthcare are achieved through high-quality epidemiological studies informed by a comprehensive and reliable ascertainment of outcomes. We have herein evaluated the performance of EHRs in addition to self-reporting for ascertaining diagnoses of CRC in UK women in comparison to a patient’s clinical records. We found that 92% of CRCs diagnosed in the UK during 2001–10 were registered within one year, and 99% within six years. Researchers looking to overcome delays in the curation of cancer registrations are advised to use HES in adjunct, which combined had a sensitivity of 98% and a PPV of 92%. Finally, self-reporting of CRC for standalone or adjunct ascertainment was not useful owing to high false positivity and low response rates.</p>
              <p id="par0170">Registration of cancers by regional registries are the cornerstone of national and international cancer surveillance [<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and have hitherto informed the implementation of CRC screening programmes [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An incomplete ascertainment of events, however, can skew analyses. Nonetheless, our group previously concluded that incomplete registration of CRC is unlikely as 85% of self-reported (but not verified) CRCs were registered within five years of diagnosis [<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The higher sensitivity of CRC cancer registration reported here (92% vs 85%) is likely due to our exclusion of previously unknown false positive self-reported CRCs. Elsewhere, it is reported that 98% of surgically treated CRCs recorded in HES during 2001–07 were registered [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], while 98% of primary care records were captured within four years [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="par0175">We found no issues with the reliability of HES (PPV 94%). This is in alignment with a recent meta-analysis [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HES did, however, have limited sensitivity that would likely preclude its use for standalone ascertainment. These missed cases are likely due to coding errors, emergency admissions, death certificate-only registrations, or privately-treated patients. Nonetheless, a similar sensitivity (83%) was reported for prostate cancers recorded by HES relative to medical notes [<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="par0180">Self-reporting of CRC by post was unreliable. While the sensitivity (91%) of responders was similar to CR at one year (92%), a low response rate (55%) limited the sensitivity to 41%. Furthermore, the PPV was 69%, and some women misreported their benign polyp as cancer. Studies in the USA have reported similar sensitivities (83–85%) for postal self-report, albeit at a lower PPV (54%) [<xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our findings align with reports that British interviewees markedly under-report CRC diagnoses in close relatives [<xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but contrasts in that they reliably self-report their participation in CRC screening [<xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As screening becomes widely accepted, an ongoing evaluation of how it might influence the layperson’s ability to reliably self-report would be insightful.</p>
              <p id="par0185">Our study has several limitations. Firstly, we did not verify the absence of cancer in those without a notification, and thus the reliability of the sensitivity estimates are dependent on the number of false negatives missed. Secondly, the potential for bias in the 39% of non-responding clinicians contacted should not be overlooked for an underascertainment of FPs through non-response would overstate the PPV, while an underascertainment of TPs would underestimate the sensitivity. Nonetheless, barring a higher proportion of mortality at point of clinician contact and notifications via death certificate, non-responders were in closer alignment to TPs than FPs in the notifications received, and we suspect the risk of bias to be minimal. Next are issues of generalisability. Men are disproportionally affected by CRC [<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while also being less likely to undertake FOBT screening than women [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but were not studied here. Ethnic minorities, too, are less likely to undertake screening [<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but were underrepresented in our cohort. Finally, our findings may be affected by ‘healthy-volunteer’ bias that typically affects those willing to enrol in trials [<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while it would also be reasonable to assume that recall biases arising from past diagnoses of CRC in the family or prior colonoscopy for suspected cancer could aid concordant self-reporting and would, ideally, be accounted for in analyses if obtained.</p>
              <p id="par0190">Weaknesses notwithstanding, our study updates the current performance estimates of colorectal cancer registrations [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our estimates are reliable though us studying verified events identified via myriad routes. It is strengthened further from the high rate at which patients’ EHRs were linked.</p>

              <p id="par0195">Electronic health records in England, Northern Ireland &amp; Wales are a reliable resource for ascertaining colorectal cancer events in women. Researchers looking to supplement delays in the registration of CRCs should use hospital episode statistics in adjunct. Self-reporting of colorectal cancer by women is neither reliable nor is it useful in adjunct with electronic health records.</p>
