                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study was a randomized trial of the early introduction of allergenic solids into the infant diet from 3Â months of age. The intervention effect did not reach statistical significance in the intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>We sought to determine whether infants at high risk of developing a food allergy benefited from early introduction.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A secondary intention-to-treat analysis was performed of 3 groups: nonwhite infants; infants with visible eczema at enrollment, with severity determined by SCORAD; and infants with enrollment food sensitization (specific IgE â‰¥0.1 kU/L).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Among infants with sensitization to 1 or more foods at enrollment (â‰¥0.1 kU/L), early introduction group (EIG) infants developed significantly less food allergy to 1 or more foods than standard introduction group (SIG) infants (SIG, 34.2%; EIG, 19.2%; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .03), and among infants with sensitization to egg at enrollment, EIG infants developed less egg allergy (SIG, 48.6%; EIG, 20.0%; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .01). Similarly, among infants with moderate SCORAD (15-&lt;40) at enrollment, EIG infants developed significantly less food allergy to 1 or more foods (SIG, 46.7%; EIG, 22.6%; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .048) and less egg allergy (SIG, 43.3%; EIG, 16.1%; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .02).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Early introduction was effective in preventing the development of food allergy in specific groups of infants at high risk of developing food allergy: those sensitized to egg or to any food at enrollment and those with eczema of increasing severity at enrollment. This efficacy occurred despite low adherence to the early introduction regimen. This has significant implications for the new national infant feeding recommendations that are emerging around the world.</p>

This level of adherence was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in IgE-mediated food allergy to 1 or more of the 6 intervention foods.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0015">At a food-specific level, adherence varied, with some foods being easier to consume than others: egg at 43.1% and peanut at 61.9%.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In the intention-to-treat analysis both foods showed nonsignificant reductions in allergy prevalence of 31% and 51% for egg and peanut, respectively.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Per-protocol effects were significantly stronger and in keeping with Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) allergy study effect estimates.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, per-protocol analyses are susceptible to bias depending on what factors determined adherence in the study.</p>
            <p id="p0020">Well-recognized factors that render an infant from the general population to be at greater risk of a food allergy include nonwhite ethnicity,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> early-onset eczema,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and early-onset sensitization to a food.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the EAT study we have previously confirmed that nonwhite ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.19-3.66; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .01) and enrollment visible eczema (3Â months of age; OR, 6.09; 95% CI, 3.67-10.1; <italic>P</italic>Â &lt;Â .001) were both significantly associated with developing a food allergy.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
            <p id="p0025">At the time of publication of the EAT study's principal results, the enrollment sensitization data available were the skin prick test results, which took place, by design, only in the early introduction group (EIG). Enrollment skin prick test sensitization (any positive wheal response to â‰¥1 foods) was significantly associated with having a food allergy in the EIG (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.99-16.3; <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .001).</p>
            <p id="p0030">The absence of comparator data from the standard introduction group (SIG) precluded comparisons between the 2 groups in terms of efficacy of the EAT intervention in infants sensitized at enrollment. Following publication of the primary EAT study findings, we secured funding to process IgE results for this large sample set. Infants were defined as sensitized at enrollment if they had specific IgE antibodies present to 1 or more of the 6 allergenic foods at enrollment at 3Â months of age.</p>
            <p id="p0035">We now present the findings of the efficacy of the EAT study in these groups of infants at high risk of developing a food allergy.

                <p id="p0045">In brief, participants were randomized to the SIG or EIG. The SIG was asked to exclusively breastfeed to around 6Â months of age. Allergenic food introduction beyond this point was at parental discretion. EIG infants continued to breastfeed while sequentially introducing 6 allergenic foods: cow's milk yogurt; then peanut, hard-boiled egg, sesame, and whitefish (cod) in a random order; and finally wheat. By week 6, EIG infants were ideally consuming the required amount of all 6 allergenic foods each week.</p>

                <p id="p0055">Only infants in the EIG underwent skin prick tests at enrollment. SIG participants did not undergo skin prick tests at enrollment because this would likely have influenced a family's decision on when to introduce allergenic foods into their child's diet. The desire was for SIG participants to introduce allergenic foods at the same time that they would have done if they had not been participating in the study.</p>
                <p id="p0060">In contrast, blood sampling was attempted on all infants at enrollment. Samples were then stored until completion of the study. IgE levels to each of the 6 individual foods were then measured with the ImmunoCAP assay system (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden).</p>

                <p id="p0065">All children with a positive skin prick test response to 1 or more of the 6 intervention foods at the 1-year and/or 3-year assessments or a history of a positive challenge at less than 1Â year of age were considered for a food challenge. The decision to challenge and the timing and type of challenge undertaken were based on the participant's study group and frequency of consumption status.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In the EAT study the primary outcome was allergy proven by double-blind challenge where possible, to 1 or more of the 6 early introduction foods. One thousand one hundred seventy-three (90.0%) of the participants attended the final 3-year visit within the scheduled visit window (by 4Â years of age), and the primary outcome could be determined in 1178 (90.4%) participants. Although the study was not specifically powered to look at individual food allergy outcomes, there were sufficient cases of peanut and egg allergy to analyze these outcomes. There were insufficient cases of allergy to any of the other 4 foods (sesame, wheat, cow's milk, and fish) to undertake subgroup analyses for these foods.</p>
                <p id="p0070">Diagnostic cut-off values for predicting food allergy based on skin prick test results have been shown to have lower thresholds in younger children.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Safety was paramount in the EAT study and, given that the presence of a positive skin prick test response at enrollment resulted in a food challenge being undertaken before home consumption was allowed, a wheal of any size was deemed positive to minimize false-negative test results. Although IgE sensitization data are presented by using a standard threshold of 0.35Â kU/L or greater, given the very young age, a lower threshold of 0.1Â kU/L or greater was used for the primary analyses of food allergy outcomes. For the outcome of food allergy to 1 or more of the 6 early introduction foods, sensitization at enrollment was defined as sensitization of 0.1 kU/L or greater to any 1 of the 6 foods. For peanut and egg allergy outcomes, sensitization at enrollment refers to sensitization of 0.1 kU/L or greater to the specific food.</p>

AÂ formal test for interaction was undertaken in a logistical model, including study group and sensitization to 1 or more foods (for the outcome of allergy to any food) or sensitization to a specific food (for the outcome of food allergy to that food).

                  <p id="p0155">Of the 157 infants who were sensitized to 1 or more foods (â‰¥0.1Â kU/L) whose primary outcome status was evaluable, 34.2% (27/79) of SIG participants developed food allergy to 1 or more foods versus 19.2% (15/78) of EIG participants (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â .03). Thirty-nine infants were sensitized to peanut at 0.1 kU/L or greater, and the corresponding figures for developing a peanut allergy in infants whose peanut allergy status was evaluable were as follows: 33.3% (6/18) for SIG infants versus 14.3% (3/21) for EIG infants (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â .26). Sixty-seven infants were sensitized to egg at 0.1 kU/L or greater; egg allergy developed in those whose egg allergy status was evaluable in 48.6% (18/37) of SIG infants versus 20.0% (6/30) of EIG infants (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â .01). Adjusting for age, ethnicity, sex, and maternal age did not affect the results.</p>
                  <p id="p0160">A statistical interaction test between study group and sensitization was significant for egg (interaction term <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .041) but not for peanut (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â .673) or sensitization to 1 or more foods (<italic>P</italic>Â =Â .149).</p>
                  <p id="p0165">Among infants with no enrollment sensitization to any food or specifically to peanut or egg, there were no significant differences in food allergy rates between the 2 groups. Similarly, among those without enrollment IgE data, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the intention-to-treat analysis.</p>
                  <p id="p0170">No sample was available to measure specific IgE levels in 133 participants at 3Â months of age (74 SIG and 59 EIG infants). Being in this group was not associated with ethnic status, visible eczema at enrollment, or the presence of sensitization on skin prick tests. AÂ sensitivity analysis was undertaken, apportioning those infants with IgE data missing to the sensitized or nonsensitized groups in accordance with the prevalence of sensitization in those with data. The efficacy of the intervention for egg persisted, and the formal interaction test remained statistically significant.</p>
                  <p id="p0175">There are no existing data on allergen-specific IgE levels or skin prick test responses as predictors of challenge-proved food allergy in 3-month-old infants. Only 7 of the 652 EIG infants had positive enrollment food challenge results (milk, 4; egg, 2; peanut, 2; and wheat, 1). These numbers are too small to generate positive predictive values in this age group.</p>

              <p id="p0180">A recent systematic review of all published early intervention trials undertaken to date concluded that early egg or peanut introduction to the infant diet was associated with lower risk of developing egg or peanut allergy.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0185">The LEAP study showed a very strong intention-to-treat effect. However, this was in the context of an extremely high per-protocol adherence rate (96%), which was achieved through regular sustained contact with the families. The EAT study intervention was considerably more challenging, with multiple foods being introduced at a young age. This, combined with a more pragmatic contacting regimen, had a concomitant effect of significantly reducing the per-protocol adherence rate.</p>
              <p id="p0190">In this article we have shown that despite significantly lower adherence rates than in the LEAP study, groups of infants at high risk of developing a food allergy, including those sensitized at enrollment and those with increasing eczema severity (SCORAD) benefited from early introduction of allergenic solids. Of equal importance was that early introduction of allergenic foods into the diets of the nonâ€“high-risk infants was not associated with any increased risk of food allergy.</p>
              <p id="p0195">It is important to note that we investigated the efficacy of the EAT intervention in these groups of infants because they are known to be at particularly high risk of developing a food allergy. Not all of these groups are readily identifiable: infants with nonwhite ethnicity and those with visible eczema are, and hence could benefit from targeted support with recommendations for early food introduction. Conversely, although we are not proposing IgE screening in the general population from which the EAT study population was recruited, it is of significance that EAT study early food intervention is being shown to have been effective in an intention-to-treat analysis in this group of infants.</p>
              <p id="p0200">Current National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases guidelines propose introduction of peanut from around 6Â months of age in children with mild-to-moderate eczema.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In the guidelines the authors state that their recommendation is based on 2 pieces of evidence: first, evidence from the LEAP study, in that some infants who participated in the LEAP study based on an egg allergy had a SCORAD at screening in the mild-to-moderate category, and second, the per-protocol protective effect seen with early peanut introduction in the EAT study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Of interest is our identification of a significant intention-to-treat effect in children with moderate eczema (52% reduction in allergy to â‰¥1 foods and 63% reduction in egg allergy) and with increasing eczema SCORAD for egg allergy. This adds to the evidence presented in these guidelines.</p>
              <p id="p0205">The principal limitation of these analyses is that only the analysis of the efficacy of the early introduction intervention in infants with eczema at enrollment was stipulated <italic>a priori</italic>. Investigating the effects of the intervention in sensitized infants and nonwhite infants are <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analyses that are subject to well-recognized limitations. If important subgroup effects are anticipated, trials should either be powered to detect them reliably, or pooled analyses of several trials should be undertaken.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0210">A further limitation is the low adherence rate in the EAT study, reducing the power to detect an ITT intervention effect in the EAT study. We have explored in detail which factors are associated with low adherence in the EAT cohort. In that publication we modelled the effect of improving adherence in the groups at high risk of developing a food allergy (nonwhite participants and those with early-onset eczema) and showed that this has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of food allergy if sufficiently high adherence were able to be achieved.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0215">The EAT study intervention did not show intention-to-treat efficacy when children with visible eczema were considered as one group, but efficacy was present within the moderate SCORAD subgroup and with continuous SCORAD for egg allergy. The number of infants with severe SCORAD eczema in the EAT study was too small to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of the intervention within this subgroup within the EAT study. We discuss the reasons for this inÂ the Discussion section in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0020">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>.</p>
              <p id="p0220">In the LEAP study, peanut-specific IgE levels of 0.1 kU/L or greater in infancy were clinically and statistically significant in terms of predicting peanut allergy at 60Â months of age. Overall, 75% (48/64) of cases of peanut allergy in the LEAP study came fromÂ those with peanut-specific IgE levels of 0.1 kU/L or greater at baseline, and in the avoidance group this number was 74% (40/54). In LEAP participants who had egg allergy with mild or no eczema at enrollment, the proportion developing peanut allergy, with IgE levels to peanut of 0.1 kU/L or greater at baseline, was 89% (8/9) overall and 88% (7/8) in the avoidance group (theÂ <italic>P</italic> value for this subgroup analysis within the mild eczema group [nÂ =Â 105] was significant: <italic>P</italic>Â =Â .0002). The clinical significance of this threshold was confirmed in the EAT study, with 69% of those developing a food allergy in the SIG by 3Â years of age already having specific IgE present to 1 or more of the early introduction foods at the 0.1Â kU/L threshold at 3Â months of age.</p>
              <p id="p0225">As countries, including the United States,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Australia,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> and theÂ United Kingdom,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> move to issue new infant feeding guidelines in light of EAT and LEAP study findings, as well as the other randomized trials that have taken place of early food introduction, we hope our findings will inform the debate as toÂ whether a risk-based dietary intervention should be recommended or a population-based intervention should be undertaken.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Clinical implications</title></caption><p id="p0230">The EAT study was effective in certain groups of infants at high risk of developing food allergy in an intention-to-treat analysis, with significant implications for new infant feeding recommendations.</p></boxed-text></p>

              <p id="p0270">The LEAP study has clearly shown that infants with severe eczema benefit significantly from early peanut introduction.<xref rid="bibE1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E1</sup></xref> In the EAT study protocol, <italic>a priori</italic>, we predicted that 25% of infants would have visible eczema at the 3-month assessment, and we estimated the prevalence of food allergy in these infants to be 30%.<xref rid="bibE2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E2</sup></xref> By using this estimate, the study had 99% power to show a reduction from 30% to 10% in food allergy and 85% power to detect a reduction from 30% in the SIG to 15% in the EIG.<xref rid="bibE2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E2</sup></xref> However, although the estimate of the proportion of infants with any visible eczema at enrollment was accurate (24.4%), the rate of any food allergy in the SIG infants with visible eczema at enrollment was significantly lower than anticipated (18.2% as opposed to 30%). This reflects the preponderance of mild eczema among those with visible eczema at enrollment and meant that the study was potentially underpowered to explore eczema subgroup efficacy. The fact that we found significant findings despite this is noteworthy. Furthermore, we are now undertaking a case-based pooled analysis of several of the early food introduction trials to optimally investigate the efficacy of early food introduction in these subgroups.<xref rid="bibE3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>E3</sup></xref><fig id="figE1"><label>Fig E1</label><caption><p>EAT enrollment and randomization. Baseline visits occurred when participants were 3Â months of age. *Eight infants randomized to each group were found to have significant health issues either on blood testing or on clinical examination at the enrollment visit, rendering them ineligible for enrollment: conditions included severe vitamin D deficiency, severe iron deficiency, severe failure to thrive, familial hypercholesterolemia, congenital stridor, epidermolysis bullosa, and cartilage-hair hypoplasia syndrome. â€ Forty-three participants in the SIG and 69 participants in the EIG withdrew voluntarily from the study. Reasons given were as follows: concerns about blood tests (SIG, 0; EIG, 2), emigration (SIG, 10; EIG, 12), expenses (SIG, 1; EIG, 1), family health issues (SIG, 3; EIG, 0), family issues (SIG, 2; EIG, 4), no reason given (SIG, 11; EIG, 16), lost contact with family (SIG, 15; EIG, 28), too far to travel for study assessments (SIG, 0; EIG, 1), and unhappy participating in the study (SIG, 1; EIG, 5).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fx2"/></fig></p>
