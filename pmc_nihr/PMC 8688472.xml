                <p id="Par1">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is first diagnosed during middle childhood, when patterns of difficulty are often established. Pre-emptive approaches that strengthen developing cognitive systems could offer an alternative to post-diagnostic interventions. This proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial (RCT) tested whether computerised gaze-based attention training is feasible and improves attention in infants liable to develop ADHD. Forty-three 9- to 16-month-old infants with a first-degree relative with ADHD were recruited (11/2015–11/2018) at two UK sites and randomised with minimisation by site and sex to receive 9 weekly sessions of either (a) gaze-contingent attention training (intervention; <italic>n</italic> = 20); or (b) infant-friendly passive viewing of videos (control, <italic>n</italic> = 23). Sessions were delivered at home with blinded outcome assessments. The primary outcome was a composite of attention measures jointly analysed via a multivariate ANCOVA with a combined effect size (ES) from coefficients at baseline, midpoint and endpoint (Registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN37683928">ISRCTN37683928</ext-link>). Uptake and compliance was good but intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences between 20 intervention and 23 control infants on primary (ES −0.4, 95% CI −0.9 to 0.2; Complier-Average-Causal Effect ES −0.6, 95% CI −1.6 to 0.5) or secondary outcomes (behavioural attention). There were no adverse effects on sleep but a small increase in post-intervention session fussiness. Although feasible, there was no support for short-term effects of gaze-based attention training on attention skills in early ADHD. Longer-term outcomes remain to be assessed. The study highlights challenges and opportunities for pre-emptive intervention approaches to the management of ADHD.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity with an estimated prevalence of around five percent in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. ADHD is typically first diagnosed and treated in middle childhood, by which time it is already associated with a broad pattern of difficulties across multiple domains of everyday functioning that usually persists into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and which can impact on quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Medication has efficacy in reducing core ADHD symptoms, although its effects on important domains of functioning is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and long-term benefits remain uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There is resistance to the use of medication by some parents and professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], especially with younger children; recommended parent-training alternatives can reduce conduct problems but do not affect core ADHD symptomatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Alternative non-pharmacological approaches that target differences in cognitive systems thought to be core to ADHD (e.g., attention and working memory training) have been developed. However, although such approaches might improve performance on tasks similar to those trained, there is little evidence they reduce core ADHD symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">Preventative strategies offer an alternative to the non-pharmacological management of ADHD. The benefits of cognitive training could be increased and the likelihood of ADHD reduced through targeting brain systems during periods of increased plasticity in early development. Indeed, there is emerging evidence that ADHD-related atypicalities in attention systems may be present in infancy long before the emergence of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Could targeting these systems reduce the likelihood of later ADHD? The success of such a strategy depends on (i) identifying vulnerable individuals during early development before ADHD onset is evident and (ii) having a way of delivering cognitive training to very young pre-verbal children. First, ADHD is a strongly familial condition, with a 13-fold increase in ADHD diagnosis in children with a first-degree relative with the condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This enables the prospective identification of infants with an elevated likelihood of developing ADHD. Second, a recent proof-of-concept study supports the use of non-invasive eye tracking to enable cognitive training protocols in infancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study, typically developing 11-month-old-infants viewed animated games designed to target emerging executive attention skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The games were designed to be infant-friendly, by using high-contrast colourful animations such as cartoon animals and characters. Eye-tracking (which uses infrared light to track the direction of an infant’s gaze) was used in real time to adaptively change the games contingent on where on screen the infant was looking, thus creating an interactive game, and allowing for the game to become more challenging contingent on the infant’s performance. Cognitive domains targeted by the games included sustained attention (maintaining gaze on a stimulus to receive an audiovisual reward), working memory (remembering where to look to receive an audiovisual reward, e.g. an infant-friendly animation), and cognitive control (inhibiting a previous rule to learn a new one, and receive an audiovisual reward). Following training, infants showed training effects on a battery of cognitive tasks compared to an untrained, active control group. Subsequent studies have replicated key effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and suggest training-related changes in social orienting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], physiological indices of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and sustained attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Taken together, there appears to be great potential for pre-emptive attention training to change trajectories in ADHD. To test this hypothesis, we examine (1) whether gaze-contingent attention training can be feasibly delivered in the context of a double-blinded, active-controlled randomised trial with infants (9- to 16-months) with elevated familial likelihood for ADHD, and (2) whether the training produces significant improvements in immediate attention skills relative to a video-viewing control group.</p>

                  <p id="Par30">To estimate the effect of treatment allocation following an intention to treat (ITT) approach, a multivariate analysis of covariance was fitted using maximum likelihood within the structural equation modelling (SEM) framework in Stata’s sem procedure. This allowed for an unstructured correlation matrix between the outcome components and was estimated by full maximum likelihood (Stata v15.1). Measures were assumed conditionally multivariate normal and missing values Missing-At-Random (MAR). Baseline and follow-up measures were treated as dependent variables with a design matrix of predictors that allowed factors for randomisation (sex and study site) and treatment group set to zero at baseline and a different error variance at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint with non-zero covariances over time and across indicators. Normal probability plots of residuals were examined. The model also provided correlation estimates of measurement reliability.</p>
                  <p id="Par31">The above model provided six parameter estimates for treatment effect (intermediate and endpoint for each of cognitive control, sustained attention and disengagement components). Using the baseline standard deviation of each component, effect sizes were combined using the lincom post-estimation command (which takes the correlation among estimates into account), equally weighted across components but on the assumption that for each component the effect by mid-point would be half that achieved by endpoint.

                <p id="Par40">From the 17 controls and 15 training families who reported, hospital presentations were reported for three control (one night with high temperature, one ear-ache, and one dehydrated) and two training infants (one admitted for two nights with norovirus, and one for a barium meal bowel biopsy). The change in day and night sleep durations before and after a session showed no group difference (SM2.6). However, the training group were reported as showing a relatively greater increase in fussiness from before to after a session (M = 0.32, SD = 0.63) than the control group (M = −0.11, SD = 0.51) that was significant but small (.4 on a 5-point scale; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). To assess whether there were any lasting effects on temperament, we conducted a DMC-approved non-prespecified examination of the IBQ-R Negativity composite (distress, fear, sadness, and falling reactivity) analysed in the same way as the other IBQ-R scales. No group difference was found (ES = 0.05, CI = −0.60 to 0.50; <italic>p</italic> = 0.862).</p>

                <title>Feasibility of pre-emptive intervention for ADHD</title>
                <p id="Par41">Intended as an infant-directed pre-emptive intervention for later ADHD, this trial is unique and innovative, and thus testing its feasibility was a primary aim. We undertook an extensive period of protocol development during an initial feasibility study (SM1.3). This resulted in a physical eye-tracking set-up that was acceptable to families and could be applied in the home to collect robust, high quality data. Indeed, the data we collected in the home was of sufficient quality to pass our strict quality assessment thresholds for selection as the primary outcome composite. We employed an active control arm that was matched in visit number, duration and protocol as closely as possible with the training arm, indicating that rigorous control designs are feasible in this population. Further, feedback questionnaires completed at the end of the trial indicated that families enjoyed participating in the study (SM2.7), with over 90% of respondents reporting that the visits were enjoyable or very enjoyable, 100% reporting that the sessions were of a suitable duration, and 100% reporting that the staff who visited their home were excellent. When asked what they found to be the most enjoyable part of the study, a key theme that emerged was seeing their infant’s behaviour. For instance, one parent reported that the most enjoyable part of the study was seeing their infant “learn how the sessions worked and remembering things”, while another reported that the most enjoyable part for them was “observing [their] baby’s reaction”. Another parent reported that their infant “really enjoyed the weekly visits” and that “watching his confidence grow was good.” This positive feedback provides strong encouragement for future home-based deployment of eye-tracking-based assessments and interventions for this population.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Despite these successes, we encountered a number of significant challenges. First, we targeted families for recruitment who had both a young infant, and also a parent or a child with ADHD. A proportion of families recruited were relatively poorly resourced (some annual incomes &lt; £20,000). Around half of families additionally reported significant mental health or psychiatric conditions in a first degree relative. These factors can make recruitment and retention in trials difficult. Multiple recruitment methods had to be employed at both the London and Southampton sites. Additionally, matching rates of recruitment to home visit capacity (due to limitations of testing team time) was challenging. However, despite some cancelled appointments and re-scheduling, the protocol was successively administered to our cohort of 43 families. The total quantity of training (or control exposure) that infants received was greater than in previous studies (<italic>M</italic> = 224.57 minutes of total training, compared to 77 minutes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], SM2.3), albeit spread over a longer training period (93 days, compared to 16 days in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], SM1.2). Given concerns that infants may, relative to adults and older children, show both greater plasticity and a faster rate at which training effects may potentially dissipate, the broader spread of training may have reduced efficacy in some cases. A slight increase in fussiness ratings from before to after each training session was noted in the intervention relative to the control group; however, this was small and did not result in longer term effects on negative emotionality measured at post-test.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Overall, we conclude that pre-emptive technology-based interventions directed at infants at elevated likelihood for ADHD are feasible. Further, these studies can and should apply rigorous RCT designs with appropriately designed control conditions, an approach that hitherto has been rarely taken with such populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As such, our study may provide a roadmap for future work. However, we did experience some challenges, particularly with participant recruitment. Once eligible families were identified, the conversion rate to enrolment was good (of the families contacted, only ~10% did not wish to participate). This indicates that the main barrier to recruitment was likely the restrictions of this specific trial (e.g. finding families who met the inclusion criteria for this particular trial), rather than reflecting low acceptability of the intervention approach more generally. Nevertheless, this highlights that further work is needed to reduce barriers so that a greater number of families can be reached in future trials of early interventions for ADHD. Current moves towards digital infrastructures such as trial platforms could be helpful in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], potentially enabling more efficient recruitment strategies that better link researchers, clinicians and families. Community screening approaches (to identify parents or older siblings with elevated ADHD symptoms) could also help to reach families who may be missed by other recruitment strategies, such as those who do not have a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. The current study was also restricted to families who lived within 2 hours of one of the study site centres. Shifting to an in-home parent-administered set-up may help to improve recruitment in future home-based eye tracking studies, by removing such geographical barriers and allowing for greater numbers of families to be reached.</p>

                <title>Outcome of the training</title>
                <p id="Par44">This trial yielded null results for both primary and secondary outcome measures. Some of the effect sizes we observed (around 0.39) indicate that attention skills around the end of the first year may be malleable, and that variations on the procedures we used, perhaps delivered with greater intensity or over a longer time period, may still be worth pursuing. One area for future exploration concerns the degree of contingency needed for optimal learning. For the training tasks, our fidelity measures showed that, on average, the eye tracker detected the infant’s gaze 68% of the time that they were looking to the screen. Such tracking validity is common even in lab-based developmental eye tracking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] but here was exacerbated by home testing. This means that sometimes the games reacted as though the infant was not looking when they were. It may be that future improvements in eye tracking hardware will allow more efficient implementation of the games and therefore a more effective training paradigm. Further, it may be that the density or number of sessions should be increased for this group of infants relative to typically developing children. However, we note that the primary outcome effect size is comparable to other early intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but is not in the predicted direction. This highlights that in order to design effective early interventions for ADHD we need greater understanding of the nature of the developing attention system in infancy; how individual differences in attention in infancy relate to longer-term behavioural outcomes; and the mechanisms through which the developing attention system can be strengthened. Our study was designed based on the most replicated infant attention training paradigm currently available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], but did not show robust effects. Our work indicates that such studies are now feasible, but that significant effort is required to generate robust and generalisable early intervention paradigms in this area.</p>
                <p id="Par45">The present RCT was designed with later emerging ADHD traits in mind, and the possibility of pre-empting some attention difficulties before they become embedded during the course of development. While the study is not sufficiently powered to address later clinical diagnosis of ADHD, scheduled assessments of the participants at 24 and 36 months will allow us to measure any longer term effects on traits, or on sub-clinical attention difficulties. Indeed, a recent pre-emptive trial of a parent-mediated intervention with infants with older siblings with autism showed a significant effect on symptoms over time despite no immediate post-training effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Combining the present design with an adaptation of parent-training approaches designed for older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] such that training can be administered with greater density and intensity (an immersion in an attention-supporting context) may also be a critical step forward in this field. However, it may be that the present trial is consistent with recent meta-analyses in indicating that cognitive training-style approaches to ADHD treatment are largely ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec28">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="Par46">A limitation of the study is the sample size. While the target sample size for this study was 50 infants, 43 infants were randomised. The trial was powered on the basis of findings from previous experimental studies that provided the best available evidence for the likely effect size (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Our confidence intervals do not entirely rule out smaller but clinically significant beneficial effects. However, the largest effect in our study (−0.39) was not in the predicted direction. Infant gaze is likely influenced by a range of environmental (such as socioeconomic status, SES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and genetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] factors. Our sample was not large enough to investigate subgroups (e.g. based on SES), nor was this a primary aim of the trial. Including larger, diverse samples in future home-based eye tracking studies could help to dissect the role that individual differences in environmental and genetic factors may have on measures of infant visual attention.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Another limitation of the study is that thus far, the infants have not been followed up into toddlerhood and preschool. In this study, we targeted infant attention skills. Infant attention skills in both screen-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and naturalistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] contexts have been shown to relate to later ADHD traits. However, there is some recent evidence that difficulties may be more apparent in other neurocognitive domains in the early development of ADHD, such as activity levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Moreover, the early development of attention involves a complex interplay both with other cognitive domains, such as learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], as well as environmental factors such as parenting behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and living environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, targeting attention skills alone may not have a significant effect on later ADHD traits, and perhaps a more multi-modal approach to intervention is required. However, though differences in infant attention may not distinguish children at an elevated likelihood for ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], executive attention skills may potentially act as a neurocognitive modifier, changing the developmental trajectory of associations between early differences in brain development and later behaviours related to the ADHD phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Follow-up of this cohort at 24 and 36 months of age will allow us to investigate potential longer term effects of the training on preschool ADHD traits, or sub-clinical attention difficulties.</p>
                <p id="Par48">A further limitation of the study is that the majority of families included in the trial were white (93% of mothers, and 90% of fathers, SM2.1). Under-recruitment of families from certain ethnic backgrounds may partly reflect a broader issue in the diagnostic process for ADHD, where ethnic and racial disparities have been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Future studies investigating early interventions for ADHD should focus on ensuring a more representative sample. Moving away from typical ad hoc recruitment processes towards digital tools for trial recruitment may increase trial visibility and potentially improve inclusivity and participation of under-represented groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par49">In conclusion, our study provides an important demonstration of a rigorously designed pre-emptive RCT at home for infants at elevated likelihood for ADHD. While the present study did not yield positive results, the feasibility of the intervention approach will provide an important impetus for paediatricians, ADHD researchers and psychologists to turn their attention to very early intervention in this population.</p>
