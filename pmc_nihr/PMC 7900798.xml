                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Approximately 418,000 people live in care homes in the UK, yet accessible, robust data on care home populations and organisation are lacking. This hampers our ability to plan, allocate resources or prevent risk. Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in care homes offer a potential solution. The value of detailed data on residents’ demographics, outcomes and contextual information captured in RCTs has yet to be fully realised. Irrespective of the intervention tested, much of the trial data collected overlaps in terms of structured assessments and descriptive information. Given the time and costs required to prospectively collect data in these populations, pooling anonymised RCT data into a structured repository offers benefit; secondary analyses of pooled RCT data can improve understanding of this under-researched population and enhance the future trial design. This protocol describes the creation of a project-specific repository of individual participant data (IPD) from trials conducted in care homes and subsequent expansion into a legacy dataset for wider use, to address the need for accurate, high-quality IPD on this vulnerable population.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Informed by scoping of relevant literature, the principal investigators of RCTs conducted in adult care homes in the UK since 2010 will be invited to contribute trial IPD. Contributing trialists will form a Steering Committee who will oversee data sharing and remain gatekeepers of their own trial’s data. IPD will be cleaned and standardised in consultation with the Steering Committee for accuracy. Planned analyses include a comparison of pooled IPD with point estimates from administrative sources, to assess generalisability of RCT data to the wider care home population. We will also identify key resident characteristics and outcomes from within the trial repository, which will inform the development of a national minimum dataset for care homes. Following project completion, management will migrate to the Virtual Trials Archives, forming a legacy dataset which will be expanded to include international RCTs, and will be accessible to the wider research community for analyses.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Analysis of pooled IPD has the potential to inform and direct future practice, research and policy at low cost, enhancing the value of existing data and reducing research waste. We aim to create a permanent archive for care home trial data and welcome the contribution of emerging trial datasets.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par15">Approximately 418,000 people live in care homes in the UK, yet accessible, reliable data on care homes, their residents and staff are lacking. The dearth of accessible, high-quality data has been highlighted previously, but was starkly exposed in the recent and continuing COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Information about care home capacity, staffing, health and social care needs and resident demographics are each required in order to inform resource allocation and meet their care needs. Administrative data (e.g. UK Office of National Statistics census) provides information about age, sex and demographic change in care home population over time, but cannot be readily linked to the long-term health, function or quality of life of individual residents. Length of stay, life expectancy and mortality of the care home population are not reliably known. Large cohort studies of older adults give much richer health data, but the proportion of care home residents in such studies is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies (CFAS) reports on 543 residents and English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) reports on 303 residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Internationally, large care home datasets are available, for example, through insurance schemes in private healthcare systems. However, with any routinely collected data, there are concerns over data quality, and for many of these registers, the data collected speak to a certain purpose only and may not contain the most relevant clinical information. In addition to problems sourcing data about residents, it is also difficult to find consistent information about the fragmented care home market, including staffing (ratios and retention), case mix, funding mix and ownership. The lack of publicly available national data on the care home sector is detrimental to those who live and work there. By failing to quantify the needs of those requiring care and their journey before entering care homes, local and national planning for the care needs of the ageing population living with dementia, multimorbidity and frailty is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, it is estimated that care home capacity will need to expand to facilitate care for those with complex needs to receive care at the end of their lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, current staffing, funding source, resident pathways to care and capacity to provide care are unknown.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted solely in care homes are a growing resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], collecting detailed information about every care home and resident they recruit. Whilst these RCTs may focus on a variety of health/care topics (e.g. falls risk, medication management, nutrition or infection) from the study team’s experience of working with various care home trials, we know that there is much overlap in outcome measurement and information collected on both residents and the care home structure. Trials in care homes monitor participants regularly, often for up to 1 year. Outcome measures, health resource use and clinical events as well as care home characteristics can therefore be tracked over this period, allowing for longitudinal analysis. Secondary analysis of individual participant data (IPD) allows for more complex and flexible analyses than is possible with only summary-level results. Whilst single care home trial datasets are valuable, if IPD from existing trials could be <italic>pooled</italic>, they would collectively provide a much larger, richer dataset on residents and staff of care homes. Repurposing care home trial data would permit rapid synthesis of large IPD through which to generate evidence based on high-quality data. This principle aligns with current moves towards improving efficiency and reducing research waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a theme of increasing importance to funders and peer reviewers. Pooled IPD would permit exploratory analysis to better understand the care home population, reduce duplication of effort and refine and pilot future research questions. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors has reiterated its commitment to improve trial transparency by sharing IPD from RCTs and registries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and strive to normalise the sharing of de-identified trial data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

                  <p id="Par17">Clinical data repositories such as Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR), Project Data Sphere and Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project are available to access IPD from single trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To allow data from <italic>multiple</italic> trials to be pooled into a single source within a secure data infrastructure, we will replicate the model developed by the Virtual Trials Archives (VTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. VTA was established in 2001, bringing together multiple, large, international data sets from completed clinical trials on stroke research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has since expanded to include two additional repositories in areas of cardiovascular and cognition (VICCTA) and renal transplantation (VIRTTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. VTA is a not-for-profit collaboration, with datasets hosted by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (RCB) at the University of Glasgow, UK. The VTA facilitates a wide range of empirical and methodological research including recent projects on test accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], psychometrics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Unlike with a traditional IPD meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], a key tenet is that data should be used for novel research and not to test original hypotheses from contributed RCTs, though IPD meta-analyses are possible with permission of contributing trialists. Investigators can access data by submitting a research proposal on the VTA website. Following approval by the relevant repository Steering Committee (a virtual collaboration of the original trialists), data extraction is tailored to the specific research question, and the requesting investigator is granted access to analyse the bespoke data extract on a secure, online analysis platform, adhering to data security standard operating procedures. On completion, the anonymised data extract is archived centrally. The VTA is funded by administrative charges per data request, which supports data curation, storage, continued development and day-to-day administration of the resource. VTA has a well-established governance infrastructure, with the ability to host data securely on a working data-sharing platform, and expertise to manage future trial inclusion and data access requests. To enable the care home trial repository to operate on a long-term basis, we are working closely with the VTA from the outset. Once operational, the repository will formally migrate to the VTA, where it will be named the Virtual International Care Homes Trials Archive (VICHTA; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Table 2 in <xref rid="Sec33" ref-type="sec">Appendix 3</xref>).

As part of preparatory work, we contacted a small number of trialists who had completed RCTs in UK care homes to date. Based on provisional agreement from five of these trialists, we anticipate the repository will initially combine trial data for over 4200 residents from 250 care homes across the UK. Through an ongoing scoping review, we have identified a further thirteen potential trials, representing an additional 6000 residents from approximately 500 care homes. We anticipate this will increase further as the project develops, including the recruitment of international studies in the legacy dataset. Additional trials will be identified through an ongoing Google Scholar alert, systematically through concurrent reviews (Prospero: CRD42020155923), by contacting all trialists listed in the NIHR ‘Advancing Care’ Themed Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (44 studies featured), the CLAHRC National Work stream Report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] (32 studies featured), and snowballing techniques utilising the DACHA project management team, study steering committees and their professional networks.</p>

Following a positive response, we will set up a meeting (phone, Zoom or face to face depending on trialist preference) to outline the project in more detail. If a trialist agrees to participate, they will be asked to sign a data transfer agreement that covers the transfer, use and storage of their trial data (see Terms of Reference, <xref rid="Sec30" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>

All data will remain on their server and analysed through their secure analysis platform, in accordance with standard conventions for data sharing initiatives. During the development stage, access to the data will be restricted to the core team (LI, JB and MA), who have undergone necessary data protection and confidentiality training.

                  <p id="Par48">When trial data are submitted to the repository, the DACHA co-ordinator (LI) at the University of Hertfordshire (UH) will access the server remotely via a secure virtual private network. A data checking analysis plan will be developed, outlining procedures and decision rules for data pooling, according to established principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We will query any anomalies, including checks for invalid, out-of-range or inconsistent items with the trialist (or their nominated study contact) to ensure that the data are represented accurately. Trials may use the same outcome measure but administer it differently. If a measure could be completed, e.g. face-to-face with a member of the research team, or as self-report or as proxy-response from care staff, we will ensure this data are coded in a standardised way. Decisions on the standardisation will be made by consensus decisions with the wider TSC or delegated groups, e.g. trial statisticians. Where possible, we will request all individual domain scores for outcome measures as opposed to the single, composite scores. All trial datasets will be cross-checked against their respective protocol and statistical analysis plan to confirm how each composite outcome was derived. If the scoring was modified, we will seek clarification from the respective trialists in the TSC for their advice and interpretation on whether the composite outcome data should be removed or amended to enable pooling with other trial datasets. We will record the number and timing of measurement points and ensure all time points are labelled consistently.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">We anticipate there will be a strong opportunity for methodological research to look at groups of measures, e.g. cognitive assessments, to attempt mapping or potentially harmonising similar variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

We will request all health service use questionnaires used in the trials and look for differences which may potentially impact the findings. Due to differences in price years and interpretation of unit costs, we will focus on resource use (e.g. number of GP contacts) as opposed to costs (e.g. total cost of GP contacts over the follow-up period). We will request datasets to include missing values where possible and not the imputed values. In developing the repository, we will not perform any missing data imputation.</p>

At the proposal stage, TSC members may declare an interest in joining the analysis team of a proposed project and take an active role, thereby meeting the ICMJE criteria for authorship.

                <p id="Par70">The Virtual Trials Archives are coordinated on behalf of the steering committees by MA (a coordinator with more than 10 years of experience in running VTA). During the DACHA study, the TSC will be co-chaired by JB (co-investigator on DACHA) and TQ, also based at the University of Glasgow and experienced in chairing other VTA repositories. Chairmanship can be reassigned at the nomination of the TSC. The research team has extensive clinical trials experience and all members are familiar with handling confidential anonymised personal health data.</p>

                <p id="Par72">Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) for the DACHA study will be led by the University of East Anglia and our expert-by-experience co-applicant (a family carer). PPIE will be represented on the DACHA independent steering group by two carers with family living in care homes. A PPIE panel is planned to work as the hub of PPIE activities, made up of 8–10 people representing care home staff, managers, family carers of care home residents and representatives of people with dementia. This group will meet 4-monthly, initially virtually. The care home resident PPIE contribution will be supported through two groups based in Norfolk care homes.</p>
                <p id="Par73">In addition to the PPIE panel, DACHA will have four regional groups of Expert Consultation groups, meeting annually. During these meetings, we will explain what data will be available in the trial repository, and then ask members to identify research topics that may be important for further investigation. Residents, their relatives, care home workers and managers are better placed to prioritise research questions on a more practical level; therefore, this exercise will ensure the right issues are being addressed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par74">This protocol defines the methods to curate a repository of care home trials for IPD analysis. It uses the existing, established infrastructure of the Virtual Trials Archive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to create this resource for informing the DACHA study and generating a legacy repository which will be expanded to include international care home trial datasets for future researchers. This represents an efficient use of existing research resources, enhancing the value from existing data and reducing waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We are aware of one IPD meta-analysis combining the US and Dutch nursing home data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but this is the first attempt to develop a care homes repository, to which new trials can continually be added. This model can and has been replicated across a range of health conditions, including stroke, atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes and metabolic conditions, cognition, renal transplantation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.virtualtrialsarchives.org/">http://www.virtualtrialsarchives.org/</ext-link>) and aphasia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.aphasiatrials.org/aphasia-dataset/">https://www.aphasiatrials.org/aphasia-dataset/</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par75">Those living in care homes are a vulnerable population, and research in this setting is challenging, not least due to high rates of incapacity and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Re-use of data is efficient, minimising burden and intrusion to residents and staff and reducing the need for primary data collection. It adds value to the original trial question—whilst most trials are framed as <italic>health</italic> research questions, IPD provides the opportunity to address the questions and priorities of <italic>social care</italic>, including experiences of living and dying in care homes. In the absence of standardised data sets about care home residents, trial data will help us to understand more about this under-researched population. Curating a resource which is based on the setting of care, rather than being disease-specific, is attractive as we recognise that many of the challenges posed by health and care services are in caring for those with complex multimorbidity. Furthermore, there are lessons to improve future trial design, by exploring the value of the assessments and measures used in care home trials, to understand their utility, feasibility and relevance to care home life. Many of these tools were designed for use in community-dwelling adults or those in hospital settings and their applicability to the population living in care homes has yet to be established. IPD analysis can help address these questions, which are otherwise unanswered.</p>

                    <title>The Virtual International Care Home Trials Archives (VICHTA) terms and conditions for Steering Committee Membership</title>
                    <p id="Par81">The Virtual International Care Home Trials Archives (VICHTA) will be an international repository for anonymised data from completed clinical trials that were set in care homes. This will be a not-for-profit collaboration hosted by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics and the University of Glasgow.</p>
                    <p id="Par82">Data will primarily be sought for use in the ‘Developing research resources and minimum data set for Care Homes’ Adoption and use’ (DACHA) study and will be contributed to VICHTA upon completion of the project to form a legacy dataset that can be interrogated for novel exploratory analyses. As per existing regulations that govern the stroke and cardiovascular sister archives (VISTA and VICCTA, respectively), we will not permit the reanalysis of treatment effects or reanalysis of the aims of the original trials.</p>
                    <p id="Par83">Trialists that contribute anonymised RCT data to VICHTA will form the Steering Committee (1 named representative per trial, as per existing regulations). The role of the Steering Committee will be to:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par84">Provide any additional information about relevant trial’s data, as appropriate, to aid in data cleaning and compilation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">Review proposals to use data from VICHTA for novel exploratory analyses</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">Provide constructive feedback and peer review of proposals and papers</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par87">The Steering Committee members may also declare an interest in joining the analysis team of a proposed project provided that they take active participation in the project and meet the criteria for authorship stated by relevant journals. All declarations of interest should be made at the proposal circulation stage, and not at the paper review stage.</p>
                    <p id="Par88">All papers that are generated as a result of VICHTA analyses will carry the by-line ‘on behalf of the VICHTA Collaborators’, and a full list of the Steering Committee members will be included in the appendix of all manuscripts.</p>
                    <p id="Par89">Whilst we understand that reviewing proposals, abstracts and manuscripts can take some time, we appreciate active involvement from each Steering Committee member. If, however, certain members are unable to actively review all outputs, decisions will be made by a quorum.</p>
