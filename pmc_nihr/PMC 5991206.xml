                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Dopaminergic functioning is thought to play critical roles in both motivation and addiction. There is preliminary evidence that dopamine agonists reduce the motivation for cigarettes in smokers. However, the effects of pramipexole, a dopamine D3 receptor preferring agonist, have not been investigated.</p>
                  <p>The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an acute dose of pramipexole on the motivation to earn cigarettes and nondrug rewards.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="s2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Twenty dependent and 20 occasional smokers received 0.5 mg pramipexole using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Motivation for cigarettes and consummatory nondrug rewards was measured using the DReaM-Choice task, in which participants earned, and later “consumed,” cigarettes, music, and chocolate. Demand for cigarettes was measured using the Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT). Self-reported craving, withdrawal, and drug effects were also recorded.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Dependent smokers chose (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and button-pressed for (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) cigarettes more, and chose chocolate less (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), than occasional smokers. Pramipexole did not affect the number of choices for or amount of button-pressing for any reward including cigarettes, which was supported by a Bayesian analysis. The dependent smokers had greater demand for cigarettes than occasional smokers across all CPT outcomes (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .021), apart from elasticity. Pramipexole did not affect demand for cigarettes, and this was supported by Bayesian analyses. Pramipexole produced greater subjective “feel drug” and “dislike drug” effects than placebo.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Dependent and occasional cigarette smokers differed in their motivation for cigarettes but not for the nondrug rewards. Pramipexole did not acutely alter motivation for cigarettes. These findings question the role of dopamine D3 receptors in cigarette-seeking behavior in dependent and occasional smokers.</p>

                  <title>Implications</title>
                  <p>This study adds to the growing literature about cigarette versus nondrug reward processing in nicotine dependence and the role of dopamine in cigarette-seeking behavior. Our results suggest nicotine dependence is associated with a hypersensitivity to cigarette rewards but not a hyposensitivity to nondrug rewards. Furthermore, our results question the importance of dopamine D3 receptors in motivational processing of cigarettes in occasional and dependent smokers.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Mesocorticolimbic dopamine functioning putatively plays a critical role in the reinforcing effects of recreational drugs, including nicotine,<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and the motivation for and learning about nondrug rewards.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref></sup> Over the past few decades, drug addiction has come to be conceptualized as a condition stemming from perturbations in the dopamine system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref></sup> More recently, theories of addiction have emphasized the apparent concomitant increase in sensitivity to drug reward and decrease in sensitivity to nondrug reward.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Dopamine is hypothesized to underpin this balance between drug and nondrug reward processing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Nicotine dependence has been associated with neuroadaptations in the dopamine system,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> a neural insensitivity to monetary reward<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and an imbalance in the processing of cigarette and nondrug rewards.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Manipulation of the dopamine system is thus a promising avenue for the treatment of nicotine dependence. Indeed, bupropion, a dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is efficacious in treating nicotine dependence. Bromocriptine, a dopamine D2 receptor preferring agonist, has been shown to acutely reduce ad libitum cigarette smoking,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> while extended use of bromocriptine was also associated with reduced cigarette smoking.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Pramipexole is a non-ergot-derived dopamine agonist that binds to dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors, with the greatest affinity for the D3 receptor.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Pramipexole is primarily used to treat Parkinson’s disease due to its activation of dopamine receptors in the degenerating basal ganglia. At low doses (e.g., 0.5 mg oral in humans), pramipexole is thought to act primarily on presynaptic autoreceptors such that it has an inhibitory effect on phasic dopamine firing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref></sup> This reduction in phasic firing could theoretically lessen craving and hence decrease motivation for cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Indeed, in nicotine-dependent individuals, 0.5 mg of pramipexole reduced attentional bias to cigarette images<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> while enhancing motivation for monetary reward.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Aspects of both cigarette<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and nondrug reward processing<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> significantly predict the success of smokers who are attempting to quit. Therefore, pharmacological treatments for nicotine dependence that simultaneously reduce motivation for cigarettes and augment motivation for alternative, nondrug rewards may be particularly efficacious.</p>
              <p>In this study, we examined whether a single low (0.5 mg oral) dose of pramipexole would reduce dependent and occasional cigarette smokers’ motivation for cigarettes. We utilized a newly designed task, the Drug Reward and Motivation-Choice (DReaM-Choice) task,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> which measures motivation for both cigarette and consummatory nondrug rewards, using choices and repeated button-pressing. The DReaM-Choice has been shown to be sensitive to the level of nicotine dependence and acute nicotine abstinence. We also used a hypothetical cigarette purchase task (CPT),<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> which is a behavioral economic task that asks participants how many cigarettes they would buy for increasing amounts of money. Behavioral economics views addiction as a state in which the substance acquires higher value than alternative rewards; the CPT measures the relationship between cigarette consumption and cost, that is, demand for cigarettes. Purchase tasks are analogous to progressive ratio self-administration tasks, but they are more efficient and have been used successfully in tobacco<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and marijuana<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> users.</p>
              <p>We hypothesized that:</p>
              <list list-type="simple">
                <list-item>
                  <p>Pramipexole would reduce motivation for cigarettes and increase motivation for nondrug rewards in the DReaM-Choice task.</p>
                </list-item>

                <p>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design with a between-subjects factor of group (dependent and occasional) and a within-subject factor of drug (placebo and pramipexole) was used. Twenty dependent (10 women) and 20 occasional (10 women) cigarette smokers took part in the study. A power analysis showed that a total sample size of 22 would be sufficient to detect a between-within interaction of medium effect size (<italic>f</italic> = 0.25) and a correlation between repeated measures of 0.7 (based on Lawn et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>), with an α of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. However, we proceeded with the larger total sample size of 40 as used previously with the DReaM-Choice task,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> which gave us a power of 0.98 to detect an interaction with an effect size of f = 0.25. Having said that, if the correlation between repeated measures in this study was not as high as it was in the previous study (0.7), the power to detect the interaction would drop from 0.98.</p>
                <p>Dependent smokers smoked on average ≥10 cigarettes/day and had a score of ≥5 on the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Occasional smokers smoked on average 0.5–5 cigarettes per week and had an FTND score of 0. More detailed eligibility criteria can be found in the Supplementary material. The experiment was approved by University College London ethics committee, and all participants gave informed consent.</p>

                  <p>The DReaM-Choice (Figure 1)<sup>14</sup> task involves participants making a series of two-option choices between different rewards (cigarette, music, chocolate, and paper—a neutral commodity) and then working for the chosen option via repeated button-pressing.

                      <p>(A) Diagrammatic representation of a single trial of the DReaM-Choice Task. It was designed to determine (1) the number of choices for each reward, which indexes “relative preference” and (2) the average number of button-presses for each reward, which indexes motivation. During the “choice stage”, the cues were presented and a choice was made with button F (left option) or J (right option; unlimited time); during the “anticipate stage 1”, the word of the reward, for example, “cigarette,” was shown (0.5s); during the “anticipate stage 2,” a small version of the cue was shown (4s); during the “respond stage,” the spacebar was pressed as many times as desired with the nondominant little finger in 7s,<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> in order to win points for the chosen reward; during the “feedback stage,” feedback concerning the amount of points won was provided for 1s. Each of the 6 possible choices were presented 4 times in three blocks, making a total of 72 trials, with trial order pseudo-randomized and left/right cue position counterbalanced. (B) The cues used in the DReaM-Choice task to represent each reward. From left to right: cigarette, chocolate, music, and paper. The “delivered rewards” which were actually given to participants to consume after the DReaM-Choice task finished were Malboro Gold cigarettes (tar 6 mg and nicotine 0.5 mg), Cadbury’s Dairy Milk chocolate, individually chosen music,<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and pieces (~2cm<sup>2</sup>) of lined paper.

                  <p>After the task, participants received their delivered rewards and had 20 minutes to consume them. Every time they consumed 1 unit (¼ cigarette, 30s music, ½ chunk of chocolate) of a reward, they reported their subjective liking (rated from −10 “extremely dislike” to +10 “extremely like”). However, we report only their subjective liking of the first “unit” of each reward consumed due to satiation effects.</p>

                  <p>The CPT<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> assesses cigarette demand, or in other words, the relationship between cigarette consumption and cost.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> It is an analogue of a progressive ratio operant task, as consumption is investigated under progressively increasing financial cost. It is an established and well-validated task that is used to examine the behavioral economic concept of “demand” relating to cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In this version, participants were asked how many cigarettes they would hypothetically buy for the next 3 hours at increasing prices.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Participants were asked “How many cigarettes would you smoke if they were _____ each”. Prices included: £0 (free), 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 15p, 20p, 25p, 30p, 35p, 40p, 45p, 50p, 60p, 70p, 80p, 90p, £1, £2, £3, £4, and £5 and were presented in that order. The CPT generates five indices of cigarette demand: breakpoint (cost suppressing consumption to zero), intensity (amount of drug consumed at zero cost), O<sub>max</sub> (peak expenditure), P<sub>max</sub> (price at maximum expenditure), and elasticity (the slope of the demand curve); see Supplementary material for more details.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>Participants were screened on the telephone to determine if they met the eligibility criteria. Eligible participants attended two 3.5-hour sessions separated by a washout period lasting between 7 and 25 days (mean = 9, SD = 4.4). Participants were told to smoke “normally” before the experiment; they were allowed to smoke (or not) before they arrived, depending on what was normal for them. Participants were also asked to fast for an hour beforehand and to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery on the day of testing. First, participants provided a carbon monoxide (CO) reading and completed the state questionnaires (excluding the DEQ). Pramipexole (0.5mg; peak plasma levels 1-3 h)<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> or matched placebo (lactose powder) was then orally administered. Based on previous research,<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> 30 mg of the peripheral dopamine D2 antagonist domperidone was orally administered on both sessions to reduce unwanted side effects such as nausea. Previous research suggests minimal central effects of domperidone,<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> as it cannot cross the blood–brain barrier.<sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Therefore, we assumed domperidone would not affect reward processing, and previous researchers have made this assumption too.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The nausea experienced by the participants had domperidone not been administered would have made the experiment unfeasible. Immediately after drug administration, participants completed half of the trait questionnaires, which were split across the two sessions. Testing began 90 minutes postdrug administration. Assessments were conducted in the following order: state questionnaires (90 minutes), CPT (100 minutes), other tasks that will be described elsewhere (105 minutes), DReaM-Choice task (145 minutes), reward consumption (175 minutes), and state questionnaires (195 minutes). Given the participants could have smoked just before taking part in the experiment, the minimum length of nicotine abstinence before the CPT was therefore approximately 1 hour 40 minutes, and the minimum length of nicotine abstinence before the DReaM-Choice task was approximately 2 hours 25 minutes. Smoking was not permitted until the consumption stage of the experiment. Participants were reimbursed £7.50/h.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>All data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS version 22) and Graphpad Prism 6, for the Cigarette Purchase Task data.</p>
                <p>The majority of data were analyzed using the general linear model. Where residuals were not normally distributed or the group variances were not homogenous, nonparametric tests were used when available and appropriate. In repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA], when sphericity was violated, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used, and corrected degrees of freedom are reported. In order to explore significant interactions, a Bonferonni correction was applied to post hoc comparisons via the syntax in SPSS. Drug order was included in all of the ANOVAs to determine if its presence affected the pattern of results. It did not, so the results are reported without drug order included. Given Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores differed between groups, we included this as a covariate after each analysis. In order to evaluate evidence in favor of null hypotheses, scaled Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow (JZS) Bayes factors were calculated using an online calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcl.missouri.edu/bayesfactor">http://pcl.missouri.edu/bayesfactor</ext-link>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether pramipexole acutely influences motivation for real cigarettes. In dependent and occasional cigarette smokers, a single oral 0.5 mg dose of pramipexole did not affect the relative preference for, motivation for and liking of cigarettes in the DReaM-Choice task. Moreover, there was no evidence that pramipexole affected demand for cigarettes in the CPT or self-reported craving or withdrawal symptoms. Nor was there evidence that pramipexole influenced responding for the consummatory nondrug rewards in the DReaM-Choice task. Bayesian analyses, conducted within each group separately, showed there was evidence in favor of the null hypotheses that pramipexole did not affect motivation for cigarettes or cigarette demand in the CPT. Furthermore, pramipexole did not have different effects on occasional and dependent smokers’ motivation for cigarettes. In support of previous research,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> dependent smokers exhibited greater motivation for cigarettes than occasional smokers, while there was no evidence that dependent smokers were less motivated to receive chocolate or music.</p>
              <sec id="s37">
                <title>Pramipexole</title>
                <p>In terms of pramipexole affecting choices, button-pressing, and demand for cigarettes, we found nonsignificant results, mostly small effect sizes and evidence from Bayesian analyses in favor of the null hypotheses. Our findings therefore question the role of the D2-subfamily of dopamine receptors, especially the D3 receptor in the motivation to smoke cigarettes. Given bromocriptine reduced ad libitum smoking in humans,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> D2-preferring agonists may be superior to D3-preferring agonists (pramipexole) in disrupting cigarette processing. However, their results could be partially due to large increases in nausea, rather than central dopamine receptor agonism. If nausea simply reduces cigarette smoking, the coadministration of domperidone may have dampened the effects of pramipexole. Interestingly, although we coadministered domperidone, the pramipexole condition did lead to higher ratings of nausea and drowsiness at postconsumption, so domperidone did not fully eradicate the emetic effects of pramipexole.</p>
                <p>More generally, the focus on dopamine in addiction, particularly nonstimulant addiction, may be overstated.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For instance, acutely administered nicotine has sometimes failed to provoke dopamine release in the striatum,<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and an unchanged striatal D2/D3 receptor density in cigarette smokers has been reported.<sup><xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Despite some positive findings concerning bromocriptine, other dopamine agonists and antagonists have failed to show effects on craving for cigarettes.<sup><xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Our null results lend support to the general hypothesis that nicotine addiction is more complex, in a neurobiological sense, than simply a dysfunctioning dopamine system.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, it may be that chronic, rather than acute, administration of pramipexole is needed in order to more substantially manipulate the dopamine system such that motivation to smoke is lowered. Indeed, bupropion, an approved drug for aiding smoking cessation can increase smoking when given acutely<sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> but reduces smoking when given chronically.<sup><xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Importantly, pramipexole may have different effects in cigarette smokers who are motivated to quit from those who are not, like bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Previously, pramipexole (at this dose) has been shown to reduce the strength of urges to smoke.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In contrast, craving in this study appeared to be greater during the pramipexole session compared with the placebo session (on two subscales of the TCQ-SF and the “strength of urges” subscale of the MPSS). However, there were no Drug ×Time interactions, and these effects appeared to be driven by seemingly random baseline differences (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Table C). Hence, our results suggest that pramipexole neither reduced nor enhanced craving for cigarettes.</p>
                <p>Pramipexole did not affect relative preference for, motivation for or liking of the consummatory nondrug rewards, music, and chocolate. Given its promotivational acute,<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> we had hoped pramipexole would enhance nondrug reward processing, while impairing cigarette reward processing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> This differential profile of drug and nondrug reward processing effects may have the most therapeutic benefits.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, not only did pramipexole fail to significantly alter processing of cigarette reward, it also failed to alter reward processing of the consummatory nondrug rewards.</p>

                <title>Group differences</title>
                <p>In terms of group differences, the dependent smokers demonstrated hypersensitivity to cigarettes compared with the occasional smokers. The dependent smokers chose cigarettes more frequently, worked harder for them during the button-pressing stage and reported greater subjective liking when they consumed cigarettes. This replicates a previous comparison between these groups on the DReaM-Choice task.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Despite augmented motivation for drugs being a hallmark of addiction, previous laboratory-based tests of cigarette self-administration have sometimes failed to differentiate addicted and nonaddicted smokers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Therefore, these data from the DReaM-Choice reveal that enhanced motivated responding for cigarettes in dependent versus occasional smokers can be reliably detected in the laboratory. Moreover, as would be expected, the forced period of nicotine abstinence during the experiment enhanced craving only in the dependent smokers, but not the occasional smokers, who would be used to periods much longer than this without smoking.</p>
                <p>There was no evidence that dependent smokers were less motivated for chocolate or music than occasional smokers, as measured by button-pressing. This corroborates previous research<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> that nicotine-dependent smokers do not appear to be amotivated for nondrug rewards following ad libitum smoking or short (approximately 2 hours 25 minutes in this study) nicotine abstinence. Whether or not more substantial nicotine abstinence (12-24 hours) produces nondrug reward processing deficits remains contentious.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup></p>

Another strength is that results from the DReaM-Choice task and the CPT dovetailed to demonstrate that pramipexole had no significant effect on motivation to smoke cigarettes. Moreover, the associations between performance on the DReaM-Choice task and the CPT demonstrate the DReaM-Choice task’s validity. A methodological improvement would have been the measurement of biological variables, such as pramipexole plasma levels<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> so that the ability of the drug to enter the blood could have been verified. Future research should also investigate the effects of different doses of pramipexole on motivational processing.</p>

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that an acute, low dose of pramipexole reduces motivation for cigarettes or redresses the imbalance of cigarette and non-drug reward processing in dependent cigarette smokers. Following a short period of nicotine abstinence (2 hours 25 minutes), dependent smokers appeared to be more motivated for cigarettes but no less motivated for consummatory nondrug rewards than occasional smokers. These findings may question the role of the D2-subfamily of dopamine receptors, especially the D3 receptor, in cigarette-seeking behavior in both dependent and occasional smokers; however, further pharmacological and imaging research is needed to fully understand what roles these receptors play in nicotine dependence.</p>
