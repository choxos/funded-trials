                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Prevention of fragility fractures, a source of significant economic and personal burden, is hindered by poor uptake of fracture prevention medicines. Enhancing communication of scientific evidence and elicitation of patient medication-related beliefs has the potential to increase patient commitment to treatment. The <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>mproving uptake of <italic toggle="yes">Fra</italic>cture <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>revention drug treatments (iFraP) programme aims to develop and evaluate a theoretically informed, complex intervention consisting of a computerised web-based decision support tool, training package and information resources, to facilitate informed decision-making about fracture prevention treatment, with a long-term aim of improving informed treatment adherence. This protocol focuses on the iFraP <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>evelopment (iFraP-D) work.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The approach to iFraP-D is informed by the Medical Research Council complex intervention development and evaluation framework and the three-step implementation of change model. The context for the study is UK fracture liaison services (FLS), which enact secondary fracture prevention. An evidence synthesis of clinical guidelines and Delphi exercise will be conducted to identify content for the intervention. Focus groups with patients, FLS clinicians and general practitioners and a usual care survey will facilitate understanding of current practice, and investigate barriers and facilitators to change. Design of the iFraP intervention will be informed by decision aid development standards and theories of implementation, behaviour change, acceptability and medicines adherence. The principles of co-design will underpin all elements of the study through a dedicated iFraP community of practice including key stakeholders and patient advisory groups. In-practice testing of the prototype intervention will inform revisions ready for further testing in a subsequent pilot and feasibility randomised trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In the UK, 3 million people are estimated to have osteoporosis,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> contributing to over 500 000 fragility fractures (fractures resulting from low trauma) per year, costing an estimated £4.4 billion per annum.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Fragility fractures can be devastating, sometimes resulting in loss of independence and mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Hip fractures alone account for 85 000 unplanned hospital admissions and 1.8 million bed-days in the UK per year.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Evidence-based treatments, such as bisphosphonates, are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for patients with osteoporosis and/or a high fracture risk. They are inexpensive, cost-effective, readily available and reduce fracture risk by 20%–70% (depending on fracture site).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Despite this, a treatment gap exists. Up to 80% of patients who experience a fragility fracture do not receive medication in the year following fracture,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> 25% of people who are offered medication decline it (non-initiation)<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and among those who do start bisphosphonates, few persist for long enough for it to be effective, with adherence estimated at 16%–60% at 1 year.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Closing this treatment gap may prevent at least 20 000 hip fractures annually in the UK.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Patient reasons for non-initiation and non-persistence of oral bisphosphonates (the mainstay of osteoporosis treatment) are complex and include: perceptions that drugs are not effective, not necessary and/or not safe; limited understanding of the consequences of non-treatment and concerns about perceived or experienced side effects.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Despite national osteoporosis guidance recommending the provision of information as a core component of management,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> patients report that osteoporosis information provided in consultations is often not easy to understand.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Some primary care clinicians believe that bisphosphonates are not safe, effective or necessary.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The more recent shift to base treatment recommendations on fracture risk rather than bone density readings,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> is not without challenge: patients struggle to understand fracture risk assessments<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and frequently underestimate their risk of fracture.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This suggests unmet health literacy needs and patients have identified improving access to information from health professionals as the number one patient priority for osteoporosis research.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>
              <p>Patients ultimately decide whether to start and continue taking medication, but this decision-making is influenced by the clinician-patient interaction. In order to decide to start and persist with medication, patients need to believe that recommended drug treatment is necessary, relevant, safe and practicable. Effective communication that enables patients to understand complex medical terms and concepts in lay terms, increases patient satisfaction, facilitates participation in the consultation, promotes trust<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and may increase patients’ commitment to medication.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This highlights the relevance of promoting and supporting effective communication between clinician and patients, and suggests that improving communication of the harms and benefits of osteoporosis medications may be beneficial in reducing the treatment gap.</p>
              <p>Decision aids (DAs) include numerical estimates of risk/benefit. They can facilitate improved risk communication and support patient decision-making before or during healthcare consultations.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> When used across a range of conditions, DAs can increase patient knowledge, reduce decisional conflict, increase patient participation in decision-making and improve the accuracy of risk perception.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A recent Cochrane review reported high-quality evidence that DAs, across a range of conditions, increase patient knowledge and reduce decisional conflict, and moderate-quality evidence that DAs increase patient participation in decision-making and improve the accuracy of risk perception.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Increases in knowledge and informed choice were also reported in studies where health literacy needs were addressed.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Evidence from pooled analyses of studies where there was no equipoise (meaning that DAs were used to give information about recommended drug treatments, rather than to choose between treatment options with perceived equal benefits), has indicated that DAs improve treatment initiation rates.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In osteoporosis, use of DAs can increase accuracy of risk perception and shared decision-making. However, existing osteoporosis DAs fail to comprehensively meet international quality standards and patient needs,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> underlining the requirement for further development.</p>
              <p>DAs are sometimes called decision support tools (DSTs), particularly when tools also contain clinician decision support. DSTs can also support clinicians to follow evidence-based practice and have been shown to improve adherence to evidence-based guidelines.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref></p>
              <p>The <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>mproving uptake of <italic toggle="yes">Fra</italic>cture <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>revention drug treatments (iFraP) programme aims to develop and evaluate a theoretically informed, complex intervention consisting of a computerised (C)DST, training package and information resources to facilitate informed decision-making about fracture prevention treatment, with a long-term aim of improving informed treatment adherence.

                <title>Overview of context and intervention</title>
                <p>The proposed iFraP consultation intervention will be primarily designed for fracture liaison services (FLSs). These are usually nurse-led, and address secondary fracture prevention by: systematically identifying patients with fragility fractures; assessing the patient’s bone health, risk of falls and future fracture and providing treatment recommendations to the patient and primary care. Clinical standards for FLS also recommend follow-up consultations, 3 and 12 months postfracture, to support medicines adherence.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Within the context of FLS, all consultations are concerned with future fracture prevention, which will maximise efficiency of recruitment and testing. The multidisciplinary study team will allow the relevance of the intervention for use in other primary and secondary care settings in which fracture prevention treatments are recommended to patients, to be considered.</p>

                <title>Theoretical frameworks underpinning iFraP development</title>
                <p>The long-term aim of the iFraP intervention is to improve fracture prevention treatment uptake, thereby preventing future fragility fractures. The intervention is targeted for use by clinicians together with the patient. This will empower clinicians to support patient behaviour change, and support clinicians with the skills to elicit and address patient perceptions and practicalities related to treatment adherence. The necessity-concerns framework (NCF) will be used as an overarching theoretical framework when designing the iFraP intervention to understand patient’s attitudes and beliefs underpinning treatment non-adherence.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The NCF suggests that medication adherence is influenced by implicit judgements of personal need for the treatment (necessity beliefs) and concerns about the potential consequences of treatment.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p>
                <p>To optimise iFraP in terms of acceptability to clinicians and patients, we will use the theoretical framework of acceptability (TFA)<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> as an overarching framework to inform iFraP intervention design. The TFA consists of seven constructs of acceptability of healthcare interventions (affective attitude, burden, intervention coherence, ethicality, perceived expectations, opportunity cost and self-efficacy). These constructs will inform data collection and analysis.</p>
                <p>The implementation of iFraP is informed by the Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivation Behaviour-Based Theory of Change Model (COM-B)<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the complementary theoretical domains famework (TDF),<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which aim to simplify and integrate a range of behaviour change theories. The TDF identifies 14 related domains of influence on behaviour. In iFraP-D, data collection will be informed by domains within the TDF (eg, knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, skills and goals). This will identify potential barriers and enablers for clinicians to implement iFraP ahead of a formal feasibility study. normalisation process theory (NPT)<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> will underpin the investigation of the dynamics of implementing, embedding and integrating iFraP, in order to identify potential process problems related to implementing iFraP in the next phase of feasibility testing. NPT ensures consideration of potential structural problems about the integration of iFraP into existing services.</p>
                <p>The specific programme theory for the iFraP-D study is detailed in the study logic model (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). This initial logic model may undergo iterative changes throughout the iFraP programme. Throughout development, a health economist will define the decision problem enabling identification of the different elements of treatment effect potentially associated with the iFraP intervention and directly informing the data collection strategy, including primary and secondary outcomes, for the subsequent pilot and feasibility trial that will follow iFraP-D.</p>

Statements will be grouped together under overarching headings (eg, ‘share information about condition’ and ‘signpost next steps’) that reflect stages of the consultation (as discussed with the CoP).

Items with a mean importance score of &lt;4 (range 1–5) in both patient and clinician surveys will be removed. Items scoring a mean score of &lt;4 in either patient/carer or clinician survey will be individually reviewed by the Study Management Group (including PPIE members) to make a decision about whether the item progresses to round 2, informed by underpinning theory, other emergent findings in iFraP-D (eg, focus groups), PPIE member experiences and views, etc.</p>

                    <p>After round 2, statements will be ranked according to their mean rating score (calculated as per round 1). The top scoring statements from both patient/carer and clinician surveys will progress to round 3, identified as those in the top three of four quartiles. Statements with a patient/carer and/or clinician score in the lowest quartile will be reviewed by the Study Management Group (including PPIE members), as to whether the statement should progress to round 3, informed by the considerations described in round 1.</p>
                    <p>In round 3, low ranking items will be removed and participants will be asked to agree/disagree whether a statement is essential in a time-limited consultation, or not. Percentage agreement that ‘this item is essential in the time-limited consultation’ will be calculated. Statements will be ranked according to percentage agreement for both patient/carer and clinician surveys. To identify a set number of essential consultation statements, which can realistically be undertaken in a time-limited consultation, we will not predefine an arbitrary level of agreement for a task to be included in the iFraP consultation. The Study Management Group in conjunction with PPIE members and expert advisors will review the ranked findings and identify, using their own knowledge and experience and free-text responses, where the most appropriate threshold is for tasks or considerations to be classified as ‘essential’ or ‘optional’.</p>

                <p>The outputs from studies in step 1 and step 2 will be integrated to inform design of the CDST and training (objective 2, 3b, 3c). iFraP design decision-making will be made and documented by the Study Management Group.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Following design of the prototype iFraP consultation intervention (including CDST and training), we will conduct three cycles of in-practice (or field) testing to assess how the fracture prevention components work together, and the acceptability and feasibility of the prototype CDST (objective 3d).</p>

                  <title>Data integration</title>
                  <p>Data from the evidence synthesis, Delphi survey and focus groups will be integrated to add rigour, provide greater credibility to results and generate insights about the intervention in development. Integration will be achieved using a convergent design and merging of the quantitative and qualitative findings using side-by-side joint displays.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p>
                  <p>A framework for the consultation will be drafted, informed by the consultation stages identified in the evidence synthesis, underpinning theory, frameworks of shared decision-making and principles of health literacy. This will include a series of stages and tasks for the clinician to progress through during the consultation, including gathering information, clinician decision-making, eliciting patient knowledge through to summarising and signposting. Findings from the Delphi analysis (a list of items to be included—and whether they are essential or optional, a list of items excluded, and relevant free-text comments) and qualitative analysis will be mapped to the relevant stage of the consultation in the drafted framework. A separate extraction table will be used for joint display of other contextual considerations for the intervention, derived from the free-text in the Delphi and qualitative findings, and will be organised into considerations with relevance to (i) the tool development, (ii) the training development and/or (iii) subsequent trial design.</p>
                  <p>The joint display will be interrogated to identify ‘meta-inferences’:<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> confirmed, discordant and expanded findings. Resultant discordant areas, or areas of uncertainty, will be presented to the CoP and PAG for further discussion. Following stakeholder discussion, the list of content and considerations for (i) tool development, (ii) training development and (iii) the trial will be finalised.</p>

                    <p>We will conduct three cycles of in-practice testing of the prototype iFraP consultation in one FLS site. Each of the three cycles will consist of five consultations with patients and postconsultation interviews. At the end of each cycle, the FLS clinician conducting the prototype iFraP consultation will also be interviewed. Each consultation will be audio-recorded, observed and contain a ‘think-aloud’ interview</p>

                    <p>Patients with a recent fragility fracture (n=15) who are referred for an FLS consultation and clinicians conducting face-to-face FLS consultations (up to n=3). In-practice testing will take place at the Haywood Hospital FLS chosen for its geographical proximity to the study team. The Haywood Hospital FLS operates a one-stop model, meaning that if appropriate, patients have a bone density scan (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), nurse assessment, drug treatment recommendation and blood tests as part of one consultation.</p>

                    <p>Patients with FLS appointments will be asked to consent to having their consultation observed by a researcher and audio-recorded. For each patient participant, the researcher will conduct a brief (previously developed) warm-up exercise on the ‘think-aloud’ technique prior to the consultation.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> In each cycle of consultation and ‘think aloud’ interview, a three-step test interview approach will be used.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> The topic guide will be developed in collaboration with PAG members.</p>
                    <p>First, the researcher will observe and listen to the test consultation (noting any visual and verbal cues to be explored in the interview immediately following the consultation) and will make notes using an observation schedule. Patients will be asked to mention (aloud, at the time they arise) any thoughts and feelings, if they feel comfortable to do so, during the consultation as part of a ‘think-aloud’ process.</p>
                    <p>Second, patient participants will be interviewed on completion of the consultation using predefined and spontaneous probes related to iFraP intervention components, to follow-up issues that emerged during the consultation (eg, to explore unexpected responses and fill in gaps where the participant may not have commented in real-time). This step will provide evidence on whether risk communication is understood by participants in a consistent way and in the way intended, and how well the intervention is meeting its objectives.</p>
                    <p>Third, participants will be invited to explain comments made in step 2 and their behaviour during the consultation, and share views and opinions of the consultation. They will be encouraged to say everything they thought about each part of the consultation. Participants will be invited to contact the researcher if any further thoughts come to mind after the interview.</p>
                    <p>Postconsultation interviews with clinicians will be conducted as soon after the last consultation in the cycle as possible. A similar three-step approach will be used. In the first step however, these clinician participants will be played audio clips demonstrating where they explained risk, used the CDST and gave recommendations. They will be encouraged to think aloud and mention any thoughts or feelings during playback. Second and third steps will be for patient interviews.</p>

                    <p>The framework approach (as described above for focus groups) will be used. The first interviews will be analysed, with help from CoP and PAG members to interpret data. Relevant changes to iFraP will be made ahead of further testing, supported by theoretical frameworks to identify and overcome barriers to implementation, enabling an iterative cycle moving between user feedback and changes to the intervention.</p>
                    <p>The outcome of this study will finalise a draft iFraP intervention and intervention manual to be tested in a formal pilot and feasibility trial with nested value of information analysis, to evaluate acceptability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness.</p>
