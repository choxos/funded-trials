                <p>Although it is recognized in the early stages of cancer recovery that changes in
lifestyle including increases in physical activity improves physical function,
there are no clear findings whether low versus moderate intensity activity or
home or gym exercise offer optimal benefit. Isometric-resistance exercises can
be carried out with very little equipment and space and can be performed while
patients are bed-bound in hospital or at home. This embedded qualitative study,
based in an English hospital trust providing specialist cancer care, was
undertaken as a component of a feasibility trial to evaluate the acceptability
and feasibility of an isometric-resistance exercise program and explore the
suitability of functional assessments by drawing from the experiences of
abdominal cancer patients following surgery. Telephone interviews were
undertaken with 7 participants in the intervention group, and 8 interviews with
the usual care group (n = 15). The gender composition consisted of 11 females
and 4 males. Participantsâ ages ranged from 27 to 84 (M = 60.07, SD = 15.40).
Interviews were conducted between August 2017 and May 2018, with audio files
digitally recorded and data coded using thematic framework analysis. Our results
show that blinding to intervention or usual care was a challenge, participants
felt the intervention was safe and suitable aided by the assistance of a
research nurse, yet, found the self-completion questionnaire tools hard to
complete. Our study provides an insight of trial processes, participantsâ
adherence and completion of exercise interventions, and informs the design and
conduct of larger RCTs based on the experiences of abdominal cancer surgery
patients.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Surgery is one of the main types of treatment for abdominal cancer, with a high risk
of post-operative complications and a notable decrease in physical function.
Colorectal is the third most common cancer with 1.8 million cases worldwide in 2018
(10.6% of all cancers). Following colorectal cancer, the most common types of
abdominal cancers also include stomach (6.1%), liver (5.0%), followed by cervical
(3.3%), pancreatic (2.7%), kidney (2.4%) and ovarian (1.7%).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although it is recognized in the early stages of cancer recovery that changes
in lifestyle including increasing physical activity can help to improve overall
well-being, there are is very little clinical evidence in terms of how different
modes of physical function and modes of exercise can be incorporated following
active cancer treatment.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Data from the United Kingdom suggests that a third of people living with and beyond
cancer are completely inactive,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr6-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and 20% reported moderate or severe difficulties with mobility or usual activities.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The World Cancer Research Fund also found strong evidence that being
physically active decreased the risk of one of the main types of abdominal
cancerâthat of colorectal cancer (WCRF Colon Cancer Report 2018). Evidence on
physical activity for people recovering from cancer has been shown to improve
physical function without increases in fatigue associated with exercise. However,
there is little evidence to identify the optimum mode, frequency, intensity and
duration of activity required for beneficial effects in cancer populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In addition, there are no clear findings to compare whether low versus
moderate intensity activity, or home-based versus gym exercise offer the optimal
benefit. The rationale to determine whether home or gym exercises offer optimal
benefit is based on previous trials evidence, which showed similar outcomes between
patients regarding exercise maintenance and adherence.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Isometric-exercises can be performed in a confined space such as in the home
without requiring access to exercise equipment. Home-based isometric-resistance
exercises therefore have the potential to have a positive effect on patients
undergoing elective abdominal cancer surgery, as previous studies have shown that it
can preserve and optimize their physical condition.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>While there is recognition of the benefits of aerobic physical activity,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr15-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> randomized or quasi-randomized studies with a clear resistence muscle
strengthening component has seen low numbers of participants to allow for any
statistically significant evidence to be used for or against this type of exercise
program. The low numbers of participants has been due to recruitment taking place in
single study centers with exclusion of participants with colon surgery. The
methodological quality of these randomized studies are moderate, with unclear bias,
difficulty in blinding trial participants and therapists, and in respect to
description of the intervention, some information lacking in terms of equipment and
methodology with regard to aerobic and functional activity components.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Resistance exercise (or strength) training could help to facilitate recovery
of muscle function.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In particular isometric resistance (or static) training has been used in the
rehabilitation of weak or atrophied muscle following surgery;<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> important factors to be considered in establishing an effective training
regime include the training intensity, the number and durations of voluntary
contractions, and the number and frequency of training sessions.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Isometric-resistance exercises can be carried out with very little equipment
and space, and can be performed while patients are bed-bound in hospital or at home.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The overarching aim of the <bold>E</bold>xercise
<bold>P</bold>eri-<bold>O</bold>perative <bold>P</bold>rogramme (EPOP) trial was to
develop an isometric resistance exercise program intended to improve the physical
function of patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery for cancer, which aimed
at expediting their return to normal physical function. The aims of the qualitative
study were to qualitatively evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of an
isometric resistance exercise program, and explore the suitability of assessments
for physical function by drawing from the experiences of abdominal cancer surgery
patients involved in the EPOP study.</p>
              <p>Understanding the experiences of the patients is vital to consider which elements of
the exercise program were relevant and useful, as well as which parts were less
attractive. Exploring how different patients viewed and engaged with the
intervention is helpful in ascertaining how it can be made more feasible to
implement in the larger study.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>

                <title>Overall Study Design</title>
                <p>The study comprised 2 main phases. Phase 1 involved a systematic review followed
by a development study aimed at designing, developing and refining the
intervention with healthcare professionals and patients (further details have
been described in a forthcoming publication). Phase 2 involved the delivery of
the intervention with the intervention group receiving a 12 week
isometric-resistance program (see <xref rid="table1-1073274820950855" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The isometric resistance
exercise program consisted of a series of 10 static exercises, and utilized the
abdominal, back, neck, arm, hand, leg and foot muscles. It was planned to be
completed within a 12 week period following surgery. The usual care group were
encouraged to walk when they felt able but did not receive physiotherapy advice
on specific exercises. The qualitative study was a planned component of the
trial and was incorporated as part of Phase 2 and comprised post-intervention
follow-up exit interviews. The rationale of the qualitative study focused on
assessing whether it was feasible to recruit patients with elective abdominal
surgery, and second, exploring the adherence of patients to perform the
exercises, finish the program and complete the functional assessments provided
as questionnaires in the form of a booklet.</p>

                <p>The Phase 2 trial data collected included self-reported and objective measures of
assessments. Self-reported physical function assessment measures were collected
using the Short Physical Performance Battery Test (SPPB) and the
âtimed-up-and-goâ test (TUG). The outcome measures were collected at baseline,
2, 6 and 12 weeks. It also included the collection of qualitative data to
capture patient experiences of the study. For the purposes of this paper, we
report upon the findings from the embedded qualitative study in Phase 2.</p>

                <p>All patients were recruited from a large general hospital trust in England
providing specialist cancer care who were undergoing laparotomies and
laparoscopies for stomach, colorectal, and gynecological malignancies.
Initially, potential participants were approached face-to-face by a member of
their clinical team on behalf of the lead clinician by way of a signed letter,
which was accompanied by a patient information sheet to assist the participant
to make a decision whether to take part in the study. Participants provided
written informed consent to take part in both the intervention and a follow-up
telephone inâterview.</p>

                <title>Randomization</title>
                <p>The trial was a 2-arm, parallel group trial with participants randomly allocated
with a ratio of 1:1 prior to surgery. Randomization was performed using a
secure, centralized and independent online randomization service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sealedenvelope.com/">http://sealedenvelope.com/</ext-link>). The clinical trials administrator
was issued with a password to access the service to randomize participants.
Participants were randomized individually and in sequence within 24 hours of
enrollment (i.e. screened as eligible and have provided informed consent). There
was no participant allocation to specific surgical groups based on approach or
primary diagnoses.</p>

                <title>Sample Selection</title>
                <p>Following surgery after the 12-week intervention period had ended and all outcome
measures and follow-up appointments had taken place, participants from both arms
of the study were invited to take part in a telephone interview. Nineteen of the
23 participants were followed up for interview (the other 4 could not be called
due to changes in contact details). Out of the 19 who were contacted by
telephone, 4 did not participate in an interview: one participant was away on
holiday; another wanted to wait until her chemotherapy had ended, and 2 did not
respond to voice messages left to arrange interviews. In order to ensure the
views of all participants were captured, purposive sampling techniques were
employed to attain a maximum variation across the intervention and usual care
groups, and to reflect the variation of the overall trial sample (n = 23).
Participants were purposively selected to help construct a sample to achieve
maximum variation, which included age and gender, date of surgery and the date
of commencement and completion of the exercise program. Within a small sample,
there were experiences where elements of the program were shared (Patton 2002,
2nd ed.), but there were also differences such as perceived baseline fitness,
domestic environment and time commitments. From the exit interviews, it was not
apparent whether the type of cancer influenced participantsâ responses on
performing the exercises or completing them.</p>
                <p>From the embedded qualitative study, 7 interviews were undertaken with
participants in the intervention group, and 8 interviews in the usual care
group. The gender composition consisted of 11 females and 4 males. Participantsâ
ages ranged from 27 to 84 (M = 60.07, SD = 15.40). No males who were interviewed
were allocated into the intervention arm, therefore no qualitative data relates
to males undertaking the exercises. For the intervention itself, the sample
consisted of 17 females and 6 males, which indicates that the participants
invited for the embedded qualitative study was similar in terms of
representative gender proportions (<xref rid="table2-1073274820950855" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

                <title>Data Collection</title>
                <p>One off semi-structured telephone interviews were undertaken with patients to
explore the experience of taking part in the EPOP feasibility trial (n = 15).<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Each interview lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes. No other people
were present during the interviews besides the participants and researcher. No
other repeated interviews were carried out at a later time point. Interviews
took place by appointment within 3 days to around 4 weeks following the end of
the 12 week intervention. The topic guides were developed by the research team
and piloted with the projectâs Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)
representatives (or lay members) who were abdominal cancer patient survivors.
Two topic guides were developedâone for the intervention group and the other for
the usual care group. The participants in the intervention group were asked
about how they found the exercises, what they thought about the questionnaires,
their thoughts about trial processes and their overall experiences of taking
part in the study. The usual care group were asked the same question prompts but
with omissions to questions relating directly to the exercise program and
functional assessments. The interviewer used a topic guide to provide prompts
for discussion, but participants were encouraged to take the conversation in
directions they believed were important. All interviews were conducted between
August 2017 and May 2018, with audio files being digitally recorded. Transcripts
were not returned to participants for comment but were available on request if
the participant wished to view it. No further field-notes were made during or
after the interviews. Every interview was conducted by FH (female) who is an
experienced qualitative researcher (at the time was Research Fellow based at the
University) with a 15 year research portfolio working on patient experiences in
health and social care and was part of the trial team.</p>
                <p>The research nurses informed the participants that a member of the trial team
(FH) would contact them following the end of the study to explore their
experiences and to discuss any problems they may have encountered. The
participants were also told that the researcher was based at the University and
wanted to hear their views before progressing to the larger trial. Despite
limitations with conducting follow-up telephone interviews (discussed further
below), participants were asked at the end of the conversation if they wanted to
share any experiences that had not emerged during the discussion and
participants took the opportunity to explore new themes that were not included
on the interview guide. Data saturation was achieved when interview data had
reached âinformation redundancyâ as no new ideas or themes were being generated.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>Interview data was coded by FH using a thematic framework approach, which took
part in 4 stages. 1) Familiarization involving data immersing, gaining an
oversight of the content and identifying topics of interest; 2) constructing an
initial thematic analysis involving refining and coding the data into nodes and
sub-nodes; 3) reviewing data abstracts which involved organizing the data to
identify any coherent data groups; and 4) summarizing and writing up the data
using summaries for each group of data appearing under each theme.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> All analysis was derived from the data. Although participants did not
provide input directly onto the findings, the lay representatives had the
opportunity to discuss them during trial meetings. This analysis was aided by
the use of a qualitative software analysis program (NVIVO Pro 12) (see <xref rid="table3-1073274820950855" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="bibr23-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr24-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>

the other, the top of body I could do.</p>

                      <p>â¦oh yes, yes especially you know the upper body, I mean as I say with
the pelvic area obviously I was a bit put back by that because
obviously once I knew that I had a problem <italic>with the
stitching and I had, well I donât know whether sheâs put it down
it was discharged and I had to have the wound opened and packed
and everything, so obviously I didnât want to put a strain on
that so the exercises involved lying down and sitting up and all
that I put on hold obviously because I didnât want to put
anything under strain. But the rest of them I found were

lower body and pelvic area were not possible for her to complete given that
she had an open wound that had not healed. She spoke about being able to put
these specific exercises âon holdâ so that she did not put a strain on that
part of her body when performing the exercises, but at the same time, found
it possible to be able to continue with the other exercises.</p>

exercises acceptable to carry them out after surgery. Some of the

self-motivated to continue to do them after surgery, while others noted they
did not want to commence them until after they arrived home. Participant P03

the things you feel when you wake up from that sort of operation you
realize you canât go at things like a bull n a china shop anyway, it
was nice to begin with something partly because itâs so very boring

                      <p>I think itâs possibly a little bit unrealistic because youâre groggy
from the effects of the anesthetic and you probably feel a little
bit self conscious as well in hospital doing them, possibly. So I
think really, realistically for me I didnât start until I came back

sort of get a feeling yourself of how youâre coming alongâ¦I could
see the difference, then when I went back to the next one I could
again tell the difference that I was stronger and I was able to do

                  <p>Blinding was a challenge in the study, as the interview data suggests, the
majority of participants were able to identify which group they were
randomized into:</p>
                  <p>
                    <disp-quote>
                      <p>â¦well the ones that, well there were 2 groups werenât there? I was
the one that was doing the extra exercisesâyesâ¦</p>
                      <p>P10, female, intervention</p>
                      <p>Yeah, I had sort of said at the beginning Iâd do it if I got
allocated that and they said that you canât chose so I was just
lucky it came up but itâs what I wanted.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It would appear from the quotations above that maintaining blinding was
difficult in an exercise-related intervention. Out of the 15 participants
who were interviewed (female = 11; male = 4), 11 participants commented that
they knew which group they were randomized into, and 4 said that they did
not know. Even though patients were given an explanation about being
allocated into the usual care or intervention group, one respondent stated
that he was still unaware that he was allocated into any specific group:</p>
                  <p>
                    <disp-quote>
                      <p>Interviewer: So do you know which group you were allocated to in the
study?</p>
                      <p>Respondent: I donât know that at all, even if I was allocated to a

                  <p>The participants were asked if they knew that by agreeing to take part in the
study, this would involve being randomized and they accepted being allocated
into groups:</p>
                  <p>
                    <disp-quote>
                      <p>I was hopeful that by being part of the [trial] group that I was
going to be benefit fromâor hopefully benefit fromâthe physio
exercise program thatâ¦that would benefit me as wellâ¦Well obviously
you have to have a control groupâ¦Well I mean I understood the
concept of a control group in, you know, medical trialsâ¦so that was
fine.</p>

                      <p>â¦yeah it was the non-exerciseâ¦I didnât mind because it was a random

                  <p>The first male participant above explained that although he was disappointed
not to be randomized into the intervention group, he understood that as he
was taking part in a trial, he accepted the process of being allocated into

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The EPOP feasibility study on isometric resistance exercise interventions following
abdominal cancer surgery has helped to inform the design and conduct of the larger
RCT by exploring the acceptability of the intervention and adherence to the program,
safety and suitability, appropriateness of functional assessments, and trial
processes around randomization and blinding. The feasibility of blinding in physical
activity interventions, as demonstrated in previous studies, was shown to be a
challenge as most participants were able to identify which group they had been
allocated to. In addition, it was found that the functional assessments enabled
participants to self-reflect to measure their own progress, yet, the self-completion
questionnaire tools were reported to be hard to complete.</p>
              <p>Participants who were in the intervention group had the ability and willingness to
understand and adhere to the exercise program, as indicated by the 7 participants
who were interviewed from this group. They commented about how they felt the
intervention was safe and suitable, aided by the assistance of a research nurse, who
was available to provide advice and help with adapting the exercises in relation to
their post-surgery mobility requirements. Our findings concur with a study by de
Almeida et. al (2017) of an early mobilization program in abdominal cancer patients
after major surgery. The program based on core stability, aerobic and resistance
training, orthostatic and gait training, was found to be safe and feasible.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> De Almeida notes the importance of a multi-professional approach including
oncologists, surgeons, physiotherapists, nurses and psychiatrists, which contributed
to high levels of adherence. The potential of a multi-professional approach in an
exercise program is an important element to help with adaptations to the program and
maintain adherence, and requires consideration for a future study.</p>
              <p>One participant reported that due to an open wound she was unable to undertake any
exercises in the pelvic area. Despite this, she continued with exercises to the
upper body under clinical supervision. In a study by Schram et al. (2018) on an
early mobilization program in colorectal surgery patients, it was found that
patients were willing and capable of participating in a light to moderate intensity
resistance-exercise program, by taking into consideration their specific
post-operative status and stratified to reflect the patientâs individual needs.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Although the patient in the EPOP study experienced mobility impediments due
to an open wound, her response to continue with the exercises should also be noted,
and that in discussion with the nurse she was able to carry on with clinical
support. Malmstrom et al. (2013) found in their study on the long-term experiences
of patients following esophageal or gastric cancer surgery, the changes in physical
status resulted in patients feeling that they had lost control over their lives.
Being involved in a supportive cancer recovery program allowed the patient in our
study to take back control over her life.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The importance of post-surgery cancer supportive care programs, at a wider
level, demonstrates a need for patients to have active involvement in their recovery
plans to enable them to feel in control of their lives.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Participants commented that the functional assessments were useful for them to
measure progress and set personal goals. Beck et al. (2020) found in their study on
a prehabilitation intervention for patients preparing for abdominal cancer surgery
showed that patients found it important to write the âdoseâ of exercise they had
performed, which provided them a âpersonalâ competition to be able to complete the
activities and tick a box on a leaflet. The psychological impact of recording
functional change in an important message from our study.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, it is also noted from the qualitative data collected from the EPOP
study that the participants reported some common problems with completing the
functional assessments, and highlights the need to explore reformatting tools in a
far more âeasy readâ and accessible lay-out. Turnpenny et al. (2018) have noted that
there are ways of adapting outcome measurement tools to make them more accessible
through âeasy readâ materials, which are characterized by plain language, simple
layout and format, and using images to illustrate key messages in the text.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Although there are no common standards for producing âeasy readâ materials,
there are national and international guidelines available to create accessible tools.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The guidance will be consulted to re-design the functional assessments for
the larger trial and any modified questionnaires will require re-validation.</p>
              <p>The timing of the introduction of the exercise program was also a factor that may
have impacted on execution and completion of the exercises. Although the evidence on
the ideal time to promote physical activity is mixed,<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Shingler et al. (2017) noted in their study on prostate cancer survivors,
that following surgery men in the study âfelt able to embark on physical activity or
nutrition interventions 6 weeks afterâ¦making this an acceptable timing for future interventions.â<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Shingler et al. stress the importance of identifying an optimum time to
introduce lifestyle behavior changes for cancer survivors.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In the EPOP study, drawing from the participantsâ responses, some respondents
noted that they would be able to start the exercises immediately after surgery while
still in hospital, while other participants indicated not until they had been
discharged home. The consideration of when to commence the exercise program is
inter-linked with the issue of exercise setting and whether the setting encouraged
patients to commence the exercises, or created a barrier to adherence. What this
means for our study is that identifying an optimal time and setting for introducing
exercise programs following surgery should not fit a âone size fits allâ approach,
but should be individually tailored should exercise support be offered. Karlsson
(2019) suggests that exercise support should be considered with respect to an
individualâs current physical activity and attitudes toward physical exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>For the EPOP study, we found that the home-based setting of the intervention enabled
the exercises to be carried out without any timetabling restrictions or
transportation considerations, which the participants noted could be fitted in and
around their daily routines. One of the key advantages of the intervention was that
it was individualized rather than group-based which meant that participants were
able to set personal goals for achievement, while noting benefits such as gains in
mobility and strength, and recognizable improvements in physical performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Further supervision and intermittent advice by way of a home visit or regular
telephone call giving additional support could help identifying what is required for
adherence, what the expected optimal achievement could be, as well as providing
strategies to mitigate against some of the mobility issues encountered after cancer
surgery. Therefore for a future trial, consideration of regular supervision with
well-trained professionals could also enhance adherence, and improve participant experience.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The lack of blinding noted in the responses from the participants in the EPOP study
is a common challenge noted by El-Kotob and Giangregorio (2018) in RCTs of exercise,
rehabilitation or physical activity interventions. They acknowledge that while a
comparison or âusual careâ group is an ideal to the intervention group, however,
blinding in physical activity interventions are almost impossible resulting in the
potential for bias. In our study, we found that the participants were at first
attracted to taking part in the study as there was the potential to be in the
exercise group. When finding out they were in the usual care group, they vocalized
an element of disappointment. Although the EPOP participants declared feeling
dissatisfied, this did not impact significantly on attrition or drop-out rates,
unlike for example Barker et al.âs study (2016) whose participants indicated losing
interest after being allocated to the control group and was the reason given for
withdrawing from the study.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1073274820950855" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Blinding in physical activity-based controlled studies has been shown to be a
persistence problem, and requires further reflection for a future study.</p>
              <p>The participants in the EPOP study found randomization an acceptable trial process,
and acknowledged that they understood the logic of being allocated to either an
intervention or usual care group. Unlike the Barker et al. study (2016), our
participants had reconciled the fact that agreeing to taking part in the feasibility
study would not necessary provide an opportunity to receive the exercise program.
Considerations around determining the acceptance of randomization may be linked to
the EPOP study having modest recruitment figures with 23 consenting in total, with
11 in the intervention and 12 in the usual care group, which enabled recruiters
(research nurses) to offer an adequate explanation over what randomization
involved.</p>
              <p>We accept that there were certain study limitations. While we acknowledge the
importance of capturing the views of the research nurses and physiotherapists who
were involved in the delivery of the intervention, it was not possible to arrange
these interviews due to time constraints and ongoing staff changes, which made it
difficult to carry out this data collection. Future research might gain more
insights into intervention delivery processes from the position of the healthcare
professionals. Although the researcher was a member of the trial team, she did not
meet the participants face-to-face who took part in the study, which may have
impacted on being able to collect in-depth qualitative data. Although there were no
explicit refusals by participants who were invited to take part in the qualitative
interviews (n = 4), it would have been useful to identify whether these
non-responders were unwilling or unable to take part. In addition, conducting
interviews with those who refused to take part in the feasibility RCT would be
insightful to understand whether changes in recruitment processes may be required
for the larger RCT.</p>

              <p>In this embedded qualitative study, we examined abdominal cancer surgery patientsâ
perspectives of an isometric-resistance exercise program with respect to recruiting
participants to an RCT, randomization and blinding, and exploring adherence of
participants to perform and finish the program, and their experiences of completing
the function assessments. Results indicated that participants had the ability and
willingness to adhere to the program indicating they found it suitable and
appropriate. One patient required supervised modifications to the program who
experienced mobility impediments due to surgery. Some participants found the
functional assessments difficult to complete with respondents declaring a distinct
dislike of them. The timing and setting of the program was a factor that may have
impacted on the commencement of exercises. The home-based setting alongside regular
supervised advice was found to be very positive. The participants found
randomization and recruitment an acceptable trial process.</p>
