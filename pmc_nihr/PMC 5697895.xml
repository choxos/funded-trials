                  <p>To investigate the feasibility of dose escalation and hypofractionation of pelvic lymph node intensity modulated radiation therapy (PLN-IMRT) in prostate cancer (PCa).</p>

                  <title>Methods and Materials</title>
                  <p>In a phase 1/2 study, patients with advanced localized PCa were sequentially treated with 70 to 74 Gy to the prostate and dose-escalating PLN-IMRT at doses of 50 Gy (cohort 1), 55 Gy (cohort 2), and 60 Gy (cohort 3) in 35 to 37 fractions. Two hypofractionated cohorts received 60 Gy to the prostate and 47 Gy to PLN in 20 fractions over 4 weeks (cohort 4) and 5 weeks (cohort 5). All patients received long-course androgen deprivation therapy. Primary outcome was late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity at 2 years after radiation therapy for all cohorts. Secondary outcomes were acute and late toxicity using other clinician/patient-reported instruments and treatment efficacy.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Between August 9, 2000, and June 9, 2010, 447 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 90 months. The 2-year rates of grade 2+ bowel/bladder toxicity were as follows: cohort 1, 8.3%/4.2% (95% confidence interval 2.2%-29.4%/0.6%-26.1%); cohort 2, 8.9%/5.9% (4.1%-18.7%/2.3%-15.0%); cohort 3, 13.2%/2.9% (8.6%-20.2%/1.1%-7.7%); cohort 4, 16.4%/4.8% (9.2%-28.4%/1.6%-14.3%); cohort 5, 12.2%/7.3% (7.6%-19.5%/3.9%-13.6%). Prevalence of bowel and bladder toxicity seemed to be stable over time. Other scales mirrored these results. The biochemical/clinical failure–free rate was 71% (66%-75%) at 5 years for the whole group, with pelvic lymph node control in 94% of patients.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study shows the safety and tolerability of PLN-IMRT. Ongoing and planned phase 3 studies will need to demonstrate an increase in efficacy using PLN-IMRT to offset the small increase in bowel side effects compared with prostate-only IMRT.</p>

                <p id="p0015">Elective pelvic lymph node (PLN) radiation therapy and hypofractionation for advanced localized prostate cancer remains controversial. We report a single-center sequential cohort study using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to deliver conventionally fractionated 50 Gy, 55 Gy, and 60 Gy to the PLN and 70 to 74 Gy (2 Gy per fraction) to the prostate. Additionally, we studied modest hypofractionation delivering 60 Gy (3 Gy per fraction) to the prostate with 47 Gy to the PLN over 4 to 5 weeks. Our findings highlight the safety of dose escalation and hypofractionation in PLN-IMRT.</p>

              <p id="p0020">Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, accounting for 27% of new cancer cases in 2014, and more than 307,000 men died from prostate cancer in 2012 worldwide <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. In the United Kingdom, 46,690 new cases were diagnosed in 2014 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>. Most men are now diagnosed with localized disease, but high-risk prostate cancer remains life-threatening. Treatment with external beam radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and in selected cases, high-dose-rate brachytherapy has been used in this patient group <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3)</xref>. Approximately 15,800 men receive radical prostate radiation therapy every year in the United Kingdom <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">(4)</xref>. However, the merit of elective pelvic lymph node radiation therapy (PLNRT) compared with treatment of prostate and seminal vesicles alone remains controversial, and present guidelines suggest that PLNRT should be considered but not mandated for high-risk disease <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.

                <p id="p0035">We performed a single-center, phase 1/2 study of IMRT to irradiate the prostate and PLN in patients with advanced localized prostate cancer. Eligible patients had prostate cancer with very high risk (T3b/T4) or node-positive disease, high-risk disease with Gleason score ≥8 or ≥2 risk factors, or an estimated risk of nodal metastases of &gt;30% based on the Roach formula <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Postprostatectomy patients (T2-T3a, N0) with extensive Gleason score ≥8 disease and seminal vesicle or lymph node involvement were also eligible.

                <p id="p0040">Patients were sequentially assigned to receive 3 different dose schedules to the PLN of 50, 55, or 60 Gy (cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) giving 70 to 74 Gy in 2-Gy fractions over 7 weeks to the prostate. An integrated boost of 5 Gy was given to radiologically suspicious PLN. Two hypofractionated cohorts (cohorts 4 and 5) were then studied, based on equivalent doses to the conventional schedule calculated assuming an α/β ratio of 2.5 Gy. They received 60 Gy to the prostate in 3-Gy fractions over 4 to 5 weeks and 47 Gy to the PLN. An integrated boost of 4 Gy was given to radiologically suspicious PLN. Patients were initially treated on a 4-week schedule (cohort 4), which was later modified to a 5-week schedule (cohort 5) because of acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Patients irradiated after prostatectomy received 64 Gy in 32 fractions in cohorts 1 and 2, 65 Gy in 35 fractions in cohort 3, or 55 Gy in 20 fractions in cohorts 4 and 5 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E1</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0010">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>).</p>

                <p id="p0050">Patients underwent planning computed tomography (CT) scans with a comfortably full bladder and empty rectum. From 2011, sodium citrate enemas were used for patients with rectal dilatation. Inverse radiation therapy planning was performed for all patients, using mandatory normal tissue dose constraints (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E2</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0015">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>) as previously described <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Clinical target volume-1 included the prostate and any radiologically involved seminal vesicle, with a margin of 8 mm posteriorly and 10 mm in all other directions to create planning target volume-1.

A uniform margin of 5 mm was applied to create planning target volume-2. Clinical target volume-3 included any radiologically involved lymph nodes, and a uniform margin of 5 mm was applied to create planning target volume-3. All organs at risk were contoured as solid organs, by defining the outer wall of rectum, bowel, and bladder. The rectum was contoured from the anus (usually at the level of the ischial tuberosities or 1 cm below the lower margin of the planning target volume, whichever was more inferior) to the recto-sigmoid junction. Bowel was outlined separately, excluding rectum and extending 2 cm above the superior extent of planning target volume-2. The bladder was outlined from base to dome. Treatment verification was performed offline using bony anatomy for registration (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Text E1</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0025">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>).</p>

                <p id="p0060">Acute side effects were recorded weekly using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scoring system up to 18 weeks after initiating radiation therapy. Late toxicity was scored according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/RTOG and Late Effects Normal Tissue–Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) late toxicity scales, and University of California, Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index (UCLA-PCI) patient-reported outcomes <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.

                <p id="p0065">Prostate-specific antigen was measured every 6 months for 8 years after the start of ADT and annually thereafter. The nadir PSA level was the lowest level recorded after radiation therapy. Biochemical failure was defined according to the Phoenix consensus guidelines as a PSA value greater than the nadir plus 2 ng/mL. Local recurrence was confirmed on MRI of the pelvis or biopsy, and postprostatectomy patients (n=34) were excluded from this endpoint. Distant relapse was confirmed on MRI, CT scan, bone scan, or choline positron emission tomography–CT scan.</p>

                <title>Statistical considerations</title>
                <p id="p0070">The primary endpoint was late RTOG toxicity assessed 2 years after radiation therapy. Secondary endpoints included assessment of all toxicity scales during follow-up and disease recurrence. Patients were stratified by total bowel volume outlined (&lt;450 cm<sup>3</sup> vs ≥450 cm<sup>3</sup>). For each dose level stratified by bowel volume, at least 15 men were treated and followed up for at least 1 year. If 0 of 15 men had a grade 3 or higher (grade 3+) RTOG complication, then a 20% grade 3+ toxicity rate was excluded with 1-sided significance level of .05. Because the dose to the initial cohort was modest, patients in the low bowel volume group were recruited to the second dose level after 7 men had ≥12 months of follow-up, provided none of these had recorded a grade ≥3 complication. For other cohorts and bowel volume groups, recruitment continued at that level until such time as 15 men had been treated and followed up for at least 1 year. This strategy ensured that the low bowel volume group moved to the higher dose cohorts in advance of the high bowel volume group. Because recruitment continued in each cohort and bowel volume group until such time as the required total of men had reached ≥12 months of follow-up, in all cases the eventual sample size in each group exceeded the required total to an extent that varied according to the recruitment rate over time.</p>
                <p id="p0075">In cohorts 3 and 4, a further dose expansion phase was planned, with a target sample size of 103 patients (of any bowel volume) evaluable at 2 years, to rule out a late grade 2 or higher (grade 2+) bowel toxicity rate of ≥25%, using a 1-sided alpha 0.05 and power of 80% with an assumed true rate of toxicity not more than 15%. The sample size was expanded to a total of 123 in each of cohort 3 and 4 to allow for an expected dropout rate of 16% by 2 years. However, because of high levels of acute bowel toxicity observed in cohort 4 (4-weekly schedule), the treatment schedule was amended to 5 weeks (cohort 5) with a target of 123 patients.</p>
                <p id="p0080">Late toxicity rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods, with time measured from start of radiation therapy. Rates by 1 and 2 years were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). One-sided 95% CIs were constructed for rate of RTOG grade 3+ bowel toxicity at 1 year (cohorts 1 and 2) and for rate of RTOG grade 2+ bowel toxicity at 2 years (cohorts 3 and 4), to assess safety of the primary endpoint. In addition, the number of men experiencing defined toxicity grades at each time point was reported as a percentage of all men assessed. Efficacy was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods to calculate duration of disease control (defined as a composite endpoint of biochemical progression, local or lymph node/pelvic recurrence, or distant metastasis, or recommencement of ADT), duration of local disease control, duration of distant disease control, and disease-specific and overall survival from start of radiation therapy. For disease-specific and overall survival, patients were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. Rates at 2 and 5 years were calculated with 95% CIs. Data were extracted in September 2015 and analyzed using STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p>
                <p id="p0085">Univariable Cox regression on duration of disease control was performed using factors of dose cohort, N stage (N0 vs N1-3), baseline PSA level (log transformed), clinical T stage (grouped as T1/T2; T3a; T3b+), and Gleason score (grouped as ≤6; 7; ≥8). Forward and backward stepwise selection methods were used to combine significant factors (<italic>P</italic>&lt;.05 on univariable analysis) into a multivariable model and produce adjusted hazard ratios with 95% CIs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0150">We found acceptable acute and late GI/genitourinary (GU) toxicity measured using both clinician-reported outcomes (CRO) and PRO in all patient cohorts. To assess the impact of PLNRT, we compared these results with a large contemporaneous group of patients treated in the CHHiP phase 3 trial, which used IMRT to treat the prostate alone using similar CFRT/HFRT schedules and scored side effects with the same compendium of CRO and PRO <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">(4)</xref>. We also used comparable data reported in a recent systematic review by Holch et al <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref>, which included no studies with PLNRT. We found that acute grade 2+ GI toxicity occurred in 40% to 56% of CFRT patients in cohorts 1 to 3, compared with 25% in CHHiP and 21% to 60% in Holch et al, with a rate of 66% in cohort 4 (4-week HFRT), compared with 30% in the CHHiP HFRT group and 36% in Holch et al. Increasing the overall treatment time to 5 weeks reduced the rate to 48% in cohort 5. However, these side effects settled rapidly in all groups. There were no differences in grade 2+ toxicity by 18 weeks, although some increase in mild grade 1+ side-effect rates persisted with PLNRT (25%-36%, compared with 21% in CHHiP). There were no clear differences between grade 2+ peak/week-18 or grade 1+ week-18 GU toxicities among cohorts 1 to 5 or when comparing with the CHHiP or Holch et al GU toxicity rates (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E3</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0080">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="p0155">Late GI side effects seemed highest in cohort 4 using CRO scales, both 2 and 5 years after treatment. For example, 2-year estimated cumulative proportions with grade 2+ (CRO) or small or worse bowel problems (PRO) were 16%, 16%, 34%, and 53% using the RTOG, RMH, LENT-SOMA, and UCLA-PCI scales, respectively, compared with 8% to 13%, 8% to 15%, 13% to 25%, and 21% to 43% for the other cohorts. The rates for the comparator CHHiP group were 8% to 9%, 10% to 11%, 16% to 18%, and 25% to 27%, respectively. Applicable results in the Holch et al systematic review <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">(19)</xref> were similar to those in CHHiP. The increased acute and late GI toxicity seen in cohort 4 would be consistent with a consequential late side effect <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Extending treatment duration to 5 weeks by treating 4 times per week seems to reduce any impact of hypofractionation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Tables E4 and E5</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0085">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="p0160">Late GU side effects, assessed using RTOG and RMH CRO scales, were similar among all groups, with no obvious impact from dose, fractionation schedule, or use of PLNRT. However, the cumulative proportion of patients with grade 2+ toxicity (LENT-SOMA, CRO) or small or worse bladder bother (UCLA-PCI, PRO) at 2 years was somewhat higher than in the CHHiP groups, suggesting these scales are more sensitive. Any differences had disappeared by 5 years, when the prevalence of small or worse bladder bother was 8% to 20% in cohorts 1 to 5 and 17% in the CHHiP comparator group (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Tables E4 and E5</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0090">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="p0165">Late bowel and bladder side effects did not show consistent differences when the subgroup of patients treated after prostatectomy was analyzed, either with CRO or PRO data (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E6</xref>; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0095">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>). However, these results should be interpreted with caution given that only 34 patients were treated adjuvantly in this trial, and limited conclusions can be drawn.</p>
              <p id="p0170">The low level of side effects seen in the present series probably relates to the use of a strict IMRT protocol and the mandating of dose constraints for both bowel and bladder. However, the doses delivered in cohorts 3 to 5 are at least 10% higher than used in past and contemporary practice (Fig. E1; available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.redjournal.org" id="intref0100">www.redjournal.org</ext-link>). Similar dose increments have been shown to improve disease outcome in trials treating the prostate alone <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0175">The 5-year overall survival in this series (87%; 95% CI 84%-90%) is at least comparable to a recent retrospective series from the National Cancer Database, in which 7606 patients were treated with PLNRT, with 5-year overall survival of 81.6% <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">(24)</xref>. In the group randomized to PLNRT in the RTOG 94-13 trial, a 4-year overall survival of 84% was reported. The 5-year biochemical/clinical failure–free rate of 71% for our entire series is similar to the control group treated with radiation therapy in the contemporaneous MRC STAMPEDE trial, which showed an estimated 75%/50% 5-year control in patients with N0/N1 disease, respectively <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0180">The low PLN recurrence rate of 6% is reassuring, but further efforts to improve local control in the prostate for patients with aggressive bulky disease seem warranted (hazard ratio for local disease control in T3b+: 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.60; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Approaches using high-dose focal radiation therapy boosts, prostatectomy, or additional ablative focal therapies using, for example, high intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy can be considered <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>. Avoidance of toxicity, however, is important, because a considerable majority of patients have disease controlled by IMRT and ADT or, alternatively, relapse with metastatic disease outside the pelvis, making additional measures to improve local control futile. The development of biomarkers to predict the response to radiation therapy and define patient groups destined to develop metastatic disease would therefore be invaluable in guiding treatment individualization <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref>. Treatment intensification with additional systemic treatments, such as docetaxel or the new generation of hormonal therapies, can be considered <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref>. Additionally, radiogenomic and dosimetric studies are aiming to refine estimates of an individual's risk of developing side effects <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="p0185">This study has provided the safety data to encourage further investigation of high-dose LNRT. The treatment techniques described have been generalized in a United Kingdom national phase 2 randomised pilot study, PIVOTAL (ISRCTN48709247), which compares prostate and pelvis with prostate-alone IMRT. Hypofractionated radiation therapy will become the United Kingdom standard of care after the CHHiP trial <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">(4)</xref>. The safety data of hypofractionated schedules in the present study is encouraging, and the use of HFRT in a new trial, PIVOTALboost, is planned. It will assess the value of pelvic IMRT as well as the effects of a focal high-dose intraprostatic boost to dominant lesions. These studies will complement other ongoing phase 3 studies, RTOG 09-24 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01368588" id="intref0105">NCT01368588</ext-link>) and PEACE 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01952223" id="intref0110">NCT01952223</ext-link>), which should finally determine the role of PLNRT in prostate cancer. An increase in efficacy will need to be demonstrated to offset the small but expected adverse effects of pelvic IMRT.</p>
