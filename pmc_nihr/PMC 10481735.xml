                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Many people quit smoking during pregnancy, but postpartum smoking relapse is common. Maintaining smoking abstinence achieved during pregnancy is key to improving maternal and child health. There are no evidence-based interventions for preventing postpartum smoking relapse. This trial aims to determine whether an intervention to prevent postpartum relapse is effective and cost-effective.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention to prevent postpartum smoking relapse (BabyBreathe), with internal pilot, economic and process evaluations. Participants are adults who are pregnant and who report having quit smoking in the 12 months before, or during pregnancy. Participants are eligible if they read and understand English, and provide informed consent. Following consent and biochemical validation of smoking abstinence, participants are randomised to intervention or usual care/control (no specific relapse prevention support). The BabyBreathe intervention consists of manualised advice from a trained member of the health visiting service, health information leaflets for participants and partners, access to the BabyBreathe website and app. At the time of birth, participants are posted the BabyBreathe box and support is provided by text message for up to 12 months postpartum. Target sample size is 880, recruiting across midwifery services at four hubs in England and Scotland and through remote advertising in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Outcomes are collected at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is self-reported sustained smoking abstinence at 12 months, carbon monoxide verified. Secondary outcomes include self-reported abstinence, time to relapse, partner smoking status and quality of life.</p>

                  <p>The trial was approved by the North West Preston Research Ethics committee (21/NW/0017). Dissemination will include publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at academic and public conferences including patient and public involvement and to policymakers and practitioners.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Around a quarter of UK women report smoking in the year before pregnancy.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> More women quit smoking during pregnancy than at any other time, with as many as 45% able to ‘spontaneously quit’.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, there are marked health inequalities, as younger mothers and women with lower income are both less likely to quit and more likely to relapse.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> There is a unique opportunity to help women who cease smoking in pregnancy to quit permanently. Most women who quit smoking wish to remain abstinent after the birth; however, up to three-quarters of spontaneous quitters return to smoking within 6 months.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Postpartum relapse is a major public health problem; yet there are no evidence-based interventions, and no routine support is offered to prevent relapse.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The National Health Service (NHS) Long Term Plan prioritises smoking cessation services in pregnancy,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> overlooking postpartum support. Supporting sustained abstinence may be critical to reaching the UK government ‘smokefree 2030’ target.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This trial will build on the success of cessation interventions in pregnancy,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> by trialling a theory-based relapse prevention intervention developed by our team.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Previous interventions to support sustained smoking abstinence post partum consist of brief and skills-based education, but when pooled, studies overall did not demonstrate effectiveness.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> A recent Cochrane review of relapse prevention interventions included postpartum relapse prevention trials as a subgroup. Fifteen studies included postpartum follow-up but there was no significant benefit of interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> New approaches are urgently needed to address this global public health issue. The recent Cochrane review concludes that: ‘Future studies may be better advised to focus on alternative approaches not studied extensively or at all so far, such as opportunistic use of nicotine replacement, contingency management, social support, cue exposure (only imaginary exposure has been studied so far), interventions aimed at maintaining abstainers’ morale and awareness of the danger of slips, and so forth’.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Sustained postpartum smoking abstinence has significant health benefits for the mother, as most new mothers will be young enough to minimise long-term harm, particularly from cancers and cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Maternal smoking is the primary source of infant and child secondhand smoke exposure,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> a substantial cause of ill health and mortality.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This has an intergenerational effect: children of smoking mothers are twice as likely to become smokers.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The total NHS annual cost of smoking continuation, or returning to smoking following pregnancy, is estimated to range between £8.1 and £64 million annually for treating maternal health problems alone.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> While, in 2015/2016 the cost of admitted patient care in children attributable to passive smoking in England was an additional £5–12 million.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>Following our comprehensive intervention development work and patient and public involvement, it is clear that postpartum smoking relapse is a complex problem requiring a multifaceted solution. Our research team have developed a novel intervention combining behavioural, digital and relapse prevention support, ‘BabyBreathe’. The intervention is theory based and uses behaviour change techniques, each supported by available evidence.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The development process involved working with pregnant and post-partum people, families and healthcare professionals to design an intervention that would fit in and work alongside usual care (universal health visiting service in the UK), be feasible to implement in practice and be acceptable.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>

                <p>Multiple recruitment strategies will be used to reach target sample size (n=880). Potential participants will be identified by hospital and community midwives, research midwives (Clinical Research Network,CRN) or sonographers, during routine antenatal appointments (eg, booking appointment, routine scan appointment for dating or fetal anomaly scan) or by screening medical records. Participants may also be identified by smoke-free services, health visitors or by self-referring (eg, via adverts in health or community settings, using targeted online recruitment or media adverts). Potential participants will be screened for eligibility by the midwife (or by other healthcare professionals, in other health settings), or by a study researcher for direct referrals. The screening process can take place at any time during pregnancy, though the target is to identify participants ahead of 26 weeks pregnancy.</p>
                <p>Eligible participants will be provided a brief patient information leaflet, either directly or indirectly via an online link, explaining the study and permission will be requested to pass their contact details to the research team. A health professional or a research team member will enter their details into a study database (Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) that will automatically generate a short messaging service (SMS)/email to an electronic patient information sheet and e-consent form containing full reassurance of confidentiality. If participants are unable or unwilling to consent electronically, study researchers will contact potential participants by telephone to complete consent. Once consent is completed, participants will provide further details so they can be contacted from 26 weeks pregnancy with the link to the eligibility confirmation questionnaire.</p>
                <p>Participants will be asked to confirm eligibility by replying via a link sent by text or email (according to preference), and will provide their address to enable postage of a CO monitor (iCO monitor, Bedfont) in order to confirm eligibility using an expired CO reading of less than 4 ppm (this is the standard cut-off used in pregnancy).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Participants will be asked to download the study specific CO monitor application (iCOBabyBreathe) which will provide the REDCap database with two CO readings. The highest of the two readings will be recorded. Where CO readings ≥26 weeks gestation are able to take place in person as part of standard care, CO readings may be obtained by a member of the clinical team or a researcher to confirm participant eligibility.</p>
                <p>Once the participant has given informed consent and eligibility is confirmed through a CO reading, a link will be automatically generated through text/email to the participant to complete the baseline questionnaire.</p>

                  <p>Control participants will receive usual antenatal and postnatal care as per the NHS maternity care pathway (ie, no routine relapse prevention support). Usual care varies across the UK and sites have been purposively selected to reflect the variations in routine care. Commonalities in usual care across all the sites include pregnant women being routinely screened for smoking status by their midwife at their first antenatal booking appointment. If a participant reports to be currently smoking, or has a CO reading of 4 ppm or more, they are automatically referred for stop smoking support via NHS commissioned stop smoking services (opt-out referral). Midwifery support focuses on abstinence in pregnancy and only includes brief advice about the opportunity to maintain abstinence postpartum and in the long-term. The usual care group will receive standard ante and postnatal care, as per mandated midwifery and health visitor contacts. These visits may be face-to-face appointments, or they may be remote video or telephone appointments due to the COVID-19 pandemic and local service provision protocols.</p>

                        <p>SMS or app notification tailored support—This will be triggered by the birth notification, delivering a programme of tailored relapse prevention messages. Messages start daily, with a diminishing schedule over 12 months. At regular intervals participants are asked to confirm smoking status, and either then stay on the ‘smokefree’ or ‘lapse’ track of tailored messages. There is the option to opt out by texting ‘stop’ at any time.</p>

Positive praise will be offered for sustained smoking abstinence and the importance of relapse prevention will be emphasised. Participants will be encouraged to continue to engage, or to re-engage, with the full suite of BabyBreathe resources. Cessation support (referral) will be offered to partners where necessary and appropriate. For those who relapse, referral for cessation support will also be offered.</p>

Participants will provide the REDCap database with two CO readings at entry and follow-up. The highest of the readings will be recorded.

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>We will use descriptive statistics to present the baseline characteristics of the two study groups. We will use χ<sup>2</sup> tests to compare follow-up rates between the study groups, to establish whether there is differential drop out. Analysis of smoking status will be based on the intention-to-treat principle by analysing individuals according to the treatment they were allocated to regardless of compliance. Individuals for whom we do not have the primary outcome data will be assumed to have returned to smoking. Analysis of the primary outcome will be based on a logistic regression model, adjusting for the stratification variables used in the randomisation algorithm. Secondary analysis will adjust for factors known to be predictive of relapse which will be agreed with the TSC and added to the statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to analysis. Secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar fashion using a general linear model. Missing data patterns will be examined, and if appropriate, multiple imputation will be undertaken. The SAP is preregistered (on the Open Science Framework (OSF))—see <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 1</xref>. The analysis plan may include analysis suggested by the qualitative analysis, such as subgroup analysis or mediation analysis. Any analysis will be prespecified before data lock and published in the SAP prior to any data analysis.</p>

                <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                <p>An economic analysis will be conducted as an integral part of the randomised controlled trial. The primary perspective will be the NHS and social care: however, we will also look at broader relevant costs such as purchase of nicotine replacement therapies. All resources required to provide BabyBreathe will be recorded: these will include staff time; equipment; consumables; required staff training; and any other relevant costs. For staff time to carry out specific tasks to provide BabyBreathe a variety of methods to obtain these data will be explored: these would include trial records on relevant expenditure and expert opinion. Healthcare resource use will be obtained from two sources. First, we will include a modified Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) to obtain data by participant self-report at the 12-month follow-up. This will cover the following: maternal antenatal hospital admissions; details of delivery, including mode of delivery and length of stay; and infant neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Contacts with GP and practice nurses, contact with other primary care practitioners and referral to secondary care will also be collected as well as smoking cessation-related expenditure. Additionally, where feasible we will obtain data from patient notes and GP records. All resources identified during the study will be valued using appropriate local and national unit cost data.</p>
                <p>The main outcome measure used in the economic analysis will be the study’s primary outcome measure, continuous postpartum smoking abstinence. This will form a cost-effectiveness study looking at cost per additional sustained abstainer. Additionally, we will use EQ-5D-5L<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> values obtained from participants to undertake a cost utility analysis (ie, cost per QALY) estimating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 months postpartum. EQ-5D-5L questionnaires will be valued using the most appropriate scoring algorithm at time of analysis. Currently, this would be the UK mapped scores.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Cost and effectiveness data will be estimated using regression-based methods to allow for differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Non-parametric bootstrapping will be used to allow for uncertainty and this will also be used to construct a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, which shows how likely the intervention is to be cost-effective at different monetary values of the effectiveness measures. A health economics analysis plan will be agreed and published on the OSF before any analysis of health economics data.</p>

Qualitative analysis will be undertaken of social support group threads, for which consent will have been sought on recruitment to the study; and audio-recordings (health visitors, practitioners or BabyBreathe researchers will be asked to record approximately 10% of visits (≤10 min intervention only), antenatal as well as postnatal) and interviews with health visitors (n=12) and a qualitative interview subsample of participants and partners (n=40). Potential contamination between trial arms and protocol modifications will be assessed through qualitative interviews with health visitors and regular reporting by trial research teams. We will assess whether any identifiable modifications were planned adaptations to fit context, or unforeseen, and report our findings according to FRAME, an established framework.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> To illuminate possible mechanisms of action, a combined analysis of qualitative participant interview data, audio-recordings (eg, intervention duration, delivery of behaviour change techniques) and quantitative engagement data across recruitment hubs will assess which components of the intervention were perceived to be particularly effective, for which people, in which contexts.</p>
