                  <p>Patients with rib fractures commonly experience significant acute pain and are at risk of hypoxia, retained secretions, respiratory failure and death. Effective analgesia improves these outcomes. There is widespread variation in analgesic treatments given to patients including oral, intravenous and epidural routes of administration. Erector spinae plane (ESP) blockade, a novel regional analgesic technique, may be effective, but high-quality evidence is lacking.</p>

                  <p>To determine if a definitive trial of ESP blockade in rib fractures is possible, we are conducting a multicentre, randomised controlled pilot study with feasibility and qualitative assessment. Fifty adult patients with rib fractures will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to ESP blockade with multimodal analgesia or placebo ESP blockade with multimodal analgesia. Participants and outcome assessors will be blinded. The primary feasibility outcomes are recruitment rate, retention rate and trial acceptability assessed by interview.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The pain from rib fractures is often described by patients as the worst pain they have ever experienced. The major complication of this pain is that patients are unable to cough and breathe deeply, causing atelectasis, retained secretions, hypoxaemia, pneumonia and progressive respiratory failure. Deterioration may require mechanical ventilation on an intensive care unit (ICU) and lead to death.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> This morbidity and mortality are a direct result of severe pain and impaired gas exchange from underlying contused lung parenchyma and altered ventilatory mechanics from the bone injury.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The presence of rib fractures in trauma is associated with a significantly increased risk of death, regardless of other injuries, with ORs of 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6) for adults 18–45 years old and 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.8) for adults older than 64 years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This injury is therefore particularly devastating for older adults who have a higher risk of death and are likely to sustain rib fractures from less traumatic accidents (due to bone fragility), for example, falling from standing height.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>A key objective in the multidisciplinary care of people with rib fractures is the assessment and treatment of pain to provide patient comfort and allow normal respiration and cough to minimise the risk of respiratory failure.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 6</xref> Alongside specialist physiotherapy and daily multidisciplinary review, good pain management is a vital element of early rib fracture care. Despite this, there is no agreement about the optimal pain relief to give patients. The literature on the use of the different analgesic techniques in rib fractures is inconclusive. Although national and international guidance recommends a multimodal approach in preference to opioid medications alone,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> two meta-analyses concluded that the evidence to recommend any specific treatment modality is insufficient, and that there is no firm evidence for benefit or harm of one analgesic technique over another.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> This leaves clinicians unsure of which analgesic techniques to use. National UK guidance specifies protocolised analgesic regimes as a standard of care for every patient with multiple rib fractures.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, the paucity of evidence meant that this guidance could not recommend which analgesic modality (epidural, peripheral nerve blocks or opioid) should be used in which clinical circumstances. Most patients with rib fractures are given a combination of analgesic drugs like paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, opioids and ketamine to help them cope with severe pain; these are the cornerstones of multimodal analgesia in this setting. Medication side effects (including nausea, pruritus, hallucinations, constipation, renal failure and respiratory depression) significantly limit their use. Some patients receive thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and some receive other forms of regional anaesthesia nerve blocks, but the delivery of these interventions by pain specialist anaesthetists is driven more by local expertise and experience than by high-quality evidence.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>Regional anaesthesia (including nerve blocks) are clinically useful following rib fractures due to their opioid-sparing effect (therefore reducing serious drug-related side effects) and the superior dynamic pain relief they provide. Traditional techniques to block the thoracic nerve supply to the ribs include TEA, paravertebral blockade and intercostal blockade. Systematic review and meta-analysis of these techniques suggested that TEA provides good pain relief; however, this benefit does not translate into superior outcomes such as occurrence of pulmonary complications and length of time spent in hospital, intensive care or requiring mechanical ventilation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Unfortunately, TEA has a significant failure rate and is also associated with common and potentially catastrophic complications<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> leading to permanent paralysis, and is therefore contraindicated in approximately one-fifth of people with significant injuries. TEA is a complex intervention to perform, practised by a small and reducing number of anaesthetists nationally and is not available equitably to patients. Even within a single hospital the care delivered varies depending on the time of day and availability of staff to perform such a complex analgesic technique. Only an estimated 9.9%–18.4% of patients receive TEA for rib fracture pain.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>The erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a regional anaesthetic technique involving the infiltration and infusion of local anaesthetic along fascial planes containing dorsal and ventral rami of thoracic spinal nerves supplying the chest wall.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The injection is performed away from the spinal cord (thereby avoiding the complications of TEA). ESP blocks were first described in 2016<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and have demonstrated analgesic efficacy for patients on enhanced recovery after surgery protocols following spinal,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> breast,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> thoracic<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and cardiac surgeries.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In these postoperative acute pain settings, ESP blocks have been shown to reduce patient-reported pain scores and opioid consumption significantly in the early postoperative period compared with multimodal analgesia regimes alone. However, the role of ESP blocks in the management of acute rib fracture pain is currently uncertain.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> There are no experimental pragmatic multicentre trials published in this setting; however, single-centre cohort data demonstrate ESP blocks provide effective pain relief and improve respiratory function when added to multimodal analgesia in patients with rib fractures.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 22</xref> Higher quality clinical evidence is urgently needed to guide clinicians on whether the ESP block is a suitable addition to current multimodal analgesia in patients with rib fractures. A definitive trial on this topic would promote evidence-based practice in rib fracture management and reduce unnecessary variation in clinical practice across UK trauma centres. However, there is currently not enough evidence on the effectiveness and acceptability of ESP blocks for rib fractures to undertake a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
              <p>The aim of this study is therefore to determine if it is feasible to undertake a definitive RCT to establish if ESP blocks are a clinically effective early treatment for acute pain in patients hospitalised with rib fractures. Formal hypothesis testing for effectiveness or efficacy is not undertaken in feasibility studies. The aim of this trial is not to assess effectiveness or efficacy but to determine feasibility of progression to a definitive RCT.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>The study question builds on previous qualitative work undertaken to validate a patient-derived recovery scale. The scale was developed following interviews with 50 patients and health professionals, with subsequent validation in a 250-patient study. This work characterised the experience of pain and breathing difficulties following rib fracture; identifying management of pain as a research priority for this patient population. The outcome scale developed through this study will be used as an outcome measure in this trial, to help capture patient-centred outcomes. Specifically for this study we have facilitated virtual focus groups with patients who have previously sustained rib fractures and were admitted to Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. The groups discussed the following aspects: the question and study design; recruitment and consent; follow-up data collection; acceptability of blinding; and preferred outcome measures. There was strong support for this study; with individuals acknowledging that pain management of non-operatively managed injuries was an important but often overlooked area of their care. A new regional anaesthetic technique was perceived to be valuable as a treatment option or adjunct since participants said they would be keen to avoid the side effects associated with oral and intravenous analgesia. The ESP block was perceived by focus group members as less invasive than an epidural. The inclusion of a sham intervention was discussed and deemed acceptable given the integrity of the research. The proposed outcome measures were reviewed by participants and were felt to be comprehensive. They valued the addition of embedded qualitative work within the study to allow for holistic feedback about study acceptability for patients and staff.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>Formal sample size calculation is not appropriate for feasibility studies. Currently, there is no single-agreed method for sample size for a feasibility trial, but most authors propose a sample size between 24 and 60 depending on the study aims.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> To answer our key objectives, we aim to recruit 50 participants, allowing estimation of recruitment and retention rates with a margin of error of less than 10%.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>Data will be collected via REDCap database. Data analysis will primarily be descriptive to address the feasibility objectives of the trial. All analyses will be documented in a statistical analysis plan which will be finalised prior to database lock. Feasibility outcomes will be estimated using descriptive statistics (with 95% CIs) and will include screening rates, recruitment rates, follow-up rates, protocol adherence and amount of missing data for clinical outcomes. Key baseline characteristics (age, sex) will be compared between trial participants and the ineligible and non-consenting patients, to ascertain adequacy of inclusion/exclusion criteria and likely generalisability of the trial to the required targeted population. Similarly, we will compare the key patient characteristics between those followed up and those lost to follow-up and investigate how similar this is across the treatment arms to assess possible attrition bias in data collection. A baseline table will compare important demographic and clinical characteristics between the two treatment arms. It is not a primary objective of the feasibility trial to obtain definitive estimates of intervention effect on clinical outcomes and so the clinical outcomes will be analysed descriptively. Additionally, we will use appropriate regression method to estimate the likely range of intervention effects (point estimate and CIs) for key clinical outcomes adjusted for minimisation variables. Reporting of the study will be according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement: 2016 extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>

              <p>The study was granted approval by the Oxford B Research Ethics Committee on 22 February 2022 (REC reference: 22/SC/0005). Substantial amendments that require review by REC will not be implemented until the REC grants a favourable opinion for the trial. All personal identifiable information collected during the trial will be coded, depersonalised with unique codes for each patient. The trial will be compliant with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation 2018 and the Data Protection Act 2018. The chief investigator and principal investigators at participating sites will have access to the full data set. Relevant anonymised patient-level data will be made available on reasonable request. Day-to-day trial management will be provided by the Trial Management Group, who will meet at least once per month. Independent oversight of trial conduct will be provided by a Trial Steering Committee, attended by the trial chief investigators and methodologist, with three independent members with expertise in trial methodology and statistics, anaesthesia and trauma care.</p>
              <p>A manuscript for a high-impact peer-reviewed journal will be prepared. Authorship will be determined in accordance with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and other contributors will be acknowledged. The results of this project will be disseminated to patients through local mechanisms at all participating centres.</p>
