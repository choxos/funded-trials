                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Pelvic organ prolapse (or prolapse) is a common condition in women where the pelvic organs (bladder, bowel or womb) descend into the vagina and cause distressing symptoms that adversely affect quality of life. Many women will use a vaginal pessary to treat their prolapse symptoms. Clinic-based care usually consists of having a pessary fitted in a primary or secondary care setting, and returning approximately every 6 months for healthcare professional review and pessary change. However, it is possible that women could remove, clean and re-insert their pessary themselves; this is called self-management. This trial aims to assess if self-management of a vaginal pessary is associated with better quality of life for women with prolapse when compared to clinic-based care.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial in at least 17 UK centres. The intervention group will receive pessary self-management teaching, a self-management information leaflet, a follow-up phone call and access to a local telephone number for clinical support. The control group will receive the clinic-based pessary care which is standard at their centre. Demographic and medical history data will be collected from both groups at baseline. The primary outcome is condition-specific quality of life at 18 months’ post-randomisation. Several secondary outcomes will also be assessed using participant-completed questionnaires. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months’ post-randomisation. An economic evaluation will be carried out alongside the trial to evaluate cost-effectiveness. A process evaluation will run parallel to the trial, the protocol for which is reported in a companion paper.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">The results of the trial will provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of pessary self-management compared to clinic-based care in terms of improving women’s quality of life, and of its cost-effectiveness.</p>

            <sec id="Sec2">
              <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
              <p id="Par6">Pelvic organ prolapse affects about 40% of women over 40 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the number of women affected is expected to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Prolapse is categorised into different stages and types and affects women of varying ages. The distressing symptoms include a sensation of “something coming down” in the vagina, bladder, bowel and sexual problems and pelvic and back pain. These symptoms impact negatively on a woman’s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Women presenting with prolapse are commonly offered conservative management (such as a vaginal pessary or pelvic floor muscle training) or surgery. There were over 28,000 hospital admissions in England in 2017/2018 related to female genital prolapse associated with approximately 42,000 bed days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. About 9.5% of women will undergo surgery for prolapse in their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, surgery is not always effective or durable with 30% of women requiring at least one further procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. With the high re-operation rates and the controversy surrounding surgery and the use of mesh implants, it is timely to consider the evidence supporting conservative options in more detail.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Currently, women who have prolapse of all types and stages can receive pessary treatment. Most commonly, women who use a pessary are over 60 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and two thirds of women will opt to try a pessary when offered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although previous research indicates that the ring pessary is most commonly used in practice, a wide range of pessaries are fitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hospital-based care remains the most common delivery mode for women who have a pessary with some community-based clinics and general practices also offering services. The most common service model for women is to return to a healthcare professional clinic to have their pessary removed and changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Most commonly, women attend a clinic appointment every 6 months for a pessary change, but time between changes does vary (3–12 months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It is not clear if pessaries would be used more often if pessary care was less reliant on follow-up appointments, allowing easier integration of pessary management with a woman’s lifestyle.</p>
              <p id="Par9">The largest UK-based observational study of pessary use reported that 86% of women successfully retaining a pessary at 4 weeks will continue to use a pessary at 5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, other studies have reported much lower continuation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Reasons for discontinuation of pessary use include developing complications such as bleeding or infection, dislike of the pessary changing procedure and inconvenience of attending appointments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par10">A UK multi-professional survey found that only 17% of clinicians offered women the option of self-managing their pessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is a significant difference in practice compared with North America, where the majority of clinicians teach women pessary self-care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The ongoing Cochrane review update has so far identified no completed trials including self-management for pessary in any comparison. Self-management focusses on actions that people undertake for themselves to manage their health and illness. In order to self-manage people need self-management support (actions taken to support people to self-manage, e.g. by healthcare professionals). Self-management has been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes such as quality of life in other conditions; e.g. condition-specific quality of life is improved for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par11">There is only one small (<italic>n</italic> = 88) non-randomised study that assesses self-management of vaginal pessaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Gains from self-management were reported in this study in that women reported higher levels of convenience, ability to access help, support and comfort than those having clinic management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Women who were self-managing had one clinic appointment scheduled at 2 years, compared to health care professional clinic-based care where women attend a clinic every 4 to 6 months for pessary changes. Whilst these may be promising findings, there is an urgent need to robustly investigate whether pessary self-management is more clinically and cost-effective than standard pessary care. The TOPSY study aims to address this uncertainty to inform clinical practice.</p>

              <title>Objectives {7}</title>
              <p id="Par12">The aim of the TOPSY trial is to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of self-management of vaginal pessaries to treat pelvic organ prolapse, compared to clinic pessary care on condition-specific quality of life.</p>

              <sec id="Sec5">
                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par13">The TOPSY study includes a multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial (RCT), an internal pilot study and a nested process evaluation. The RCT and internal pilot will be described in further detail here, whilst the protocol for the process evaluation will be reported in a separate companion paper and will not be addressed further here.</p>
                <p id="Par14">The aim of the internal pilot is to ensure that the TOPSY trial can recruit, randomise and retain sufficient numbers of participants whilst delivering the intervention as planned. The internal pilot will aim to recruit 63 women across six centres (identified prior to the commencement of the study). The primary stop-go rules are detailed in the analysis section.</p>
                <p id="Par15">We will establish if pessary self-management is cost-effective compared to standard clinic-based pessary care by collecting cost and resource-use data for all participants using a combination of NHS data and participant-completed questionnaires. This is described in more detail in both the outcome section and the analysis sections.</p>

              <sec id="Sec6">
                <title>Study setting {9}</title>
                <p id="Par16">Healthcare providers with pessary care services (who have granted permission for the study to take place) will identify and recruit women (for more information on centres involved, please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://w3.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/TOPSY/Public/Public/index.cshtml">https://w3.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/TOPSY/Public/Public/index.cshtml</ext-link>).</p>

              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Eligibility criteria {10}</title>
                <p id="Par17">Women will be eligible for inclusion if they are aged 18 or older, use a pessary of any type/material (except those that require more complex removal techniques such as Shelf or Gellhorn pessaries and those that must be self-managed such as cube pessary) and have retained the pessary for at least 2 weeks. Women will be ineligible if they: have limited manual dexterity that would affect their ability to remove and replace their own pessary; are judged by their healthcare team to have a cognitive deficit such that it is not possible to obtain informed consent or to self-manage; or are pregnant. The self-management teaching is only available in English; therefore, sufficient understanding of English language is required for participation.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec8">
                <title>Recruitment {15}</title>
                <p id="Par18">Potential participants will be identified in the following ways:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par19">Reviewing patient notes, clinic lists or caseloads to identify women who are currently using a pessary and could be approached;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">At a pessary appointment when women attend for pessary review (existing users) or are fitted with a pessary for the first time (new users); and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par21">Women who learn about the TOPSY study themselves (website, posters, word of mouth) and approach their centre or the trial office (this would be dependent on there being a TOPSY recruitment centre local to the women).</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par22">Women who are identified as potential participants through the mechanisms detailed above will be given a recruitment pack which contains an introductory letter, a participant information leaflet, an expression of interest form and a reply paid envelope. Women identified via patient notes, clinic lists or caseloads will have the recruitment pack posted to them by the “local TOPSY clinical team”. Women identified at their pessary appointment will be given the same recruitment pack in clinic. If time restraints in clinic mean that the local TOPSY clinical team are unable to fully discuss the study with the woman after giving out a pack, a follow-up call with the woman from a member of the research team at the centre delegated to do so can be arranged for an agreed time.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Once women have had enough time to make their decision, they can return the expression of interest form by post or in person to the local TOPSY clinical team to indicate if they are interested in participating or not. On receiving a positive expression of interest form, a member of the local TOPSY clinical team will discuss the study further with the woman and screen her for eligibility.</p>
                <p id="Par24">In addition, for women who are new pessary users (used a pessary for 3 months or less), eligibility screening will be finalised by a telephone call to assess if the pessary has been retained for at least 2 weeks. If the pessary has not been retained for 2 weeks, standard centre protocol would be followed for further pessary care. If women indicate that they remain interested in participating in TOPSY, eligibility will be reassessed once standard centre protocol is followed and the pessary has been retained for 2 weeks.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="Sec9">
                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par25">If a woman is eligible and willing to take part, she will be asked to come to a baseline clinic appointment to provide written, informed consent for randomisation and completion of baseline questionnaires and demographic data (see “<xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">Outcomes</xref>” section for more information).</p>
                <p id="Par26">Informed consent procedures will ensure that women understand participation is voluntary and that participants can withdraw from all or any part of the research at any time without affecting their participation in other parts of the study, or their healthcare. Women may choose to withdraw from the treatment aspect of the study, but continue to provide data, for example by completing questionnaires. Where women cannot, or choose not to, continue to self-manage, this will be recorded and women, where willing to do so, will continue to complete questionnaires. If withdrawal occurs, the primary reason for withdrawal will be documented in the participant’s case report form (CRF), if possible. After full withdrawal, no further data will be collected from the participant but data collected up to that point will be analysed.</p>
                <p id="Par27">If a participant is randomised and then withdraws prior to any trial intervention being undertaken, for trial purposes the woman will continue to be included within her original allocated group, and if data are available, in the intention to treat (ITT) analysis. If women in the self-management group cross over to clinic-based care during the trial, they will follow the trial clinic-based care group protocol. A change of status form will be completed in all of the above examples to indicate the nature of the change of status and to monitor participant attrition rates. The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will review change of status information at an appropriately agreed frequency.</p>

                <title>Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens {26b}</title>
                <p id="Par28">The main trial consent asks participants if they would be willing to be contacted about the interviews (for the process evaluation part of TOPSY) or if they would be willing to have their teaching session or their 2-week follow-up call audio-recorded. They are also asked if they would be happy to be contacted in the future about research. Participants can say no to any of these questions and still take part in the TOPSY study.</p>

              <p id="Par35">Self-management interventions are highly heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], making identification of the effective component parts of an intervention difficult. However, based on evidence drawn from large scale self-management programmes, three tasks need to be achieved in order for individuals to self-manage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]: medical management of the condition, role management and emotional management.</p>

                <p id="Par36">To support a woman to achieve the three tasks needed for self-management, the intervention will be directed at three levels:

                <title>Supporting delivery of self-management at service and professional levels</title>
                <p id="Par40">At a service level, the TOPSY training team (a clinical co-applicant and the trial manager) will visit all trial centres and will discuss with staff the trial processes and the self-management protocol.</p>
                <p id="Par41">A training manual for those staff teaching women self-management has been developed: with Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) input (including a focus group with women from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) PPI group, Women’s Voices); through discussion with our clinical co-applicants (which includes urogynaecologists from across the UK, nurses and a physiotherapist); using International Consultation on Incontinence recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; using best practice guidance from the self-management literature.</p>

              <sec id="Sec20">
                <title>Intervention components delivered to individual women</title>
                <p id="Par42">Women allocated to self-management will receive: a self-management teaching appointment, a self-management information leaflet, a 2-week follow-up telephone call, and a telephone helpline number/email address for their local clinical site.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Each woman in the self-management group will receive a 30 min, one-to-one self-management teaching appointment with an intervention healthcare professional (HCP) who has been trained in the pessary self-management intervention by the TOPSY training team. The intervention HCP is most likely to be a specialist nurse or physiotherapist, but may also be a urogynaecologist or general practitioner (GP). They have to be involved in pessary management as part of their clinical role to be eligible to teach women the intervention for the TOPSY study. The teaching appointment should take place within 4 weeks of the randomisation date. The self-management training manual specifies in detail the key components of the self-management intervention, facilitating standardisation of the self-management intervention across the centres. The key components as laid out in the training manual will be used by the intervention HCP when teaching women within the teaching appointment.</p>
                <p id="Par44">During the self-management teaching appointment, women will be given a self-management information leaflet containing written information on pessary self-management. The leaflet was initially developed as part of a previous non-randomised study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and is based on the viewpoints of, and feedback from, PPI representatives. The leaflet has undergone further development, drawing on the expertise of TOPSY PPI representatives, Women’s Voices (RCOG) focus group members and clinical co-applicants. The leaflet includes diagrams of various pessary types and pelvic floor anatomy, information about common complications and what to do if these are experienced. The same leaflet will be used across all centres.</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par45">During the self-management teaching session and reinforced in the self-management leaflet, women in the self-management group will be asked to remove, clean and re-insert their pessary at least once in the 2 weeks following the self-management teaching appointment. The woman will be telephoned 2 weeks after the appointment and asked if she has been successful in removing, cleaning and re-inserting her pessary. They will discuss any difficulties experienced. If the woman has not changed the pessary, the HCP will ask her to do so over the next week, and will call her again to check if this has been achieved. Where a woman has experienced difficulty that requires assessment by the HCP or where the woman has not changed the pessary by the time of the second phone call, she will be offered a second self-management teaching appointment. If, after this second appointment, the woman is unable to self-manage or does not wish to do so, she will be given the choice to transfer to clinic-based pessary care. All information on these interactions with women and any subsequent crossovers will be recorded in the study-specific CRF. Once it is clear that the woman has been able to remove and re-insert the pessary at least once, she will be asked to remove and re-insert the pessary at least once every 6 months. This information will be given as part of the self-management teaching appointment and is written into the information leaflet.</p>
                <p id="Par46">Women in the self-management group will receive a local telephone number and an email address to use to make contact with the intervention HCP at their centre if they experience any pessary problems or have questions (numbers of contacts received and details of reasons for calls will be recorded by the centre).</p>
                <p id="Par47">Women with PVC pessaries in both groups will receive a new PVC pessary every 6 months (women in the self-management group will either receive their new pessary by post or by picking up a prescription or some centres may give 2 extra pessaries at the baseline visit).</p>
                <p id="Par48">Women in the self-management group with silicone pessaries, which are more durable, will only have the pessary changed by request if required (e.g. if the pessary becomes damaged) and women with silicone pessaries in the clinic-based care group will have the pessaries changed as per local centre protocol. Self-management leaflets will include information about what women need to do if they require a new pessary.</p>
                <p id="Par49">Women in both trial groups will be asked to complete questionnaires every 6 months which will include questions regarding their patterns of pessary removal and re-insertion. At 18 months after randomisation, women in both groups will attend a clinic appointment which will include an examination of vaginal tissues, comparable to that carried out routinely in clinic-based pessary care (see below).</p>

Content of appointments will follow local protocol which usually includes vaginal examination to remove the pessary, inspection of the vaginal tissues and insertion of a new pessary. Data on frequency of appointments and of pessary changes at appointments will be recorded in the CRF.

Each centre will have a centre initiation visit to ensure all study processes are in place before recruitment commences. The TOPSY Study Office will set up regular centre “forums” for all centres to “phone in” and discuss any problems experienced and share learning. Updates will be provided via quarterly newsletters. Centres having specific problems with recruitment and/or retention will be offered additional support either remotely or by an additional centre visit.</p>

                <p id="Par56">The primary outcome, condition-specific quality of life at 18 months post-randomisation, will be measured via participant-completed questionnaires using the PFIQ-7. The PFIQ-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] is a reliable, valid and responsive short form of the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) which measures condition-specific quality of life in women with pelvic floor disorders including urinary incontinence, prolapse and faecal incontinence. There are three subscales: urinary (UIQ-7), colorectal-anal (CRAIQ-7) and pelvic organ prolapse (POPIQ-7), with each sub-score ranging from 0 to 100 and a total score ranging from 0 to 300. Data will be collected at each time-point to allow repeated measures analysis of the PFIQ-7 scores.</p>

                <title>Secondary outcome measures</title>
                <p id="Par57">Several secondary outcomes will be collected as described below. Frequency of collection for each outcome is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par58">Participants’ health-related quality of life will be measured by Euroqol (EQ-5D-5L) complementing the primary outcome measure of condition-specific quality of life, and also providing data for the analysis of cost-effectiveness (see section “<xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">Data collection for economic evaluation</xref>” for more information).</p>
                <p id="Par59">The severity of prolapse-related symptoms will be measured by PFDI-20. This was developed and validated in parallel with the PFIQ-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It contains 20 questions about the presence of bladder, bowel and pelvic symptoms, and how bothersome these are.</p>
                <p id="Par60">Women’s sexual symptoms will be assessed by The Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-IR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par61">A woman’s general self-efficacy (as a moderator of quality of life) will be measured by the General Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Pessary complications</title>
                  <p id="Par62">A new pessary questionnaire developed for TOPSY (with 15 possible complications of pessary use), developed based on the literature, PPI opinion and the team’s experiences in the pilot study, will be used to record women’s pessary complications (e.g. discharge, odour, pain, discomfort, bleeding). The questionnaire record will be used to collect the secondary outcome measure of pessary-related complications to report on the impact and safety of the trial interventions.</p>

                  <title>Pessary use</title>
                  <p id="Par63">A new questionnaire (including eight questions) developed based on the literature, PPI consultation and the team’s experiences in the pilot study will be used to collect data on the pattern of a woman’s pessary use, including pessary continuation and perceived acceptability and benefit. This will include questions that ask women the following: whether or not they are still using a pessary as treatment for prolapse; when they last removed and re-inserted their pessary; reasons for pessary removal; interference of the pessary with everyday life; and if they find the pessary an acceptable treatment. Also included is a question adapted from the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) which will be used to assess perceived benefit of the pessary care regimens being evaluated. The PGI-I is a single-item tool asking the individual to rate the change in their condition since having treatment, which has been validated for urogenital prolapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An amended version asking women to describe how they feel about their pessary care since taking part in the study will be used, with response options ranging from very much better to very much worse. Patterns of pessary use are used to measure impact, adherence and acceptability of the trial interventions.</p>

These six questions have been developed with PPI representatives, PPI input, statistical input and clinical team members. We will use both the generic validated measure of self-efficacy (GSE) and the responses to the newly developed pessary-specific self-efficacy questions to measure self-efficacy and help us understand the influence it has as a moderating factor on quality of life.</p>

                  <p id="Par65">As an indicator of intervention effectiveness, the uptake of other treatment for prolapse since the start of the study, or treatment awaited, will be recorded in participant questionnaires (e.g. surgery, pelvic floor muscle training, oestrogen, lifestyle advice). Women’s access to professional pessary-related support since starting the study will also be recorded (e.g. telephone support, hospital appointment, GP appointment). These data will be collected at all trial time-points to improve data quality as they rely on women recalling events occurring over a period of some months. Additional treatment will be described as part of the main trial findings to assist in understanding adherence and level of support women need, as well as being used as part of the cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>

Monitoring will be via multiple data sources: questions within the pessary use questionnaire, telephone support contacts and health records. It will include crossover to the other trial group (i.e. self-managing women opting to move to clinic-based care). Clinic-based care women will not have access to the trial self-management teaching and support intervention, but they may choose to remove and replace their pessary at home and this will be recorded in the pessary use questionnaire.</p>

The analysis of the primary outcome will estimate the mean difference (with 95% confidence intervals) in the PFIQ-7 score at 18 months between the self-management and standard care groups using a mixed effects repeated measures model (which assumes incomplete outcome data to be missing at random). The model will incorporate age (&lt; 65/≥ 65) and pessary user type (new/existing) and baseline PFIQ-7 as fixed effects and participant and recruitment centre as random effects. Statistical significance will be at the 5% level.</p>
                <p id="Par89">Secondary outcomes will be analysed using an appropriate generalised linear model, for example binary logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes such as discontinuation with pessary (Y/N), and ordinal logistic regression for ordered categorical outcomes such as women’s global impression of improvement (PGI-I). All models will be adjusted for minimisation covariates (age, pessary user type and centre) and baseline score (where applicable).</p>

                  <p id="Par91">Given the potential for crossover, we will conduct a secondary analysis of compliers to estimate the effect of receiving the self-management intervention, using complier average causal effect (CACE) estimators. The CACE analysis will take a maximum likelihood approach, which can assume incomplete data to be missing at random, and can be adjusted for covariates. This analysis will provide unbiased effect estimates of receiving the self-management intervention, which will complement the ITT effect estimates.</p>

                  <p id="Par94">To examine the costs and outcomes of self-management compared to clinic-based care beyond the trial period, a decision analytic model will be developed. This will involve extrapolating data from the trial period and supplementing with additional data from the literature and other data sources as required. A 5-year time frame will be used and the care pathway over this period will be mapped out. We will incorporate data on the number of women who would want to self-manage, continued pessary use, continuation rates for self-management, complications and adverse events, conversion to surgery rates for both self-management and clinic-based care, health outcomes (prolapse and general quality of life outcomes), expenditure attending follow-up appointments in both groups, expenditure on replacement pessaries in both groups (type-dependent) and other (potentially rare) outcomes of interest that we would unlikely to see during the 18-month trial period (e.g. fistula). Using this model, we will perform cost-effectiveness analyses by synthesising trial data and data from other sources. Robustness of the results will be assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. This will allow us to examine longer-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness under the presence of uncertainty.</p>

Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant will be used to enquire about AE/SAE occurrence. Participants will also be asked if they have been admitted to hospital, had any accidents, used any new medicines or changed medication regimens. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be recorded. Women in the self-management group are asked during the teaching appointment and advised in the information leaflet to call the telephone helpline if they experience any of the symptoms that may be indicative of an SAE/AE. The pessary complication questionnaire completed by all women at all time-points will also capture any adverse events experienced.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par111">Due to the anticipated rise in the prevalence of prolapse with an ageing population, there will be an anticipated increasing demand on pessary management services which will have increased cost implications across all NHS trusts. Some pessary management services in different regions across the UK offer women the option to learn how to self-manage their own pessaries but there is limited evidence to support this practice. There is currently no “gold standard” on how self-management is taught to women, no evidence on the support structures that should be available to support self-managing women or on how often women should be seen in clinic if self-managing. The TOPSY study is therefore crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of self-management on a woman’s quality of life and the potential impact on current and future NHS workload. TOPSY is the first trial of self-management in pelvic floor dysfunction.</p>
              <p id="Par112">Previous pessary trials, where women are randomised prior to pessary fitting, have an attrition rate of approximately 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A particular strength of the TOPSY trial design is to ensure that women have managed to retain their pessary for at least 2 weeks before they are eligible to be randomised. It is anticipated that having less attrition will support a true test of whether or not self-management is more effective in improving women’s quality of life than clinic-based care.</p>
              <p id="Par113">If the TOPSY study concludes self-management has a positive effect on a women’s quality of life in regard to management of pelvic organ prolapse and has cost benefits to the NHS, it is hoped that the intervention package (including the training manuals and literature developed for TOPSY) will be rolled out and implemented across the UK.</p>

              <title>Trial status and internal pilot</title>
              <p id="Par116">The first participant was randomised on the 16th of May 2018. All six pilot centres were recruiting by June 2018, and 72 participants were recruited by the end of the pilot phase on 16 November 2018. The principal stop/go criterion was therefore met and the trial continued.</p>
              <p id="Par117">The secondary target of at least 60% of women self-managing at 2 weeks was also met with 83% of those randomised to self-management still self-managing at 2 weeks. The target of 20% of existing users was exceeded with 22% of eligible existing users randomised. The target of 40% of new users was not met with only 28% of eligible new users randomised. This lower than the anticipated figure led to a re-profiling of recruitment. As a consequence, the number of centres was increased, currently 21 centres are open to recruitment across the UK, and the recruitment period was extended until January 2020. Data collection will continue until 2021. As part of the process evaluation, data was gathered about participant recruitment processes, the findings of these elements of the pilot study will be submitted for publication imminently.</p>
