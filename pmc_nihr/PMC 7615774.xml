          <body>
            <p id="P6">Over the last two decades, the survival of extreme preterm infants has increased with modest reductions in neonatal morbidities, although the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) has increased.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> In this gestation group, a large patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (1.5 mm diameter or greater) that is present beyond 3 days of age is associated with an increase in the odds of death or severe morbidity and BPD compared to infants without a PDA.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The incidence of PDA is inversely proportional to gestational age: over 40% of infants born at less than 28 weeks’ gestation have a persistent PDA by 4 months of age.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The risk of BPD or death in extreme preterm infants also increases with persistence of the PDA beyond 1–2 weeks of age.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P7">Various treatment strategies have been investigated for managing infants with a PDA.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Prophylaxis with indomethacin or ibuprofen in the first 12 to 24 hours of life is reported to reduce severe intraventricular hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage, but without an improvement in survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> However, utilizing a prophylactic approach, most infants will receive treatment unnecessarily since PDAs can close spontaneously.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Data are limited on the treatment of infants with a symptomatic PDA, with no reported improvement in clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Consequently, the number of extreme preterm infants with a PDA that are treated pharmacologically has decreased.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P8">By utilizing bedside functional echocardiography,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> infants can now be screened to identify PDAs that are large with unrestricted flow that are unlikely to close spontaneously. Selective early targeted treatment of patients with these PDAs may avoid unnecessary treatment of all patients with PDAs.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Parenteral indomethacin and ibuprofen have been used for early targeted treatment of PDA with no evidence of a difference in their efficacy,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> although the side-effect profile of ibuprofen is reported to be superior.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
            <p id="P9">We hypothesized that early (up to 72 hours) selective treatment of patients who have a PDA that is 1.5 mm diameter or larger with unrestricted flow, identified using bedside echocardiography, with ibuprofen compared to placebo, would reduce mortality and improve short-term outcomes such as BPD.</p>

Missing data were not imputed. Analyses were adjusted for minimization factors, such as the size of the PDA at randomization, gestational age at birth, age at randomization, sex, multiple birth, mode of respiratory support at randomization, receiving inotropes at time of randomization, and center, and the correlation between siblings from multiple births, where technically possible (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S7</xref>). Binary outcomes were analyzed using mixed effects Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator with risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals presented. Model diagnostics were checked and satisfied (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2</xref>). Continuous outcomes were analysed using linear regression models, with mean differences and 95% confidence intervals presented, after checking model assumptions.

                <title>Discussion</title>
                <p id="P23">In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of extreme preterm infants with a large PDA, there was no evidence that early treatment with ibuprofen was associated with an improvement in the composite outcome of death or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks’ post-menstrual age. There were no apparent between-group differences in death or moderate or severe BPD.</p>
                <p id="P24">Our results are broadly consistent with other studies of early targeted treatment of PDA with ibuprofen that have not demonstrated a convincing benefit in clinical outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Although these studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of pulmonary hemorrhage and patient symptoms attributable to the PDA, intervention with ibuprofen is not associated with a reduction in the incidence of BPD, mortality or neurodisability. <sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P25">Approximately half of the infants we enrolled were less than 26 weeks’ gestation, the cohort at greatest risk of developing a hemodynamically significant PDA. We enrolled infants with a large PDA based on a combination of echocardiographic parameters, including the diameter of the PDA and ductal flow characteristics.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The rates of death or moderate or severe BPD in our study were high, but comparable to other randomized trials of early pharmacological treatment of PDA.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
                <p id="P26">A single early course of ibuprofen resulted in a closed or small PDA (confirmed by echocardiography at 3 weeks of age) in only 55.5% of infants randomized to ibuprofen. Although previous studies have reported variable closure rates with early intravenous ibuprofen therapy,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> our findings are consistent with recent studies in similar patient populations.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Variation in the rate of PDA closure among studies is likely explained by differences in the timing of the intervention, an open-label treatment study design, the route of administration of the ibuprofen and the dosing regimen used.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Intravenous ibuprofen using a standard dosing regimen was chosen as the intervention in our study because higher doses are usually only used when an infant is 7 days of age or older, and it was the most common treatment schedule for infants with a PDA in the United Kingdom at the time the study was designed.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Similarly, most units did not routinely repeat echocardiographic assessment after ibuprofen therapy with the intention of offering a second course if the PDA remained patent.</p>
                <p id="P27">The rate of open-label medical therapy for patients with a symptomatic PDA in this trial appeared lower than that reported in other similar trials<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> and occurred almost twice as frequently in the placebo group compared to the ibuprofen group. Although a recent non-inferiority trial of early ibuprofen in the management of patients with a PDA achieved a very low rate of open-label medical therapy of 0.7% in the expectant management arm,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> there was frequent use of acetaminophen as an analgesic after randomization in both arms.</p>
                <p id="P28">Accordingly, exposure to any pharmacological agent with the potential for ductal closure was approximately 25% in babies managed expectantly, representing a contamination rate comparable to ours.</p>
                <p id="P29">The median time from randomization to open-label medical therapy in our study was 11 to 12 days, well-beyond when the infant received the trial intervention (up to 7 days). This was much later than the timing of rescue treatment in a French study<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (median 4 days) that overlapped with the trial intervention. The low effective closure rate in our ibuprofen group combined with the relatively late timing of open-label medical therapy suggests that a large proportion of treated infants may have been exposed to the potentially damaging effects of the ductal shunt for a prolonged time period. Combined with the relatively high incidence of open-label medical therapy in the placebo group (30%), this resulted in poor discrimination between our two study groups with respect to ductal patency (55.5% versus 37.0%) and probably also in prolonged exposure to a ductal shunt. The absence of data from serial echocardiograms precludes detailed analysis and limits interpretation of the impact of shunt duration on outcomes between the two groups. Nevertheless, one might reasonably conclude that an early, echo-targeted, course of ibuprofen results in an additional closure or constriction rate of 18% without impacting clinical outcomes.</p>
                <p id="P30">We found no evidence that ibuprofen resulted in excess serious complications. Unlike Hundscheid <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>, we did not identify an association between ibuprofen therapy and BPD, a finding that might be explained by differences in study populations or drug exposure.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Whereas most infants enrolled into our study were receiving invasive ventilation, the Beneductus trial mostly enrolled those who were on non-invasive respiratory support. Another important difference was the use of repeated courses (often with high doses) of ibuprofen in the Beneductus trial. This early exposure to high cumulative doses of ibuprofen in infants with a relatively low baseline risk of BPD as in the Beneductus trial may be detrimental.</p>
                <p id="P31">Our study has limitations. Despite adopting strict criteria to restrict its use, 29.8% of babies in the placebo arm received open-label medical therapy, the likely impact of which would have been to increase the PDA closure rate in this group and make it more difficult to demonstrate between-group differences in clinical outcomes. We did not meet our recruitment goal, enrolling 653 participants out of a target of 730. This was partly due to drug non-availability, changes in clinical practice, competing trials and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although early assessment and randomization was encouraged, the median age at which the first dose of trial medication was administered was 61 hours, a time that was later than in other similar studies.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Trial entry up to 72 hours after birth was permitted to allow a pragmatic approach to enrollment and to ensure the availability of an echocardiography assessment. However, it is possible that earlier intervention may have achieved more effective ductal closure.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>

                <p>Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from an interaction term between treatment assignment and subgroup characteristic of interest, in a log binomial model adjusted for size of PDA at randomization, gestational age at birth, age at randomization, sex, multiple birth, mode of respiratory support at randomization, receiving inotropes at time of randomization, and centre as a random effect, and clustered by siblings to account for correlation between multiple births. Some of the patient subgroups have been collapsed into fewer subgroups than pre-specified due to the low number of patients in each category. No adjustments were made for multiplicity of testing and therefore interpretation of the confidence intervals should not be used to assess treatment effect.</p>
