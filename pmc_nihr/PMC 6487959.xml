                  <p>Many children suffer with skin diseases but to date most dermatological research has been done ‘on’ rather than ‘with’ children; in this study we actively sought the experiences of children and young people. Atopic eczema (<styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>) is a chronic, itchy, inflammatory skin condition that affects around 20% of children and can impact on the health and wellbeing of children and their families. The role of specialist clothing in the management of <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content> is poorly understood.</p>

                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>The aim of this study, which was nested in a randomized controlled trial, was to qualitatively examine child participants’ experiences of using silk garments for the treatment of <styled-content style="fixed-case">AE</styled-content>.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Eighteen children aged 5–15 years, who took part in the <styled-content style="fixed-case">CLOTH</styled-content>ing for the relief of Eczema Symptoms (<styled-content style="fixed-case">CLOTHES</styled-content>) trial, participated in age‐appropriate individual interviews or focus groups.</p>

                <sec id="bjd15909-sec-0004">
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Thematic analysis generated four themes directly related to the silk garments: (i) expectations of the garments; (ii) wearing the garments; (iii) asking if the garments helped; and (iv) thoughts about the garments. The conclusions from this nested qualitative study are that there was some limited improvement in eczema for some children but that the hoped‐for ‘miracle cure’ did not transpire. A mixed picture of knowledge, beliefs and experiences of using the silk garments emerged.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Engaging children in the evaluation of the garments provided first‐hand nuanced insights that enhanced understanding of the <styled-content style="fixed-case">CLOTHES</styled-content> study as a whole. This nested study demonstrates that children can and indeed want to be engaged in dermatological research in meaningful ways that add to our understanding of treatment options.</p>

            <p>There is growing interest in qualitative research in dermatology<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> and the active engagement of children in dermatology consultations;<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> however, these ideals are not always realised. Globally there are around 1·8 billion people aged 0–14 years.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Historically, children have been viewed as dependent and vulnerable objects of study, with primary informants typically being parents or clinicians.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> There are increasing calls for children to be actively involved in research studies, but evidence suggests children are frequently not engaged in meaningful ways.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Health research is often undertaken on rather than with children, or their experiences are extrapolated or subsumed within adults’ views. Children are rarely heard in dermatology research, with the exception of the use of some quantitative measures such as the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p>
            <p>Atopic eczema (AE) is a common inflammatory skin condition affecting around 20% of children.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Treatment typically includes emollients and topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors, and systemic treatments in more severe cases. Topical treatments can be time consuming to apply and unpleasant to use, and treatment failure is often attributed to nonadherence.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Poor control leads to worsening AE, which affects physical and emotional wellbeing.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Many parents and children are keen to explore nonpharmacological interventions for the management of AE, and silk garments have been suggested as one such approach. These garments are available for private purchase or in some countries on prescription, but the evidence base for their use is limited. The CLOTHing for the Relief of Eczema Symptoms (CLOTHES) trial comprises randomized controlled trial (RCT) and nested qualitative studies involving children, parents, clinicians, and commissioners of silk clothing. A summary of the elements of the study is provided in Table <xref rid="bjd15909-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and reported in detail in other published works.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In this nested study we explored child experiences of using silk garments, as they were the users of these products in the CLOTHES trial and therefore their input was essential.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>

              <p>An exploratory qualitative research method<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> was used to explore participating children's and young people's views about the silk garments.

                <title>Ethical considerations</title>
                <p>Ethical approval was gained from Health Research Authority East Midlands – Nottingham 1 Research Ethics Committee (reference number 13/EM/0255) and the local research and development department for each participating centre. Parents and children were informed about the qualitative study by their research nurse towards the end of their participation in the RCT. Children were given an age‐appropriate participant information sheet and invited to sign an assent form.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> They were told clearly that they did not have to take part and could stop at any time.</p>

                <p>Once children had completed the RCT we recruited a convenience sample<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> of 18 children aged 5–15 years from both intervention and standard care groups across the five study recruiting sites. We used convenience rather than purposive sampling in light of the challenges of identifying and recruiting children from all sites and, in the case of focus groups, from deliberately narrow age bands. Children in the intervention group had used the garments for 6 months and those in the standard care group for 2 months after the primary outcome had been collected at 6 months.

                <p>Prior to data collection, conversations with parents and older children ensured the research team's understanding of the child's developmental stage and current interests and this information was used to plan data collection activity. Some parents chose to be present during the interviews and focus groups but none participated or obviously influenced children's contributions. Venues for data collection were as child friendly as possible. At the beginning of each episode of data collection E.W. spent time with the children getting to know them, making introductions and checking that they were willing to take part. Interviews were conducted by E.W. Focus groups were facilitated by E.W. and an observer was present to take notes and ensure the well‐being of participants. Children were not pressurized to join in any activities and we were careful not to interpret a child ‘just watching from the side’ as nonparticipating. Subtle communication was valued as much as the more obvious. Breaks were taken during data collection guided by cues from the children.</p>
                <p>A Mosaic approach<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> involving multiple participatory and adaptable, creative and fun<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> methods of data collection were used.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Elements of the ‘least adult’ role were adopted to support active child participation and children were enabled to ‘take charge’ and direct the research agenda.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> For example E.W. followed the lead of the children in selecting activities and was fully engaged in these, consciously using children's language and testing understanding. Children chose what to do and how to share their feelings and experiences. For example, we created a story together with younger children based on a day in the life of Billy the puppet (Fig. <xref rid="bjd15909-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), and they used drawings, stickers and two‐dimensional foam people to share their experiences. Towards the end of each data‐collection session, E.W. checked her understanding with the children. They photographed any artefacts as they were keen to take them home. As each photograph was taken the creator explained its significance to E.W. to ensure authenticity in data analysis and reporting. Each interaction ended with E.W. briefly recapping what had been said, explaining to the children what would happen to their data, and presentation of a certificate acknowledging their contribution. Data gathered using diverse methods from children aged 5–15 years varied in terms of content and the ways in which they were communicated. However, as seen in the data analysis below some strong and consistent messages were provided.</p>

                <p>To ensure faithful representation of child data we used three methods of holistic, selective and detailed analysis,<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> which involved viewing the data (interview transcripts, artefacts with child explanations and observer notes) as a whole, identifying phrases or ideas that represented the experience under study, and finally studying the data line by line in order to identify themes. Throughout analysis we were mindful of the age and developmental stage of participants that affected the verbal and nonverbal language they used. The analysis process was not linear but moved back and forth between wholes and parts. F.C. and E.W. reviewed the data alone and then together to ensure authenticity in portraying children's experiences. As data analysis progressed, emerging themes were discussed with the qualitative study team until shared understanding was achieved. At this stage the qualitative researchers were independent from the wider study team and findings were not shared until all elements of data analysis were completed.</p>

                  <p>This theme comprised three subthemes: use of other treatments, garments, and hopes. Many children expected the garments to feel ‘silky’ and hoped that using the garments would reduce the need to use creams. Realising that this was not the case was a source of disappointment. Children were disappointed with the ‘rough’ texture of the garments and some reported needing to use creams more frequently when wearing the garments. A number of children had expected the silks to be cooling, but for many the effect was the opposite, with the garments making them hotter. Many of the children were excited to try the garments, and spoke of their hopes for, or doubts about, the effect on their eczema.</p>

                  <p>This theme addresses the times at which children chose to wear the garments. There are two subthemes: day vs. night, and school vs. home. Few children of any age wore the silks during the day: a majority preferred to wear them at night only. There were many issues with being able to wear them for school, ranging from fit, uniform requirements, changing for physical education lessons, and the reactions of other children. Peer groups and friendships were very important for children of all ages; only those with very secure friendships felt confident enough to tell their peers openly about their eczema and the garments.</p>

                  <p>This theme has three subthemes: getting better, getting worse, and ‘liked anyway’. There was a real mixture of success of the garments, ranging from perceived complete cessation of eczema, to no effect at all, to worsening of symptoms. Some reported that the silks had improved their sleep, while others felt it had made them more comfortable but not improved their eczema per se. A few stated that the clothing improved their emotional well‐being, while others were disappointed in the effect of the garments. Some children reported liking wearing the garments for comfort, even if they had no perceptible effect on their eczema.</p>

                  <p>Thoughts about the garments comprised three subthemes: quality and cost, appearance and design, and fit and fabric. Many participants thought the garments were poor quality in terms of appearance, design, fit or the fabric itself. Several children reported that the garments did not wash well, turning baggy and grey and affecting fit over time (Fig. <xref rid="bjd15909-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Older children reported using the garments as advised, allowing creams to soak into the skin before putting them on; however, they found that garments tended to become sticky and oily, and in some cases smelly. Some thought the texture was rough and actually irritated their skin more and some stated that the silks made them hotter. The fact that the silks were see‐through was an issue, particularly for older children, making their use limited to the home. At night, the garments tended to be worn under pyjamas or onesies. The cost, which some children had either looked up or discussed with their parents, was an issue for further purchase for a few, with a couple of participants suggesting that they were too expensive to buy and should be available on prescription from a general practitioner.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Generally, children reported some limited improvement in their eczema, but the hoped‐for ‘miracle cure’ did not transpire. Several children entered the trial believing that using the garments would lead to a reduction or ceasing of the need to use topical treatments; the requirement to continue use, as set out in the patient instructions, was a source of discontent. Children reported a significant sense of disappointment in relation to effectiveness, and the quality, fit and durability of garments. Including children in the study allowed deeper understanding, particularly about patterns of adherence and reasons for nonadherence.</p>
              <p>The child data reported here have uncovered insights that help to inform interpretation of the results of the study as a whole. The CLOTHES trial comprised the RCT, an economic evaluation, and qualitative studies with children, parents, clinicians and commissioners. In line with current recommendations, the CLOTHES study was developed as a coherent whole from the design phase,<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> with each element contributing to a rounded picture of the impact of silk garments. The decision to analyse datasets separately and then triangulate ensured no contamination while maximizing the value of each part.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> The RCT and economic evaluation found no significant gain in the use of silk garments in treating childhood eczema;<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> parental data revealed a preference for nonpharmacological treatments but a sense of disappointment with the garments, and clinicians and commissioners reported a lack of knowledge and evidence base for the garments, particularly given the cost.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> The child data have provided a deeper, richer and more detailed understanding of the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how come’ underpinning participants’ beliefs, behaviours and patterns of adherence.</p>
              <p>Parents and children generally had high expectations when entering the trial and this may have led to a degree of detection bias when completing the secondary patient‐reported outcome measures with their parents. Inclusion of the quantitative study gave confidence that the selected objective outcomes measure used for the primary outcome in the trial did not miss issues that were important to patients.</p>
              <p>The focus groups and interviews at the end of the RCT allowed children to reflect on whether there had been improvement in their condition when their initial high hopes had abated. The children provided detailed and nuanced explanations about why they did and did not wear the garments, which went beyond the views provided by their parents. Some issues were practical in nature, such as the perceived poor fit, rough feeling of the fabric and being hot and uncomfortable. Others were more personal and sensitive and it is these thoughts that were uniquely reported by the children. Several commented on the embarrassment of wearing garments, and jibes from their peers. Children were also most vocal about ways in which the garments could be improved to increase likelihood of adherence.</p>
              <p>In terms of relevance to other studies, while many researchers aspire to include children in meaningful ways – for example Hussain<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> – a recent review of 506 peer‐reviewed studies conducted between 2009 and 2012 involving children aged 0–8 years analysed child positioning, researcher perspective and level of respectful culture in each study, concluding that only 3·4% positioned children in inclusive, participatory roles.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Our study demonstrates that children <italic>can</italic> be included in research even from a relatively young age. Children <italic>wanted</italic> to talk with the researcher and were very able to express their experiences with clarity given age‐appropriate means of communication.</p>
              <p>A strength of this study is that trustworthiness is ensured by documentation of the decision trail<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> and reporting in line with Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research guidance.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> A limitation is self‐selection of participants as they may not be representative of the trial cohort. Also, recruitment of children from study centres in prescribed age bands was difficult and we would have preferred to recruit more children. We considered recruiting to wider age bands for the focus groups but made the decision not to do so as it would have compromised the value of using developmental and age‐appropriate activities to enable children to convey their thoughts and feelings. Combining qualitative and quantitative approaches from the design stage is a strength but our decision to undertake separate analysis of each dataset could be challenged, with some arguing for a more formal approach to data triangulation at the analysis stage.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>There is increasing recognition of the value of including nested qualitative studies within RCTs;<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> however, the rigour and integrative processes in this approach is often lacking.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Few nested studies including child participants have been reported. Examples include assessment of a home‐based exercise programme for children with cystic fibrosis<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and a home physiotherapy regimen for youngsters with joint hypermobility.<xref rid="bjd15909-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Both report valuable child data but this is not explicitly linked with associated RCT data. Ours is an original study in dermatology to qualitatively seek the experiences of children as part of a larger trial and demonstrates the possibilities for future studies.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this nested study demonstrates that with sufficient planning children can effectively and meaningfully be involved in dermatology research. Given the number of children with skin conditions and the impact this has on their quality of life it is important that we listen to their experiences. Many children were eager to try the garments but were less enthusiastic once they had seen and felt them. The majority of children expressed disappointment about the garments and the impact they had on their eczema. Equally, some children expressed a great reluctance to wear the garments, and given how much they cost this is an important message for prescribers and commissioners. When combined with other data, the results provide a more robust evidence base about the value of silk garments in the treatment of childhood eczema.</p>
              <p>Effective management of eczema relies on adherence to prescribed treatment regimens. Therefore there is a need to include children in the evaluation of proposed products from the design phase of trials, and thought should be given as to how best to triangulate data. Broadly, the child and parent data concur, with agreement that the garments were not of optimum design or quality and that expectations of improvement in condition were not met. Views on comfort were individual, with reports of both heating and cooling effects that were not always seasonally influenced. Children's explanations of nonadherence were often different or more subtle from those offered by parents and often included more sensitive subjects such as embarrassment and peer pressure. Inclusion of this qualitative component with children provided additional detail on possible reasons for nonadherence in wearing the garments that would not have been revealed from other data.</p>
