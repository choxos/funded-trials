                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Higher maternal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations, even below gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) thresholds, are associated with adverse offspring outcomes, with DNA methylation proposed as a mediating mechanism. Here, we examined the relationships between maternal dysglycaemia at 24 to 28 weeks’ gestation and DNA methylation in neonates and whether a dietary and physical activity intervention in pregnant women with obesity modified the methylation signatures associated with maternal dysglycaemia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>We investigated 557 women, recruited between 2009 and 2014 from the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), a randomised controlled trial (RCT), of a lifestyle intervention (low glycaemic index (GI) diet plus physical activity) in pregnant women with obesity (294 contol, 263 intervention). Between 27 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, participants had an oral glucose (75 g) tolerance test (OGTT), and GDM diagnosis was based on diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), with 159 women having a diagnosis of GDM. Cord blood DNA samples from the infants were interrogated for genome-wide DNA methylation levels using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Robust regression was carried out, adjusting for maternal age, smoking, parity, ethnicity, neonate sex, and predicted cell-type composition. Maternal GDM, fasting glucose, 1-h, and 2-h glucose concentrations following an OGTT were associated with 242, 1, 592, and 17 differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (dmCpG) sites (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05), respectively, in the infant’s cord blood DNA. The most significantly GDM-associated CpG was cg03566881 located within the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 6 (LGR6) (FDR = 0.0002). Moreover, we show that the GDM and 1-h glucose-associated methylation signatures in the cord blood of the infant appeared to be attenuated by the dietary and physical activity intervention during pregnancy; in the intervention arm, there were no GDM and two 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs, whereas in the standard care arm, there were 41 GDM and 160 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs. A total of 87% of the GDM and 77% of the 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs had smaller effect sizes in the intervention compared to the standard care arm; the adjusted r<sup>2</sup> for the association of LGR6 cg03566881 with GDM was 0.317 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.012, 0.022) in the standard care and 0.240 (95% CI 0.001, 0.015) in the intervention arm. Limitations included measurement of DNA methylation in cord blood, where the functional significance of such changes are unclear, and because of the strong collinearity between treatment modality and severity of hyperglycaemia, we cannot exclude that treatment-related differences are potential confounders.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Maternal dysglycaemia was associated with significant changes in the epigenome of the infants. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic impact of a dysglycaemic prenatal maternal environment appeared to be modified by a lifestyle intervention in pregnancy. Further research will be needed to investigate possible medical implications of the findings.</p>

                      <p>The incidence of gestational diabetes is increasing worldwide, concurrent with a rise in obesity with children born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) having a heightened risk of obesity and metabolic disease, perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of metabolic disease.</p>

                      <p>As little is known of the epigenetic changes induced by maternal GDM within mothers with obesity, a high-risk population for GDM, we examined relationships between DNA methylation in infants born to mothers with obesity who developed GDM and those who did not and the mother’s blood glucose concentration.

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Maternal obesity is a major risk factor for the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which is defined as diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Concomitant with the rising prevalence of maternal obesity, the incidence of GDM is increasing [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Women with GDM are at high risk from pregnancy and delivery complications including infant macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, and cesarean delivery [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, children born to mothers with GDM have a heightened risk of obesity and metabolic disease, which may lead to an intergenerational cycle of metabolic disease [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that maternal GDM and dysglycaemia even below GDM thresholds are associated with adverse offspring outcomes, including increased neonatal and childhood adiposity, altered neurodevelopment, greater insulin resistance, and a lower disposition index in childhood, a key risk factor in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>One of the mechanisms by which maternal GDM increases the risk of metabolic disease in the child is suggested to be through stable modifications of the offspring’s epigenome as a result of in utero exposure [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Epigenetic processes, which include DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs, induce heritable changes in gene expression without a change in nucleotide sequence. DNA methylation can be influenced by both genotype and the environment [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Substantial evidence from human epidemiological studies is accruing to suggest that the in utero environment can alter the epigenome of the infant. Maternal undernutrition [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and micronutrient status [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], maternal obesity [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and socioeconomic status[<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have all been associated with changes in the methylation status of the offspring epigenome. Both candidate gene [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and genome-wide studies [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have reported that GDM exposure is associated with significant changes in the infant’s or child’s methylome, and a recent meta-analysis of 7 pregnancy cohorts identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with GDM within OR2L13 and CYP2E1 [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the majority of these studies have focussed on GDM versus no GDM, rather than the continuous relationship between maternal glucose levels and DNA methylation [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and none has studied the GDM-associated signal within a high-risk population of women with obesity; thus, the relationship between the degree of maternal dysglycaemia and the contribution of maternal post-challenge/postprandial glucose excursions to the infant’s methylation signature in this high-risk group remains unknown.</p>
              <p>To date, direct evidence linking maternal GDM exposure to adverse health outcomes in the offspring through an epigenetic mechanism is lacking, as most studies have been observational [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for appropriately designed randomised control intervention studies that examine the causal link between dysglycaemia and induced changes in the fetal epigenome. Lifestyle interventions, particularly those designed to improve glycaemic control in women with GDM or those at risk of GDM, offer a promising strategy to improve outcomes for the mother and child. The UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT) is the largest randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a complex lifestyle intervention (low glycaemic index (GI) diet, reduced saturated fat intake, and increased physical activity) in pregnant women with obesity and has shown improvement in certain maternal and infant outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Obesity is a major risk factor for GDM[<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and 26% of the women in this study developed GDM. Although the lifestyle intervention did not prevent the 2 primary outcomes of the trial—the incidence of GDM and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, it reduced maternal glycaemic load, saturated fat intake, gestational weight gain and adiposity, and improved the maternal metabolome [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; in the infants, adiposity at age 6 months was reduced [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, utilising samples from the UPBEAT trial, we sought to (1) identify the DNA methylation changes in cord blood associated with maternal GDM, as well as relationships with fasting, and post-challenge 1-h and 2-h glucose concentrations; and (2) investigate whether a lifestyle intervention in pregnancy focussed on improving maternal glycaemic control modifies the methylation signature in the infant associated with maternal GDM or dysglycaemia.</p>

                <title>Design of the intervention study</title>
                <p>The present study used samples from the UPBEAT RCT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://isrctn.org/">isrctn.org</ext-link> 89971375). Details of the study design have been reported previously [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, UPBEAT was a multicentre (8 inner-city National Health Service (NHS) Trust Hospitals in the United Kingdom—London (3 centres), Bradford, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, and Sunderland) RCT, designed to test the effectiveness of a complex dietary and physical activity intervention in preventing GDM in women with obesity and reducing the incidence of LGA infants [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Women with underlying medical conditions and those prescribed metformin were excluded. The trial comprised 1,555 women ≥16 years of age, recruited between 2009 and 2014; all had a prepregnancy BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and a singleton pregnancy. Participants were randomised between 15<sup>+0</sup> and 18<sup>+6</sup> weeks gestation to either a lifestyle intervention (low GI diet, reduced saturated fat intake, and increased physical activity) or standard antenatal care. The primary outcomes of GDM and LGA did not differ significantly between the control and intervention arms, but there were improvements in some predefined maternal secondary outcomes in the intervention group, including reduced dietary glycaemic load, gestational weight gain, maternal sum-of-skinfold thicknesses, and increased physical activity [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], as well as an improved metabolome [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>

                <p>Clinical information was ascertained at time point 1 (15<sup>+0</sup> to 18<sup>+6</sup> weeks’ gestation). The trial protocol required an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 27<sup>+0</sup> to 28<sup>+6</sup> weeks’, but for this study, a clinically pragmatic approach was adopted with OGTTs at 23<sup>+2</sup> to 30<sup>+0</sup> weeks’ (mean 27<sup>+5</sup>) included. Diagnosis of GDM was according to International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria (fasting glucose ≥5.1 mmol/l and/or 1-h ≥10.0 mmol/l and/or 2-h ≥8.5 mmol/l in response to a 75 g oral glucose load) [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Blood was kept on ice, processed within 2 h and stored at −80°C. Women with a positive diagnosis of GDM were treated using standard protocols, with GDM treatment predicated on the severity of the hyperglycaemia, beginning with dietary advice, followed by metformin with the addition and/or replacement with insulin if control was not achieved. There were no significant differences in the number of women receiving each treatment regime in the control and intervention arms of the study.</p>

Probes with an absolute methylation range &lt;10% were removed from the dataset, leaving 387,569 probes for differential methylation analysis. In total, 14 duplicate samples were included, for which the Euclidean distance was calculated, and hierarchical clustering, using complete linkage as implemented in the “hclust” function in R, was used. This grouped duplicate pairs together. The sex of samples were predicted using the “getSex” function, and 14 samples with discrepancies in assigned and predicted sex were removed from the dataset. Data were further assessed by visualisation of methylation density plots and calculation of median absolute deviation (MAD) scores. Duplicates were removed after normalisation, but before inference, the duplicate with the lowest MAD score was removed. A total of 22 samples showed aberrant methylation densities, and MAD scores lower than −5 were removed from the analysis, while 6 samples showed aberrant grouping on a multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot, separated by infant sex, and were removed from subsequent analysis. This resulted in 557 samples that were taken forward for further analysis. ComBat was applied to remove chip effects [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the batch-corrected methylation values used for downstream analysis. Model assumptions were assessed by visual inspection of quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plots, <italic>p</italic>-value histograms, and calculation of genomic inflation factor lambda (λ) values, which was below 1.2 for all analyses. DNA methylation microarray data have been deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus under accession no. GSE141065.</p>

                <p>To adjust for differences in cellular heterogeneity, a reference-based prediction of the cell composition was carried out using the algorithm by Houseman and colleagues and the FlowSorted.CordBlood.450k package in R that utilises the reference for cord blood cell compositions estimated by Bakulski and colleagues [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Regression models using limma [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were run with methylation as the outcome variable. We used the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] to select the covariates from a list compiled from the literature. The covariates selected by DAG and included in all models were maternal age and the predicted values for B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, and nucleated red blood cell composition as continuous variables; and smoking (yes/no), ethnicity (white/African/Asian/other), parity (primi-/multiparous), and neonate sex (male/female). The analysis was controlled for multiple testing with the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR). Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the effect of baseline maternal BMI, the intervention and gestational age at OGTT on any genome-wide methylation changes observed by including these variables individually as covariates in the regression models. Methylation QTL (mQTL) analysis was carried out using the Genotype-Environment-Methylation (GEM) package in R [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>

                <p>Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were examined using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). Genes associated with a differentially methylated CpG (dmCpG) (FDR &lt; 0.1) were entered into STRING and visualised in Cytoscape. The properties of the PPI network were calculated under default parameters, and only connected nodes were retained for further analysis. Large networks were further segmented using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm in Cytoscape using default parameters. Enriched gene ontology (GO) terms were determined using the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (BiNGO) [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] to examine overrepresented GO terms. To account for the multiple CpGs per gene, <italic>methlglm</italic> from the methylGSA [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] package in R was used to investigate enriched GO terms, to compare to the STRING/BiNGO analysis.</p>

                <p>All statistical analyses were carried out in R (version 3.4.2). Missing data were handled on a case-by-case basis, using a listwise deletion strategy. The hypergeometric distribution probability test was used to test the significance of the overlap between dmCpGs associated with GDM and different measures of maternal dysglycaemia. Fisher exact tests were used to test the enrichment of dmCpGs among the different histone modifications and chromatin enhancer states. Linear models were fitted to the pyrosequencing data adjusting for the following covariates: maternal age, smoking, ethnicity, parity, neonate sex, and the predicted values for B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells, and nucleated red blood cell composition. Regression diagnositics (Q–Q plots, heteroscedasticity, and Cook’s distance and residuals) were checked for the top 5 dmCpGs in each epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis and for all pyrosequencing regressions.

Compared to those who did not develop GDM, women diagnosed with GDM (<italic>n</italic> = 159) were older, had a higher BMI, and were more likely to be multiparous. As expected, those who developed GDM had higher fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations, together with increased plasma glucose (PG) concentrations at 1-h (1-h PG) and 2-h (2-h PG) during the OGTT. Predicted cell composition of the cord blood showed that, compared to women without GDM, offspring of women who developed GDM had higher proportions of B lymphocytes and monocytes in cord blood. Comparison of the participants in this study to those without cord blood samples revealed that the mothers were on average 7 months older (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02), more likely to have GDM (29% versus 23%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), less likely to be multiparous (52% versus 59%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and had a lower ethinic diversity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>).</p>

                <p>DNA from 557 cord blood samples were interrogated for genome-wide DNA methylation levels using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Maternal GDM was associated (Benjamini–Hochberg FDR adjusted <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with altered methylation status of 242 CpG loci in cord blood (Tables <xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003229.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Table C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g002">2C</xref>), of which 7 remained significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. The top 2 dmCpGs associated with maternal GDM were cg03566881, located within the body of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 6 (<italic>LGR6</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), and cg16536918, located within 200 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) of the arginine vasopressin (<italic>AVP</italic>) gene (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In total, 72.7% of the dmCpGs showed hypermethylation in those diagnosed with GDM, with an overrepresentation of dmCpGs in the OpenSea regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Adjustment for baseline maternal BMI in these analyses led to a small increase in the number of dmCpGs associated with maternal GDM status to 282 dmCpGs (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05), with an 81.6% overlap (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−308</sup>) between the GDM-associated dmCpGs with and without adjustment for maternal BMI (Table D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Adjustment for gestational age at OGTT resulted in 288 dmCpGs (FDR &lt; 0.05) associated with GDM, with 86% of the intial 242 GDM-associated dmCpGs remaining significantly associated with GDM after gestational age adjustment.</p>

                <p>Different pathophysiological pathways are implicated in abnormal fasting and post-challenge glucose concentrations at 1 h versus 2 h; to gain insight into whether these might induce differential effects on the infants epigenome, we analysed cord blood DNA methylation with respect to continuous measures of maternal FPG, 1-h PG, and 2-h PG concentrations post-OGTT. There was 1 dmCpG associated with maternal FPG, 592 dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g002">2C</xref>), and 17 associated with 2-h PG (Tables <xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="pmed.1003229.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Tables E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>). The dmCpG associated with FPG was cg03750061, located in the body of the PDZ domain containing 8 gene (<italic>PDZD8</italic>); for 1-h PG, the top 2 dmCpGs were cg0896944, located within an intergenic region on chromosome 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">Fig 1H</xref>), and cg08960443, located within 1,500 bp of the TSS of the transmembrane protein 210 (<italic>TMEM210</italic>) gene (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>); for 2-h PG, the top 2 dmCpGs were located in the body of the proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 12 (<italic>PSMD12</italic>) gene (cg07552638) and the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (<italic>GCH1</italic>) gene (cg01899130). There was an overrepresentation of dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG in the OpenSea regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), with 102 of the 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs overlapping with the GDM-associated dmCpGs (<italic>p</italic> = 8.76 × 10<sup>−222</sup>). There was 1 dmCpG associated with both maternal GDM and FPG and 4 dmCpGs associated with both GDM and 2-h PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003229.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, Table G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Furthermore, there was significant overlap between the 1-h PG (58%), 2-h PG (82%), and FPG (100%) dmCpGs with the dmCpGs after additional adjustment of the regression models for gestational age at OGTT (Table H+I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>).</p>

In the males, 4 dmCpGs were associated with GDM and 75 dmCpGs with 1-h PG (FDR &lt; 0.05). In females, there were no dmCpGs associated with GDM, and 112 dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG (FDR &lt; 0.05). There was no overlap between the dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG in the males and females. Similarly, examining the top 250 dmCpGs associated with GDM and 1-h PG in the males and females, there was no overlap between the GDM-associated dmCpGs, and only 3/250 (1.2%) of the 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs in common between male and female infants.</p>

                <p>To investigate the functional significance of the methylation changes associated with maternal dysglycaemia, we examined the chromatin landscape surrounding the GDM and dysglycaemia-associated dmCpGs, using the ENCODE Hidden Markov Model (ChromHMM). There was a significant enrichment of GDM- and 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs overlapping active/weak enhancers, DNase hypersensitivity sites, as well as regions of H3K4me1/3, H3K79me2, H3K27, and H3K9 acetylation, with an underrepresentation in heterochromatin and quiescent inactive regions. The 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs were also enriched in regions overlapping H3K4me2, H4K20me1, and H2A.z modification, whereas 2-h PG-associated dmCpGs were enriched only at regions overlapping H3K79me2 modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s004">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

                <title>The effect of the lifestyle intervention on the methylation signature associated with maternal dysglycaemia and GDM</title>
                <p>The UPBEAT dietary and physical activity intervention did not reduce the incidence of GDM or the number of LGA infants, but improvements in maternal diet, physical activity, and a decrease in skinfold thickness and gestational weight gain [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and improved metabolome [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was observed in the mothers, while in the infants, there was a reduction in subscapsular skinfold thickness z-score at age 6 months [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we found that the intervention itself was not associated with significant changes in DNA methylation (FDR ≤ 0.05) in cord blood, but examination of the modifying effects of the intervention on the methylation signatures associated with maternal dysglycaemia showed an increase in the number of dmCpGs associated with maternal 1-h PG concentrations after adjustment for intervention compared to the unadjusted analysis (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>); 704 dmCpGs were associated with 1-h PG (Table Q in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>) in the intervention adjusted analysis compared to 592 in the unadjusted analysis (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), with a significant overlap between the dmCpGs (82%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−308</sup>). There was also a small increase in the number of dmCpGs associated with maternal GDM (Table R in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>) and 2-h PG after adjustment for intervention but no effect of adjusting for intervention in the analysis between maternal FPG and cord blood DNA methylation. The increase in number of dmCpGs associated particularly with 1-h PG levels after adjustment for intervention may imply a better model fit after adjustment, suggesting that the intervention might modify the 1-h PG-associated methylation signature in the infant. To investigate this further, the effects of maternal GDM exposure and dysglycaemia on cord blood DNA methylation were analysed in the standard care and intervention arms of the UPBEAT trial separately (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Here, we found there were marked differences in the number of dmCpGs associated with maternal GDM and dysglycaemia in the 2 arms of the trial (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), even though there were no differences in the number of women with or without GDM, or in fasting, 1-h or 2-h PG concentrations between the standard care and intervention arms (<xref rid="pmed.1003229.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). There were 160 dmCpGs (FDR ≤ 0.05) in cord blood associated with maternal 1-h PG concentrations in the standard care arm and only 2 dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG in the intervention arm; 41 dmCpGs were associated with GDM in the standard care arm but no dmCpGs associated with GDM in the intervention arm; 78 dmCpGs associated with 2-h PG in the standard care arm and 1 in the intervention arm, while for FPG, there was 1 dmCpG in the standard care arm and no dmCpGs in the intervention arm (Tables S and T in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Furthermore, comparison of the effect sizes for the 41 dmCpGs associated with GDM in the standard care and intervention arms of the study showed that for 87.8% of these CpGs, there were reductions in the effect size in the intervention arm compared to the standard care arm (Table U in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003229.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Similarly, analysis of the 160 dmCpGs associated with 1-h PG showed that the effect sizes were reduced in the intervention arm compared to the standard care arm for 77.5% of the dmCpG sites. For cg03566881(LGR6) and cg16536918 (AVP), 2 of the top hits associated with GDM, the adjusted r<sup>2</sup> in the analysis stratified by intervention showed a decrease in effect size from 0.317 to 0.240 and from 0.292 to 0.258, respectively, in the intervention arm compared to the standard care arm, with similar decreases in the 1-h PG analysis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>There is increasing evidence that maternal dysglycaemia has adverse effects on the health of the offspring, predisposing the infant to developing obesity and metabolic disease in later life [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The mechanisms by which the maternal environment may induce such long-term effects on the offspring have been suggested to involve the altered epigenetic regulation of genes [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Here, we show that maternal GDM, FPG, 1-h, and 2-h PG levels were associated with significant changes in the cord blood DNA methylome, with dmCpG loci being primarily associated with genes involved in cell signalling and transcriptional regulation. Moreover, we show that a maternal lifestyle intervention in pregnancy appeared to attenuated the GDM, 1-h, and 2-h PG-associated methylation changes in cord blood, demonstrating that the epigenetic impact of a dysglycaemic prenatal maternal environment can be modified by a maternal lifestyle intervention in pregnancy.</p>
              <p>The methylation signature associated with maternal GDM status overlapped at both the dmCpG and DMR level with the methylation changes associated with maternal FPG, 1-h and 2-h PG, the 3 definitional components of GDM. The majority of the dmCpGs associated with GDM or 1-h PG were hypermethylated and enriched among enhancers, DNaseI hypersensitive sites, and sites of K4me1/3 and K79me2—activating histone promoter-associated marks [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggesting that maternal dysglycaemia is associated with increased gene silencing at sites of active gene transcription or regulation. Moreover, as the GDM and 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs were enriched in pathways associated with cell signalling and chromatin remodelling, this may suggest dysregulation of such pathways in GDM infants. DMRs within <italic>ZMYND8</italic> and <italic>PLEKHB1</italic> were common to GDM, FPG, 1-h, and 2-h PG; <italic>ZMYND8</italic> is an epigenetic reader that provides a structural template for histone peptide recognition [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and is known to be involved in coordinating gene expression programs associated with cell proliferation, migration, and DNA repair. Interestingly, <italic>BRD2</italic>, which contained a DMR associated with both 1-h and 2-h PG, is known to interact with <italic>ZMYND8</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and was previously reported by Houde and colleagues to be associated with maternal hyperglycaemia [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. <italic>BRD2</italic> has been reported to play a major role in metabolism [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; it is highly expressed in pancreatic “beta” cells, where it inhibits “beta” cell mitosis and insulin transcription. <italic>BRD2</italic> also plays a key role in B lymphocyte cell expansion [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Interestingly, B lymphocyte cell number was increased in the cord blood of infants born to GDM mothers, but whether this is related to altered <italic>BRD2</italic> methylation in these cells requires further investigation.</p>
              <p>There were differences in the number and location of dmCpGs associated with maternal FPG, 1-h, and 2-h PG concentrations. The strongest signal was observed with maternal 1-h PG levels, with weaker signals associated with FPG and 2-h PG. This is unlikely to reflect a difference in the number of individuals with FPG, 1-h, or 2-h PG levels above the IADPSG GDM cutoffs, as in this study there were more women with a FPG ≥5.1 mmol/l than women with a 1-h PG ≥10.0 mmol/l. Rather, these differences in methylation may arise from differences in the aetiology of the dysglycaemia; higher maternal 1-h PG levels concentrations reflect impaired insulin secretion [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and our data suggest this may be a stronger driver of epigenetic change in the fetus. In the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) cohort, Lowe and colleagues also reported that maternal 1-h PG levels, but not maternal FPG levels, were positively associated with the child’s FPG, 1-h, and 2-h PG levels at age 10 years, and negatively associated with their disposition index [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As children with low disposition index are most likely to progress to T2D [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], this suggests the importance of maternal 1-h PG levels as a long-term risk factor and is consistent with the more pronounced epigenetic changes seen in the infant at birth associated with this measure of maternal dysglycaemia.</p>
              <p>The neonatal methylation signature associated with maternal GDM/dysglycaemia differed between the sexes. A growing literature suggests sexual dimorphism in the association between maternal GDM and childhood outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], with a report from the OBEGEST cohort showing that exposure to GDM is a risk factor for childhood overweight in boys but not in girls [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Here, we found marked differences in the cord blood DNA methylation patterns associated with maternal GDM/dysglycaemia between male and female infants. Follow-up studies to investigate sex differences in the anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of the older children are therefore indicated, together with further studies to determine whether the dysglycaemia-associated dmCpGs in males and female infants are associated with specific metabolic characteristics of the children.</p>
              <p>The lifestyle intervention did not induce significant changes in the cord blood methylome but appeared to be associated with marked attenuation of the methylation signature linked to maternal GDM, 1-h, and 2-h PG concentrations. This may reflect recommendations for decreased consumption of high GI foods in the intervention arm, leading to lower glycaemic excursions in those individuals metabolically susceptible to high early postprandial glucose concentrations; although not influencing the OGTT result, over the time frame of the intervention the low GI diet may be sufficient to lessen the impact on the offspring’s methylome. Some human studies and experiments in animal models have suggested that the epigenome is most susceptible to environmental factors during the periconceptional period [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For example, in the Dutch Hunger Winter cohort, offspring DNA methylation changes were only observed in those exposed to famine during the periconceptional period rather than during the second or third trimester [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, the fact that the UPBEAT lifestyle intervention appeared to attenuate the dysglceamia associated methylation signature in cord blood suggests that there is a plasticity in the cord blood methylome in the later stages of pregnancy, and targeting interventions at the second trimester of pregnancy may have beneficial effects on offspring outcomes.</p>
              <p>DNA methylation can be influenced by the genotype of the individual, with sequence variation at specific loci resulting in different patterns of DNA methylation [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. These sites are called methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) and contribute to interindividual differences in DNA methylation and differential response to environmental factors. Here, we found that 11% of the 1-h PG-associated CpGs were influenced by genotype; of these, the majority were <italic>trans-</italic>meQTLs rather than <italic>cis-</italic>meQTLs. Whether the SNPs affecting these <italic>trans</italic>-meQTLs represent sequence variations within genes associated with the methylation machinery or in regions spatially linked to the dmCpGs is unknown. Given that the majority of 1-h PG-associated dmCpGs were located within intergenic regions and linked to enhancer regions, an understanding of the spatial 3D relationship between the meQTLs and associated SNPs may provide novel insights into the regulation of these dmCpGs.</p>
              <p>There are several strengths to this study. Firstly, this is the largest study to date where DNA methylation changes have been examined with respect to maternal GDM exposure in obese women, a high-risk group, and all pregnancies with available cord blood were included rather than a case control design. Previous genome-wide studies investigating methylation changes associated with GDM exposure have also identified GDM-associated dmCpGs; Finer and colleagues identified 1,485 dmCpGs associated with GDM (adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value ≤0.05) in the cord blood of infants from mothers with GDM (<italic>n</italic> = 25) or without (<italic>n</italic> = 21) [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hjort and colleagues compared DNA methylation in 9- to 16-year-old children born to mothers with (<italic>n</italic> = 93) or without (<italic>n</italic> = 95) GDM, identifying 76 GDM-associated dmCpGs [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While there was no overlap between the dmCpGs identified in this study with those reported by Hjort and colleagues, phosphofructokinase (<italic>PFKP</italic>) and pre-mRNA-splicing factor (<italic>SYF1</italic>) associated with GDM in this study were also identified by Finer and colleagues [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The lack of major overlap between the GDM-associated dmCpGs among the different studies is likely to reflect the different GDM diagnostic criteria used, age at analysis, ethnicity, and/or the inclusion of different confounders. Many previous reports did not take account of the confounding influence of maternal prepregnancy BMI and/or found that the signal associated with maternal GDM was largely attenuated by inclusion of maternal BMI. Here, all women had a prepregnancy BMI of over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, lessening the chance of a confounding effect of BMI, and in a sensitivity analysis, we further adjusted for any potential confounding effect of obesity. More recently, a meta-analysis of 7 pregnancy cohorts [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (3,677 mother–newborn pairs with 317 GDM cases) identified 2 DMRs associated with GDM within OR2L13 and CYP2E1. There was no overlap with the DMRs identified in this study; however, the GDM diagnostic criteria was different, and we have studied the GDM-associated signal within a high-risk population of women with obesity rather than across the spectrum of BMI, which may account for the greater number of dmCpGs and DMRs associated with GDM diagnosis in this study. Furthermore, we have, for the first time in a GDM study, used the updated Illumina 850K array, which has increased coverage over important regulatory regions and shown that DNA methylation changes associated with GDM and dysglycaemia are enriched among these regions.</p>
              <p>There were some limitations to this study. The first was that we compared DNA methylation patterns in cord blood of infants, and the functional significance of such changes are unclear; methylation changes in blood cells could reflect alterations in immune function and/or chronic low grade inflammation which is strongly linked to increased adiposity and insulin resistance. Secondly, the methylation changes observed were modest and the functional significance of these changes is unknown. This is a common finding in epigenetic studies investigating the impact of maternal GDM exposure or other early life environmental factors [<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003229.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As DNA methylation is essentially binary with each CpG site being either 0% or 100% methylated, a small change in CpG methylation observed across a tissue will reflect a change in DNA methylation in a small fraction of cells within the tissue. Depending upon the location of the CpG site, this may affect the level of gene transcription with consequences for cell function. Since DNA methylation changes are heritable, such changes may be perpetuated during subsequent cell division, leading to persistent changes in function/metabolic capacity that could alter susceptibility to disease. However, no RNA was available from the samples to determine whether the methylation changes observed were accompanied by a corresponding variation in gene expression. Nevertheless, the DNA methylation changes reported in this study may prove useful as indices of early life glycaemic exposure. Thirdly, as uncontrolled glucose homeostasis during pregnancy can result in poor pregnancy outcomes, the majority of the women diagnosed with GDM were treated, with the treatment regime predicated on the severity/aetiology of the glycaemia; GDM treatment generally began with dietary advice, followed by metformin with the addition of/replacement with insulin if control was not achieved. Because of the strong collinearity between treatment modality and severity of hyperglycaemia, we cannot exclude treatment as a potential confounder. However, similar numbers of women with GDM in each arm of the trial received treatment through dietary advice, insulin only, metformin only, or a combination of metformin plus insulin, supporting the conclusion that the lifestyle intervention led to attenuation of the infant methylation signal. Finally, generalisability cannot be assumed, and future studies should address the optimum gestational window for intervention and reproducibility in lean pregnant women with GDM. In future, we will examine the associations of these methylation patterns at birth with metabolic function and anthropometric measures of the children at the 3-year follow-up visit, recently completed, and as the children grow to maturity.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In summary, we found that maternal pregnancy GDM and dysglycaemia led to changes in cord blood DNA methylation, and GDM/dysglycaemia-associated dmCpGs are sensitive to a maternal nutritional and physical activity intervention in the second trimester of pregnancy in women with obesity. The data imply that second trimester lifestyle interventions to improve metabolic health could influence the next generation through persistent influences on the epigenome. In future, we will assess whether the attenuated methylation signature is associated with improved child health outcomes particularly with respect to 25- to 28-week FPG, 1-h, and 2-h PG levels.</p>

              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from the editors:</p>
              <p>Please revise your title according to PLOS Medicine's style. Your title must be nondeclarative and not a question. It should begin with main concept if possible. "Effect of" should be used only if causality can be inferred, i.e., for an RCT. Please place the study design ("A randomized controlled trial," "A retrospective study," "A modelling study," etc.) in the subtitle (ie, after a colon).</p>
              <p>Abstract </p>
              <p>* Please include the study design, population and setting, number of participants, years during which the study took place, length of follow up, and main outcome measures.</p>
              <p>* Please quantify the main results (with 95% CIs and p values). </p>
              <p>* Please include the important dependent variables that are adjusted for in the analyses. </p>
              <p>* In the last sentence of the Abstract Methods and Findings section, please describe the main limitation(s) of the study's methodology.</p>
              <p>Abstract Conclusions:</p>
              <p>* Please address the study implications without overreaching what can be concluded from the data; the phrase "In this study, we observed ..." may be useful.</p>
              <p>* Please interpret the study based on the results presented in the abstract, emphasizing what is new without overstating your conclusions.</p>
              <p>Author summary</p>
              <p>At this stage, we ask that you include a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract. Please see our author guidelines for more information: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link></p>
              <p>References should be placed within square brackets please and bibliography should be in Vancouver style </p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>Please mention where the original trial took place </p>
              <p>Did your study have a prospective protocol or analysis plan? Please state this (either way) early in the Methods section.</p>
              <p>a) If a prospective analysis plan (from your funding proposal, IRB or other ethics committee submission, study protocol, or other planning document written before analyzing the data) was used in designing the study, please include the relevant prospectively written document with your revised manuscript as a Supporting Information file to be published alongside your study, and cite it in the Methods section. A legend for this file should be included at the end of your manuscript. </p>
              <p>b) If no such document exists, please make sure that the Methods section transparently describes when analyses were planned, and when/why any data-driven changes to analyses took place. </p>
              <p>c) In either case, changes in the analysis-- including those made in response to peer review comments-- should be identified as such in the Methods section of the paper, with rationale.</p>
              <p>Discussion</p>
              <p>Lines 428-432 need to be toned down. Please add “to our knowledge” to avoid assertions of primacy. In addition, since this study can be strictly described as “observational” I would avoid the use of causal language. </p>
              <p>Please ensure that the study is reported according to the STROBE guideline, and include the completed checklist as Supporting Information. When completing the checklist, please use section and paragraph numbers, rather than page numbers. Please add the following statement, or similar, to the Methods: "This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (S1 Checklist)."</p>
              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript capitalises on samples and date generated from women who participated in UPBEAT (a) to address the relationship between maternal glycaemia and cord blood DNA methylation patterns and (b) to examine the ability of a lifestyle intervention (diet and physical activity) to modify these associations. The study has several strengths (including the large numbers, validation of the array data and consideration of heterogeneity) but I have several comments that the authors should consider:</p>
              <p>1. The women included in the current study represent about a third of those in the total UPBEAT study. How did the characteristics of the subset differ from the whole cohort and on what basis were they selected (or what determined if a buffy coat from cord blood was collected)?</p>
              <p>2. It is mentioned that fetal sex was included in the regression models. However given that there is accumulating evidence for the importance of sex difference in the field, it is surprising that sex specific effects are neither investigated or discussed. </p>
              <p>3. It is a strength that validation of the array data by pyrosequencing was included. What were the % validation rates observed?</p>
              <p>4. Was any threshold for methylation differences incorporated in the analysis? Some differences look to be very small - discussion of the potential biological relevance of difference is important.</p>
              <p>5. How many of the loci as being identified as being differentially methylated relate to genes that are expressed in cord blood cells? Given the relatively late nature of the intervention, many of its effects on methylation are likely to be tissue specific, therefore discussion of potential functional relevance is important.</p>
              <p>6. Line 471- the statement that high 1 hour glucose reflects impaired insulin secretion needs a reference.</p>
              <p>7. Line 547 - the term widespread is probably not appropriate - it is actually a small percentage of loci affected</p>
              <p>8. Table 1 - glucose and insulin measurements are probably not accurate to two decimal places.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thanks for the opportunity to review your manuscript. My role is as a statistical reviewer, so I have concentrated my review around the data and analysis (and the presentation of these). I should declare that I do not have bioinformatics expertise and I recommend that someone with expertise in this area review the manuscript. I have included general comments and queries to begin with, followed by questions that are more specific.</p>
              <p>This study is a secondary analysis of data from a randomised control trial comparing usual care with a diet and physical activity intervention in pregnant women with a BMI &gt;30. The main study found that the intervention was successful in improving diet and physical activity, but there were no differences detected in the primary outcomes of GD development and LGA infants. In this secondary study the authors have examined whether DNA methylation levels from infants were associated with maternal GD status (and other continuous glycaemic measures) </p>
              <p>This is an interesting study and there are some improvements I think could be made to the current manuscript. As PLOS Medicine has a general audience, it would be helpful for an explanation of the key outcomes (i.e. the measurements of methylation) to be included so that the importance of this work is obvious to someone without extensive experience in genomics.</p>
              <p>Was a protocol or analysis plan created for this secondary study? If this were available, it would be helpful in reviewing.</p>
              <p>How was missing data accounted for in the analysis? The rates of missingness are not extremely high, but there are key measurements (fasting insulin, HBA1c etc.) with a reasonable level of missing data and my impression from a look at the tables is that this may depend on GD diagnosis. Was a complete-case analysis used or a listwise deletion strategy? </p>
              <p>L193. 'Hierarchical clustering' is vague, what exact algorithm and metrics were used for this analysis?</p>
              <p>L214. What form did the covariates take in the regression model (continuous, polynomial, or as dummy variables)?</p>
              <p>How were assumptions (linearity, heteroscedacity, distribution of residuals) checked?</p>
              <p>L218. More details are needed about the sensitivity analysis - how exactly were these conducted? Are these sub-group analyses or a type of moderation/mediation model?</p>
              <p>L218. FDR is a much more utilised concept for controlling for multiplicity in genomic analysis as opposed to clinical/epidemiology where we are much more used to familywise methods. I do not think the application of the B-H method here is inappropriate but it does achieve power at the cost of higher Type I rates. Is FDR generally accepted as appropriately for looking at how patient level measurements are associated with levels of methylation?</p>
              <p>L253/Figure S1. Fisher's exact test can be used where all the margins of the tables are fixed, which I don't think is the case with this data. There are alternatives e.g. Barnard's test for when 1 or more margins aren't fixed.</p>
              <p>L355. Is there are way to present point estimates/effect size measures from these linear models in addition to just the p-values? I</p>
              <p>Table 1. The summary information here is useful but I don't think that the p-values are useful, given that a null hypothesis of no difference isn't realistic given the groups are stratified according to GDM diagnosis. I would just remove the p-values. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The current study investigated the impacts of maternal GDM and continuous glucose levels on cord blood DNA methylation and additionally examined how lifestyle interventions that improve maternal glycemic control influence these relationships. Major strengths of the study include the design, sample size, and the acquisition of genetic data, which allowed the authors to evaluate how genetic variation influences their findings. However, there are also some important limitations. In particular, I do not believe that the statistical analyses performed were appropriate for testing the authors' hypothesis that the lifestyle treatments modify the impacts of GDM/glucose on cord blood methylation. Several key references were also missing from the Introduction and Discussion. I also have concerns about the methods used to conduct the pathway analyses. Some additional minor concerns are also described in more detail below.</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Line 73: There is a typo in the first sentence of the Introduction</p>
              <p>Lines 95-96: Although most studies on GDM/glucose and methylation have been small, the PACE consortium recently published a meta-analysis on GDM and cord blood methylation, which merits some brief discussion in the Introduction (PMID: 31601636).</p>
              <p>Lines 96-98: This statement is not true: "all have focussed on GDM versus no GDM, rather than the continuous relationship between maternal glucose levels and DNA methylation". Some previous studies have evaluated maternal glucose continuously in relation to offspring methylation (e.g., see PMID: 29752424 and 22396200). There is also a typo in this sentence.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Lines 188-189: "CpGs known to cross-hybridise to other locations in the genome (n=14,759), coinciding with SNPs (n=77,261)". Please cite the appropriate supporting reference here.</p>
              <p>Lines 214-218: Please provide some detail about how covariates were selected</p>
              <p>Were results similar after additional adjustment for gestational age at OGTT? This needs to be addressed.</p>
              <p>Network analyses: Do these analyses account for the fact that some genes are overrepresented on the EPIC array? There are software and methods available that account for this that may be more appropriate </p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p>Were any of the CpGs still statistically significant after applying the more conservative Bonferroni correction? This is worth reporting.</p>
              <p>Did the DMRs identified using DMRcate overlap with the differentially methylated CpGs identified using the traditional EWAS single CpG approach? Or were there notable differences? It would be interesting to see more details on this.</p>
              <p>Lines 389-391: "The increase in number of dmCpGs associated particularly with 1h-PG levels after adjustment for intervention suggested that the intervention might attenuate the 1h-PG associated methylation signature in the infant". This rationale isn't clear to me. Wouldn't you expect to see fewer differentially methylated CpGs after adjusting for treatment? Also, if effect modification is of interest, the main comparison should be the results stratified by treatment arm (i.e., Table 2). However, rather than conducting an EWAS for these stratified analyses, it would make more sense to identify CpGs that are significantly differentially methylated by glucose level in the control group and then compare the magnitudes of the effect estimates for these same loci in the intervention arms. </p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>Lines 421-422 "There is increasing evidence that maternal dysglycemia has adverse effects on the health of the offspring, predisposing the infant to developing obesity and metabolic disease in later life." Please provide supporting references for this statement.</p>
              <p>Lines 461-462 "higher maternal 1h-PG levels concentrations reflect impaired insulin secretion". Please provide supporting references for this statement.</p>
              <p>Additional limitations: </p>
              <p>Please be explicit about the lack of gene expression data</p>
              <p>Please address generalizability as a limitation</p>
              <p>Please address the lack of follow-up data on methylation in childhood as a limitation (or a potential future direction)</p>
              <p>Lines 519-521: "More recently, a meta-analysis of seven pregnancy cohorts (3,677 mother-newborn pairs with 317 GDM cases) identified 2 DMRs associated with GDM within OR2L13 and CYP2E1". The citation for this study is missing.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Lillycrop,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Maternal dysglycaemia, changes in the infant’s epigenome and amelioration by a diet and physical activity intervention in pregnancy:  secondary analysis of a randomised control trial" (PMEDICINE-D-20-00268R2) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and the academic editor and it was also seen again by reviewers. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>

              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>. </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Aug 21 2020 11:59PM. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>["... amelioration by a diet ... intervention" in the title is bit too declarative. Please revise to "Maternal dysglycaemia, changes in the infant’s epigenome modified with a diet and physical activity intervention in pregnancy: secondary analysis of a randomised control trial. </p>
              <p>Overall: can you please change all instances of “obese” to “with obesity”. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the text of the abstract (we suggest around line 77) to note that further research will be needed to investigate possible medical implications of the findings. </p>
              <p>Please provide brief participant demographics in the methods and findings section</p>
              <p>Please provide exact FRD values in all instances, unless below 0.001</p>
              <p>Line 639- do you mean to say lower glycemic excursions? Please revise as needed</p>
              <p>Please add a space between text and reference brackets throughout </p>
              <p>“652 DNA Methylation can be influenced by the genotype of the individual, with sequence variation 653 at specific loci resulting in different patterns of DNA methylation[72]. These sites are called 654 methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) and contribute to inter individual differences in 655 DNA methylation and differential response to environmental factors” perhaps this information should be provided in the Introduction?</p>
              <p>Line 721- you may wish to revise to “In future, we will examine the associations …” and the same in line 731 </p>
              <p>The main manuscript doesn’t need information about funding or competing interests as these are provided in the article meta-data</p>
              <p>At line 108 and several other points in the paper, you state that "methylation changes ... were reduced by ... the intervention". Although such language is appropriate in reporting the main outcomes of appropriately powered RCTs, here we note that the observations were not primary outcomes of the study, and dropouts may also influence the findings. Therefore, we ask you to adopt more cautious language at all relevant instances in the paper, e.g., "methylation changes ... appeared to be reduced ...".</p>
              <p>We note that no significant effects were reported on the UPBEAT trial's two primary outcomes - please amend the text around line 159 to indicate this. </p>
              <p>Please make that "strengthening" at line 192.</p>
              <p>Please correct the typo(s) at line 308. </p>
              <p>At line 309, please note any changes made to the analysis plan after the study had begun. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the text around line 726 to "led to changes" and so on.</p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: No additional comments - my original comments have all been addressed.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thanks for the revised manuscript and detailed responses to my original queries. The additional text in the discussion was helpful for me to understand the methylation measurements. The additions to the methods section have clarified all of my original queries and I think these changes have made the analysis easier to understand as well. </p>
              <p>I agree the using an alternative to Fisher's may not make much difference here, and given that a conservative bias especially problematic with these measurement (i.e. these are not safety outcomes from a RCT) so this does not need any further changes. </p>
              <p>Table S2 is a helpful addition along with the text in the discussion. I still wasn't clear what would have made a patient more likely to have a buffy coat sample taken. i.e. is this linked to provision of certain clinical procedures, or were buffy-coat samples only taken at particular sites or at certain phases of the study?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The authors have done an excellent job addressing my previous concerns. I believe the manuscript is now suitable for publication.</p>
