                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a programme of individually prescribed physical exercise, education and self-management activities. PR is recommended in international guidelines for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other chronic respiratory diseases. PR is still under-recognised in tuberculosis (TB) guidelines and PR is not available in many low and middle-income countries and for people with post-TB lung disease (PTBLD). The main aims of the study are to adapt and define a culturally appropriate PR programme in Kyrgyzstan for people living with PTBLD and to test, in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), the effectiveness of PR in improving exercise capacity for people living with PTBLD.</p>

              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease and a major cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It typically affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) and approximately a quarter of people globally are at risk of developing TB.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Every year, approximately 10 million people worldwide develop TB,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> of which 500 000 are multidrug-resistant cases.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pulmonary TB remains an important cause of chronic respiratory impairment in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) and globally. Kyrgyzstan is classified as lower middle income country, is situated in Central Asia and has a higher respiratory mortality compared with Europe, with a TB incidence of 100:100 000.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
                <p>The presence of long-term respiratory sequelae following pulmonary TB treatment is well established.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> The persistence of abnormal airway physiology,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> specifically fixed airways obstruction after treatment, has been documented in large population-based cross-sectional studies. The consequence of suffering from pulmonary TB is termed post-TB lung disease (PTBLD). PTBLD negatively impacts people’s quality of life, with exercise intolerance, respiratory symptoms and abnormal lung function.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> PTBLD also poses a significant economic burden to individuals and societies, not only attributable to direct costs of drugs and hospital stay but also indirect costs such as missed workdays or lower productivity. The burden of PTBLD alongside the economic conditions in LMIC such as Kyrgyzstan aggravates the situation of patients, leading to disability and early mortality.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
                <p>Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a programme of individually prescribed physical exercise, education and self-management activities. PR is recommended in international guidelines for managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung diseases<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but is still under-recognised in TB guidelines and in LMIC.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> With the established benefits of PR for people living with chronic respiratory diseases, many high-income countries have integrated PR services within routine healthcare services. Delivery of PR is encouraged in LMIC where there is profound need,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> where there is emerging evidence that it is feasible to deliver PR in low-resource settings,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> including for people living with PTBLD<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> for whom post-treatment support for health and well-being is needed.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Indeed, PR is typically delivered by a multidisciplinary team, which has been advocated for people living with PTBLD in order to account for psychosocial and economical challenges.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Western models of PR may not be optimal in LMIC and there is a need to implement PR interventions tailored to the local culture, traditions, geography, population and healthcare systems. To date, despite the potential to improve patient outcomes in PTBLD, there has been no formal fully powered trial of PR for people living with PTBLD in LMIC. It is important for PR to be appealing to patients and to ensure that it is delivered in a manner sensitive to local contexts. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to adapt a conventional model of PR to Kyrgyzstan and PTBLD contexts and test its effectiveness in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
                <p>The trial is comprised of: stage 1: adaptations to PR informed by patients living with PTBLD and healthcare professionals (HCPs) who would refer to PR; stage 2a: fully powered RCT; and stage 2b: qualitative evaluation of PR. The objectives of this study are to:</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>After receiving a research fact sheet, patients eligible for the study will be asked if they would like to participate after they have had the opportunity to ask questions. If they wish to take part, they will be asked to provide written informed consent (Appendix A). Reasons for declining the study will be taken as field notes. If they wish to participate, they will be asked to provide written informed consent. Reasons for declining to participate will be reflected in the field notes. The staff of the family medicine centres, doctors of the City Tuberculosis Hospital, the City Tuberculosis Dispensary, the National Hospital, District Hospitals and the National Centre of Cardiology and Internal Medicine will screen patients for eligibility and refer interested patients to the PR study team. Interested patients will be screened by the study team to confirm interest in participation and to schedule the baseline visit. After providing written informed consent, participants will undergo a baseline assessment at the NCCIM by a specially trained team of researchers and residents. After the baseline measures are complete, participants will be randomised into one of two groups: PR or usual care control. At 6-week postbaseline and 12-week postbaseline, patients will undergo follow-up assessments. If participants are not able to attend follow-up assessments in person, questionnaires only will be completed via telephone appointment. Experiences of the patients living with PTBLD and PR deliverers will be explored in interviews and focus groups. Participants who drop out of the trial will be asked to take part in an interview and information provided freely by the participants will be collected as field notes. All outcome measures will be performed at 6 and 12 weeks by dedicated staff who are blinded to group allocations. Control participants will be offered PR at the end of the study (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>The PTBLD PR programme will be held two times weekly for a period of 6 weeks. Each session will last approximately 2 hours, consisting of exercise and health education (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>). The PR programme recruitment will be rolling rather than fixed groups, with a maximum capacity of five patients per session (due to pandemic) and supervised by a nurse, doctor, researcher or physiotherapist. The equipment used will be simple and based on local availability. It will be based on the core elements of an evidence-based rehabilitation, including exercises and health education, but we will be adapting the detail and delivery based on the qualitative work in Stage 1.</p>

Patients will be asked to do one session of strength training and to walk every day at home in addition to structured classes. Minimal equipment will be used where possible, such as bottles filled with water, to achieve the desired weight in kilograms and to offer insight into how participants can exercise effectively at home during and after finishing PR. Aerobic exercise will include walking and static cycling. Walking will be individually prescribed at a speed equivalent to 85% maximal oxygen capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>) peak derived from the ISWT.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Walking will be monitored and target duration increased by the instructor as the programme progresses. The content delivered within the education sessions will be based on existing materials, with refinement from stage 1 of this trial and will be delivered by an interdisciplinary team.</p>

                <p>Randomisation will occur through a web-based service Sealed Envelope and conducted in a designated room by a dedicated member of the research team. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to either PR or usual care. A dedicated member of the research team will inform the assessors of group allocations via telephone. Participants will be informed at the end of their baseline visit to arrange their first PR class.</p>

                <p>Outcome measures taken at baseline, post-PR and follow-up will be taken by a researcher blinded to group allocation. It is not possible to blind participants to treatment due to the nature of a PR intervention. Research staff will be blinded to outcome measures. Participants will be advised not to reveal their group during the follow-up assessments. Episodes of un-blinding will be documented and reported for both time points.</p>

                  <p>All interview and focus group discussions will be audio-recorded, expected to last on average 20–40 min and will be conducted by a trained interviewer. Recordings will be transcribed verbatim, with identifiable information removed. Consent will be obtained from participants prior to their involvement. PR deliverers will be invited to participate in in-depth interviews at the end of the study to discuss aspects of PR, such as insights into barriers to attendance, logistical barriers of running a PR programme and their views of patients’ experiences of the intervention.</p>

This will be in the form of a PR log book accessible to participants before, during and after sessions as well as a dedicated evaluation form (Appendix B).

Each participant will receive standardised instructions to: ‘Walk at a steady pace, aiming to turn around when you hear the signal. You should continue to walk until you feel that you are unable to maintain the required speed without becoming unduly breathless’. To account for any learning effect, a practice ISWT will be performed and the greatest distance walked from either test will be taken forward. The test will be terminated when either: (1) the patient indicates that they are unable to continue, (2) the operator determines that the patient is not fit to continue or (3) the operator assesses that the patient was unable to sustain the speed and cover the distance to the cone prior to the beep sounding.</p>

                <p>For stages 1 and 2b, qualitative data will be transcribed verbatim in Russian and translated into English for triangulation with UK-based researchers. Transcripts will be analysed using thematic analysis; following the six distinct stages of familiarisation with data; generating initial codes; searching for themes; reviewing themes; defining and naming themes and producing the report.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34 35</xref> The qualitative lead will carry out initial coding and a sample of the transcripts will be coded independently by a second researcher to improve consistency and interpretive authenticity. The team will meet regularly to review emerging themes, with close attention to interactions within the interview and focus group data.</p>
                <p>For stage 2a, quantitative analysis will be conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Data will be reported as mean (SD), median (IQR) or frequency (%) as appropriate. All randomised patients will be included in an intention to treat analysis with the primary efficacy analysis based on both per protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations, with missing data imputed. For the primary analysis, the differences in the primary outcome of walking distance on the ISWT will be estimated using mixed models (unadjusted and adjusted for covariates if there are differences between groups at baseline). There will be no formal interim analysis of the data.</p>

                <p>We know from conversations with adults living with PTBLD that support after completing TB treatment is lacking and that these individuals continue to live with a reduced quality of life, including respiratory symptoms and social isolation. It is clear that these individuals would benefit from support to better manage their condition, which is what this project seeks to deliver. The PR intervention and trial are to be informed directly from people living with PTBLD and healthcare workers in Kyrgyzstan. The results of this work will be presented to patients and the public at dedicated dissemination events, including those hosted at the NCCIM, Bishkek and surrounding TB Hospitals.</p>
