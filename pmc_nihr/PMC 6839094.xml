                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Approximately 425 million people globally have diabetes, with ~ 90% of these having Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This is a condition that leads to a poor quality of life and increased risk of serious health complications. Structured self-management education (SSME) has been shown to be effective in improving glycaemic control and patient related outcome measures and to be cost-effective. However, despite the demonstrated benefits, attendance at SSME remains low. An intervention has been developed to embed SSME called the ‘Embedding Package’. The intervention aims to address barriers and enhance enablers to uptake of SSME at patient, healthcare professional and organisational levels. It comprises a marketing strategy, user friendly and effective referral pathways, new roles to champion SSME and a toolkit of resources.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A mixed methods study incorporating a wait-list cluster randomised trial and ethnographic study, including 66 UK general practices, will be conducted with two intervention start times (at 0 and 9 months), each followed by an active delivery phase. At 18 months, the intervention will cease to be actively delivered and a 12 month observational follow-up phase will begin. The intervention, the Embedding Package, aims to increase SSME uptake and subsequent improvements in health outcomes, through a clear marketing strategy, user friendly and effective referral pathways, a local clinical champion and an ‘Embedder’ and a toolkit of resources for patients, healthcare professionals and other key stakeholders.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary aim is, through increasing uptake to and attendance at SSME, to reduce HbA1c in people with T2DM compared with usual care. Secondary objectives include: assessing whether there is an increase in referral to and uptake of SSME and improvements in biomedical and psychosocial outcomes; an assessment of the sustainability of the Embedding Package; contextualising the process of implementation, sustainability of change and the ‘fit’ of the Embedding Package; and an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the Embedding Package.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">Diabetes affects approximately 425 million people globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with approximately 3.8 million in the United Kingdom (UK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a figure that continues to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is estimated that by 2035, diabetes will account for 17% of National Health Service (NHS) expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Around 90% of people with diabetes have Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], a serious, progressive, chronic disease, which leads to poor quality of life and increased prevalence of costly long term health complications. Despite advances in pharmacological interventions, management of T2DM remains a challenge.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Structured self-management education (SSME) for T2DM has been shown to be both beneficial and cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Programmes such as DESMOND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], X-PERT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the Diabetes Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], have shown SSME to be associated with improved biomedical (e.g. HbA1c, lipids, weight, blood pressure), psychosocial (e.g. depression, quality of life, hypoglycaemia rates), behavioural, and medical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis found that SSME on averaged reduced HbA1c by over 0.4%, with the greatest benefits seen in those with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c &gt; 7.0%), aged less than 65 years and non-white participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Powerfully, another systematic review combining data from 42 trials, found a 26% reduced risk of all cause morality in those who had attended diabetes SSME compared to standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">Unfortunately, despite the increase in the quality and quantity of the evidence base since the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) first recommended SSME programmes and made SSME for T2DM a national priority in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], rates of uptake to SSME for those with T2DM have remained persistently low. The recent addition of a Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) indicator for referral to SSME in those with newly diagnosed T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has improved the rate at which education is offered to people with newly diagnosed T2DM, with 74.5% of those with newly diagnosed diabetes (type 2 and other) being offered SSME within 12 months of diagnosis in 2016 as opposed to 47.4% in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, referral does not equate to uptake; moreover, many of these programmes may not be evidence based or meet the NICE criteria. The most recent national figures (2016) show that only 8.3% of T2DM patients were recorded as having attended SSME within 12 months of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par27">Evidence suggests that poor participation is due to multiple patient, healthcare professional (HCP) and organisational factors. At the level of HCPs, barriers include: insufficient investment, insufficiently trained educators, lack of staff capacity, absence of public health marketing for diabetes awareness, lack of integration into patient pathways, poor IT systems for tracking the patient, absence of an infrastructure for organisation-wide education, HCPs not advocating or recognising the positive outcomes of self-management education, the misperception that education is expensive, and lack of consideration of patient access issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A review conducted in 2017 highlighted a number of commonly reported patient barriers to access SSME, which included: issues with timing and length of courses; access/transportation issues; family/work commitments; lack of information and the benefits of attending not being communicated by the HCP; patients feeling happy with the information they had already been provided with (and so seeing SSME attendance as unnecessary) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">An intervention titled the ‘Embedding Package’ has been developed in order to increase uptake to SSME by people with T2DM in primary care, with the overall intention of improving glycaemic control. The Embedding Package was designed to address barriers and enhance enablers to uptake at patient, HCP, and organisation levels, including SSME providers and commissioning bodies. This package has been piloted and refined in a feasibility study (Davies et al. Increasing uptake of self-management education programmes for type 2 diabetes in a multi-ethnic primary care setting: A feasibility study. 2019. In preparation). The mixed methods study outlined in this protocol is designed to assess the effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and sustainability of this Embedding Package in comparison with usual care using a wait-list cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design with an integrated ethnographic study.</p>

                <title>Summary of study design</title>
                <p id="Par35">This 30 month open-label trial is testing a complex intervention, the Embedding Package, compared to usual care (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for World Health Organization Trial Registration Data Set). The intervention is complex with elements delivered at multiple levels (practice, provider and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)). The study has been designed in line with best practice guidelines to seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of whether and how the intervention works, as well as providing cost data to inform its potential roll-out in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Accordingly, the study comprises an 18 month wait-list cluster RCT, similar to a stepped wedge design but with a single step during the study, to ascertain the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, followed by a 12 month observation to ascertain whether changes are maintained after study support is withdrawn. This is a mixed methods project and to better understand and evaluate the process of implementation, ethnographic work will run alongside the trial.

                  <p id="Par36">Baseline data have been collected at month 0. Practices will be randomised 1:1 to 1) the immediate group who receive the Embedding Package from months 0 to 18, or 2) the wait-list group who provide usual care for months 0–9 and receive the Embedding Package for months 9 to 18 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Since data are collected from each step, each practice acts as its own control (immediate group uses the baseline data as its control, the wait-list group uses data collected between 0 and 9 months). To limit potential contamination, for the aspects of the intervention that are targeted at CCG/locality/provider level (e.g. social marketing initiatives), we will request that as far as possible, these are first targeted at practices participating in the Embedding Package, and only aimed at wait-list practices when these have crossed over to receive the intervention.

                  <p id="Par38">The integrated ethnographic study is designed to provide comprehensive data on the process of implementation and the fit of the intervention. Qualitative data will be gathered from observations and semi-structured interviews. The following will be undertaken:

All biomedical patient level outcomes will be extracted from primary care electronic medical records. For most of these outcomes, the last measurement within that time period will be used. For example, for the first step HbA1c will be defined as the last HbA1c measurement between months 0 and 9.

                  <p id="Par47">The secondary biomedical measures to be extracted from primary care at the patient level are: Body Mass Index (BMI); weight; total, Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; glucose, blood pressure and lipid lowering medications; smoking status; hospital admissions; cardiovascular risk score.</p>
                  <p id="Par48">Process outcomes will reflect how the intervention is implemented and aid understanding of effectiveness. They will be measured at the patient, practice, or provider level as appropriate, and will include the following: whether or not the patient was referred to and attended SSME (main secondary outcome); type of SSME; percentage of eligible individuals referred to education; percentage of eligible individuals who attended education; percentage of eligible individuals who declined education; number, timing and venue of available education sessions; number of trained educators.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">Secondary psychosocial and process outcomes will also be self-reported by a subset of patients at a single time-point during the first step so that psychosocial outcomes can be compared between those in the intervention and control arms (it is estimated around 2000 questionnaires will be returned). This data will be collected by questionnaire; all participants will be sent a short questionnaire they can further opt to complete an additional questionnaire. The self-reported outcomes from the short questionnaire are: whether or not the patient was referred to and attended SSME; and where the patient has previously received diabetes information from. Those completing the additional questionnaire will provide data on patient activation measure; well-being (W-BQ12); Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) score.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment</title>
                  <p id="Par51">Before patients were contacted CCGs and their associated SSME providers were approached regarding the study. They needed to support the study by implementing the aspects of the Embedding Package that are aimed at providers and commissioners themselves. Participating providers will contribute data on activities relating to the Embedding Package for use in the cost-effectiveness analysis, on the availability of education sessions and on the number of educators. In CCGs where the provider declined participation, Embedders will work solely and directly with the practices.</p>
                  <p id="Par52">Eligible practices within these localities were recruited. Practices with an interest in taking part will contact the research team to discuss their possible participation. Patient-level data will be extracted from participating practices computer systems. Cost-effectiveness data will be collected through the recording of Embedding Package activity. All patients diagnosed with T2DM at the start of each step (including those diagnosed during the step), registered at the practice, and meeting the eligibility criteria will have their pseudonymised data extracted for the outcome measures and will be invited to complete a consent form to link extracted data with self-reported information.</p>
                  <p id="Par53">Sampling to the integrated ethnographic study will be purposive, and based on practice characteristics (location, type of setting - rural, suburban or urban, practice size and socio-economic factors), provider characteristics (structured education programme) and CCG characteristics (sustainability and transformation plans) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Adoption of this selection criteria will enable the identification of a varied sample of practices with a view to developing an in-depth explanation of the extent of success of implementing the Embedding Package at different levels and in different settings, and inform how to optimise implementation of the package (and similar initiatives) in different contexts. In the first step, this will be informed by demographic profile and discussions with the trial co-ordinators, and will aim to generate a maximum variation sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Sampling during the second step will be theoretically informed by mid-term progress data to explore the challenges involved in implementing and sustaining the Embedding Package in a variety of circumstances. Data will also be collected from organisations associated with the delivery of the Embedding Package in these practices, including CCGs, providers, NHS England regional offices, area teams, and commissioning support units. Practices and associated organisations sampled in the first step will continue to be included in data collection in the second step.</p>
                  <p id="Par54">A sub-sample of practices and all of the participating providers will also provide more detailed information on the costs of the individual activities through interviews with a designated staff member (such as the SSME service manager).</p>

Practices can extract their own data, pseudonymise it and then transfer it electronically to the study team at the University of Leicester, or this can be done remotely by PRIMIS. Data extraction will be performed using MIQUEST software. The only key identifier to be extracted will be NHS numbers which will be encrypted into a unique hash (#) code by an Open-Pseudonymiser and CHART software and stored in a spreadsheet containing only pseudonymised data.

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p id="Par75">The Embedding Package underwent development based on a range of qualitative and experiential work, as well as piloting in an earlier feasibility (Davies et al. Increasing uptake of self-management education programmes for type 2 diabetes in a multi-ethnic primary care setting: A feasibility study. 2019. In preparation). It comprises four key components: 1. clear marketing strategy for SSME; 2. user friendly and effective referral pathways; 3. new/amended roles including a local clinical champion and an ‘Embedder’; 4. toolkit of resources (for patients, HCPs and other key stakeholders). The toolkit contains a wide selection of patient-facing resources (e.g. promotional posters, invitation letters and self-referral forms), HCP-oriented resources and guidance (e.g. document templates, guidance for recruiting staff, referring patients and increasing staff engagement) and coordination/provider/commissioner-oriented resources (e.g. audit collection and reporting, electronic administration and referral systems, and sample referral pathways). It will also include guidance on constructing and carrying out marketing and communication strategies, how to carry out local needs assessments, as well as detail about how to ensure patient accessibility and course tailoring. The new/amended roles will include the appointment of an ‘Embedder’ working across each site (or potentially up skilling of an individual already holding an analogous post) who will liaise between all relevant stakeholders to promote SSME, use of the Toolkit, communication and referrals etc. A local clinical champion in each CCG (for example the Diabetes Lead at one of the participating practices) will be identified to promote SSME across the whole locality. Together the two roles and the online Toolkit make up the ‘Embedding Package’ (the intervention).</p>
                <p id="Par76">Patients will also be able to access online versions of SSME as a complement to attendance at the group-based version as some patients may prefer education delivered via a different modality. In order to track the use of this, practice-specific log-ins will be generated that participating practices can give to patients. There will be posters in participating practices to make patients aware of this option.</p>
                <p id="Par77">To allow for any changes to the landscape of the NHS during the project, whilst maintaining the integrity of the study, any changes to the Embedding Package will only be made at Month 9, i.e. when the wait-list group begin receiving the intervention, so that the Embedding Package received during any one time period is consistent. The details of the Embedding Package that is actually delivered in each time period will be recorded and considered in secondary analyses, as appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par78">On commencement of the study in a CCG, the Embedder will hold a Toolkit Action Plan meeting to look at which elements of the Toolkit can be implemented. This will then be written up and circulated for finalisation including assigning of tasks to relevant personnel. Review meetings will be scheduled to look at progress. Actions relating to practices will then be disseminated by the ‘Embedder’ to the relevant staff within each practice, and additional meetings arranged, if necessary.</p>

                <title>Control</title>
                <p id="Par79">Usual care will be practice-dependent; therefore, each practice will continue to provide their usual activities related to SSME whilst in the control period. These activities vary greatly between CCGs and their associated practices, and due to the ever-changing landscape of the NHS, usual care may evolve over time. However, usual care will be monitored and recorded within all practices.</p>

Practices will be randomised prior to baseline (month 0) in a 1:1 fashion to either: Immediate group (receive the Embedding Package for months 0–18), or wait-list group (provide usual care for months 0–9 then receive the Embedding Package for months 9–18). Randomisation will be stratified by CCG, and generated and implemented by a statistician. The statistician will provide the study team with the randomisation outcome so that they can inform practices of their allocation.</p>

                  <p id="Par81">Data from the RCT will be analysed once data collection is complete. Descriptive summary statistics of baseline characteristics and process variables (e.g. number of education sessions available, back end data for the Toolkit and MyDesmond websites, usual care delivery, etc.) will be produced, using mean (standard deviation) for normally-distributed variables, median (interquartile range) for non-normally distributed variables, and count (percentage) for categorical variables.</p>
                  <p id="Par82">The primary analysis will compare HbA1c between the control and intervention states using a mixed model that allows for repeated longitudinal outcomes and practice-level clustering, and is adjusted for season to deal with expected seasonal variation in HbA1c. The primary analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, i.e. all eligible patients will be included. Missing outcome data will need to be imputed for the ITT analyses. This will be done using an appropriate multiple imputation method; it is anticipated that predictive mean matching will be used to impute continuous outcomes as this is able to handle non-linearity and non-normality, and logistic regression will be used for binary outcomes. Predictive variables are likely to include practice level demographics, e.g. sex, ethnic group, or baseline HbA1c. Sensitivity analyses will repeat the primary analyses using complete cases and per protocol populations.</p>
                  <p id="Par83">As secondary analyses, the ITT model from the primary analysis will be fitted for the following subgroups of interest: (1) including only patients who attended education; (2) excluding patients with HbA1c &lt; 6.5% at baseline; (3) by baseline education attendance status; (4) by patient ethnicity and age to examine the effectiveness of the Embedding Package in groups in which there is low SSME uptake; (5) by type/format of programme offered/attended.</p>
                  <p id="Par84">Secondary patient-level and practice-level outcomes will be compared in a similar manner to the primary analyses, except that practice-level outcomes will not be adjusted for cluster and the psychosocial outcomes will not account for repeated measures as they will only be measured once.</p>

                  <title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par89">The general framework for the analysis is to describe the costs and effects of current levels of implementation using published estimates of the cost-effectiveness of patient education programmes, then estimate the incremental costs and benefits of increased implementation. These incremental costs and benefits will be a combination of the costs of the implementation activities, the associated increase in uptake and the cost effectiveness of the patient education programmes. This framework has been applied to implementation of QOF indicators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and is currently being developed further by the Department of Health Policy Research Unit for the Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions (EEPRU).</p>
                  <p id="Par90">The cost-effectiveness analysis will take an NHS perspective and model costs and effects over the lifetime of patients (with appropriate discounting). The costs of implementation activities will be generated from within the RCT. The Embedders will record all activity and the uptake of individual embedding activities in each provider will be recorded through an activity proforma, whilst unit costs for each activity will be generated via interviews in all providers across a sample of practices. The resources identified in each interview will be costed using either budget information from the practices/CCGs or external unit costs (e.g. Unit Costs of Health and Social Care). All other costs relating to diabetes care will be generated by the Sheffield T2DM policy model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] which will have its data sources updated through literature review and identification of the most recent unit costs.</p>
                  <p id="Par91">The effects of the implementation activities will be measured in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using the Sheffield T2DM policy model. The model will generate the QALYs via changes in HbA1c associated with SSME. Changes in HbA1c will be estimated in two ways. The primary analysis will be based on individual patient data from this RCT (as described above), whilst a secondary analysis will use published estimates of the effectiveness of SSME generated from a meta-analysis of RCT data. The central estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the Embedding Package will be presented, together with probabilistic estimates of cost-effectiveness represented in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Value of information analysis will be undertaken using the Sheffield Accelerated Value of Information tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Deterministic sensitivity analysis will also be undertaken to explore the effects of uncertainties that cannot be adequately represented probabilistically; for example, the length of effect of the package, uptake rate without the package, and the mix of alternative education programmes to which patients are referred. Methods and results will be reported in line with Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

Increasing uptake of self-management education programmes for type 2 diabetes in a multi-ethnic primary care setting: A feasibility study. 2019. In preparation). Recruiting 58 practices (29 to each randomisation point) will give over 90% power to detect a difference in HbA1c of 0.1% assuming an SD of 1.5%, based on United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There will be 80% power to detect a difference as small as 0.062%. This assumes an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, one baseline HbA1c measurement with one more HbA1c measurement at each randomisation point. This calculation does not take account of potential variation in cluster size, as methodological work has shown that the power of studies of a stepped wedge type design is robust to variation in cluster size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The sensitivity of this calculation to changes in the average cluster size was assessed. As long as the average cluster size remains larger than 174 there will be 80% power to detect a 0.1% difference. To allow for potential cluster drop out of 10% the target will be to recruit 66 practices in total.</p>

In consultation with PPI groups, we will take direction for prioritising methods of sharing key findings through popular media, through public information networks, and web-based technology. Evaluation of the impact of our communications strategy will be made through analysing the number of publications covering outcomes, web page hits and other success measures.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par98">This mixed methods study will assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of the Embedding Package, an intervention which aims to improve biomedical and psychosocial outcomes of people with T2DM, through increased referral to and uptake of SSME. This study is timely. In 2017 the James Lind Alliance published the top ten research priorities in Diabetes, and the question “What is the best way to encourage people with type 2 diabetes, whoever they are and wherever they live, to self-manage their condition, and how should it be delivered?” was ranked third, highlighting the importance of this issue to patients with T2DM, carers, health-care professionals, and ethnic minority groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Given the high burden of disease and the current low levels of uptake to education, this study has the potential to have a big impact on the management of T2DM within the UK.</p>
              <p id="Par99">This trial is informed by a programme of work including development of the Embedding Package based on evidence from existing studies to identify experiential practices, procedures, strategies and plans which represent best practice. A feasibility study was then conducted which gave an opportunity to pilot the intervention and refine it based on ethnographic findings and to assess the feasibility of data collection processes. The results of the pre-trial studies are described in detail elsewhere (Davies et al. Increasing uptake of self-management education programmes for type 2 diabetes in a multi-ethnic primary care setting: A feasibility study. 2019. In preparation).</p>
              <p id="Par100">The trial not only assesses the effectiveness of the intervention but also includes an observational follow up phase. During this time no active trial input will happen, and the follow-up phase will therefore capture whether the Embedding Package can change culture and practice leading to longer term improvements. The trial is also pragmatic; all people with T2DM will be included irrespective of whether they are referred to or attend education during the study period. Therefore a small change in HbA1c is expected. In a study conducted at the patient level, a minimum difference of 0.3% in Hba1c may be clinically meaningful and lead to change in practice. Here the study is powered to detect a difference of at least 0.1%. This reflects the practice-level design of the study. Planned secondary analyses will try to elicit the effectiveness of the intervention in those referred to education during the course of the study. The study uses a wait-list design, similar to a stepped wedge design but with a single step during the study. The design is efficient as each practice acts as its own control and therefore produces a significant reduction in the sample size required compared to a standard cluster randomised trial. Given components of the intervention are delivered at the level of the CCG/providers, strategies to limit contamination of control state practices will be put in place during the first step.</p>
              <p id="Par101">If the Embedding Package is found to be both effective and cost-effective, a ‘toolkit’ to enable widespread implementation will be developed and rolled-out.</p>

              <p id="Par102">The NHS Research Ethics Committee West Midlands - Edgbaston has provided ethical approval for the conduct of this study (REC reference: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>/WM/0036). HRA Approval was issued on 05 February 2018.</p>
              <p id="Par103">All methods of consent were approved by the Ethics Committee. The Caldicott Guardian of each participating practice gave to consent to the data extraction from primary care. Return of a completed questionnaire will be taken as implied consent. Patients will also be asked to provide written consent for the research team to link their responses to the data extracted from GP practices and their record held by the local SSME Provider, if such a record exists. Additionally, consent will be taken by the researcher before to the start of the interview or the observation.</p>
              <p id="Par104">The current protocol version is Version 3; 23 April 2019. Two substantial amendments have been approved. Substantial Amendment 1 changes were based on feasibility study findings and entailed a revision of sample size, study paperwork and how data is collected. Substantial Amendment 2 involved changes to practice eligibility criteria, to clarify that ethnographic sub-study is optional and to increase study target, due to the greater than anticipated number of questionnaires being returned by patients.</p>
