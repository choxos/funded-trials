                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Older adults (aged ≥70 years) are at increased risk of severe disease and death if they develop COVID-19 and are therefore a priority for immunisation should an efficacious vaccine be developed. Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged ≥65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18–55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56–69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5–6·5 × 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18–55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA<sub>80</sub>). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses.

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged ≥56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18–55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56–69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18–55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56–69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 20 713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13 898–33 550], n=39; 56–69 years, 16 170 AU/mL [10 233–40 353], n=26; and ≥70 years 17 561 AU/mL [9705–37 796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA<sub>80</sub> at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18–55 years, 193 [IQR 113–238], n=39; 56–69 years, 144 [119–347], n=20; and ≥70 years, 161 [73–323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (&gt;99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18–55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841–2428], n=24; 56–69 years: 797 SFCs [383–1817], n=29; and ≥70 years: 977 SFCs [458–1914], n=48).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.</p>

              <p id="para10">As of Nov 13, 2020, over 52 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide, with over 1·2 million confirmed deaths.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Severe COVID-19 is more common in adults aged 70 years and older and in individuals with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> A safe and effective vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be an important tool in controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are no licensed vaccines against COVID-19, 48 potential vaccine candidates based on a variety of platforms including lipid nanoparticle mRNA, DNA, adjuvanted protein, inactivated virus particles, and non-replicating viral vectors are in clinical trials (of which 11 candidates are in phase 3 trials) and a further 164 candidates are in preclinical testing.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">The WHO global target product profile of critical characteristics for prequalification of a COVID-19 vaccine requires candidates to be targeted at the most at-risk groups, including older adults; have a favourable safety profile; provide efficacy as measured by prevention of virologically confirmed disease or transmission, or both; and to provide at least 6 months of protection for individuals at ongoing risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> On Sept 25, 2020, the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) gave interim recommendations for the national prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccines.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The following groups were provisionally prioritised: first, older adults living in residential care homes and residential care home workers; second, all adults aged 80 years or older and health-care and social-care workers; and third, all adults aged 75 years and older. However, the JCVI acknowledged that this priority ranking could change substantially if the first available vaccines were not considered safe or effective in older adults. Similar recommendations have also been made by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para30">Immunosenescence refers to the gradual deterioration and decline of the immune system brought on by ageing. Age-dependent differences in the functionality and availability of T-cell and B-cell populations are thought to have a key role in the decrease of immune response.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> There has been a drive to develop vaccines and adjuvant formulations tailored for older adults to overcome this diminished immune response after vaccination. Assessment of immune responses in older adults is therefore essential in the development of COVID-19 vaccines that could protect this susceptible population.</p>
              <p id="para40">The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors on target cells during viral entry.

                  <p id="para70">We searched PubMed for research articles published from database inception until Nov 13, 2020, with no language restrictions, using the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “vaccine”, AND “clinical trial”. We identified published clinical trial data on eight other vaccine candidates. Two recombinant viral vectored vaccines have been tested in clinical trials. A single dose adenovirus (Ad) 5 vector-based vaccine (CanSino Biological/Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, China) elicited neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses in a dose-dependent manner, but was less immunogenic in individuals older than 55 years. A heterologous prime-boost Ad5/Ad26-vectored vaccine schedule (Gamaleya Research Institute, Russia) generated neutralising antibody and cellular responses in adults younger than 60 years. Two nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine candidates using a two-dose regimen were tested in adults aged 18–55 years and 65–85 years, and generated neutralising antibodies in both age groups in a dose-dependent manner, although immunogenicity decreased with age (Pfizer/BioNTech, USA). Another mRNA vaccine (Moderna, USA) was given to adults older than 56 years. The vaccine was tolerated, with neutralising antibodies induced in a dose-dependent manner, which increased after a second dose. Neutralising antibody responses with this mRNA vaccine appeared to be similar in adults older than 56 years to those aged 18–55 years who also received the vaccine. Two inactivated viral vaccines have also shown neutralising antibody responses in a dose-dependent manner in adults aged 18–59 years (Wuhan Institute Biological Products/SinoPharm, China) or adults aged 18–59 and 60 years and older (Beijing Institute Biological products/SinoPharm, China), with the second showing lower neutralising antibody titres in older adults after two doses. Finally, a clinical trial of a nanoparticle vaccine composed of adjuvanted trimeric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoproteins (Novavax, USA) reported results of a two-dose schedule given 3 weeks apart in healthy adults younger than 60 years. This vaccine was well tolerated and induced neutralisation responses that exceeded those measured in serum samples from convalescent symptomatic patients.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">This study is the fifth published clinical trial of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 tested in an older adult population (aged 18–55 years, 56–69 years, and ≥70 years). The vaccine was safe and well tolerated, with reduced reactogenicity in older adults. Antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were induced in all age groups and were boosted and maintained at 28 days after booster vaccination, including in the 70 years and older group. Cellular immune responses were also induced in all age and dose groups, peaking at day 14 after vaccination.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para110">The populations at greatest risk of serious COVID-19 include people with coexisting health conditions and older adults. The immune correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been determined, but neutralising antibodies are thought to be associated with protection, and in a COVID-19 non-human primate challenge model, neutralising antibody responses correlated with protection. These findings have led to the use of neutralisation assays to assess immune responses in recent human COVID-19 vaccine trials. Immunisation with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 results in development of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in almost 100% of participants including older adults without severe comorbidities, with higher levels in boosted compared with non-boosted groups. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.</p>

              <p id="para120">Replication-deficient adenovirus vectors containing a pathogen-specific transgene have been used as novel vaccines because of their ability to induce strong humoral and cellular responses.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, pre-existing immunity might reduce the immunogenicity of vectors derived from human viruses; hence, use of simian adenoviruses might be preferable.

The study is being run at 20 centres in the UK (listed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix [pp 84–87]</xref>). Here we report selected results from the phase 2 component of the trial and for which participants were enrolled at two sites in the UK: the Oxford Vaccine Centre, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford (Oxford) and the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (Southampton).

                <p id="para150">Participants were enrolled into one of ten different groups. Recruitment was sequential with low-dose groups recruited first and standard-dose cohorts recruited after a protocol amendment was approved on June 5, 2020, that incorporated the new higher dose level. For the first stage of recruitment, participants aged 18–55 years were recruited to the low-dose group. Subsequently we recruited participants aged 56–69 years, and further extension to recruit those aged 70 years and older only occurred after safety review by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). A minimum of 2 weeks of safety and immunogenicity data were reviewed by the DSMB before recruitment to each successive age cohort. The 18–55 years groups received two doses of vaccine and were randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or the control vaccine. The 56–69 years and 70 years and older groups were randomly assigned to receive either one dose or two doses of vaccine and were then randomly assigned to receive the experimental vaccine or the control vaccine. The same process was repeated with recruitment and randomisation for the standard-dose cohorts after review by the DSMB. All participants underwent a screening visit in which a full medical history, targeted examination, blood test for SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and a urinary pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential were done. Volunteers who were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2 before enrolment were excluded from participating in all groups, apart from those in the 18–55 years standard-dose cohort. Additionally, all participants included in this phase 2 component of the study, apart from those in the 18–55 years low-dose group, had additional safety tests (blood tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C serology, full blood count, and kidney and liver function tests).

The trial staff administering the vaccine prepared vaccines out of sight of the participants and syringes were covered with an opaque material until ready for administration to ensure masking of participants. Participants, clinical investigators, and the laboratory team remained masked to group allocation for the duration of the study. However, trial staff administering the vaccine were unmasked.</p>

Participants were observed in the clinic for a minimum of 15 min after the vaccination procedure in case of any immediate adverse events.</p>
                <p id="para220">Participants from each group were instructed to complete a diary card to record solicited local and systemic adverse reactions for 7 days after each dose. Protocol-defined solicited local adverse events included injection-site pain, tenderness, warmth, redness, swelling, induration, and itch, and solicited systemic adverse events included malaise, muscle ache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, feverishness (ie, a self-reported feeling of having a fever), and objective fever (defined as an oral temperature of 38°C or higher). All participants were given an emergency 24-h telephone number to contact the on-call study physician as required. Serious adverse events will be recorded throughout the follow-up period of 1 year after the last dose of vaccine.</p>
                <p id="para230">Severity of adverse events was graded with the following criteria: mild (transient or mild discomfort for &lt;48 h, no interference with activity, and no medical intervention or therapy required), moderate (mild-to-moderate limitation in activity, and no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required), severe (substantial limitation in activity and medical intervention or therapy required), or potentially life-threatening (requires assessment in emergency department or admission to hospital). All participants in the 56–69 years and 70 years and older groups and participants in the 18–55 years standard-dose group had clinical and immunogenicity assessments at 0, 7, 14, and 28 days after their prime and booster vaccinations. Participants in the 18–55 years low-dose group had clinical and immunogenicity assessments at baseline, immediately before the boost dose, and at 14 and 28 days after their booster vaccination.</p>
                <p id="para240">Humoral responses at baseline and after vaccination were assessed using Meso Scale Discovery multiplexed immunoassay against spike and receptor binding domain [RBD], a standardised total IgG ELISA against trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and a live SARS-CoV-2 microneutralisation assay MNA<sub>80</sub>, which was done at Public Health England (Porton Down, UK), as described previously.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay to enumerate antigen-specific T cells.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Neutralising antibodies to the ChAdOx1 vector were measured using a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP)-reporter assay, which measures the reciprocal of the serum dilution required to reduce in-vitro expression of vector-expressed SEAP by 50%, 24 h after transduction.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Due to the labour-intensive nature of neutralisation assays, we prioritised analysis of samples from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 groups, randomly selecting more samples from ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 participants than control samples to be sent for blinded analysis.</p>

                <p id="para250">The coprimary outcomes of the trial are to assess efficacy as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19 and safety of the vaccine as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes include safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity profiles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in older adults (aged 56–69 years and ≥70 years), efficacy against severe and non-severe COVID-19, death, and seroconversion against non-spike proteins. A full list of secondary and tertiary outcomes is in the protocol (pp 118–24).</p>
                <p id="para260">Here we report preliminary results for selected secondary endpoints, comparing local and systemic reactogenicity and cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 between different age groups, after one or two doses and at low or standard dose.

              <p id="para320">Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to the experimental vaccine or control vaccine group: 160 participants aged 18–55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56–69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 40 assigned to MenACWY). Full details on randomisation are in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>. All participants randomly assigned to treatment were vaccinated. One participant (in the 18–55 years low-dose group) received the incorrect vaccine after randomisation and was excluded from analysis. Seven participants randomly assigned to receive two doses of vaccine chose not to continue with the boost dose and were excluded from further analyses. Three participants were excluded from immunology analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples (either incorrect participant identification numbers or incorrect timepoints noted on the label, or both; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The baseline characteristics of the participants eligible for inclusion in the analysis in each group are shown in the <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>. Participants 70 years and older were recruited from the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. All other participants were recruited at the Oxford Vaccine Centre, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford. Among the analysed population, 280 (50%) of 552 participants were female. 524 (95%) of 552 participants identified as white, and 540 (98%) were non-smokers. A large proportion of health-care workers who were predominantly female were enrolled in the 18–55 years and 56–69 years age groups. The median age in the 18–55 years group was 43·0 years (IQR 33·6–48·0), in the 56–69 years group was 60·0 years (57·5–63·0) and in the 70 years and older group was 73·0 years (71·0–76·0). The median age in the 70 years and older groups ranged from 73 years to 74 years across dosing groups, with the oldest participants aged 83 years.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure

              <p id="para330">The following results for local and systemic adverse reactions are all for participants who were randomly assigned to receive two doses of vaccine. Injection-site pain and tenderness were the most common solicited local adverse reactions and occurred most frequently in the first 48 h after vaccination (data for standard-dose regimen shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>; data for the low-dose groups and control groups are shown in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix [pp 7, 9, 19–21]</xref>). In those aged 56 years or older, a standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, whether the prime or boost vaccination, elicited a greater number of local or systemic reactions than did MenACWY. The difference was less clear with the low-dose vaccine in the 56–69 years and 70 years and older groups, and the number of participants in the control groups was small (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 30</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para410">Our findings show that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was safe and well tolerated with a lower reactogenicity profile in older adults than in younger adults. Immunogenicity was similar across age groups after a boost vaccination. If these responses correlate with protection in humans, these findings are encouraging because older individuals are at disproportionate risk of severe COVID-19 and so any vaccine adopted for use against SARS-CoV-2 must be effective in older adults.</p>
              <p id="para420">Most of the reported local and systemic adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, in line with our previous phase 1 study of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> and previously reported studies of ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Fewer adverse events were reported after the boost vaccination than after the prime vaccination and reactogenicity reduced with increasing age. The lower dose of vaccine was less reactogenic than the standard dose of vaccine across all age groups.</p>
              <p id="para430">The serious adverse events observed during the trial in these study groups were judged to be unrelated to the study vaccines and occurred at frequencies expected for these conditions in the general population. None of the participants included in this report had any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. In the phase 3 component of the trial, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions occurred in other groups, and will be reported in detail in a subsequent publication. We carefully monitored suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions and other adverse events to ensure that no pattern of unexplained illnesses emerged that could indicate a safety concern. Independent assessments have led to the recommendation that the trial is safe to continue.</p>
              <p id="para440">The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine induced a specific antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and RBD at 28 days after a single dose across all age groups, including adults aged 70 years and older. A clear effect of a boost vaccination on antibody titres at day 56 was seen that was unrelated to dose regimen or age group. Similar patterns were observed with neutralising antibody responses, with no difference in the magnitude of the response at day 28 after the prime vaccine regardless of age or vaccine dose, but a booster effect was observed in individuals who received a second dose of vaccine.</p>
              <p id="para450">Other clinical trials have also assessed safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults. An adenovirus 5 vector-based vaccine also had reduced reactogenicity in adults aged 55 years and older compared with adults aged 18–54 years after a single dose of vaccine, although immunogenicity was concurrently reduced in this older age group.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> A two-dose mRNA vaccine has also been shown to be immunogenic in adults older than 56 years with dose-dependent immune responses and similar neutralising antibody titres and cellular immune responses to younger adults.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Another two-dose mRNA vaccine has shown immunogenicity in older adults, but absolute neutralising antibody responses in adults aged 65–85 years were lower than in those aged 18–55 years.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> By contrast with our observations, in both these studies, reactogenicity was more common after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. A two-dose inactivated virus vaccine has also shown lower absolute neutralising antibody titres in adults aged 60 years and older than in adults aged 18–59 years, but reactogenicity was not formally compared between the first and second doses in this study.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">T-cell responses are important in controlling disease in natural infection<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and therefore generation of a robust cellular immune response is a desirable attribute for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we found that spike-specific T-cell responses measured with ELISpot peaked at 14 days after the prime vaccination, consistent with previous studies of simian adenovirus-vectored vaccines,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and were similar in all groups regardless of age and vaccine dose. Spike protein T-cell responses measured with ELISpot have also been reported in studies with other adenovirus-vectored vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> including in adults older than 55 years.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Theoretical concerns about vaccine-enhanced disease have led to a view that a type 1 T-helper (Th1)-biased CD4 response is a preferred coronavirus vaccine characteristic.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> An adjuvanted nanoparticle vaccine has been shown to induce spike-specific CD4 T-cell cytokine responses with a predominantly Th1 profile,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> as has an mRNA vaccine in small numbers of adults aged 56–70 years and 71 years and older.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> More detailed investigations of antigen-specific T-cell responses in our study participants are ongoing.</p>
              <p id="para470">The robust humoral and cellular immune responses obtained in our older adult population were encouraging given that a number of studies have shown that decreasing immune function with age leads to decreased immune responses to vaccines. This fact holds true for vaccines such as for influenza, for which pre-existing immune memory exists,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and vaccines that induce primary immune responses, such as hepatitis B.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Other adenovirus-vector platforms against SARS-CoV-2 have either shown reduced immunogenicity in an older age group<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> (although this study was of a single-dose regimen and so not directly comparable with our prime-boost regimen) or have not yet been tested in an older population.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para480">However, our results are consistent with previous studies of adenovirus-vector-based vaccines against respiratory pathogens that evoke humoral and T-cell responses in older adults, including a human adenovirus-vectored respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and a simian adenovirus-vectored RSV vaccine.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Our results with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 are also consistent with those of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against influenza that showed good immunogenicity in adults older than 50 years.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">Notably, the anti-spike antibody responses in our study increased after a boost vaccination at an interval of 1 month but the neutralising anti-vector antibody responses did not. There was also no difference in anti-vector immunity by age. We observed a small negative correlation between anti-vector antibody titres and anti-spike total IgG, but not T-cell ELISpot responses. Further work is needed to investigate if homologous boosting with adenovirus-vectored vaccines can be done without loss of immunogenicity to the pathogen-specific transgene.</p>
              <p id="para500">In the absence of a clear serological correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies have focused on measuring neutralising antibodies because these have been shown to confer protection from challenge in animal models.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Live virus neutralisation assays are labour intensive and can only be done in specialist laboratories under category 3 biological safety conditions. We found here that anti-spike IgG levels correlate with neutralising antibody titres for all age groups. This finding suggests that, should neutralising antibodies be shown to be protective in humans, routine serological assays could be used for the standardised evaluation of functional antibody by vaccine candidates in clinical trials.</p>
              <p id="para510">A limitation of this study is its single-blind design. However, all laboratory analyses and clinical assessments reported in this manuscript were done in a blinded fashion. A further limitation is possible variation of severity of local reactions due to the difference in injection volumes between different batches of vaccine in the low-dose group. Ongoing studies in larger groups will investigate the reactogenicity of a booster dose in more detail. Finally, the selection of participants aged 70 years and older, with a median age of 73–74 years between dose groups and with few comorbidities, might not be representative of the general older population, including those living in residential care settings or older than 80 years. Early phase studies in older adults require healthy volunteers to be enrolled for safety assessments, and recruitment to the study occurred during a period of national lockdown when more susceptible individuals were advised by Public Health England to self-isolate. Therefore, we excluded volunteers with substantial comorbidities or clinical frailty. Larger studies are now underway to assess immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy in older adults with a wider range of comorbidities.</p>
              <p id="para520">Ultimately, licensure of a vaccine relies on the demonstration of efficacy in preventing COVID-19 and safety. Phase 3 studies with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 are ongoing in the UK, Brazil, and the USA to assess vaccine efficacy and safety. Here we found similar safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in older adults compared with younger adults, which could support the use of this vaccine in this older age group, if it is shown to be protective in phase 3 trials.</p>
