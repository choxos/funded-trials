                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for about 100,000 maternal deaths every year, most of which occur in low- and middle-income countries. Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin blood clots. TXA decreases blood loss in surgery and reduces death due to bleeding after trauma. When given within 3 h of birth, TXA reduces deaths due to bleeding in women with PPH. However, for many women, treatment of PPH is too late to prevent death. Over one third of pregnant women in the world are anaemic and many are severely anaemic. These women have an increased risk of PPH and suffer more severe outcomes if PPH occurs. There is an urgent need to identify a safe and effective way to reduce postpartum bleeding in anaemic women.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The WOMAN-2 trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to quantify the effects of TXA on postpartum bleeding in women with moderate or severe anaemia. Ten thousand women with moderate or severe anaemia who have given birth vaginally will be randomised to receive 1â€‰g of TXA or matching placebo by intravenous injection immediately (within 15â€‰min) after the umbilical cord is cut or clamped. The primary outcome is the proportion of women with a clinical diagnosis of primary PPH. The cause of PPH will be described. Data on maternal health and wellbeing, maternal blood loss and its consequences, and other health outcomes will be collected as secondary outcomes. The main analyses will be on an â€˜intention-to-treatâ€™ basis, irrespective of whether the allocated treatment was received. Results will be presented as appropriate effect estimates with a measure of precision (95% confidence intervals). Subgroup analyses will be based on the severity of anaemia (moderate versus severe) and type of labour (induced or augmented versus spontaneous). A study with 10,000 patients will have over 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction from 10 to 7.5% in PPH. The trial will be conducted in hospitals in Africa and Asia.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par51">Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. PPH follows 6 to 10% of all births and accounts for around 100,000 maternal deaths every year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Ninety-nine percent of deaths are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many women who survive experience severe morbidity. Some women need surgery to control the bleeding (e.g. exploratory laparotomy, uterine artery ligation, brace sutures) and many require a hysterectomy, thus removing the possibility of having more children. Severe morbidity due to PPH interferes with breastfeeding and bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PPH is a frightening experience and some women develop post-traumatic stress disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par52">Many women with PPH are given a blood transfusion. However, blood is a scarce and costly resource in LMICs and access to safe blood is limited. The blood donation rate in Africa is 5 per 1000 population compared to 47 per 1000 population in the USA and it is estimated that 35 of the 40 sub-Saharan countries collect less than half of the donor blood required to meet their population needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even when blood is available, because of problems with screening, recipients are at risk of blood-borne infections and adverse transfusion reactions are common.</p>
              <p id="Par53">Anaemia is a cause and consequence of PPH. A cohort study in Assam, India found that women with moderate or severe anaemia had a greatly increased risk of PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Women with moderate anaemia had a 50% increased risk of PPH, whereas those with severe anaemia had a tenfold increased risk. The reasons for the increased risk is unclear but some researchers think that anaemic women are more susceptible to uterine atony due to impaired oxygen transport to the uterus. Anaemic women experience worse outcomes after PPH. An international survey of 275,000 women found that severe maternal outcomes after PPH were nearly three times more common in anaemic than in non-anaemic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Even moderate bleeding can be life-threatening in anaemic women. Excessive bleeding after childbirth worsens maternal anaemia, raising the possibility of a vicious circle of bleeding and adverse outcomes. Fatigue due to anaemia limits a motherâ€™s wellbeing and her ability to care for her children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Despite efforts to prevent anaemia, many women labour with low haemoglobin (Hb) levels. Worldwide, over 32 million pregnant women are anaemic, about 800,000 of whom are severely anaemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The prevalence is highest in countries in central and West Africa as well as in South Asia where about half of pregnant woman are anaemic and it poses a severe public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is an urgent need to find an effective way to reduce postpartum bleeding in anaemic women.</p>
              <p id="Par54">Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analogue of the amino acid lysine, which inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the lysine binding sites on plasminogen. TXA reduces surgical bleeding and death due to bleeding in trauma patients. The WOMAN trial assessed the effects of TXA in 20,060 women with PPH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. TXA significantly reduced death due to bleeding with no adverse effects. When given within 3 h of birth, TXA reduced death due to bleeding by nearly one third (Relative Risk (RR)â€‰=â€‰0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91; <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.008). However, for many women, treatment is too late to prevent death from PPH. Most PPH deaths occur in the first hours after giving birth and women with anaemia are at increased risk. Whilst there have been some trials of TXA for the prevention of PPH, most have serious flaws and very few collected data on maternal wellbeing. Most of the trials are small, low-quality, single-centre studies and only one was prospectively registered. Many trials were not properly randomised and were imbalanced for key prognostic variables. Furthermore, several of the trial reports contained important errors or inconsistencies and at least two trials did not have ethics approval. There is very little reliable evidence about the effectiveness and safety of TXA for preventing postpartum bleeding, especially in high-risk anaemic women.</p>
              <p id="Par55">The WOMAN-2 trial should determine the effects of TXA in women with moderate or severe anaemia who give birth vaginally. For pregnant women, the World Health Organisation (WHO) defines moderate anaemia as Hb levels of 70â€“99â€‰g/L and severe anaemia as Hb levels lower than 70â€‰g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Women with anaemia are at increased risk of PPH and experience worse outcomes should PPH occur. By including women with moderate or severe anaemia, participating women have the potential to benefit from the trial treatment. Results from clinical trials of TXA in elective surgery show that TXA reduces blood loss by about one third irrespective of baseline blood loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In other words, TXA treatment seems to move the entire distribution of bleeding towards reduced blood loss. If this is also the case in postpartum anaemic women, then trial participants have the potential to benefit whether or not they experience PPH, since even moderate or mild blood loss can have adverse health consequences in anaemic women.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Around 10,000 women with moderate or severe anaemia giving birth in hospitals primarily in Africa and Asia will be randomly allocated to receive TXA or matching placebo after the umbilical cord is cut or clamped. Although there is no evidence of any adverse effects on the baby, by randomising women after cutting or clamping the umbilical cord, any risk associated with placental transfer of the trial treatment to the baby is removed. The umbilical cord will be cut or clamped in the usual way and the timing will not be affected by the trial. TXA passes into breast milk in very low concentrations and so an antifibrinolytic effect in the baby is highly unlikely.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>How does tranexamic acid prevent excessive blood loss?</title>
                <p id="Par57">The ability to form a blood clot depends on fibrinogen levels. In both trauma and PPH, a low serum fibrinogen is a strong predictor of life-threatening bleeding. Fibrinogen declines rapidly during bleeding due to its consumption in fibrin clot formation. However, fibrinolysis due to the activation of plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) worsens fibrinogen depletion by breaking down clots. Tissue- plasminogen-activator-mediated fibrinogenolysis also depletes fibrinogen levels. Early TXA administration has the potential to prevent excessive blood loss by interrupting the vicious circle of fibrinolysis and fibrinogen depletion. Women with anaemia are at increased risk of bleeding soon after delivery. If they can be treated with TXA before their fibrinogen levels fall, severe postpartum bleeding and its consequences may be prevented.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale for trial</title>
                <p id="Par58">For some women the treatment of PPH is too late to prevent death and severe morbidity. Despite efforts to increase the availability of antenatal care, many women are anaemic at the time of giving birth and blood for transfusion is often unavailable. There is an urgent need to reduce postpartum bleeding and its adverse impacts on mothers, especially in anaemic women in LMICs. Knowing that TXA reduces deaths due to bleeding after PPH provides reason to believe that it might also prevent PPH. However, the evidence to date is insufficient to support the prophylactic use of TXA in routine clinical practice. Most of the available trials of TXA for preventing PPH are small and unreliable, and few collect information on maternal health and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One exception is the TRAAP trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] which enrolled 4079 women who were giving birth vaginally in French hospitals. Women were randomised to receive 1â€‰g TXA or matching placebo within 2 min after delivery. Although women who received TXA were less likely to experience a blood loss of â‰¥â€‰500â€‰mL (the primary endpoint), the difference was not statistically significant (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01; <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.07). Fewer woman in the TXA group received additional uterotonics (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.75, 95% 0.61 to 0.92; <italic>P</italic>â€‰=â€‰0.006); however, there were no statistically significant differences in transfusion, change in Hb or surgical intervention. The WOMAN-2 trial should provide reliable evidence on the effects of TXA when used to prevent PPH in anaemic women in LMICs. Although there was no increase in thrombotic events with TXA in the WOMAN or TRAPP trials, the administration of TXA to all women who give birth vaginally may be inappropriate. There is an increased risk of venous thrombosis in the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and maternal anaemia is an established risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Treating all mothers would involve treating all women when only a proportion would benefit. However, in anaemic women the benefits could outweigh any harms so that a trial is justified. Inclusion in the trial will be limited to women giving birth vaginally. For women who give birth by caesarean section, especially for placenta abnormalities, the interval between cord clamping and PPH onset is short, often a matter of minutes, so the potential of TXA to prevent coagulopathy and PPH is limited.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>Safety of tranexamic acid</title>
                <p id="Par59">TXA is a widely used treatment with a good safety profile. Although on pathophysiological grounds we might expect an increased risk of thrombosis with antifibrinolytic drugs, randomised trials including over 50,000 participants show no increased risk. High doses of TXA (doses from 7.5â€‰g up to 20â€‰g) have been associated with seizures in cardiac surgery but there was no increase in seizures in the CRASH-2 or WOMAN trials, which used a 1â€“2â€‰g dose. TXA passes into breast milk in very low concentrations, approximately 100th of the concentration in maternal blood. An antifibrinolytic effect in the breast-fed infant is highly unlikely at this low concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. No adverse events (AEs) in breastfed babies were found in the WOMAN trial. Because TXA will be given after cutting or clamping the umbilical cord, there will be no risk of placental transfer to the baby. Nevertheless, we will collect data on nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, maternal thrombotic events, seizures and thromboembolic events in breastfed babies in all participants as outcomes. These outcome events will not be reported using the AE reporting procedure.</p>

                <p id="Par63">Women from hospitals where anaemia in pregnancy is common, primarily in Africa and Asia, will be enrolled. All participating hospitals will have the facilities to provide comprehensive essential obstetric care as defined by the WHO.</p>

                <title>Number of participants needed</title>
                <p id="Par64">For the purpose of the sample size calculation, a baseline risk of PPH of 10% was assumed. A trial with 10,000 women would have over 90% power (two-sided alphaâ€‰=â€‰5%) to detect a clinically important 25% reduction from 10 to 7.5% in PPH. The sample size estimate is based on two key assumptions (1) the baseline event rate and (2) the size of the treatment effect. The primary endpoint is PPH. The prevalence of PPH is estimated at 6% world-wide but 10% in Africa and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If the event rate is 10% then the trial has 99% power. However, if the event rate is lower, the study will have less power. For example if the 6% estimate applies, the trial would have just over 90% power. Planning for the possibility that the event rate may be lower than anticipated is a sensible precaution. It is also possible that the treatment effect is not as large as predicted. Although a 25% reduction would be clinically important, a more modest reduction would also be worthwhile. The additional power also reduces the chance that a more modest treatment effect will be missed. Experience from the WOMAN trial shows that loss to follow-up will be minimal (less than 1%) and will not influence trial power. The LSHTM Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) has successfully recruited large sample sizes for previous international trials and is experienced at managing recruitment at sites to ensure that target recruitment is achieved. The main anticipated risk to recruitment to the WOMAN-2 trial is political instability in the participating countries. The main resource for mitigating this risk is the large international network of obstetric clinical trialists that was established during the WOMAN trial. If political instability prevents the recruitment of patients in any of the planned settings, recruitment in other sites will be initiated, thereby reducing the risk.</p>

If women are in the active stage of labour and able to give fully informed consent, written consent will be obtained. However, many women arrive at hospital in the second stage of labour. Because these women are more likely to be anaemic and more likely to have a PPH it will be important to include these women in the trial. However, they may not have the physical or mental capacity to give fully informed consent due to the pain of labour, poor health or the urgency of the situation. In these cases, a clinician will assess the capacity of the woman and the most appropriate consent procedure will be used for her.

If no test has been done on admission to give birth, women planning to give birth vaginally will be offered a standard point-of-care Hb assessment (HemaCueÂ®). Pregnant women will be informed about the purpose of the test before it is performed and they will have the right to accept or decline in line with any clinical care being offered. The test will be provided free of charge. Information on patients screened will be recorded on a Screening Log.</p>

                  <title>Risks and benefits</title>
                  <p id="Par91">TXA reduces the risk of death due to bleeding in women with PPH. The WOMAN trial randomised 20,060 women with PPH to receive TXA or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The results show that TXA significantly reduces death due to bleeding (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.00), particularly when given within 3 h of giving birth (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). There is also evidence from randomised trials that TXA improves outcomes in traumatic and surgical bleeding. The CRASH-2 trial of TXA in 20,211 bleeding trauma patients showed that TXA reduces death due to bleeding when given soon after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Treatment within 3 h of injury reduced the risk of death due to bleeding by around 30% (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.83). In surgery, a systematic review of 129 randomised trials found that TXA reduces the probability of receiving a blood transfusion by 38% (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.62, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.68) and average blood loss by 34% (RRâ€‰=â€‰0.66, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.67) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. There was no increased risk in AEs with TXA in either the WOMAN trial, the CRASH-2 trial or the surgical systematic review.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">TXA is widely used and well tolerated.

                  <p id="Par96">There is some evidence from cohort studies in cardiac surgery patients that high doses of TXA are associated with seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The doses used in these studies (6â€“20â€‰g) were substantially higher than the dose that will be used in the WOMAN-2 trial (1â€‰g). There was no increased risk of seizures with TXA in the two large trials involving over 40,000 participants that used 1â€“2â€‰g of TXA (WOMAN and CRASH-2 trials).</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Women in the postpartum period have an increased risk of thromboembolic events compared with non-pregnant women. Although the absolute risk of venous thrombosis is low at around 2 per 1000 woman-years, women in the postpartum period are four times more likely to suffer a venous thrombosis than non-pregnant women of the same age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although on mechanistic grounds TXA has the potential to increase the risk of venous thrombosis, randomised trials provide no evidence of any increased risk of venous thrombosis with TXA. In the WOMAN trial, the risk of venous thrombosis did not differ significantly between groups (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Because severe bleeding is a strong risk factor for vascular occlusive events and TXA reduces bleeding, it is possible that TXA reduces (rather than increases) the risk of thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of tranexamic acid (TXA) on thromboembolic events in the WOMAN trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>TXA (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰10,033)</th><th>Placebo (<italic>n</italic>â€‰=â€‰9985)</th><th>RR (95% CI)</th><th><italic>P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any thromboembolic event</td><td>30 (0.3%)</td><td>34 (0.3%)</td><td>0.88 (0.54 to 1.43)</td><td>0.603</td></tr><tr><td>Venous events</td><td>20 (0.2%)</td><td>25 (0.3%)</td><td>0.80 (0.44 to 1.43)</td><td>0.446</td></tr><tr><td>DVT</td><td>3 (0.03%)</td><td>7 (0.07%)</td><td>0.43 (0.11 to 1.65)</td><td>0.203</td></tr><tr><td>PE</td><td>17 (0.2%)</td><td>20 (0.2%)</td><td>0.85 (0.44 to 1.61)</td><td>0.611</td></tr><tr><td>Arterial events</td><td>10 (0.1%)</td><td>9 (0.09%)</td><td>1.11 (0.45 to 2.72)</td><td>0.827</td></tr><tr><td>Myocardial infarction</td><td>2 (0.02%)</td><td>3 (0.03%)</td><td>0.66 (0.11 to 3.97)</td><td>0.651</td></tr><tr><td>Stroke</td><td>8 (0.08%)</td><td>6 (0.06%)</td><td>1.33 (0.46 to 3.82)</td><td>0.599</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>CI</italic> confidence interval, <italic>DVT</italic> deep vein thrombosis, <italic>PE</italic> pulmonary embolism, <italic>RR</italic> Relative Risk</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>
                  <p id="Par98">TXA is excreted in the urine unchanged with 90% of the dose excreted in the 12â€‰h after administration. Plasma concentrations are higher in renal insufficiency and with repeated dosing there is a risk of accumulation. However, because a single dose of 1â€‰g is used in the WOMAN-2 trial, there will be no risk of accumulation. Unpublished data from the manufacturer indicate that TXA passes into breast milk at a concentration of approximately 100th of the concentration in the maternal blood and thus an antifibrinolytic effect in the infant is unlikely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].

Un-blinding should occur only in those rare cases when the clinician believes that a participantâ€™s management depends importantly upon knowledge of whether the participant received TXA or placebo. If a woman in the trial develops PPH, she should receive all clinically indicated treatments. There should be no need to un-blind before initiating treatment with TXA. Even if a woman received 1â€‰g of TXA immediately after giving birth, TXA has a large therapeutic index and a second 1-g dose is well within the dosing range. In those few cases when urgent un-blinding is necessary, a 24-h telephone service is provided by the CTU. The caller will receive a voice message, text message or email informing them whether the woman received TXA or placebo. The investigator should complete an un-blinding request/report form within five working days of un-blinding. If a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is reported, un-blinding may be needed for reporting to Regulatory Agencies and Ethics Committees.</p>

                  <p id="Par198">Data on side effects that might be associated with anaemia, postpartum bleeding or TXA use will be collected and will be presented to the independent DMC. The trial involves seeking consent, giving the trial drug using a routine clinical procedure, collecting outcome information (mostly from the hospital notes), a Hb estimation, timed walk test, and a quality of life questionnaire. Prior to discharge, the womanâ€™s Hb concentration will be measured using a point-of-care test (HemaCueÂ®). This involves a pinprick blood sample and takes only a few minutes. This test will provide clinically useful information for the patient and treating physicians.</p>
                  <p id="Par199">The timed walk test assesses the womanâ€™s functional exercise capacity. The test measures the distance that a woman can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 min. A chair will be placed along the walking area so she can rest during the test if she chooses to. The results should give a good indication of the womanâ€™s ability to carry out her daily physical activities. The test is safe in patients with cardiopulmonary disease and in frail older populations. The test will not be done if there is a history of unstable angina or myocardial infarction in the past month but these conditions will be extremely rare in postpartum women. Apart from the trial drug, all other clinical care will be as per usual practice. For these reasons, the risk of harm or injury (whether physical, psychological, social or economic) from participating in the trial is assessed to be low.</p>
                  <p id="Par200">The outcome questionnaire will ask participants about their mental and physical wellbeing, and breastfeeding. It is possible that these questions may bring up feelings for participants such as discomfort, worry or sadness. Trial staff will be trained to ask the questions in a sensitive manner and to look for signs of discomfort in participants. If the trial team member detects discomfort in any participant, they will ask permission to continue. If the trial team member has any concerns about the wellbeing of the participant, they should refer her back to the treating clinician for further assessment and ongoing care.</p>

In summary, the CTU will closely monitor the trial to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of the trial participants and to ensure the accuracy of the data. All coordinating centres and site trial teams will be trained in the trial procedures and provide extensive guidance. Central monitoring methods will be used by the CTU. A sample of consent forms from all sites will be monitored at the CTU to make sure they are properly completed. In addition, data management and statistical checks of data (central statistical monitoring) will be done to ensure that trial participants meet the inclusion criteria and trial treatment is administered in line with the protocol. Event rates for primary and secondary outcomes will be monitored. Sites with higher or lower than expected event rates will be selected for further monitoring. Quantitative variables (systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate and blood loss) will be monitored to check the accuracy of the data. For example, the coefficient of variation for the data at each site will be examined and those where there is any reason for concern will be selected for further monitoring.</p>

Source data verification will be done on at least 10% of the trial data. Additionally, site self-monitoring will be carried out where needed. This will involve the PI/delegate at a site monitoring themselves against a standardised checklist. The LSHTM CTU will require investigators and their institutions to provide access to source data and all trial-related documents for monitoring, audits, Ethics Committee review and regulatory inspection. All trial-related and source documents including medical records, original consent forms and original CRFs must be kept safely. Investigators must plan in advance of the trial start where the trial-related documents will be stored and how they will be accessed. All documents must be made available when required for monitoring/audit/inspection during the course of the trial and for up for 5 years after the end of the overall trial.</p>

                  <p id="Par208">Analyses will be on an â€˜intention-to-treatâ€™ basis. Data will be analysed by randomised group, irrespective of whether the group received the intervention. Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, standard deviation, median, range, and number of observations. Categorical variables will be presented as numbers, and as percentages of those participants who had the assessment. All statistics will be presented by treatment group. Effect measures will be Relative Risk (RR) and absolute risk reduction. Precision will be quantified using 95% confidence intervals. Planned subgroup analyses include analyses based on the severity of anaemia (moderate versus severe) and type of labour (induced or augmented versus spontaneous). In a large trial, such as WOMAN-2, the baseline characteristics of participants that may influence the outcome are expected to be evenly distributed between the treatment and placebo groups, so that any difference in outcome can be attributed to the intervention. However, it is still possible that a chance imbalance in important prognostic factors could influence the results. To investigate this possibility, an analysis of the effect of treatment that is adjusted for baseline risk will be conducted. A prognostic model will be built based on pre-specified baseline variables and use it to estimate the predicted risk of the outcome at baseline. Checks will be made to ensure that there are sufficient patients in the severe anaemia subgroup by limiting recruitment to these patients if necessary. For subgroups, RRs and confidence intervals with two-sided <italic>P</italic> values will be reported. Test of homogeneity of effect across the subgroups will be done and a <italic>P</italic> value reported. Unless there is evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects the overall RR will be taken as the most reliable guide to the approximate RR in all subgroups.</p>

                  <p id="Par252">The DMC is independent from the sponsor, Ethics Committees, regulatory agencies, investigators, Steering Committee membership, clinical care of the trial participants, and any other capacity related to trial operations. The DMC has the responsibility for deciding whether, whilst randomisation is in progress, the un-blinded results (or the un-blinded results for a particular subgroup) should be revealed to the TSC. The DMC Charter states that they will do this if, and only if, two conditions are satisfied: (1) the results provide proof beyond reasonable doubt that treatment is on balance either definitely harmful or definitely favourable for all, or for a particular category of, participants in terms of the major outcome and (2) the results, if revealed, would be expected to substantially change the prescribing patterns of clinicians who are already familiar with any other trial results that exist. Exact criteria for â€˜proof beyond reasonable doubtâ€™ are not, and cannot be, specified by a purely mathematical stopping rule, but they are strongly influenced by such rules. The DMC Charter is in agreement with the Peto-Haybittle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] stopping rule whereby an interim analysis of major endpoint would generally need to involve a difference between treatment and control of at least three standard errors to justify premature disclosure. An interim subgroup analysis would, of course, have to be even more extreme to justify disclosure. This rule has the advantage that the exact number and timing of interim analyses need not be pre-specified. In summary, the stopping rules require extreme differences to justify premature disclosure and involve an appropriate combination of mathematical stopping rules and scientific judgment.</p>
