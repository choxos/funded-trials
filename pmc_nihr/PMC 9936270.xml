                  <p>Prospective, single-centre, single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled study. This study will be conducted in a single-centre, secondary care setting (National Healthcare Service Hospital) in the UK. All patients aged over 18 years undergoing vascular or general surgery with Rockwood Frailty Score of 3 or above on admission. Exclusion is inability or unwillingness to participate in trial, implanted electrical device, pregnancy and acute deep vein thrombosis. Target number of recruitment is 100. Participants will be randomly assigned to active NMES group (group A) or placebo NMES group (group B) prior to surgery. Participants will be blinded and asked to use the NMES device, 1–6 sessions daily (30 min per session) after surgery in addition to standard National Health Service rehabilitation care until discharge. The primary study outcomes are acceptability and safety of NMES assessed by the device satisfaction questionnaire on discharge and adverse events recorded during hospital stay. The secondary outcomes are the postoperative recovery and cost-effectiveness compared between two groups, assessed by various activity tests, mobility and independence measures and questionnaires.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Rehabilitation after surgery is an important component of the holistic care of patients undergoing surgical intervention. Increasing life expectancy is resulting in an ageing population with a greater number of comorbidities and reduced physiological reserve.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Older people are also more likely to suffer from sarcopenia, which impacts their ability to rehabilitate postoperatively.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This population increase in clinical frailty undergoing surgical intervention leads to a greater demand for multidisciplinary postoperative care.</p>
              <p>National Vascular Registry reported that length of stay (LOS) after elective vascular surgery is a median of 7 days, whereas emergency cases can be up to 22 days.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> National Health Service (NHS) general ward bed costs are significant, with an estimated cost of £586.59 per day,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> compounded by a considerable deficit in rehabilitation beds. Patients who have previously espoused that their primary desire postoperatively is for a rapid return home.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Current best practice for recovery after surgical intervention is intensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy based rehabilitation to return patients to a premorbid independence level.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, due to patient fatigue and resource constraints, especially outside of the working week, such rehabilitation is necessarily limited to 1–2 hours of intervention per day, Monday to Friday.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This prolongs inpatient stay, increases costs and delays return to home, which is often the most important outcome to patients. Increased frailty is thought to lead to increased duration of recovery to baseline.</p>
              <p>Neuromuscular stimulation (NMES) has been shown to be beneficial in improving symptoms in claudication and venous disease and is the subject of a multicentre National Institute for Health Research randomised study.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref> It has also been shown to be beneficial in accelerating recovery after orthopaedic surgery, stroke and intensive care stay.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref></p>
              <p>NMES uses electrical impulses to cause involuntary contraction of lower limb muscle groups. This allows for continued safe muscle training without the need for therapists. These devices often use pre-set 30 min sessions, which can be repeated up to six times a day. They have been shown to be safe in multiple situations and offer a reusable and low-cost option for adjunctive intervention.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref></p>
              <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the acceptability and safety of NMES as an adjunct for rehabilitation after vascular and general surgery and monitor the effects of NMES in postoperative recovery in terms of activity, frailty, independence and quality of life (QoL) levels.</p>

                <p>The device investigated (REVITIVE Medic, Actegy Health) is a class IIa medical device, CE marked for in treating disorders of the lower limb (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The device is used in the seated position, with the users’ bare feet placed on a pair of conductive footplate electrodes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). Electrical impulses are delivered to the muscles and nerves of the feet, which cause foot and calf muscle contraction. Direct contact between skin and electrodes is required for stimulation, precluding the use of compression stockings. Both feet have to be placed on the conductive footplates for the device to work. Although infrequent, potential side effects of NMES include skin irritation and muscle pain.</p>

                <p>The device runs a 30 min programme of NMES consisting of 15 different waveform patterns, each with varying electrical output characteristics. The intensity of stimulation ranges from 1 to 99 units, delivering a maximum current of 15 mA (r.m.s., root mean square) at 500 Ω resistance. Pulse duration will be 450–970 µs and pulse frequency will be 20–53 Hz. Stimulation intensity will be increased by the subject until visible calf muscle contraction is seen (group A). Patients will be advised to use the highest intensity that was comfortable for them. The intensity of stimulation varies for each individual and is affected by oedema and moisture. The sham device looks identical to the active device, but no effective electrical impulses are delivered to contract the muscles. Participants in group B will be asked to select intensity 25. All participants will be asked to fill in the usage diary (patient diary). The diary will be collected on the day of discharge. REVITIVE Medic was used in this study for its ease of use and commercial availability. The device manufacturer has agreed to supply the active and sham investigational devices free of charge. Patients in both active and sham groups will be allowed to keep the device at the end of their participation. Participants in the placebo group will be offered a free active device after their participation.</p>

              <p>Current postoperative rehabilitation is limited due to resource constraints. NMES is safe, low cost and can be used without supervision. When the conventional postoperative management is restricted by staff shortages, and for the patients who unable to participate in the exercise therapies, NMES may be an effective alternative. This study is to investigate the acceptability and safety of NMES as an adjunct for rehabilitation after vascular and general surgery.</p>
