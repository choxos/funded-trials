              <abstract>
                <p>A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is one of the best treatments for kidney failure. The UK’s LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients’ family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative ‘think-aloud’ interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention discussed, we identified three themes: for the Norway model: i) Overcoming communication barriers and assumptions; ii) Request from an official third party, and iii) Risk of coercion; for the home education model: i) Intragroup dynamics; ii) Avoidance of hospital, and iii) Burdens on participants; and for the transplant candidate advocates model: i) Vested interest of advocates; ii) Time commitment, and iii) Risk of misinformation. We used these results to develop a multicomponent intervention which comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. This will be evaluated in a future randomised controlled trial.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) describes a transplant in which a kidney has been donated from a living person, typically a relative or friend. It is the best treatment in terms of life-expectancy for most people with kidney failure [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The risks of donating a kidney are small [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the quality of life of donors usually returns to pre-donation levels after donation [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>The UK’s LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, including the Netherlands and the USA [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Only 20% of those listed on the UK’s kidney transplant waiting list receive a LDKT each year [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and certain groups of individuals with kidney disease appear to be less likely to receive a LDKT. Socioeconomic deprivation describes the disadvantage of an individual or group relative to others in society, as indicated by people’s education, employment, income, and assets [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the UK the most socioeconomically-deprived people with kidney disease are 60% less likely to receive a LDKT than the least deprived [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Improving equity in living-donor kidney transplantation has been highlighted as a research priority by patients and clinicians [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study we aimed to develop a multicomponent intervention to support those currently disadvantaged in accessing a LDKT and to increase LDKT numbers in the UK. This study follows our previous mixed-methods research to identify barriers to living-donor kidney transplantation, and to understand reasons for the observed socioeconomic inequity in the UK (<xref rid="pone.0253667.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

              <p>Four variables have been identified as key mediators of socioeconomic inequity (<xref rid="pone.0253667.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Patient activation describes the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Social support comprises the emotional, physical, practical, informational, and relational assistance available to a person [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; perceived social support describes what support an individual perceives is available and may not correlate with true available social support. Finally, health literacy describes an individual’s ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Socioeconomic deprivation is associated with a lack of LDKT knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], lower levels of patient activation [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], perceived low levels of social support [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and lower health literacy [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0253667.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

                <p>The four factors identified above are potential targets for intervention. An intervention to overcome the identified barriers to living-donor transplantation therefore needs to include the components outlined in <xref rid="pone.0253667.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, to address barriers directly or provide a ‘work-around’ approach to them. For example, if low levels of patient activation mean that a patient find it difficult to approach potential donors, a ‘work-around’ solution would be for a healthcare practitioner to approach potential donors on a patient’s behalf.</p>

                <title>Existing interventions</title>
                <p>We investigated the existing evidence base to identify intervention components that might overcome the identified barriers. A recent scoping review summarised strategies to increase LDKTs, and concluded that there was an important gap in the literature for evidence-based interventions [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Two potentially delivered the required components:</p>
                <sec id="sec004">
                  <title>• Home-based patient and family education [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</title>
                  <p>This was the only trialled intervention found to be effective in the scoping review [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It was developed with reference to Multisystemic Therapy theory [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and trialled amongst disadvantaged populations in the USA [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Kidney patients and invited family members are visited at home by health workers who provide them with information on kidney disease, transplantation and donation, ensure patients know a LDKT is an option for them, engage their social network, and facilitate conversations about living kidney donation. Both trials reported &gt;20% more LDKTs in the intervention versus control groups.</p>

                <sec id="sec005">

                  <p>In this intervention a friend, relative or volunteer is trained as an advocate: someone willing to speak to other friends and family about donation on the patient’s behalf. Although a small, single-centre observational evaluation of the intervention has been undertaken using a matched cohort study [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], there is currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence.</p>
                  <p>We also considered another intervention that targets the identified barriers, that is standard of care in Norway but has not been formally evaluated in an RCT:</p>

                <sec id="sec006">
                  <title>• Communication from healthcare provider to potential donors (‘the Norway model’)</title>
                  <p>In Norway, people with advanced kidney disease provide their doctor with the details of friends and family members whom they are happy for the clinical team to contact with information on the person’s need for a kidney transplant, and with information about living kidney donation [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
                  <p>We identified the above interventions as potential components of a multicomponent complex intervention.</p>
                  <p>The aim of this intervention development study was to develop and co-produce a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support individuals eligible for kidney transplantation to access a LDKT. The intervention aims to target barriers particularly experienced by socioeconomically-deprived patients, but the intervention will be offered to all transplant candidates, in keeping with the concept of ‘proportionate universalism’ [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The intended intervention will be a complex intervention, in that it combines a number of interacting components [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We aimed to investigate the views of all relevant stakeholders on possible intervention components. We aimed to understand and accommodate the perspectives of the people who will both use and deliver the intervention, in order to improve acceptability, feasibility, engagement, and ultimately outcomes. The intended outcome of this work was a developed intervention to take forward into a clinical trial.</p>

                <title>Theoretical framework</title>
                <p>We undertook intervention development using an approach that was both ‘theory and evidence based’ and ‘target population centred’ [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ‘Theory and evidence based’ approaches develop interventions by combining published research evidence and existing theories. As indicated above we identified three existing intervention components from the published literature. One intervention (Home-based patient and family education) had been developed with respect to multisystemic therapy theory and had RCT evidence of effectiveness. One intervention (TCAs) had weak evidence of effectiveness from an observational study, and one (‘the Norway model’) had not been formally evaluated in research. ‘Target population centred’ approaches develop interventions based on the views of the people who will use them, and we employed the ‘Person-Based Approach’ (PBA) to do this. The PBA [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] is a method for optimising intervention materials to ensure they are as acceptable and engaging as possible and feasible for use. Through qualitative interviews we aimed to understand how different people may view and engage with the proposed intervention components, which components seem particularly relevant or attractive to them, and which may be rejected. The PBA involves the production of ‘Guiding Principles’ consisting of two elements: i) intervention design objectives, and ii) key features of the intervention that can achieve these objectives (<xref rid="pone.0253667.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Individuals were invited to participate in a single face-to-face qualitative interview by i) post (invitation letter, patient information leaflet, a return response slip and pre-paid return envelope), ii) in person by a healthcare practitioner at a clinical appointment (e.g. in-centre haemodialysis session), and iii) through posters in outpatient clinics and haemodialysis units. Purposive sampling of patient participants was undertaken to ensure diversity in sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status using the following socioeconomic measures: patient’s education level, employment status and housing/postcode). Demographic data on socioeconomic status was collected at interview. Family members were recruited via posters in hospital outpatient areas and through ‘snowball sampling’ through participants with kidney disease. Healthcare practitioners were invited to participate by the Chief Investigator (PKB) via email. Healthcare practitioners were purposively sampled to ensure diversity in sex, age, ethnicity and clinical role. All participants were aware of living-donor kidney transplantation as a theoretical treatment option for advanced kidney disease.</p>

Some intervention components were seen as ‘of another culture’, and needed time for adoption in the UK:</p>

                  <p>The greatest perceived benefit was the involvement of a third party in approaching potential donors: patients reported that this removed feelings of selfishness and required less effort and time than a patient contacting all potential donors directly. The burden of responsibility and stress was removed by someone else asking on their behalf:</p>

                  <p>The ‘third party’ being an official recognised professional (for example a medical practitioner) or organisation was seen as being of particular importance:</p>

                    <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">Just say someone like me</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">from my background</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">where I’ve lied and cheated a lot you know what I mean … I don’t get a lot of credence for my views so from a doctor is definitely more … there’s a lot more weight behind it</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">’ (Patient/Male/40-49 years/Unemployed)</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>In addition, the use of an official, standardised letter was also seen as ‘normalising’ the need for a kidney transplant for potential recipients:</p>

                    <p>‘<italic toggle="yes">I think it’s a great idea</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">I think it puts it in the context that it isn’t just me</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it normalises i</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">t’ (Patient/Male/70-79 years/Retired)</italic>.</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The request coming from a third party was considered as allowing patients to distance themselves slightly from the request, potentially protecting a relationship and reducing any perceived direct personal pressure from the transplant candidate on a family member to donate:</p>

Concern was expressed that such investments compromised the independence and impartiality of an advocate, and created potential for the advocate to be coercive or manipulative:</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, we have developed a multicomponent complex intervention designed to improve access to living-donor kidney transplantation. The intervention comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. Intervention resources have been produced after an iterative development process. We have gained insights into which of the intervention components should be discarded, and which aspects of the intervention should be fixed or flexible in the full trial [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The intervention has thus been developed and optimised prior to evaluation in the ASK trial: improving AccesS to Kidney transplantation (ISRCTN registry reference ISRCTN10989132 <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10989132" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10989132</ext-link>). The final intervention for trial is detailed in the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in <xref rid="pone.0253667.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>.</p>
              <p>The developed intervention may undergo further refinement following evaluation in the feasibility trial [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Through a mixed-methods process evaluation we will aim to understand people’s experiences of and views on the intervention and resources at delivery in the real world, refining and adapting the intervention as necessary. We will also aim to understand how to optimise implementation and understand the influence of context on intervention delivery and effectiveness [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
              <p>The initial proposed intervention compromised components that had already been delivered and/or evaluated in other populations in the Netherlands, the USA and Norway [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We found that interventions delivered in one population may require modification before being adopted in other populations. The Transplant Candidate Advocate intervention component, previously evaluated in observational work in the USA, was not popular with participants and this component will not be part of our intervention. This finding may be because individuals in this UK population have different views to those of individuals in a USA healthcare population. However, to our knowledge, no qualitative evaluation of the Transplant Candidate Advocate intervention has been undertaken in the USA, and therefore the concerns participants raised in this study may not be population specific. This might be more likely given that the identified themes were not related to UK culture or the healthcare model (Vested interest of advocates; Time commitment; Risk of misinformation). However, some participants perceived the intervention components as belonging to another culture, and therefore not an approach that translated to the UK. Changing cultural norms was seen as possible and participants suggested time would be the biggest factor in models of care becoming established practice.</p>
              <p>The Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] describes how an individual’s behaviour (e.g. to engage in the proposed intervention, to share information on living donation with family members, to invite guests to a home education session) is influenced by normative beliefs and perception of social norms. In this study, one participant indicated that knowledge that other people were engaging in these activities (<italic toggle="yes">‘something that people just did’</italic>) may have change her own unwillingness to engage. The beliefs and attitudes of family members and friends contribute to perceived social norms. Our study findings emphasised the importance of the family on decision-making regarding donation and acceptance of a LDKT, something previously reported in numerous qualitative studies and a systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This finding highlights the importance of engaging with family members and friends even if they are unsuitable or unwilling to personally donate as they may still be influential on the decisions and actions of other potential donors and the transplant candidate, with capacity to affect the perceived social norms.</p>
              <p>‘Resource limitation’ was an identified general theme, with participants expressing concerns about the resources required to deliver the intervention. The intervention was recognised as requiring dedicated resources, including professionals specifically employed to deliver the role. The process evaluation planned to run parallel to the trial will also allow us to evaluate both the capacity of the NHS to deliver the intervention and the impact of delivery on existing NHS services. This is essential to ensure an effective intervention is not rejected because of limited NHS resources, and to ensure an intervention effective at increasing LDKTs doesn’t have a negative impact on another service. Related to appropriate allocation of limited resources was the question of whether there was evidence that the proposed intervention components were effective. No participants expressed strong beliefs that one intervention component would be effective, which suggests there is equipoise as to whether the interventions would work or not, important for recruitment to and delivery of an RCT [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition to effectiveness, given the significant required resources to deliver the intervention, cost-effectiveness information is crucial to guaranteeing healthcare funding for the intervention. A cost-effectiveness evaluation will be essential in the final full-scale trial, and information on cost-drivers will be evaluated in the feasibility trial.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>This study provides an in-depth investigation of the views of people with kidney disease, family members, and healthcare workers towards potential interventions to improve access to living-donor kidney transplantation. Talking participants through the intervention components in qualitative interviews has allowed different perspectives to emerge compared with responses to closed or more abstract questions [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Participants shared their views on both the proposed intervention components and drafted intervention resources, and the work achieved the aim of developing a multicomponent intervention and resources for delivery. Theme saturation was reached, and patient and healthcare worker participants were purposively selected for maximum diversity to capture the views of a variety of stakeholders. There are some limitations: i) Only 4 family members participated. Recruitment was limited by two main factors. Firstly, family members could be recruited by patient participants inviting their family members which may have been difficult and akin to approaching them to consider donation. Secondly, the Covid-19 pandemic meant that family members were not allowed to attend hospital appointments with patients and therefore exposure to waiting room posters about the study was limited. ii) Although participants were sampled from two NHS trusts they were from one region of the UK. Although a diverse sample was achieved, findings may not transfer to other regions or other centres in the UK. iii) Interviews were carried out by a clinician (PKB), known to most of the healthcare workers. Although participants spoke freely we are unable to determine if this altered responses. PKB was not known to any of the patient or family participants. iv) Interviews were not undertaken with individuals who did not speak English, and study resources have only been developed in English. Whilst resources could be translated we do not feel that this will be sufficient adaptation for individuals who do not speak English. This intervention has been developed to particularly address variables that mediate socioeconomic inequity and may not address barriers that explain ethnic inequity in access to living-donor transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], which differ from those being targeted here [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. If the intervention proves acceptable, feasible and effective it will require formal adaptation for non-English speaking groups. This will require adaptation beyond simple translation of language, and will require cultural adaptation, as well as specifically addressing different barriers to living-donor transplantation. Translating intervention resources without additional cultural adaptation risks inappropriately discarding an effective intervention. Such cultural adaptation is required when evaluating an intervention in any new population: as illustrated in this study, interventions used in other countries do not automatically translate to a UK population.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>Improving equity in living-donor kidney transplantation has been highlighted as a UK and international research priority by patients and clinicians [<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0253667.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Through this study we have developed a multicomponent complex intervention, incorporating components developed for other populations. We have adapted and optimised the intervention and resources for use in a UK renal population, ready for evaluation in a feasibility and later full-scale randomised controlled trial. We have demonstrated that interventions delivered in one population may not be suitable for use in other populations without adaptation.</p>

              <p>Development of an intervention to improve AccesS to living-donor Kidney transplantation (The ASK study): a UK qualitative interview study with mixed stakeholders using the Person-Based Approach</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr. Bailey,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE’s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p>
              <p>This is an important piece of work that has generated interest of the reviewers given the timely and relevant nature of the topic, i.e. interventions to address socio-economic inequity in access to LD KTx. The expert reviewers came up with substantive comments and suggestions to improve the paper, and I agree with their assessments. The MS would be better if more concise (including the title as suggested by reviewer 2) as it is indeed extensive, and please check all figures and tables (as there had been issues with them upon primary submission). There might be selection bias at various levels, highlighted by 2 reviewers. Please address all reviewers' comments in a point-by-point discussion and make revisions accordingly. Beware that this invitation for major revisions does not automatically imply acceptance of the revised paper, as it will undergo thorough peer review again. Looking forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jun 06 2021 11:59PM.

              <p>Reviewer #1: Dr Bailey presented on behalf of the research group their manuscript entitled Development of an intervention to improve AccesS to living-donor Kidney transplantation (The ASK study): a UK qualitative interview study with mixed stakeholders using the Person-Based Approach.</p>
              <p>The matter of this investigation is relevant and contemporary. This is a qualitative research. The authors give the impression they are deeply familiarized with the methodology applied. They compared three different approaches to improve living kidney donation rates, interviewing patients, relatives and health care professionals. They aimed to design an intervention to enhance the chances of socioeconomically deprived end-stage renal disease patients’ access to the kidney transplant list. They propose to apply this instrument adapted to the UK population in a future RCT.</p>
              <p>My concerns are the following:</p>
              <p>-the manuscript is very extensive, including over 25 years old references (for example ref 1-3;10). The reader may get overwhelmed with the extensive details that are not essential to the research. I suggest being more concise.</p>
              <p>-selection of participants seems biased. On page 9 is stated that the eligible population was identified by the local site primary investigators. Healthcare practitioners were contacted by e-mail based of the PI knowledge. My concern is how can be assured that these 12 patients and 4 relatives represents the variety of cases attending the two UK hospitals involved in this research. It is quite possible that introvert subjects were not selected, and other ethnic groups were underrepresented. Actually, 5 participants belong to other ethnic group, but it was not stated are they patients or healthcare providers. This is a major obstacle to the aim of enhancing socioeconomically deprived end-stage renal disease patients’ access to the kidney transplantation, and from my opinion lowers the validity of the results.</p>
              <p>-participants selection flow chart is not shown. Actually, figures were not provided.</p>
              <p>-it is not clearly exposed why 50% of the participants were healthcare professionals and 38% patients. In my understanding, patients’ and relatives’ opinion should be more extensively represented, clearly more than healthcare professionals. Patients and relatives can propose a model, and healthcare professionals evaluate feasibility.</p>
              <p>-were the 12 patients interviewed already on the transplant list, or under evaluation? Did they have previous knowledge about LD?</p>
              <p>-the think aloud technique is interesting, because it encourages proposing anything that come to the participant´s mind about a task. Would it be possible that UK patients could come with a new proposal, different from the three foreign models presented to them?</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: I have reviewed the manuscript entitled Development of an intervention to improve Access to living-donor Kidney transplantation (the ASK study): a UK qualitative interview study with mixed stakeholders using the Person-Based Approach. Due to evidence of socioeconomic inequity to live donor kidney transplant this study aims to develop a UK-specific intervention to support eligible persons to access a living kidney transplant. Three existing interventions from the literature were identified The Norwegian model, The home education model and the transplant candidate advocate model. The person-based approach was used for intervention development. Qualitative in-depth interviews were performed with persons with advanced kidney disease, their family members and transplant healthcare professionals to understand how different people view the proposed intervention components. The interviews were analysed with an inductive thematic analysis. Four general themes were identified and for each of the three intervention discussed three themes were identified. The results are illustrated with demographics of participants, a figure of the themes generated from the interviews as well as quotations in the body text to strengthen the themes. With the results a multi component intervention was developed suitable for the UK context. This intervention will be evaluated in a coming study.</p>
              <p>This is a very well written manuscript and an important subject as well as interesting. A lot of effort has been put into making this thorough and detailed qualitative study. However, as reviewer I have a few minor comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Title: It is a very long title, wouldn’t this be enough? Development of an intervention to improve Access to living-donor Kidney transplantation (the ASK study)</p>
              <p>Study population: Page 9 line 173 You wrote: People with advanced kidney disease CKD 4-5 and in this you include patients with a functioning kidney transplant? I do not agree that this is correct.</p>
              <p>Page 10 line 215: A query £20 voucher was given to the participants. Did the participants know in advanced that they would get the voucher after being interviewed? If Yes is that ethically correct? If no, please add the information in the text.</p>
              <p>Results: You have a qualitative approach however in the results you describe parts numerically e.g. page 15 line 305 and 317 (7/32) and 11/32) respectively. This continues through to page 20. Usually qualitative results are not described numerically, please change.</p>
              <p>I am also doubtful about the information given about each study participant that you quote, i.e. patient/gender/ age/education/occupational status. Is all this information needed for each quotation? I suggest you use only the first two or possibly the first three or explain why all are needed.</p>
              <p>On page 24 line 526 the sentence; Only 9/32 participants expressed positive views about the use of advocates. Again, this is a numeric way of describing the result and also valuing by saying only 9/32: Firstly it is a qualitative study and secondly I am not sure about if it is only either, 9/32 is 28 percent - close to one third of the study population. However this is not a quantitative study, please reword this sentence to a qualitative style.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Reviewer Comments:</p>
              <p>Page 3, line 69: the authors refer to “Figure 1-flow chart illustrating programme of research” but figure 1 does not seem to be part of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Page 3, line 75: reference is not provided for the definition for social support while references are provided for the other terms.</p>
              <p>Page 4, line 80: authors refer to “Figure 2-Mediators of socioeconomic inequity in living-donor kidney transplantation” but figure 2 does not seem to be part of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Page 4, lines 86-88: The following sentence about “if low levels of patient activation contribute to difficulties ...” should be reworded as it is not currently easy to comprehend.</p>
              <p>Page 6, line 139-140: The authors refer to using “a theory and evidence based approach (basinginterventions on published research evidence and existing theories”. Is the theory-based approach referring to the original theoretical frameworks/constructs that were used during the development of the three previously existing interventions (e.g., Norway model...) or is this referring to the development of the multicomponent intervention? Please clarify and elaborate on the specifics of the theoretical frameworks utilized.</p>
              <p>Page 8-9 (Study Population): Did the study interview family members that were related to people with advanced kidney disease that also participated in the interviews?</p>
              <p>Page 9, line 183-184: What does “socioeconomic status (sampled by healthcare professionals’ knowledge of patient’s education...” mean? Was socioeconomic status used for purposive sampling determined by healthcare professional’s knowledge of a patient’s educational attainment?</p>
              <p>Page 13, line 265: The authors refer to “Figure 3-thematic diagram”, figure 3 seems to be missing.</p>
              <p>Page 14, line 280: The number of participants that brought up the four general themes are presented for three sections not including perceived cultural norms. How many participants brought up perceived cultural norms?</p>
              <p>Page 15, line 312: the employment status is missing from the participant.</p>
              <p>It is recommended that the paper be proofread for typos.</p>

              <p>Response to reviewers’ comments:</p>
              <p>Formatting and data availability statement:</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: We have reformatted the manuscript so that it meets PLOS ONE’s style requirements. We have updated the Data Availability statement as follows:</p>
              <p>'This study generated qualitative data in the form of digital audio recordings and transcripts from interviews. Participants were asked to provide written consent to share their anonymised data with other researchers. Data will be shared only if consent has been provided. 29 of 32 participants provided consent for data sharing. Anonymised interview transcripts have been uploaded to the University of Bristol’s Research Data Repository: <ext-link xlink:href="https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/" ext-link-type="uri">https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/</ext-link>. Audiofiles of the recorded interviews are not suitable for sharing as they carry a high risk of allowing the research participant to be identified, and the content of interviews includes sensitive information. </p>
              <p>Individuals who wish to access the dataset can contact the researchers directly or actively search the University of Bristol’s data repository. Although the qualitative transcripts have been anonymised, as personal and sensitive issues have been discussed we cannot rule out the risk of identification, and therefore access to these transcripts is controlled. Individual researchers will need to request access to the controlled data through the University of Bristol via the Data Access Committee (DAC) for approval, before data can be shared after their host institution has signed a Data Access Agreement. The procedure for accessing data can be found here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/accessing-research-data/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/accessing-research-data/</ext-link>.'</p>

The authors give the impression they are deeply familiarized with the methodology applied. They compared three different approaches to improve living kidney donation rates, interviewing patients, relatives and health care professionals. They aimed to design an intervention to enhance the chances of socioeconomically deprived end-stage renal disease patients’ access to the kidney transplant list. They propose to apply this instrument adapted to the UK population in a future RCT.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you for taking the time to read our manuscript and for your comments. The study team indeed comprises individuals with expertise in qualitative research, intervention development, complex intervention and pragmatic RCTs.</p>
              <p>My concerns are the following:</p>
              <p>-the manuscript is very extensive, including over 25 years old references (for example ref 1-3;10). The reader may get overwhelmed with the extensive details that are not essential to the research. I suggest being more concise.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you. We have substantially edited the manuscript and removed text not essential to the research. We have also removed older references where possible.</p>
              <p>-selection of participants seems biased. On page 9 is stated that the eligible population was identified by the local site primary investigators. Healthcare practitioners were contacted by e-mail based of the PI knowledge. My concern is how can be assured that these 12 patients and 4 relatives represents the variety of cases attending the two UK hospitals involved in this research. It is quite possible that introvert subjects were not selected, and other ethnic groups were underrepresented. Actually, 5 participants belong to other ethnic group, but it was not stated are they patients or healthcare providers. This is a major obstacle to the aim of enhancing socioeconomically deprived end-stage renal disease patients’ access to the kidney transplantation, and from my opinion lowers the validity of the results.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Selection bias is a quantitative research term, not usually applicable to qualitative research theory or methodology. </p>
              <p>Sampling needs to be consistent with a study’s aims. In most quantitative studies sampling aims to achieve a population representative sample, such that findings may be generalisable to the population from which participants were sampled. In this qualitative research study, sampling was purposive, with the aim of achieving diversity in personal characteristics, experiences and perspectives. Diversity was achieved as indicated by:</p>
              <p>• Results Table 4 (page 13 clean document)– participants were recruited from different stakeholder groups, hospitals (transplant centre and non-transplanting referral centre), sexes, ages groups, ethnic groups, and differed with respect to their marital status, levels of education and employment status. By providing full details of the sample we enable readers to judge transferability to other settings and contexts.</p>
              <p>• Diverse perspectives were disclosed in interviews as indicated in the results – a simple example is that some participants expressed positive views towards different intervention components whilst others expressed concerns or negative views, but the results detail differing views from participants.</p>
              <p>• Theme saturation – an iterative approach was taken to sampling, data collection and analysis until theoretical data saturation was reached, and then sampling was stopped. </p>
              <p>The eligible population was identified by local site primary investigators as is required by NHS Research ethics (no identifiable information can be shared with researchers until a patient has provided consent). The local investigators were told who was eligible (age 18 years or older, English speaking, CKD 4 or 5, dialysis, transplant). Local site investigators (one of whom was the Chief Investigator PKB) then invited participants who were diverse in the characteristics specified in the manuscript. As interviews progressed, if we wanted to interview more women or younger people, for example, site investigators were asked to invite eligible individuals from these groups.</p>
              <p>This study aimed to develop an intervention to improve access to living-donor kidney transplantation that targets barriers experienced by socioeconomically deprived individuals. We have undertaken research to investigate ethnic inequity [References i) Wong K et al. Investigating Ethnic Disparity in Living-Donor Kidney Transplantation in the UK: Patient-Identified Reasons for Non-Donation among Family Members. J Clin Med 2020;9(11):3751, ii) Bailey PK et al. Beliefs of UK Transplant Recipients about Living Kidney Donation and Transplantation: Findings from a Multicentre Questionnaire-Based Case-Control Study. J Clin Med 2019;9(1):31]. Whilst there is evidence of some confounding with ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation the barriers that explain ethnic inequity in living-donor kidney transplantation are different to those experienced by those who are socioeconomically deprived across all ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>If this intervention proves feasible to deliver and acceptable we aim to adapt it to target barriers identified in our previous work with respect to ethnic inequity. This will require formal cultural adaptation, via interviews with individuals from target ethnic minority groups (in the UK primarily Black/African/Caribbean/Black British). The following text is included in our discussion limitations section:</p>
              <p>‘This intervention has been developed to particularly address variables that mediate socioeconomic inequity and may not address barriers that explain ethnic inequity in access to living-donor transplantation (reference in manuscript), which differ from those being targeted here(reference in manuscript). If the intervention proves acceptable, feasible and effective it will require formal adaptation for ethnic minority and non-English speaking groups. This will require adaptation beyond simple translation of language, and will require cultural adaptation, as well as specifically addressing different barriers to living-donor transplantation. Such cultural adaptation is required when evaluating an intervention in any new population: as illustrated in this study, interventions used in other countries do not automatically translate to a UK population.’ (page 32, lines 677-686, clean document).</p>
              <p>-participants selection flow chart is not shown. Actually, figures were not provided.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: There is no participant selection flow chart. Participant selection flow charts are not a feature of qualitative research as the aim is not to achieve a population representative sample. Rather, as explained above with purposive sampling we aimed to ensure diversity in participant characteristics and demographics and diversity in views and perspectives.</p>
              <p>-it is not clearly exposed why 50% of the participants were healthcare professionals and 38% patients. In my understanding, patients’ and relatives’ opinion should be more extensively represented, clearly more than healthcare professionals. Patients and relatives can propose a model, and healthcare professionals evaluate feasibility.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Following submission of our manuscript we noted a mistake in Table 4 which we have now corrected. 13 participants were patients, 4 family members and 15 healthcare professionals. Therefore 47% of participants were healthcare professionals and 53% were patients or relatives.</p>
              <p>Healthcare professionals are important stakeholders to interview as they will be required to a) deliver an intervention, b) recruit to and deliver research to evaluate the intervention, c) accommodate an intervention in existing care pathways, and d) manage the impact of a successful intervention in terms of increased LDKT assessment workload. As individuals with the capacity to facilitate or obstruct intervention delivery and evaluation, the views of healthcare practitioners are crucial to optimising an intervention before trial.</p>
              <p>The main aim of this study was not to generate new ideas for interventions. As illustrated in Figure 1, this study followed our previous mixed-methods work to identify barriers to living-donor transplantation and to identify interventions that address these barriers. We aimed to investigate stakeholder views on models identified in the literature that target the barriers identified in our previous mixed-methods work (a ‘theory and evidence based approach’ to intervention development [Reference: O'Cathain A, Croot L, Duncan E, Rousseau N, Sworn K, Turner K, et al. Guidance on how to develop complex interventions to improve health and healthcare. BMJ Open. 2019;9:e029954.). After discussing the proposed intervention components all participants were asked if they had any other suggestions or ideas (please see ‘Other suggestions: Is there another approach you think might be helpful?’ in the S1 File. Example topic guide).</p>
              <p>-were the 12 patients interviewed already on the transplant list, or under evaluation? Did they have previous knowledge about LD?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: The patient participants included people with chronic kidney disease stages 4 and 5 and those receiving kidney replacement therapy, including individuals receiving dialysis and individuals with a kidney transplant. All individuals who did not have a functioning transplant were eligible for transplantation and/or undergoing assessment for suitability. </p>
              <p>Assessment of knowledge about LD was not an aim of this study but all patient participants were aware of living donor transplants as a theoretical treatment option. To clarify this we have added a sentence to the methods: ‘All participants were aware of living-donor kidney transplantation as a theoretical treatment option for advanced kidney disease.’ (page 9, lines 181-182 clean)</p>
              <p>-the think aloud technique is interesting, because it encourages proposing anything that come to the participant´s mind about a task. Would it be possible that UK patients could come with a new proposal, different from the three foreign models presented to them?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: The think-aloud technique is a method used to gather data when evaluating products, resources or tasks. It is not a technique employed without a focus for the ‘thinking aloud’. As indicated in the methods section, in this study think-aloud interviews were used when participants were reviewing drafted intervention resources (letters to family/friends, information leaflets, animations). Therefore participants could suggest changes to the resources (which could have included not using them at all) and they could suggest alternatives to the resources they were reviewing but not new models. As indicated above participants could suggest alternative models/interventions, outside the think-aloud questions (please see ‘Other suggestions: Is there another approach you think might be helpful?’) in the S1 File. Example topic guide.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>I have reviewed the manuscript entitled Development of an intervention to improve Access to living-donor Kidney transplantation (the ASK study): a UK qualitative interview study with mixed stakeholders using the Person-Based Approach. Due to evidence of socioeconomic inequity to live donor kidney transplant this study aims to develop a UK-specific intervention to support eligible persons to access a living kidney transplant. Three existing interventions from the literature were identified The Norwegian model, The home education model and the transplant candidate advocate model. The person-based approach was used for intervention development. Qualitative in-depth interviews were performed with persons with advanced kidney disease, their family members and transplant healthcare professionals to understand how different people view the proposed intervention components. The interviews were analysed with an inductive thematic analysis. Four general themes were identified and for each of the three intervention discussed three themes were identified. The results are illustrated with demographics of participants, a figure of the themes generated from the interviews as well as quotations in the body text to strengthen the themes. With the results a multi component intervention was developed suitable for the UK context. This intervention will be evaluated in a coming study.</p>
              <p>This is a very well written manuscript and an important subject as well as interesting. A lot of effort has been put into making this thorough and detailed qualitative study. However, as reviewer I have a few minor comments and suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you for taking the time to read our manuscript and for your suggestions for how to improve the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Title: It is a very long title, wouldn’t this be enough? Development of an intervention to improve Access to living-donor Kidney transplantation (the ASK study)</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Yes, you’re quite right! We’ve edited the title as you have suggested. Thank you.</p>
              <p>Study population: Page 9 line 173 You wrote: People with advanced kidney disease CKD 4-5 and in this you include patients with a functioning kidney transplant? I do not agree that this is correct.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: We don’t include people with a functioning kidney transplant in CKD 4-5. Individuals with a functioning transplant were included as individuals receiving kidney replacement therapy. We’ve now clarified the text to read:</p>
              <p>‘People with advanced kidney disease (including i) individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease stages 4 and 5, and ii) individuals those receiving kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or a functioning kidney transplant))’. (page 9, lines 164-166., clean document).</p>
              <p>Page 10 line 215: A query £20 voucher was given to the participants. Did the participants know in advanced that they would get the voucher after being interviewed? If Yes is that ethically correct? If no, please add the information in the text.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Participants did know in advance that they would get a voucher after being interviewed. The participant information sheet stated that ‘We will refund any travel expenses. You will be given a £20 voucher to thank you for your time.’ This practice is recommended in national research guidance (e.g. from NIHR <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/payment-guidance-for-researchers-and-professionals/27392#Good_practice_for_payment_and_recognition_%E2%80%93_things_to_consider" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/payment-guidance-for-researchers-and-professionals/27392#Good_practice_for_payment_and_recognition_%E2%80%93_things_to_consider</ext-link>) to ensure patient contributors to research are not financially worse off as a result of research participation, and as a form of recognition and thanks for their time and contribution. This in part can help to achieve socioeconomic equity in research participation. This was approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee and Health Research Authority prior to the study starting. </p>
              <p>Results: You have a qualitative approach however in the results you describe parts numerically e.g. page 15 line 305 and 317 (7/32) and 11/32) respectively. This continues through to page 20. Usually qualitative results are not described numerically, please change.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: As requested we have removed the numbers.</p>
              <p>I am also doubtful about the information given about each study participant that you quote, i.e. patient/gender/ age/education/occupational status. Is all this information needed for each quotation? I suggest you use only the first two or possibly the first three or explain why all are needed.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: We have deleted the education level to reduce the information provided. We feel that the remaining information is required to provide a) evidence that the quotes are from different participants, and diverse participants, particularly with respect to socioeconomic status given the aim of this study, and b) context for some of the comments (e.g. one participant talks about not being able to take time off work to engage with a home education visit). </p>
              <p>On page 24 line 526 the sentence; Only 9/32 participants expressed positive views about the use of advocates. Again, this is a numeric way of describing the result and also valuing by saying only 9/32: Firstly it is a qualitative study and secondly I am not sure about if it is only either, 9/32 is 28 percent - close to one third of the study population. However this is not a quantitative study, please reword this sentence to a qualitative style.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you. As the preceding sentence contains the same information we have deleted the sentence you have highlighted. This section now reads: ‘The transplant candidate advocate intervention component was the least popular option, with most participants expressing negative views towards it or concerns about its use.’</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: </p>
              <p>Page 3, line 69: the authors refer to “Figure 1-flow chart illustrating programme of research” but figure 1 does not seem to be part of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Please accept our apologies. Figures were uploaded late, after initial submission. Figure 1 has now been provided in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Page 3, line 75: reference is not provided for the definition for social support while references are provided for the other terms.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: A reference was provided for the definition of social support: Langford C, Bowsher J, Maloney J, Lillis P. Social support: a conceptual analysis. Journal of Advanced Nursing. 1997;25:95-100.</p>
              <p>Page 4, line 80: authors refer to “Figure 2-Mediators of socioeconomic inequity in living-donor kidney transplantation” but figure 2 does not seem to be part of the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Please accept our apologies. Figures were uploaded late, after initial submission. Figure 2 has now been provided in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Page 4, lines 86-88: The following sentence about “if low levels of patient activation contribute to difficulties ...” should be reworded as it is not currently easy to comprehend.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: We have reworded this sentence to make it easier to understand:</p>
              <p>‘For example, if low levels of patient activation mean that a patient find it difficult to approach potential donors, a ‘work-around’ solution would be for a healthcare practitioner to approach potential donors on a patient’s behalf.’ (page 4, lines 85-88, clean document).</p>
              <p>Page 6, line 139-140: The authors refer to using “a theory and evidence based approach (basing interventions on published research evidence and existing theories”. Is the theory-based approach referring to the original theoretical frameworks/constructs that were used during the development of the three previously existing interventions (e.g., Norway model...) or is this referring to the development of the multicomponent intervention? Please clarify and elaborate on the specifics of the theoretical frameworks utilized.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: The ‘theory and evidence based approach’ refers to the development of the multicomponent intervention. To clarify this we have now re-written the relevant section so that it now reads:</p>
              <p>‘We undertook intervention development using an approach that was both ‘theory and evidence based’ and ‘target population centred’ (34). ‘Theory and evidence based’ approaches develop interventions by combining published research evidence and existing theories. As indicated above we identified three existing intervention components from the published literature. One intervention (Home-based patient and family education) had been developed with respect to multisystemic therapy theory and had RCT evidence of effectiveness. One intervention (TCAs) had weak evidence of effectiveness from an observational study, and one (‘the Norway model’) had not been formally evaluated in research. ‘Target population centred’ approaches develop interventions based on the views of the people who will use them, and we employed the ‘Person-Based Approach’ (PBA) to do this.’ (page 7, lines 136-145, clean document).</p>
              <p>Page 8-9 (Study Population): Did the study interview family members that were related to people with advanced kidney disease that also participated in the interviews?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: One of the family participants was related to one of the participants with advanced kidney disease. We have added a sentence explaining this to the results.</p>
              <p>Page 9, line 183-184: What does “socioeconomic status (sampled by healthcare professionals’ knowledge of patient’s education...” mean? Was socioeconomic status used for purposive sampling determined by healthcare professional’s knowledge of a patient’s educational attainment?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Yes, socioeconomic status was used for purposive sampling. Sampling was based on several measures of socioeconomic status including patient’s education level, employment status and housing/postcode. We agree that the used of the words ‘by healthcare professionals’ knowledge’ is confusing and so we have edited this sentence to now read:</p>
              <p>‘Purposive sampling of patient participants was undertaken to ensure diversity in sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (using the following socioeconomic measures: patient’s education level, employment status and housing/postcode).’ (page 9, lines 174-176, clean document).</p>
              <p>Page 13, line 265: The authors refer to “Figure 3-thematic diagram”, figure 3 seems to be missing.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Please accept our apologies. Figures were uploaded late, after initial submission. Figure 3 has now been provided in the revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Page 14, line 280: The number of participants that brought up the four general themes are presented for three sections not including perceived cultural norms. How many participants brought up perceived cultural norms?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: 16/32 participants mentioned societal or cultural norms. At the request of Reviewer 2 we have now removed the numbers presented as distracting quantitative information.</p>
              <p>Page 15, line 312: the employment status is missing from the participant.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: This participant is a healthcare practitioner ‘Home dialysis nurse’. Employment status is only provided for patient and family participants.</p>
              <p>It is recommended that the paper be proofread for typos.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you. We have done this.</p>

              <p>4. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Dr Bailey has elegantly answered all the queries. There is a better description of the methodology used to recruit participants. As in qualitative research is usually done, in the clean version the results that were described numerically were removed and the results are expressed in a suitable way. The authors still did not provide data on the patients with CKD being listed for KT or even being considered as suitable candidates for KT. However the authors now included a sentence stating that the patients were aware of KT and LD in particular.</p>
              <p>I consider that the manuscript has been remarkably improved and achieved good quality to be considered for publication.</p>
