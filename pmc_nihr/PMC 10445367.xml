                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>This project applies a Learning Healthcare System (LHS) approach to antibiotic prescribing for common infections in primary care. The approach involves iterations of data analysis, feedback to clinicians and implementation of quality improvement activities by the clinicians. The main research question is, can a knowledge support system (KSS) intervention within an LHS implementation improve antibiotic prescribing without increasing the risk of complications?</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted, with randomisation of at least 112 general practices in North-West England. General practices participating in the trial will be randomised to the following interventions: periodic practice-level and individual prescriber feedback using dashboards; or the same dashboards plus a KSS. Data from large databases of healthcare records are used to characterise heterogeneity in antibiotic uses, and to calculate risk scores for clinical outcomes and for the effectiveness of different treatment strategies. The results provide the baseline content for the dashboards and KSS. The KSS comprises a display within the electronic health record used during the consultation; the prescriber (general practitioner or allied health professional) will answer standard questions about the patientâ€™s presentation and will then be presented with information (eg, patientâ€™s risk of complications from the infection) to guide decision making. The KSS can generate information sheets for patients, conveyed by the clinicians during consultations. The primary outcome is the practice-level rate of antibiotic prescribing (per 1000 patients) with secondary safety outcomes. The data from practices participating in the trial and the dashboard infrastructure will be held within regional shared care record systems of the National Health Service in the UK.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Translating research findings into routine clinical practice is a major challenge. The Learning Healthcare System (LHS) approach has been proposed to better integrate research into clinical practice.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It involves iterations of data analysis (data to knowledge), feedback to clinicians (knowledge to performance) and implementation of quality improvement activities by clinicians (performance to data).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> In the LHS, feedback can either be provided periodically through for example online dashboards or during consultations with patients using a knowledge support System (KSS). We use the term KSS as distinct from a Clinical Decision Support System because the information provided is about the condition, common complications and treatment options in general rather than specific decisions. Activation of KSS linked to electronic health records (EHRs) has been proposed for augmenting cliniciansâ€™ knowledge during consultations with patients.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> An icon on the cliniciansâ€™ computer screen provides access to information on â€˜patients like mineâ€™ (eg, the risk of developing clinical complications in similar patients), recommendations (eg, best not prescribe amoxicillin given this patientâ€™s frequent prior use) and a patient information sheet tailored to their condition and treatment. The information on similar patients could be drawn from several sources such as historic data on clinical outcomes from comparable patient groups.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, the KSS provides contextual information where a Clinical Decision Support System would point to a desired decision.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>In this project, the LHS approach will be applied to antibiotic prescribing for common infections in primary care. Primary care accounts for 72% of antibiotic prescribing in England.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Overuse of antibiotics is a major public health concern as it increases antimicrobial resistance. The National Health Service (NHS) 2019 Long Term Plan pledged action to optimise antibiotic uses, reducing inappropriate prescribing. The LHS approach will also include personalised patient information sheets that the clinician can provide to patients during consultation after KSS activation. A recent Cochrane review found that people exposed to decision aids feel more knowledgeable, better informed and clearer about their values. It also found improved knowledge and accurate risk perceptions when decision aids are used within the consultation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>

                <title>Research questions</title>
                <p>The research question is whether a KSS intervention within an LHS implementation can improve antibiotic prescribing without increasing the risk of complications? Practices that have implemented the KSS will be compared with practices that have not (ie, randomised cluster trial). The LHS approach will involve detailed data analysis followed by feedback to clinicians.</p>

                  <p>A previous project piloted and implemented the IT infrastructure for the LHS (ie, data analytics, feedback to clinicians) on antibiotic prescribing care in UK primary care. This project (BRIT: Building Rapid Interventions to reduce AMR and over-prescribing of antibiotics) was part of the Â£20â€‰million Department of Health and Social Care funded Connected Health Cities programme (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.connectedhealthcities.org/</ext-link>). This initial BRIT project developed practice-level feedback on antibiotic together with feedback on individual prescribers.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> These dashboards comprise a variety of antibiotic prescribing measures that were developed with clinical stakeholders.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> They currently provide information at practice level on the drivers of antibiotic prescribing (overall and by indication), analyses of prescribing of inappropriate types of antibiotics (deviating from guideline) and extent of risk-based prescribing. Importantly, the dashboards will allow clinicians to review data at different levels, including for example prescribing rates of a specific antibiotic to the individual patients prescribed that antibiotic, and comparison to other practices in the region.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>

                  <title>KSS during consultation</title>
                  <p>Our KSS intervention was developed based on the results of two mixed-methods codesign workshops to gauge the acceptability of a prototype.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Clinicians identified the following key requirements: ease and efficiency of use, integration of systems, patient-centeredness, personalisation and training. The KSS needs to include extraction of pertinent information from the care record (such as antibiotic prescribing history), recommended actions, personalised treatment, risk indicators and electronic patient information leaflets. The anticipated acceptability and intention to use the KSS, was moderate to high. While time was identified as a cost/burden, this was outweighed if the KSS improved patient outcomes and increased prescribing confidence. All the main requested features were implemented in the KSS except personalised treatment recommendations because current treatment guidelines do not cover all of the frequently encountered clinical challenges, such as frequent repeat antibiotic prescribing shortly after the first one.</p>

                  <p>These personalised risk scores are based on risk prediction models including characteristics such as age, gender, clinical and medication risk factors, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. These risk prediction models were developed and tested in the OpenSAFELY platform (<ext-link xlink:href="https://opensafely.org" ext-link-type="uri">https://opensafely.org</ext-link>) or the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD and Aurum (<ext-link xlink:href="https://cprd.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://cprd.com/</ext-link>).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> Risks are calculated using these algorithms which are combined with the patientâ€™s specific characteristics as recorded in the EHR. The clinician is given links to the relevant National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for the infection in screen 5 (treatment guidelines). The clinician can then consider these risk scores alongside other information when considering whether to prescribe an antibiotic, line up a back-up antibiotic or discuss with the patient alternative care pathways without antibiotics (treatment decision is recorded in screen 6). Once the shared decision-making process is complete, the clinician may provide an information sheet for the patient, particularly where an antibiotic is not being prescribed to advise the patient of the decision and provide the personalised risk scores (screen 7 with patient leaflet). Screen 8 allows the clinician to initiate a write-back function which will write back to the care record the diagnosis, symptoms and treatment as SNOMED codes. The KSS has been developed for use with EMIS which is the most common primary care record system in England.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Patient records remain confidential, and all data flows happen within the NHS.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The KSS arm will be limited to a maximum of 62 practices as this arm involves time and effort of clinicians during consultation. Sample size calculation has been computed based on the primary outcome of practice rate of antibiotic prescribing (per 1000 patients). In CPRD, the mean practice list size was 7981 and the overall rate of the number of antibiotic prescriptions (for any indication) was 598 per 1000 patients per year (SD 155). Assuming a reduction of 10% in the low-intensity KSS arm, its antibiotic prescribing rate will be around 538 per 1000 patients per year. Assuming an unchanged SD of 155 and practice attrition rate of 5%, randomising 62 practices to each of the two arms will provide 90% power to detect a 10% (54 per 1000 patients per year) between-arm difference in the overall rate of antibiotic prescribing (two-sided Î±=0.05), assuming a correlation of 0.82 between baseline and outcome antibiotic prescribing rate and analysing using analysis of covariance with baseline prescribing rate as covariate and 5% drop-out rate. For 80% power, 47 practices are needed in each arm. Sample size calculations were performed in PASS 2019 software. Our primary target is 112 practices although we will recruit up to 124 practices, given the limitation on numbers in the KSS arm. However, determination of the total sample size of practices will depend on practice consent to take part in the KSS evaluation and passing an assessment of IT system capability for the KSS installation.</p>

                <p>The unit of analysis will be general practice. The primary clinical outcome will be the overall rate of antibiotic prescribing. One secondary outcome, relating to safety, will be infection-related complications as recorded in the primary care record, including pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections, peritonsillar abscess, mastoiditis, intracranial abscess, empyema, scarlet fever, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, toxic shock syndrome and septicaemia, and Lemierre syndrome (as defined by Gulliford <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). BRIT found that clinician-recorded infection-related complications provided comparable results as those recorded in linked hospital admission data.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Another safety outcome will be hospital admissions for infection-related complications (linked hospital data are likely to be available within the shared care-record systems). The primary and safety-related secondary outcomes are equivalent to those used in a recent trial in UK primary care of a decision support system plus patient information sheets.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Another secondary outcome will be the level of risk-based prescribing (ie, the proportion of antibiotic prescribing in patients with different risks) as based on the risk prediction scores as developed and validated in the BRIT project.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

Data analysts will have access to anonymised data from participating practices within a secure data analytic environment. Rates will be analysed using appropriate models with Poisson or normal error structures, weighted by practice size, and with adjustment for practice-level covariates including region (Greater Manchester, Wirral and Merseyside/Cheshire), study quarter, period of randomisation and baseline antibiotic prescribing, socioeconomic status, case-mix of patients and ethnicity distribution in each practice (including Charlson comorbidity score<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), consultation rates for common infections, coding propensity and characteristics of patients with common infections. The coding propensity will be the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions with recent clinical record for common infection. The characteristics of patients with common infections will include the averages in each practice for mean age, sex, and predictors for infection-related complication (including clinical and medication risk factors<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Body mass index and smoking history will also be considered as potential predictors for infection-related complications; these will be discussed with the Study Steering Committee and will each be included in either the primary analysis, a sensitivity analysis or not included in the analysis. The primary analysis will be a complete case analysis (ie, excluding practices who drop out of the trial), unless attrition is higher than expected (ie, &gt;10% overall or differential between-arm attrition of &gt;10%).</p>

                  <p>NICE has produced guidance on the type of economic analysis needed for digital health technologies, depending on the level of financial risk to the NHS.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> For a digital health technology like KSS that has the potential to be cost-saving, the economic analysis level could be defined as â€˜low financial commitmentâ€™ requiring at least a cost-consequence analysis (CCA) and a budget impact analysis (BIA). We will estimate the economic impact of the KSS, from the perspective of the NHS and partner social care services The primary analysis will be a within-trial CCA and BIA where the outcomes are overall rate of antibiotic prescribing and level of risk-based prescribing. As we do not have access to infection-related hospital admissions, we need to use a proxy for this aspect of resource use. Therefore, we will also carry out an indicative BRIT2 algorithm-based economic analysis where we will use the data summarised above plus estimates of the expected rate of infection-related hospital admissions based on the validated BRIT2 risk algorithms, to provide indicative estimates of overall costs associated with KSS.</p>
                  <p>In the primary CCA, we will use the primary outcome, overall level of antibiotic prescribing, level of risk-based prescribing, infection-related hospital admissions and infection-related complications, to estimate economic impact of KSS.</p>

                  <p>The OCoP will focus on discussion of complex cases (eg, patients who frequently but intermittently are prescribed antibiotics). It will also discuss the analytics of the local data and any actions that need to be implemented and evaluated locallyâ€”this will help researchers to understand the interpretation of the dashboard and provide feedback on the dashboard. The target users will be health professionals in the participating general practices as well as local healthcare (NHS) and public health organisations. The staff will include general practitioners (GPs), GP research leads, practice managers, quality and safety pharmacists, medicines optimisations pharmacists and public health consultants. We have already spoken to some of the community to develop this and when developing the OCoP we will build on this to provide a platform that will suit the way this community works. We need some champions to encourage widespread adoption of the resource. We will include some workshops using video conferencing to gain some of the input for the OCoP as well as provide training.</p>

                <title>Consent</title>
                <p>General practices will need to agree with study participation (information sheet is provided in <xref rid="SP3" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix 3</xref>) and clinicians will need to activate the KSS within the care record system. Patient consent for use of the KSS will not be sought and is not required as approved by the Ethics Committee. The reason for this is that the KSS intervention is focused on cliniciansâ€”the KSS will provide clinicians with further information. It will be up the clinician to decide whether to access or not the KSS, prescribe an antibiotic or not. The KSS makes information easily accessible to the clinicians and will not provide treatment recommendations. Studies very similar to our proposal also did not seek informed consent from patients, but, like our study, required consent by participating clinicians.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 24</xref></p>

                <p>The UK regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) produced guidance on how to comply with the legal requirements for interventions including software. Based on a reasonable interpretation of the MHRA guidance, BRIT2 is not considered a device for the following reasons: the KSS will not apply â€˜automated reasoningâ€™ to the clinicianâ€™s decision to prescribe an antibiotic or not. There will be no â€˜if then reasoningâ€™, no direct inferences can be drawn from the BRIT2 information provided. There will be no provision of a treatment threshold; it will be up to the clinician to decide whether a BRIT2 risk estimate of infection-related complications of for example, 1% is relevant to the patient and whether this would require an antibiotic. BRIT2 will provide â€˜reference information to enable a clinician to make a clinician decisionâ€™.</p>

                <title>Technical description of the KSS</title>
                <p>The initial version of the KSS has been written to target the EMIS Healthâ€™s EMIS Web EHR system as EMIS Health provide EHR services to the majority of general practices in the trial region. This was a strategic decision aimed at controlling the complexity of the software and managing the delivery schedule while maximising the potential targets for the KSS randomisation. Future iterations of the KSS will be platform agnostic and present data in the presentation layer of the application in a consistent way regardless of EHR software running on-site and early design decisions support this future requirement.</p>

The ethics application (IRAS 290050) and trial registry (ISRCTN16230629) concern two funded projects including the NIHR funded cluster trial (as described in this study protocol) and an observational study funded by Health Data Research UK (HDR UK Better Care Programme for frail elderly) with data analysis and feedback for frail elderly. These two projects were combined in the same ethics research approval and study registration as they were to share the same data and dashboard infrastructure; interventions and study populations were to be different and both studies were separately described in the ethics application. Due to delays in getting data access, the frailty project did not progress to implementing the (dashboard) interventions. Sample size calculations were conducted separately for each project (including in the ethics application) although study registration reported overall target number of 300 for practice recruitment.</p>
