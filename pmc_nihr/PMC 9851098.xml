                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Major depression represents a pressing challenge for health care. In England, Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services provide evidence-based psychological therapies in a stepped-care approach to patients with depression. While introduction of these services has successfully increased access to therapy, estimates suggest that about 50% of depressed patients who have come to the end of the IAPT pathway still show significant levels of symptoms. This study will investigate whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), a group intervention combining training in mindfulness meditation and elements from cognitive therapy, can have beneficial effects in depressed patients who have not responded to high-intensity therapy in IAPT. It will seek to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MBCT as compared to the treatment these patients would usually receive.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">In a 2-arm randomised controlled trial, patients who currently meet the criteria for major depressive disorder and who have not sufficiently responded to at least 12 sessions of IAPT high-intensity therapy will be allocated, at a ratio of 1:1, to receive either MBCT (in addition to treatment as usual [TAU]) or continue with TAU only. Assessments will take place at baseline, 10 weeks and 34 weeks post-randomisation. The primary outcome will be reduction in depression symptomatology 34 weeks post-randomisation as assessed using the Public Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes will include depressive symptomatology at 10 weeks post-randomisation and other clinical outcomes measured at 10-week and 34-week follow-up, along with a series of binarised outcomes to indicate clinically significant and reliable change. Evaluations of cost-effectiveness will be based on assessments of service use costs collected using the Adult Service Use Schedule and health utilities derived from the EQ-5D.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial will add to the evidence base for the use of MBCT in depressed treatment non-responders. It will constitute the first trial to test MBCT following non-response to psychological therapy, with results providing a direct estimate of efficacy within the IAPT pathway. As such, its results will offer an important basis for decisions regarding the adoption of MBCT for non-responders within IAPT.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par45">Major depression represents a pressing challenge for health care. The disorder not only is highly prevalent—10.9% of the adult population in England suffered from an episode of depression in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]—but also shows many characteristics of a progressive disease: if left untreated, it tends to become more recurrent and chronic over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with even residual levels of symptoms conferring a significantly increased risk for future relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is evidence for functional decline as the disorder accelerates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and physiological changes underlying its progression have been linked with a significantly increased risk for a broad range of physical and neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par46">In order to address this challenge, it is imperative to provide treatments that effectively reduce symptoms in those who are affected and promote recovery and thus to prevent progression into increasingly recurrent or chronic courses. Although there is still a significant unmet need, progress in providing access to treatment has been encouraging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], due to a significant degree to the introduction of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services, which were established with the express aim of providing patients with evidence-based psychological treatments in a timely manner and are projected to care for increasing numbers of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. IAPT uses a stepped care approach, with those not responding to low-intensity treatment or greater complexity receiving high-intensity treatment. In 2020–21, IAPT services offered treatment to over 1,000,000 people.</p>
                <p id="Par47">However, while the introduction of IAPT is successfully increasing access to psychological therapies, outcome reports indicate that about 50% of the depressed patients who have completed high-intensity evidence-based psychological therapies within IAPT do not reach recovery and continue to show significant levels of symptoms. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. At the same time, progression to secondary care remains reserved for those with complex depression and high risk for suicidality. Data from the “Predicting Outcome Following Psychological Therapy in IAPT (PROMPT)” study show that of those who do not respond only 8% receive secondary care interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], while the remainder are currently not offered any further-line treatment. Most of these patients are sent back to their GPs, who are likely to prescribe antidepressant medication. Yet, the majority of IAPT non-responders are already receiving medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There is therefore a considerable gap in service provision for patients who do not respond sufficiently to high-intensity evidence-based psychological therapies—a problem that is likely to come into focus even further as numbers of patients accessing IAPT are increasing.</p>
                <p id="Par48">Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], an 8-week, group-based intervention that combines intensive training in mindfulness and elements from cognitive therapy for depression, may be particularly suited for addressing this gap. While originally developed, and NICE-recommended, for the prevention of relapse in remitted patients with a history of recurrent depression, recent research has brought promising evidence that MBCT can have significant beneficial effects in patients with acute and more persistent forms of the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and particularly in those who have not responded to previous interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a large definitive RCT in patients who had not responded to antidepressants, Eisendrath et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found a statistically significant advantage of MBCT over a rigorous psychological control treatment on depression symptomatology, <italic>d</italic> = 0.32, an effect size in the small to medium range. In a smaller scale RCT, also in patients who had not responded to antidepressants, Chiesa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] reported a statistically significant benefit for MBCT relative to attention-placebo on depression symptomatology, <italic>d</italic> = 0.79, an effect size in the medium to large range. A further smaller scale RCT investigating the effects of MBCT in chronically depressed patients who had not responded to antidepressants has shown a statistically significant advantage on depressive symptomatology compared with treatment as usual with a small effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.35) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, evidence is currently not sufficient to warrant guideline endorsement for use as a further-line treatment, which is a necessary prerequisite for implementation within the evidence-based IAPT pathway.</p>
                <p id="Par49">The current trial will constitute a second definitive trial of MBCT as a further-line treatment and would thus provide an important step towards a sufficient evidence base. Furthermore, it will constitute the first trial to test MBCT following non-response to psychological therapy with results providing a direct estimate of efficacy within the IAPT pathway. If successful, the proposed research would provide the evidence necessary for adoption of MBCT for non-responders within IAPT and would thus justify the use of an easy to implement and much-needed treatment option for a considerable proportion of patients who are currently not receiving sufficient support.</p>
                <p id="Par50">MBCT offers a number of advantages for addressing more persistent courses of depression. Mindfulness training is specifically aimed at helping patients become better at recognising and disengaging from habitual and automatic maladaptive patterns of thinking. Research indicates that, through such ‘decentering’, the practice helps to prevent the spiralling of negative mood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The training provides patients with sustainable skills that remain accessible to them after the end of the intervention, with recent evidence suggesting that ‘decentering’ skills further improve as patients continue using mindfulness practices following the end of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. MBCT might thus serve to effectively reduce symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] as well as keep people well for the longer term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Because of its group-based format and emphasis on training skills, the intervention is particularly suited for alternative forms of delivery such as videoconferencing.</p>
                <p id="Par51">In order to provide evidence that, if positive, would be sufficient to enable a change in IAPT practice, we shall compare MBCT (in addition to TAU) as delivered via videoconferencing to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in IAPT high-intensity treatment non-responders in a definitive clinical trial. TAU was chosen as the comparator as it is reflective of the current state of care. Delivery via videoconferencing was chosen due to demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. We shall test the immediate effects of the intervention on depressive symptomatology as well as whether effects on symptomatology can be sustained over a period of 6 months (the primary outcome), thus taking into account the high risk of relapse in early stages following treatment. In addition to testing clinical effectiveness, we shall measure service use and collect information on quality of life in order to provide information on the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in IAPT high-intensity treatment non-responders. Previous research has suggested that MBCT for relapse prevention is broadly comparable to maintenance antidepressant use with an estimated cost for group attendance in person of £112 per group participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with these costs likely to be lower when delivering the intervention via remote formats such as videoconferencing. However, data on the economic effects of outcome in IAPT non-responders would be needed in order to guide decisions on implementation in this particular group.</p>

                  <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                  <p id="Par79">MBCT combines mindfulness training with elements from cognitive therapy. We will follow the treatment manual with minor adaptations to address the fact that patients are suffering from current symptoms of depression following practice from our previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The intervention will be delivered by trained MBCT therapists together with an assistant to groups with a target size of 13 patients (minimum 8 and maximum of 16) using videoconferencing on a secure online platform. This will allow participants to attend sessions through Internet connection from their home or another place of their choosing. All three sites have prior experience with delivering MBCT in this format and will follow shared internal guidelines for videoconferencing delivery. All therapists will meet qualifications in line with Good Practice Guidelines and competency level ‘proficient’ on the MBCT Therapy Pathway, which implies, among other criteria, that the therapist is teaching at competent levels across all six domains of the Mindfulness-Based Interventions: Teaching Assessment Criteria (MBI-TAC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). Where MBI-TAC ratings are not available, we will require the therapist to have a track record of teaching MBCT for at least 5 years. Therapists will receive a 1-day workshop to familiarise them with the modifications of the programme necessary for use with currently depressed patients and will be provided with individual supervision sessions weekly during the intervention. Manual adherence and treatment fidelity will be monitored using methods established in our previous trials using the MBCT Adherence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and MBI-TAC based on the recordings of the online intervention sessions. MBCT consists of eight weekly group-based sessions and participants are asked to engage in home practice for about an hour per day using guided meditation audio recordings, with attendance and practice monitored following previously established practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As the intervention is delivered online, it will be possible for participants recruited at different sites to attend a given MBCT course. We will offer access to an online MBCT course run by therapists at a centre different from the one where the participant has been recruited, if it is deemed helpful in order to respond to demands of recruitment and time preferences by participants and provided that risk management procedures remain unaffected. In these cases, assessments will continue to be conducted by the site where the participant has been recruited and we will require information about local emergency contacts to be in place and provided to the therapist of the group.</p>
                  <p id="Par80">Participants in the TAU condition will be asked to continue with their usual care and follow the regimens suggested by their GP or mental health professional, which in most cases will consist of continuing use of antidepressant medication. Following previous practice in our trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], TAU participants will be invited to an interview to prevent tendencies towards ‘resentful demoralisation' and highlight the importance of their contribution. As the pre-class interview for the MBCT courses, this interview will be conducted via videoconferencing.</p>

                  <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                  <p id="Par81">Participants are free to withdraw their participation at any point. If a participant in either arm indicates that they wish to discontinue the trial they will not be contacted further by the research team, other than to invite them to take part in a brief written survey to ascertain their reasons for not taking part. In the MBCT arm of the trial, different levels of discontinuation are possible. A participant may discontinue therapy but remain in the trial, or they may discontinue the trial. In order to enable intention-to-treat analyses, we will still ask participants who opt to discontinue therapy at any point to take part in assessments, should they be willing to contribute to the research in this way.</p>
                  <p id="Par82">Consideration will be given to whether it is in the participant’s interests to continue or discontinue trial treatment in the event of a serious adverse reaction. If the participant, the therapist or the research team believes that ongoing intervention or trial participation will result in, or is likely to result in, a further or ongoing serious adverse reaction, discontinuation will be recommended. Should an unexpected serious adverse reaction occur to either the therapy or the trial procedures, and if this is judged to be directly related to trial participation or to the therapy, the trial will be temporarily halted pending investigation and analysis of the extent to which future risk can be mitigated. If it is judged that this is not possible, the trial will be discontinued. This process will be led by the sponsor in collaboration with the TSC chair and chief investigator. The same process will be followed should information come to light that indicates that the therapy intervention or trial procedures are unsafe.</p>

Hence, the primary outcome will be PHQ-9 scores at 34-week follow-up (consistent with end-of-treatment monitoring in IAPT). The PHQ-9 is a widely used self-report measure of depression that represents an integral part of the management of depression in the IAPT pathway and has good psychometric properties.</p>

The authors report a test–retest reliability of 0.84 over a period of 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Other clinical secondary outcome measures will include the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the Phobia Scale and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, all from the IAPT minimum data set (IAPT Toolkit, 2008/9), along with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], Experiences Questionnaire (EQ) Decentering Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A series of binarised outcomes will be derived, based on PHQ-9 and/or GAD-7. Recovery, reliable recovery, and reliable improvement will be reported using (i) PHQ-9 only to align with depression research literature and (ii) both PHQ-9 and GAD-7, to align with IAPT practice. We will also report deterioration and reliable deterioration with regard to PHQ-9 and GAD-7 separately. We will also track symptoms weekly using the PHQ-9, GAD-7, Phobia Scale and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale.</p>

In addition, the cost perspective will be broadened to include the costs of time off productivity losses, since these are known to be relevant and important in those attending IAPT services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par90">Costs will be calculated by collecting service use information using the Adult Service Use Schedule (AD-SUS), a self-report measure developed by the team at King’s College and used in previous trials of MBCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], modified for use online, to which routine unit costs will be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We will collect data on all service use not just use related to mental health conditions, because there is evidence that successful treatment in IAPT can reduce use of all healthcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In addition, comparison via randomised groups will ensure that any differences in cost are due to the impact of the MBCT intervention. Information on TAU will be collected via the AD-SUS, modified to ensure that all relevant services are included. Data on the use of the MBCT intervention will be collected via therapist records and costs estimated using the standard approach set out by Curtis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], acknowledging the challenges of costing group-based interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

Costs and outcomes will be combined first in a cost-utility analysis using QALYS and second in a cost-effectiveness analysis using the PHQ-9, providing information on whether or not MBCT is worthwhile in terms of cost savings elsewhere or improvements in outcomes, and information will be provided to decision makers with statistical analysis of differences in costs, cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Qualitative analyses</title>
                  <p id="Par91">Qualitative analyses will be used to explore patient experience of the intervention and to understand how the treatment might best benefit patients in the IAPT pathway. Previous trials have shown considerable variation in the degree to which patients engage in mindfulness practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and a major focus of the qualitative analyses will therefore be on factors influencing such engagement and its relation with dynamics of change. For this purpose, we will investigate the following: (1) patients’ views on acceptability of MBCT and mindfulness practice, and the experience of participating in the course remotely; (2) patients’ views of the changes they experience and their utilisation of mindfulness skills; and (3) patients’ views of the broader impact of MBCT on their lives.</p>
                  <p id="Par92">A subsample of participants in the MBCT arm, estimated to be 24 (or until data saturation has been reached), will be invited to a qualitative telephone interview conducted by trained research assistants. Recruitment will be purposive, including patients across all sites, and seeking to achieve maximum variation in relation to (1) completion/non-completion of treatment, (2) response/non-response to treatment and (3) recruitment site (to examine contextual factors).</p>
                  <p id="Par93">Written feedback provided in the protocol sheets that MBCT participants receive on a weekly basis will be used to inform subsampling and will also provide us with the opportunity to explore any unanticipated experiences and effects in more depth. In collaboration with service users, we will develop, and pilot test, a semi-structured topic guide based on the above aims. Interviews will be video-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymised. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts will be conducted using a Framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], involving the coding and sorting of textual units according to both deductive and inductively derived categories, and the use of matrices to review the coded data, investigate commonalities and differences and search for patterns. Coding and data management will be facilitated by NVivo software.</p>
                  <p id="Par94">Given that MBCT was originally developed for relapse prevention in patients who are in remission and its use for currently depressed treatment non-responders will require adaptations in how the manualised approach is delivered and made accessible for patients, we will also conduct qualitative interviews with the therapists involved in the trial. These will serve to investigate (1) the overall experience of the therapist, (2) their experience of supporting participants in their practice, (3) helpful and unhelpful aspects of MBCT for treatment non-responders and (4) therapists’ experience of its overall effectiveness. Interviews will be guided by a semi-structured topic guide and data processed using the same approach that will be applied to participants’ interviews (see above).</p>

                <p id="Par95">Interested participants will undergo screening using a brief structured telephone interview conducted by the research assistant. Potential participants will be invited for an initial assessment session to be conducted via videoconferencing to ascertain eligibility using structured clinical interviews conducted by the research assistant and assess baseline levels of symptoms (baseline assessment). Eligibility interviews will be conducted as soon as possible after the screening. Baseline questionnaire assessments will be conducted within a window of 3 weeks before randomisation. Participants will be randomly allocated and learn about group assignment at least a week preceding the pre-intervention interviews held with both groups. After the 9-week treatment delivery period, participants will be assessed again at 10 weeks and 34 weeks post-randomisation. Patients will be asked to complete the follow-up assessments within a 1-week window and prompted weekly using phone, text, or email for up to four weeks, if not responsive. Patients are free to receive their usual care through the NHS while they wait to start MBCT.

                <p id="Par96">Following previous suggestions for defining successful treatment outcome in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the study will be powered to enable detection of a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Using a criterion of one standard error of measurement (38), the MCID for our primary outcome measure (PHQ-9) has been estimated to range from 2.59 under best-case reliability scenarios to 4.78 under worst-case reliability scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In order to detect an MCID at the smaller end of this range (2.59) using a standard deviation of 5.4 (as reported for the baseline data in the clinical trial that served to estimate the above-listed range of MCIDs in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]), with 90% power at an alpha level of 0.05, 186 participants are required. In our previous large-scale multi-centre trial of MBCT for patients with a history of recurrent suicidal depression, 93% of participants provided follow-up data over a 1-year follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Considering a rate of attrition of 20%, conservatively estimated to be above that observed in our previous research, we will recruit a total sample of 234 participants (117 in each arm, 78 per site). As currently available research suggests that trials using remote delivery generally show comparable or even lower rates of attrition, we would expect this estimate to be transferable to the use of videoconferencing delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The research team will monitor attrition at regular milestones during the trial (e.g. at the point where 50% of participants have reached their scheduled 6-month follow-up time) and consider remedial steps to increase sample size, if this is needed. We have not inflated the sample size to take account of clustering within treatment groups, as reanalyses of previous trials of MBCT have found intra-class correlations (ICCs) for primary outcomes to be negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par97">Participating IAPT services will identify patients who are coming to the end of their high-intensity treatment and have not responded (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) or patients who within a 6-month window following the end of high-intensity therapy show levels of symptoms above caseness without prior remission. Data from the IAPT services originally listed as collaborators in our grant proposal indicated that we would be recruiting from a pool of more than 7500 non-responders per year. Remote delivery of the intervention will allow us to reach an even wider potential pool of participants and allow inclusion of further IAPT services given that participation in the treatment will not be restricted to people within the geographical regions of the sites. The research team will include further IAPT services as patient identification centres (PIC) to work together with the three research sites. As IAPT services can differ widely in their characteristics and organisational features of IAPT services have been shown to explain considerable variance in their outcomes (Clark et al., 2018), we will only include services that can provide a considerable number of participants and make sure that collaborating services do not show outlier characteristics. As a general rule, services included as PIC sites will have to have recovery rates above 45% and their percentage of IAPT therapists should be at least 40%. A short participant information sheet together with a ‘Permission for Researcher to Contact Form’ will be sent to potential participants either via email or post (in the latter case together with a stamped addressed envelope for their response) through the service. Potential participants will be invited to either contact the research team directly or send the completed ‘Permission for Researcher to Contact Form’ so that the researchers can contact the potential participant. If potential participants do not return the form within 14 days, they will be contacted via email, telephone or text message by service administrators, IAPT staff or Research Network Clinical Studies Officers to check whether they have received the letter and asking them if they wish to participate in the trial. In all cases, we will follow procedures that are in line with the policy of the respective trust as covered in the GDPR statement signed by each patient and will respect any opt outs that the trust may have received via national or other routes.</p>
                <p id="Par98">Patients who are potentially interested in taking part will be contacted by the researchers for an initial screening to confirm the presence of symptoms and history of high-intensity treatment for depression, and to provide further information on the research. If positive on the screen, potential participants will be invited to take part in a structured clinical interview conducted via videoconferencing to confirm eligibility and, if eligible, to complete baseline assessments by completing web-based questionnaires. Clinical interviews will be conducted as soon as possible after initial contact and screening, while baseline questionnaire assessments will take place within a window of 4 weeks before randomisation. The invitation for this assessment will include the patient information sheet (PIS) and informed consent will be taken before the start of the assessment by asking participants to sign and return the consent form electronically.

                <p id="Par113">Participant characteristics at baseline (including number of previous depressive episodes and IAPT service) will be set out descriptively by the treatment arm. The primary analysis approach will use the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle (all participants will be included in the analysis according to their randomised allocation irrespective of the treatment actually received) including observed data only. All outcomes will be reported descriptively at baseline, and at 10 and 34 weeks’ follow-up. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models. The binary outcome variables will be analysed using logistic regression. All analyses will adjust for participant covariates used in randomisation, with adjustment for baseline scores for continuous outcomes. We will assess other participant characteristics at baseline and will consider adjusting for any covariates that are found to be substantively unbalanced, should such covariates be considered predictive of outcome. Inferential between-group comparisons (MBCT vs TAU) for the primary and all secondary outcomes will be performed at 34-week follow-up. As a sensitivity analysis, we will perform a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis for continuous outcomes only, to estimate the treatment effect while accounting for non-adherence to treatment. A participant in the intervention arm will be considered to be a ‘complier’, if a minimum of four treatment sessions were attended. Mixed effects regression models with a random effect on individual participant will be performed for continuous and binary outcomes, including participants with outcome data reported for at least one follow-up time. To address the potential for clustering effects by IAPT service, we will perform sensitivity analyses using mixed effects regression models for the primary and secondary (continuous and binary) outcomes, with a random effect on IAPT service. Similarly, to address the potential for effects of clustering by therapist, further sensitivity analyses will test for the effect of individual therapists or therapist seniority. Mixed effects model with a random effect on individual therapist will also be performed. As a further sensitivity analysis, therapist seniority will be added as a fixed effect within the primary model for the primary outcome and all secondary outcomes. To explore effects under conditions of different inclusion criteria, a sensitivity analysis will be run including only those patients who failed to meet both criteria for reliable recovery according to IAPT conventions, that is reliable change in symptoms and symptom levels below caseness. We will also perform a sensitivity analysis (primary outcome only) to include any data collected outside the 7-day window. Sensitivity analyses will be based on the ITT principle (except the CACE analysis). Should further sensitivity analyses be indicated, these will be described in the statistical analysis plan.</p>

A score of more than 0 on the PHQ-9 item 9 (that represents a change from the previous trial assessment) and reports of suicidal ideation, intent, plans or urges, and any risk of harm to self or others in the MINI interview or other contexts will be deemed as risk issues. Identification of a risk issue will trigger the trial team to capture more detailed information and context to assess risk in line with the trial risk protocol. Where necessary participants will be provided with support in line with the local sites’ risk management process.</p>

In particular, suicidality will be deemed as an AE or SAE, if risk is categorised as level C on our risk protocol. Routine hospitalisations and planned surgery recorded at the baseline assessment visit (pre-treatment) do not require reporting as SAEs.</p>

Research Assistants will be responsible for screening the AD-SUS questionnaire within 72 h of completion to check for potential serious adverse events. Identification of a potential SAE in the AD-SUS will trigger a telephone call to the participant to capture more detailed information and context of the event although this should not delay reporting. As reports on the AD-SUS are retrospective, the research team will assess any remaining risks and the local sites risk management process will be adhered to at any time to ensure participants receive support where necessary.</p>
                    <p>The local PI will evaluate the reported event for seriousness considering the available contextual information. All non-serious AE will be documented in the electronic patient record. If the issue is assessed as serious, the event must be reported to the CI, Trial Manager, local R&amp;D department and Sponsor, immediately and no later than 24 h of being made aware of the event. Initial reports of SAE can be made via email but must be promptly followed with a detailed written report using the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form for the Sponsor and containing sufficient detail regarding concurrent life events. The PI should ensure that follow-up information is provided when available.</p>
