                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Transmission blocking vaccines targeting the sexual-stages of the malaria parasite could play a major role to achieve elimination and eradication of malaria. The <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Pfs25 protein (Pfs25) is the most clinically advanced candidate sexual-stage antigen. IMX313, a complement inhibitor C4b-binding protein that forms heptamers with the antigen fused to it, improve antibody responses. This is the first time that viral vectors have been used to induce antibodies in humans against an antigen that is expressed only in the mosquito vector.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Clinical trial looking at safety and immunogenicity of two recombinant viral vectored vaccines encoding Pfs25-IMX313 in healthy malaria-naive adults. Replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAd63) and the attenuated orthopoxvirus modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), encoding Pfs25-IMX313, were delivered by the intramuscular route in a heterologous prime-boost regimen using an 8-week interval. Safety data and samples for immunogenicity assays were taken at various time-points.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The reactogenicity of the vaccines was similar to that seen in previous trials using the same viral vectors encoding other antigens. The vaccines were immunogenic and induced both antibody and T cell responses against Pfs25, but significant transmission reducing activity (TRA) was not observed in most volunteers by standard membrane feeding assay.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Both vaccines were well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile in malaria-naive adults. However, the transmission reducing activity of the antibodies generated were weak, suggesting the need for an alternative vaccine formulation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It was estimated that in 2018, malaria killed 405 000 people most of whom were children aged under 5 years (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The global community has made a powerful economic and humanitarian case for continued investment in the fight against malaria with the aim of defeating malaria within the next 15 years (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), having already reduced the global incidence of malaria by 30% and the malaria mortality rate by 47% between 2001 and 2013 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Transmission control is an essential component of malaria control and elimination (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The strategic goals for 2030, set out in the Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap, include the development of transmission blocking malaria vaccines (TBVs) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Unlikely traditional vaccines, TBVs do not provide direct protection to the vaccinated individual but instead reduce or eliminate disease transmission within a vaccinated community. Malaria TBVs target sexual stages of the parasite, which do not cause disease within the human host but are critical for completing it’s life cycle in the mosquito vector (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p>
              <p>The <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Pfs25 protein (Pfs25) is a leading candidate antigen for a TBV (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Pfs25 is a sexual stage antigen of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> that is expressed on the surface of the zygote and ookinete forms of the parasite, where it is involved in ookinete formation, as well as a possible role in traversal of the mid-gut epithelium (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). As Pfs25 is not displayed with the human host, it has not been under the same level of immune pressure as other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> antigens, making it an attractive vaccine target. Pfs25 was identified as the target of highly effective transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies which were shown to prevent the ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito mid-gut in several pre-clinical studies, thereby blocking transmission (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p>
              <p>It has modest immunogenicity as a monomeric protein, but when conjugated to itself or to other carrier proteins the immunogenicity is substantially improved (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). A recombinant Pfs25 protein administered with adjuvant ISA 51 in human has been tested previously but this trial had to be terminated due to erythema nodosum reactions likely related to this specific antigen/adjuvant combination (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In <italic>ex vivo</italic> models, such as the standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA), mosquitoes are fed cultured gametocytes in the presence of whole serum or purified IgG. In this assay, vaccine-induced antibodies generated against candidate antigens have been shown to reduce the transmission capacity of the parasite, although this was carried out on the <italic>P. vivax</italic> homologue Pvs25 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In two other clinical trials, conjugation of Pfs25 to a recombinant detoxified ExoProtein A (EPA) from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and a plant produced virus-like-particle displaying Pfs25 induced antibodies that recognized native protein on the parasite surface and demonstrated modest but insufficient TRA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p>
              <p>TRA demonstrated in a SMFA has been shown to correlate with antibody titer and with antibody avidity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, a correlation between level of antigen-specific antibodies and their blocking efficacy was demonstrated in humans, as approximately 1000 units (95% Confidence Interval, 683–1565 units) of antibody were required to reach a 50% reduction in oocyst density (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Moreover, two studies demonstrated that concentration of 50-80 ug/mL of anti-Pfs25-specific antibodies in human serum was needed to provide significant oocyst reduction in the SMFA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>IMX313 is a small protein domain that self-assembles into a nanoparticle with seven identical chains. The 55 amino acid sequence is a hybrid of the oligomerisation domains of two chicken C4b-binding proteins, both distant homologues of human Complement 4 binding protein (C4bp), simultaneously performing an adjuvant-like effect that improves antibody responses to the fused protein antigens (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). IMX313 has recently been tested in a Phase I clinical trial in Oxford as part of a candidate tuberculosis vaccine MVA 85A-IMX313 demonstrating favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Pre-clinical vaccine development demonstrated that mice immunized with the blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate MSP1<sub>19</sub> fused to IMX313 were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> parasites (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Similarly, in our murine study, Pfs25 fused to IMX313 and expressed in recombinant replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 (ChAd63) and an attenuated orthopoxvirus MVA viral vectors demonstrated significantly higher transmission-reducing activity than the vectors encoding monomeric Pfs25, rendering it a highly promising TBV candidate vaccine (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>The design and administration of a recombinant replication–deficient adenovirus and an attenuated recombinant poxvirus vectors in a prime/boost regimen has been optimized over the last decade in preclinical models to induce antibodies in conjunction with T cell responses (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), including studies of such vectors encoding sexual-stage malaria antigens (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). These vectors, delivering antigens from <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, have now been shown to be safe and immunogenic, resulting in the development of both T cell and antibody responses in healthy European and American adult volunteers (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) as well as in African adults, children, and infants (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p>
              <p>Here, we report the safety and immunogenicity of ChAd63 and MVA vectors encoding Pfs25-IMX313. These vaccines were tested in an open-label dose-escalation Phase Ia study in healthy United Kingdom (UK) adults. We report that these vaccines demonstrate a favorable safety profile in malaria-naive adults and that anti Pfs25-specific antibodies, B cell and T cell responses can be induced by immunization in humans. However, vaccine-induced serum antibodies displayed weak transmission blocking activity, highlighting the need for further in-depth evaluation of the human immune responses induced by this vaccine candidate in order to inform improved design of future TBV vaccines.</p>

                <p>This was a Phase I open-label, dose escalation, first-in-human, non-randomized trial of the viral vectored vaccines ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313 and MVA Pfs25-IMX313 given in a prime-boost regimen with an eight week interval. The study was conducted at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and the NIHR-CRF University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, UK. The study received ethical approval from the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee A in the UK (REC reference 15/SC/0237). The study was also reviewed and approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, reference 21584/0344/001-0001). Volunteers signed written consent forms and consent was verified before each vaccination. The trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02532049) and was conducted according to the principles of the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki 2008 and in full conformity with the ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the safety of ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313 and MVA Pfs25-IMX313, with secondary endpoints to assess immunogenicity and <italic>ex-vivo</italic> efficacy.</p>

                <p>Following each vaccination, volunteers completed an electronic diary card for 28 days with any adverse event data. Data regarding SAEs were collected throughout the duration of the trial. Observations (heart rate, temperature and blood pressure) were taken at the clinic visits from the day of vaccination until the 28 day follow-up visit. Blood tests for exploratory immunology were taken at all visits except those occurring 2 days after each vaccination (i.e. days 2 and 58). Blood samples for safety (full blood count, liver function, urea and electrolytes) were carried out at screening, day 0, day 7 and day 28 for all groups, as well as on days 56, 63 and 84 for Groups 2B and 2C. Any solicited AEs occurring during the first 7 days following vaccination were defined as being at least possibly related to vaccination. The likely causality of all other AEs was assessed as described in the protocol and all AEs considered possibly, probably or definitely related to vaccination are reported (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"><bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold></xref>).

                <p>ELISAs were performed against full-length Pfs25 protein using standardized methodology as previously described (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Briefly ELISA plates were coated over-night with Pfs25 protein (2µg/mL, 50 µL per well). The plates were blocked with StartingBlock™ T20 (PBS) Blocking Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific,UK) and the assay is performed by using a standard curve and internal controls from the reference serum. Unknown test serum samples from immunized volunteers are diluted and added in triplicate to the ELISA plate. After a two hour incubation period, the diluted sera were discarded, the plate was washed and a secondary polyclonal antibody against the γ–chain of human IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, UK) was added. After 1 hour incubation, followed by a wash step, the alkaline phosphatase substrate was added. The substrate is left to develop for 25 minutes and the absorbance at 405nm was read using a plate reader. A standard curve and Gen5 ELISA software v3.04 (BioTek, UK) was used to convert the OD405 of individual test samples into arbitrary units (AU). These responses in AU are reported in μg/mL following generation of a conversion factor by calibration-free concentration analysis (CFCA) as described in <bold>Supplementary Materials and Methods</bold>.</p>

                <p>Healthy UK adult volunteers were enrolled into the VAC062 trial to test the ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313 vaccine in an open-label, dose-escalation study design. Fifty-three UK adult volunteers were screened in total, of which twenty-six were enrolled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The first five volunteers were recruited to Group 1, however, one volunteer was withdrawn from Group 1 on the day of vaccination as they had been vaccinated with the low dose in error (the volunteer should have been enrolled into Group 2A and given the full dose). The remaining four volunteers were vaccinated with 5x10<sup>9</sup>vp of ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313. The next four volunteers were recruited into Group 2A (vaccinated with 5x10<sup>10</sup>vp ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313, eight volunteers to Groups 2B (vaccinated with 5x10<sup>10</sup>vp of ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313 followed by 1x10<sup>8</sup>pfu of MVA Pfs25-IMX313) and the last nine volunteers into Group 2C (one volunteer from Group 2C withdrew and was replaced) (vaccinated with 5x10<sup>10</sup>vp of ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313 followed by 2x10<sup>8</sup>pfu of MVA Pfs25-IMX313). 19 females and 7 males were enrolled into the study. The mean age of volunteers was 31 years (range 21 – 50 years), and 22 volunteers completed follow-up. Vaccinations began on 12<sup>th</sup> October 2015 and all follow-up visits were completed by 25<sup>th</sup> May 2017. All vaccinees received their ChAd63 Pfs25-IMX313 immunizations as scheduled. One volunteer in Group 2C withdrew before receiving their MVA Pfs25-IMX313 immunization (after the D28 follow-up visit) and was replaced, as permitted in the study protocol. There were two further withdrawals prior to the final D240 follow-up visit – one in Group 2B and one in Group 2C.</p>

              <p>Successful malaria vaccines that can contribute to malaria elimination will also need to have an impact on malaria transmission. In order to break the cycle of malaria transmission, TBVs will require mass administration to a broad population. Thus, developing a TBV with highly satisfactory safety profile and a formulation with minimally perceived risk are both mandatory for rapid clinical development. The results in our study showed the ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313 vaccine formulation demonstrated a favorable safety profile, being well tolerated at all dose levels, with most local and systemic adverse events being mild in severity, no apparent increase in adverse events with boost vaccination, and no participants withdrawn due to adverse events. Reactogenicity of the ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313 vector was similar to that seen consistently with the same doses of vectored vaccines encoding the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic malaria antigens (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Thus, our study supports the safety of clinical use of ChAd63/MVA delivery. In addition, confirming previous report in humans (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), no antibody or T cell-mediated cross-reactivity was detected in any of the study groups to the oligomerisation domain of human C4bp, which is likely due to the limited similarity between the IMX313 and human C4bp (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p>
              <p>The ChAd63/MVA heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen induced both B and T cell responses and a modest level of anti-Pfs25 serum IgG titers. The ChAd63/MVA delivery platform has routinely been shown to induce a mixed antigen-specific CD4+/CD8+ T cell response in humans (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Similar to data in other <italic>P. falciparum</italic> antigen studies in humans using these vaccine vectors (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), the results presented here show that IFN-γ T cell responses were induced and peaked at median levels of greater than 2,000 SFU/million PBMCs following the MVA boost. The contribution of T cell responses to anti-Pfs25 immunity still remains unclear. However, a recent study, using Pfs25 encapsulated into synthetic vaccine particles as a vaccine in nonhuman primates, demonstrated that Pfs25-specific T cells may play a role in blocking malaria parasite transmission, by stimulating increased Ab avidity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, another study demonstrated that the antibody response against Pfs25 was enhanced by carrier protein-dependent T-cell priming (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), suggesting that effector T cells may be important to induce the optimal antibody response against Pfs25.</p>
              <p>In agreement with our preclinical data in mice (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the ChAd63/MVA prime-boost regimen also induced anti-Pfs25 specific serum IgG antibody responses in healthy malaria-naive adult volunteers. Around 50% of participants had detectable antibody responses after the prime, with rapid boosting achieved after MVA Pfs25-IMX313 administration, when antigen-specific antibodies were induced in all volunteers. Boosting with the higher dose of MVA Pfs25-IMX313 (Group 2C) did not increase the antibody concentrations significantly, suggesting that beyond a certain vaccine dose threshold, the immunogenicity of MVA Pfs25-IMX313 does not improve. However, in another clinical study where malaria-naïve healthy adults received up to four doses of Pfs25-EPA conjugates formulated with Alhydrogel (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), the anti-Pfs25 antibody concentration was 10-fold higher compared to the level we observed in this study, suggesting that recombinant protein-in-adjuvant formulations may be superior over viral vectored vaccines in inducing antibody responses against mosquito stage malaria parasites.</p>
              <p>We subsequently assessed the functional anti-parasitic antibody activity using the SMFA. These findings demonstrate weak transmission-reducing activity of antibodies in the serum of human volunteers vaccinated by ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313, when only one of sixteen vaccinated volunteers showed significant reduction in transmission activity. The TRA values of individual sera were low and highly variable, but weakly correlated with antibody concentrations measured by ELISA. However, oocyst counts in infected mosquitoes in the field are naturally much lower, in the range of 2–10 (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), therefore the measured <italic>ex-vivo</italic> level of inhibition of oocyst development in the SMFA might be an under-estimation of the effect that could be achieved in the field challenge setting.</p>
              <p>In contrast to the clinical trial data, our preclinical data in mice, confirmed that, in response to the same vaccines used in this clinical trial, high-titer functional anti-Pfs25 antibodies were induced, achieving extremely effective transmission-blocking activity. Consequently, information obtained from animal studies which assess efficacy of Pfs25 as a TBV candidate may not faithfully predict the results of human immunization. Notably in this regard, Cheru et al. demonstrated that the concentration of anti-Pfs25 human antibodies needed to inhibit 50 percent of oocyst development (IC50) in the membrane feeding assay varied among species, reporting that at least a 5-fold higher concentration of anti-Pfs25 human IgG antibodies (85.6µg/ml) was needed in comparison to mouse anti-Pfs25 IgG concentration (15.9 µg/ml) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In another Phase I clinical trial, following immunization with Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel<sup>®</sup>, the IC50 was estimated to be 57.2 μg/ml (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In our study, a maximum of approximately 10µg/ml anti-Pfs25 antibodies were induced in the human serum, providing an explanation as to why transmission blocking activity was not observed by the SMFA in this clinical trial.</p>
              <p>The lack of significant inhibition of oocyst intensity following ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313 makes further progression of this vaccination unlikely. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the need to explore the immunological basis for the inefficient TRA conferred by the ChAd63/MVA Pfs25-IMX313 vaccine, with a goal to improve future TBV immunization strategies. It will be of importance to further characterize the cellular and antibody responses, as it seems likely that differences in antibody function, avidity, IgG subclass profile, fine epitope specificity, as well as the potential requirement for tailored T-helper cell responses may all explain the weak inhibition of parasite growth mediated by this vaccine. With regards to other vaccine candidates, whilst a Phase I clinical trial of Pfs25 protein using Montanide ISA-51adjuvant had to be stopped due to safety issues (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), other Phase I studies in healthy adults (using either the plant-produced Pfs25 virus-like particles or Pfs25H-EPA conjugate vaccine with Alhydrogel<sup>®</sup>) suggested that a more immunogenic formulation is needed to effectively interrupt malaria transmission (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). When Pfs25H-EPA in Alhydrogel<sup>®</sup> was further tested in a naturally exposed population, it induced significant functional activity that blocked parasite transmission in a laboratory assay; however, this activity was only seen at peak titers after four vaccine doses, and antibody titers rapidly waned (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Recent data from a clinical trial testing Pfs25 and Pfs230 conjugated to EPA reported that anti-Pfs230 antibodies have better functional activity than anti-Pfs25 antibodies (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). This highlights the need for testing additional antigens in clinical trials as pre-clinical animal studies are unable to underscore these differences.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, these prior trials in congruence with our study, suggest that transmission blocking immunity in humans using a Pfs25-based vaccine is feasible, but immunogenicity needs to be improved for this antigen, if 10x higher antibody concentrations are to be achieved, allowing this to be an effective constituent of a future multi-component malaria vaccine. New strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and well-tolerated formulations that consistently induce higher responses of longer duration are required, especially as Pfs25 is not naturally presented to the human immune system, natural boosting will not occur Alternate approaches, such as particulate delivery to improve immunogenicity and epitope-display, as well as alterations in schedule and dosing to improve qualitative and quantitative responses are being explored (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Although efficacy is too low for this vaccine to have a role in public health in its present form, Pfs25 may be combined with other TBV, or pre-erythrocytic and/or erythrocytic vaccines which could permit use of more contemporary adjuvant formulations, with a potential to confer malaria protection.</p>
