                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA) trial evaluated an
enhanced emergency care pathway which aimed to facilitate thrombolysis in
hospital. A pre-planned health economic evaluation was included. The main
results showed no statistical evidence of a difference in either
thrombolysis volume (primary outcome) or 90-day dependency. However,
counter-intuitive findings were observed with the intervention group showing
fewer thrombolysis treatments but less dependency.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Aims</title>
                  <p>Cost-effectiveness of the PASTA intervention was examined relative to
standard care.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A within trial cost-utility analysis estimated mean costs and
quality-adjusted life years over 90 days’ time horizon. Costs were derived
from resource utilization data for individual trial participants.
Quality-adjusted life years were calculated by mapping modified Rankin scale
scores to EQ-5D-3L utility tariffs. A post-hoc subgroup analysis examined
cost-effectiveness when trial hospitals were divided into compliant and
non-compliant with recommendations for a stroke specialist thrombolysis
rota.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The trial enrolled 1214 patients: 500 PASTA and 714 standard care. There was
no evidence of a quality-adjusted life year difference between groups [0·007
(95% CI: −0·003 to 0·018)] but costs were lower in the PASTA group [−£1473
(95% CI: −£2736 to −£219)]. There was over 97.5% chance that the PASTA
pathway would be considered cost-effective. There was no evidence of a
difference in costs at seven thrombolysis rota compliant hospitals but costs
at eight non-complaint hospitals costs were lower in PASTA with more
dominant cost-effectiveness.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Analyses indicate that the PASTA pathway may be considered cost-effective,
particularly if deployed in areas where stroke specialist availability is
limited.</p>

              <p>Intravenous thrombolysis for ischaemic stroke is a cost-effective treatment, but
large variations in provision exist.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Previous studies have described
improvements in the volume and/or speed of treatment following the introduction of
ambulance pre-notification,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> multidisciplinary training<sup><xref rid="bibr4-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and a higher priority response for suspected stroke,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> but none have reported the economic impact of a pre-hospital intervention
intended to promote thrombolysis delivery.</p>
              <p>The Paramedic Acute Stroke Treatment Assessment (PASTA) multicenter cluster
randomized controlled trial examined whether an enhanced paramedic emergency stroke
assessment pathway for patients presenting within 4 hours of stroke onset could
improve thrombolysis volume (primary outcome) when compared to standard care
(SC).<sup><xref rid="bibr6-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Secondary
outcomes included dependency at day 90 after stroke (modified Rankin Score (mRS))
and resource utilization data for a pre-planned health economic analysis. The PASTA
intervention comprised additional prehospital information collection, a structured
hospital handover, practical assistance after handover, a pre-departure care
checklist, and clinician feedback.</p>
              <p>Although there was no statistical evidence of a difference between the trial groups
for the proportion of patients who received thrombolysis (primary outcome), contrary
to the anticipated effect of the intervention, less people received treatment in the
PASTA group [PASTA: 197/500 (39.4%) versus SC: 319/714 (44.7%); adjusted Odds Ratio
(aOR) 0·81 (95% CI: 0·61–1·08); <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0·15].<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> There was also no statistical evidence of a difference between the trial
groups in dependency at day 90 after stroke (modified Rankin Score (mRS)) grades
3–6); however, counter-intuitive to the lower thrombolysis rate, fewer patients were
dependent in the PASTA group [PASTA: 313/489 (64.0%) versus SC: 461/690 (66.8%); aOR
0.86 (95% CI: 0.60–1.20); <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.39]. These unexpected findings led
to a post-hoc analysis to explore how stroke specialist availability impacted upon
thrombolysis treatment. At 8/15 trial hospitals that were not fully compliant with a
national recommendation for specialist input into all thrombolysis decisions, there
was a significant 9.8% reduction in thrombolysis in the PASTA group compared to SC
[99/276 (35.9%) PASTA versus 105/230 (45.7%) SC; unadjusted OR 0·67 (95% CI:
0·47–0·95); <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0·03]. Whereas for the 7/15 hospitals that were
compliant, there was no evidence of a difference in thrombolysis rates [98/224
(43.8%) PASTA vs. 214/484 (44·2%) SC; unadjusted OR 0·98 (95% CI: 0·71–1·35);
<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0·91]. We proposed a hypothesis that structured handover of
additional information and/or a multidisciplinary checklist improved the selection
of patients for thrombolysis, particularly in hospitals with reduced specialist availability.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Cost-effectiveness results showing a similar pattern would be consistent with
this theory.</p>

multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial was hosted by three UK ambulance
services (North East, North West and Wales) and 15 Hyperacute Stroke Units
(HASUs). Clusters were individual paramedics based within ambulance stations
pre-randomized to PASTA training or continuing SC. Paramedics at PASTA stations
had to successfully complete training prior to their involvement in the trial
(accessed online). Paramedics at SC stations were advised that their routinely
recorded clinical data would be used in a research study.</p>
                <p>Patients were identified and recruited to the trial by hospital staff after
completion of the thrombolysis assessment in participating HASUs. Eligible
patients were those where a hospital specialist confirmed a stroke diagnosis and
a study paramedic had attended within 4 h of symptom onset. Written consent was
obtained. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving
thrombolysis. Secondary outcomes included key time intervals across the
emergency stroke pathway and day 90 mRS. The study sample size calculation was
1149 participants which provided 90% power to detect a change from 43% to 53% of
study eligible patients receiving thrombolysis.</p>
                <p>The National Research Ethics Committee North East – Newcastle and North Tyneside

              <p>This economic evaluation has shown that the PASTA trial group had lower costs than
standard care and when costs were considered alongside data on QALY difference,
there was a very high chance that the PASTA intervention would be cost-effective
across all threshold values for society’s willingness to pay. This finding was
consistent across all sensitivity analyses. The subgroup analyses indicated that
cost-effectiveness was particularly likely across services with specialist
availability below the level recommended by national guidelines.</p>
              <p>Whilst the lower costs were in part related to fewer thrombolysis treatments in the
PASTA group, there were also savings observed in other aspects of care including
length of stay, rehabilitation and social care. These latter findings are consistent
with the direction of the QALY difference between the groups, as patients with
better health would require lower costs for these resources.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> It is surprising, however, that patients were generally in better health and
incurred fewer care costs in the PASTA group when there was no statistical evidence
of a difference in thrombolysis rate (primary outcome) and indeed fewer thrombolysis
treatments were observed.</p>
              <p>We have previously hypothesized that the counter-intuitive main trial observations of
a lower thrombolysis rate and better health outcomes in the PASTA group may be
explained by a theory that the PASTA intervention led to greater caution during
patient selection for thrombolysis when the benefit to risk ratio was borderline and
thereby this avoided futile treatment and lowered the risk of harm from adverse events.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Other aspects of acute care might also have been performed better amongst the
intervention group if PASTA generally reinforced adherence to acute care guidelines.
As the lower thrombolysis rate was particularly evident across services with
specialist availability below the level recommended by national guidelines, the
relative inexperience of non-specialists may routinely lead to over-rather than
under-treatment of borderline cases when weighing up complex information under time
pressure. Such behavior may have been moderated by the more detailed and structured
content of the enhanced paramedic assessment including details about bleeding risk
(e.g. recent surgery and anticoagulant medication) and pre-stroke dependency.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In non-stroke specialties, there is already evidence that simple tools to
structure paramedic to ED handover<sup><xref rid="bibr20-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and multidisciplinary care

the quality of care. As the trial findings were unexpected, we did not collect
detailed information about individual treatment decisions and additional
interventions which would be needed to confirm our theory; however, we believe that
both the main and post-hoc health economic analyses are consistent with and provide
support to this suggestion.</p>
              <p>Interpretation of trials with a neutral primary outcome yet dominant
cost-effectiveness is variable with some authors reporting that the intervention
should be adopted but others stating uncertainty or favoring the control.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The PASTA trial is further complicated when the counter-intuitive nature of
the main trial observations are considered. The results of the health economic
analyses could of course be due to chance as the study was not powered to detect
differences in costs, QALYs, and cost-effectiveness. However, as PASTA was a large
trial across multiple hospital sites and confidence intervals for costs and QALYs
were relatively narrow, there is a very high likelihood that the PASTA intervention
would be considered cost-effective even though the underlying mechanism requires
further investigation. As cost-effectiveness was shown for &gt;97.5% of willingness
to pay scenarios, this is analogous to a one-sided <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> value
&lt;0.025 that cost-effectiveness would be acceptable.</p>
              <p>The main strength of our study was the use of a randomized controlled cluster design
involving large numbers of patients across multiple HASUs operating under the same
National Clinical Guidelines and costing frameworks. The main limitation of the
economic analysis is that utility values were estimated using published algorithms
for mapping mRS scores on to the EQ-5D rather than being based on responses to the
EQ-5D collected directly from participants. However, the algorithm used has been
well validated and it is reassuring that conclusions did not change when an
alternative utility algorithm was applied. Although the QALY difference found was
small and therefore potentially prone to measurement error, the value reflects the
entire trial population whereas only a proportion of patients received thrombolysis,
which itself is a treatment that only benefits or harms a proportion of those who
are treated. Consequently, it may not be surprising that the QALY difference found
was small. In addition, follow-up was short term at 90 days whereas QALY gain may be
greater over a longer period as patients in better health by day 90 are likely to be
those with a changed recovery trajectory which would translate into additional
further gain over time.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-17474930211006302" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> It should also be acknowledged that the study took a UK
personal social care perspective, and the findings may not apply in other healthcare
settings.</p>
              <p>This is the first study to formally evaluate the 90-day cost-effectiveness of a
paramedic-led process to improve outcomes during emergency care of stroke patients
and illustrates the importance of considering economic consequences of complex
interventions. Further investigation is required to understand the specific effects
upon clinical decisions and care delivery, but our data indicate that the PASTA
pathway is likely to be a cost-effective intervention, particularly if it is
deployed in areas where hospital stroke specialist availability is limited.</p>
