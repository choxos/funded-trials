                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Compared with the rest of the UK and Western Europe, England has high rates of the infectious disease tuberculosis (TB). TB is curable, although treatment is for at least 6 months and longer when disease is drug resistant. If patients miss too many doses (non-adherence), they may transmit infection for longer and the infecting bacteria may develop resistance to the standard drugs used for treatment. Non-adherence may therefore risk both their health and that of others. Within England, certain population groups are thought to be at higher risk of non-adherence, but the factors contributing to this have been insufficiently determined, as have the best interventions to promote adherence. The objective of this study was to develop a manualised package of interventions for use as part of routine care within National Health Services to address the social and cultural factors that lead to poor adherence to treatment for TB disease.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This study uses a mixed-methods approach, with six study components. These are (1) scoping reviews of the literature; (2) qualitative research with patients, carers and healthcare professionals; (3) development of the intervention; (4) a pilot randomised controlled trial of the manualised intervention; (5) a process evaluation to examine clinical utility; and (6) a cost analysis.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>This study received ethics approval on 24 December 2018 from Camberwell St. Giles Ethics Committee, UK (REC reference 18/LO/1818). Findings will be published and disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, published in an end of study report to our funder (the National Institute for Health Research, UK) and presented to key stakeholders.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Against a background of rising tuberculosis (TB) in the 1990s and 2000s, the need for a comprehensive approach to TB control in England was deemed necessary by Public Health England and the National Health Service (NHS) England. In January 2015, these bodies jointly launched the ‘Collaborative Tuberculosis Strategy for England 2015–2020’.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This seeks to reduce TB incidence, decrease health inequalities and ultimately contribute to international efforts to eliminate TB as a public health problem. Ensuring that people can take all of their medication as prescribed is one of the strategy’s priorities, as poor adherence to treatment for TB is a driver of worse patient outcomes,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2–9</xref> increases the risk of transmission (due to delayed sputum culture conversion)<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and can promote the development of drug resistance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 11–16</xref> Subsequent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance noted the lack of robust TB research in this area.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Barriers to optimal adherence to treatment for TB may occur for a number of reasons. These include</p>

                <list-item>

              <p>Non-adherence is not a single issue and may take various forms, for example, suboptimal implementation (skipping doses) or stopping treatment early (eg, as soon as a patient feels better.).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
              <p>Although a series of studies have been undertaken to define the population groups most at risk of non-adherence,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> it is currently difficult, prior to starting medication, to identify who may struggle with taking treatment as prescribed. To date, methods to support treatment address some, but not all, of the important underlying reasons for poor adherence. For example, the WHO’s recent focus on digital technologies reflects our attention on individual-level determinants of adherence and reminder/observation-based systems<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>; far less research has addressed the social and structural barriers to staying on TB treatment.</p>
              <p>In the UK, the development of an intervention to support adherence to treatment that is sensitive to the individual’s cultural background and social circumstances, and can be routinely delivered within the NHS, is critical. To this purpose, a mixed-methods, patient-centred, approach to the study of the modifiable factors that influence patients’ adherence to treatment of TB is required.</p>

              <p>This study uses a mixed-methods approach. There are six subsections, reflecting the six objectives: (1) scoping review and conceptual framework, (2) formative research, (3) development of intervention, (4) pilot study, (5) process evaluation and (6) cost analysis and future work. Although the different elements are described separately further, the research activities for each will overlap, and some will run concurrently.

                <p>These questions will be answered through the three following reviews:</p>

                  <p>In line with findings from the scoping review, we will develop topic guides for qualitative interviews exploring current models of TB service delivery in the study sites, providers’ views on the barriers and facilitators for treatment adherence, and TB patients’ and their family members’ experiences of starting and staying on treatment.

                  <p>Adults (aged 18 and over) who are currently taking or recently completed treatment will be identified by the local TB service at four UK sites (Southampton, Edinburgh, Central London and East London)) and will be asked to take part in the study. The services have been chosen for their patient diversity, geographical spread and as reflecting the national TB picture. The patient group will be enriched with people who have been poorly adherent to treatment, although we will also include patients who report full adherence so that we can capture what may have enabled them to take treatment as prescribed. With patient consent, family members and/or carers will also be approached and asked to participate.</p>
                  <p>Health and social care workers from both primary and secondary care settings will be directly approached by researchers and invited to be interviewed. All those approached will be aged 18 or over and involved in TB management and care.</p>

                  <p>Once the intervention is developed, proof of concept is required within the real world. This will be undertaken using a non-blinded cluster randomised pilot study that compares the manualised intervention to the usual standard of care in four London clinics treating TB. Two clinics will be randomly allocated to the intervention and two to standard of care. In the latter, the amount of support provided to patients is based on perceived need, as identified by a nurse-led review and a needs assessment. Most patients will have supported self-administered therapy, while others will be offered DOT and/or VOT if this is felt to be appropriate. We anticipate enrolment to commence in January 2020.</p>
                  <p>All consecutive patients aged 18 or over who are about to start treatment for TB, irrespective of the site of disease, will be approached to take part in the study. We will exclude individuals who are unable to provide informed consent, those already on treatment and those who are not expected to live for the duration of the study (a minimum of 6 months from starting treatment). Within the pilot study, it is essential to capture the entire treatment period for each patient in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Due to the nature of the TB patient population in the UK, patients are likely to include people at greater risk of poor adherence, such as migrants newly arrived in the UK, people whose first language is not English, people with a mental health disorder, people taking immunosuppressive therapy or known to have immunodeficiency, those with a previous history of treatment for TB, or poor adherence with anti-TB medication, and people with a current or previous history of drug or alcohol misuse.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of the pilot study was not formal hypothesis testing. Given this, a target sample size of 80 patients enrolled (20 per site) was identified for the pilot study as providing useful information that can help determine whether the intervention will be deliverable within a clinical setting. It will also guide the development of a possible larger definitive study using the intervention. The four TB clinics of interest (in East and North London) each treat in excess of 60 relevant patients per annum.</p>
                  <p>Based on usage of DOT within the clinic populations seen at the treatment sites (ie, individuals currently identified as needing adherence support), we estimate that around 33% of patients will be at risk of non-adherence. Taking this as a minimum (as the manualised intervention is likely to be more sensitive than current risk assessments), we would expect that at least 26 of the 80 patients recruited will be identified as requiring adherence support. This sample size allows us to measure consent to enrolment for 80 individuals, data completeness for adherence and treatment outcomes for 80 individuals, data on acceptability and feasibility of the intervention package for around 40 individuals, and data on acceptability and feasibility of adherence support for at least 26 individuals (13 receiving the manualised intervention and 13 standard care).</p>

                  <title>Analysis and interpretation</title>
                  <p>Where possible, univariable analyses will be undertaken to compare each outcome measure listed between study arms (intervention and control). For the primary outcome (adherence), the mean percentage value will be reported by arm (intervention and control) and histograms will be used to describe the distribution of values by study arm. Binary secondary outcomes will be reported by the proportion of individuals achieving the outcome within each arm. The need to adjust for clustering by site and clinical care provider will be assessed using the cluster summary method (a t-test) to compare the cluster means or proportions (as appropriate, between arms). An assessment of the balance in baseline characteristics between the study arms will also be conducted. If randomisation has failed to evenly distribute key characteristics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity or other factors identified as important during the scoping reviews), then the cluster means or proportions will be adjusted for these differences before applying the t-test. This two-stage approach to analysis is described by Hayes and Moulton.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We recognise that adherence data may be highly skewed and thus may require compensatory analytical approaches.</p>
                  <p>The analysis of the first three of our secondary outcomes will address the feasibility of a definitive trial following a similar design to the pilot. Analysis of secondary outcomes 4–6 addresses the intervention, and complements the process evaluation (see below). Analysis of the primary outcome and final secondary outcomes around treatment adherence and completion provides initial information—given the modest sample size—concerning the effectiveness of the intervention, and may assist the sample size calculation for the definitive trial. They can also offer an alert in the unlikely event that the intervention is harmful.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our study will develop and pilot a manualised intervention to improve adherence to treatment for TB in the UK using a mixed-methods, patient-centred and provider-informed approach. This will enable us to begin to understand what motivates patients’ treatment behaviour, while ensuring deliverability within the NHS. Our work is based on a robust understanding of the evidence on social, cultural and personal factors that influence adherence, and the interventions that are most effective in addressing these. The study reflects the geographical spread of TB in the UK and captures not only patient and expert clinical and academic experience but also that of family and carers to develop the intervention. A key feature of the study is the coproduction of a pragmatic and easy-to-use tool that uses the best evidence on adherence and allows its application in the clinic setting in a dynamic and iterative way.</p>
              <p>Although the final pilot study may be limited to a relatively small sample size, it is hoped that its broad patient-centred perspective will make a useful contribution to our understanding of, and ability to deal effectively with, the risks of non-adherence to TB treatment in a population that can find this challenging. As many of the factors influencing adherence are likely to be generalisable to patients with other conditions in both high and low resource settings, this study also has the potential to inform adherence interventions in other disease areas.</p>
