                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Patients with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) have limited treatment options with historically poor outcomes. We investigated treatment with 3 oral drugs, bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L), (B-Pa-L), with TB bactericidal activity and little pre-existing resistance.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Nix-TB is an open label single arm study ongoing at three South African sites evaluating the safety and efficacy of B-Pa-L for 26 weeks for extensively drug-resistant TB or treatment intolerant /non-responsive multidrug-resistant TB. We present the efficacy and safety outcomes for all 109 patients enrolled in the trial followed to the predefined primary endpoint, six months after the end of treatment.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>In the intent to treat analysis, 98 patients (90%), (95% CI 82.7-94.9%) had a favourable outcome at 6 months after the end of treatment. Six patients died during the early stages of treatment, one withdrew during treatment, one died during follow-up without evidence of relapse, one relapsed, one relapsed and subsequently died during follow up and one was lost to follow-up. The expected linezolid toxicities of peripheral neuropathy (experienced by 81% of patients) and myelosuppression (48%), while common, were manageable, often requiring reductions of dose and/or interruptions in linezolid.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>The vision of the End TB strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) is for a world free of tuberculosis (TB) by the year 2035.[<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A potential threat to this is the lack of effective treatment for intolerant or non-responsive multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB, with resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB, MDR-TB with additional resistance to any fluoroquinolone and at least 1 injectable (amikacin, capreomycin, or kanamycin)).[<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p>
              <p>The treatment of MDR-TB, at the time of starting the trial ranged from 18 months to over 2 years, with some patients receiving up to 7 medications including a second-line injectable. Intolerance to these regimens is high with 45% of patients having moderate to severe adverse events.[<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] XDR-TB patients had few treatment options with no standard treatment regimen.

                <p>Participants aged 14 years and above were eligible for enrollment. The major inclusion criteria were: pulmonary XDR-TB or MDR-TB documented on culture or molecular test within 3 months prior to screening with drug resistance documented by phenotypic or genotypic tests followed by, in the MDR-TB cases, documented non-response to treatment with an available regimen for 6 months or more prior to enrolment, or inability to continue a second-line drug regimen due to documented drug intolerance. HIV-infected participants having a CD4+ count &gt; 50 cells/μL could be enrolled and appropriate antiretroviral treatment given (See Supplementary material (S1)). Participants with baseline peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or 4 were excluded. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in the Protocol (Supplementary material).

                <p>Twelve patients had transaminase increases; 12 had an ALT elevation and 11 an AST elevation greater than 3 times the upper limits of normal (ULN). Two of these had ALT and AST elevations of &gt;3 × ULN as well as direct and total bilirubin elevations of &gt;2 × the ULN. In both cases the study drug regimen was interrupted. Eight patients had the regimen interrupted for hepatic adverse events, but all resumed and completed the full 26 weeks of treatment.

              <p>A favourable outcome 6 months after the completion of therapy was found in 98 patients (90%), including 63 (89%) XDR-TB patients. Thirty-eight patients enrolled in the Nix-TB Trial had MDR-TB, with 35 (92%) favourable outcomes.</p>
              <p>One of the limitations of this study is that there was no randomized control group. At the time of implementing this protocol, there was no standard regimen for the treatment of XDR-TB. Mortality was extremely high, with long term cure below 20% in reports from South Africa, and a single arm trial was therefore warranted. However, during the course of this study both bedaquiline and linezolid have been increasingly used to treat MDR and XDR-TB , and the WHO recently published guidelines that recommend these 2 drugs be used first line to treat patients with MDR-TB over an 18 month course of therapy.[<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Bedaquiline has been shown recently in a programmatic setting to reduce overall mortality when added to treatment for MDR- and XDR-TB.[<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Patients with XDR-TB treated in Cape Town, South Africa at one of the sites of the Nix-TB Trial have reported cure rates that were below 20% prior to the use of bedaquiline or linezolid and that have improved to a rate of 66% more recently when bedaquiline and linezolid (81% of the 68 patients) were added to their regimen.[<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Of note, these patients were newly diagnosed and treated for 24 months with a median of 8 drugs.</p>
              <p>Another limitation of this study was that it was conducted in only one country which potentially limits the generalizability of the findings. South Africa was selected as it has a robust regulatory framework, good clinical trial capacity and historically poor outcomes in XDR-TB. In addition, there is a high background prevalence of HIV infection.</p>
              <p>The primary endpoint was based on treatment failure at 6 months after the end of treatment as most relapses occur in this period.[<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The secondary endpoint of treatment failure is measured at 24 months after the end of treatment. It is reassuring that to date there has been only one further relapse among the 47 who have reached this time point in the trial.</p>
              <p>For both individuals with TB and national TB programs, a shorter duration of treatment that is effective is hugely beneficial. Visits to health care facilities place a financial and time burden on patients. In addition income loss often constitutes the largest financial risk for patients. For the TB program, a shorter duration of treatment translates into a lower number of patients in care at any one time with the potential to reduce loss to follow up.</p>
              <p>There was a high rate of adverse events related to linezolid in the trial. Eighty percent of the participants reported peripheral neuropathy and almost half had evidence of haematological toxicity. While patients taking this regimen clearly need careful monitoring, these toxicities were manageable in this setting. All eight patients who had the regimen interrupted for hepatic adverse events, resumed and completed the full 26 weeks of treatment.</p>
              <p>Nix-TB is the first study to treat XDR-TB and complicated MDR-TB with a regimen consisting of three oral agents for just 26 weeks. Despite historically being a hard to treat patient group, treatment success was 90%, which is higher than even those of the standard of care (HRZE) therapy in modern drug sensitive (DS) TB trials.[<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p>
