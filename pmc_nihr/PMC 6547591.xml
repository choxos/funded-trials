                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Antidepressants are used both for treating acute episodes and for prophylaxis to prevent future episodes of depression, also called maintenance treatment. This article describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (ANTLER: ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession) to investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in UK primary care of continuing on long-term maintenance antidepressants compared with a placebo in preventing relapse of depression in those who have taken antidepressants for more than 9 months and who are currently well enough to consider stopping maintenance treatment.</p>

                  <title>Methods/design</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The ANTLER trial is an individually randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants are randomised to remain on active medication or to take an identical placebo after a tapering period of 2 months. Eligible participants are those who: are between the ages of 18 and 74 years; have had at least two episodes of depression; and have been taking antidepressants for 9 months or more and are currently taking citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg or mirtazapine 30 mg but are well enough to consider stopping their medication. The participants will be followed up at 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">The primary outcome will be the time in weeks to the beginning of the first episode of depression after randomisation. This will be measured using a retrospective version of the Clinical Interview Schedule—Revised administered at 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks.</p>
                  <p id="Par4">Secondary outcomes will include depressive and anxiety symptoms, adverse effects, withdrawal symptoms, emotional processing tasks, quality of life and the resources and costs used. We will also perform a cost-effectiveness analysis based on results of the trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par29">Depression is a major health problem that is not only debilitating to the individual but also to society, being the lead cause of disability worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Globally, more than 300 million people live with depression. Antidepressants are often a first-line treatment for depressive symptoms and are also used for maintenance treatment; that is, to prevent relapse once an individual has recovered. It has been estimated that, between 1993 and 2005, 90% of antidepressant prescriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] in the UK were used for maintenance. A more recent UK study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] has also demonstrated a steady increase between 2001 and 2012 in the duration of long-term treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The number of prescriptions for antidepressants has risen dramatically in recent years; increasing by around 7% per annum in the UK. Furthermore, antidepressant prescribing has shown a greater increase than drugs for any other therapeutic area, with over 65 million prescriptions being issued in England in 2016, at a cost of £266.6 million to the NHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] Similar increases in antidepressant prescribing have been observed in other high-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">Moreover, there are other considerations in addition to cost. Prolonged antidepressant treatment has been associated with common side effects such as weight gain, sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction. There are also reports of an association between antidepressants and severe adverse outcomes in older people such as stroke and transient ischaemic attack, although there is no evidence to say that the associations are causal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England recommends that antidepressant maintenance treatments should continue to be used for 2 years for those at risk of relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, they also recognise the uncertainty about the benefit of long-term maintenance treatment and recommend further research into its psychological and pharmacological effects.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The impact on relapse rates of continuing maintenance treatment in the first few months after remission has been achieved with antidepressant treatment has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the amount of evidence for a treatment period longer than 36 weeks is small. In the existing reviews, there were only three studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that have treated patients for more than 32 weeks. All three had methodological and statistical limitations due to either small sample size (e.g. Cook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], <italic>N</italic> = 15; Bialos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], <italic>N</italic> = 17; and Kupfer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], <italic>N</italic> = 20) or sample characteristics (e.g. Cook et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] sample compromised elderly males). A further weakness in the reviewed studies was that most were funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical companies can be imaginative in ways of manipulating their research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and there is evidence that they publish only half of their trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The studies were conducted in a variety of different health systems with antidepressant medication that is not currently used in the UK. Therefore, the results are difficult to generalise to the UK population.</p>
              <p id="Par34">There is some evidence that the number of previous episodes, a presence of residual depressive symptoms and female gender are associated with increased rates of relapse. However, there is no evidence that these factors are associated with the difference in relapse rates between maintenance antidepressant and placebo.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The long-term benefits of the ANTLER (ANTidepressants to prevent reLapse in dEpRession) trial may lead to improving treatment recommendations and guidance for general practitioners (GPs). As there is very limited evidence for effectiveness of maintenance treatment longer than 6 months, the ANTLER trial will refine our understanding of the costs and benefits of long-term maintenance therapy and therefore will help to inform patients and practitioners when treatment decisions regarding the duration of treatment are being discussed. If the results of the ANTLER trial demonstrate that long-term maintenance treatment proves ineffective, this will lead to benefits associated with reducing not only unnecessary treatment but also adverse effects and costs. On the other hand, if maintenance treatment proves effective, individuals who are not currently taking medication to prevent depressive relapse might benefit from antidepressant use.</p>
              <p id="Par36">The aim of the trial is to answer the following research question: ‘What is the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in UK primary care of continuing on long-term maintenance antidepressants compared with a placebo in preventing relapse of depression in those who have taken antidepressants for more than 9 months and who are now well enough to consider stopping maintenance treatment?’</p>
              <p id="Par37">The objective of the trial is to provide a valid and generalisable estimate of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants in UK primary care.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>The choice of trial medication</title>
                <p id="Par38">The choice of medication was guided by the pragmatics of recruitment and carrying out the study. We think it is important to compare the active treatment with a placebo in a condition such as depression with well-described placebo effects. Therefore, we wanted to minimise the number of antidepressants to make the manufacture and distribution of placebo easier. There are a large number of antidepressants all of which act on the monoamine systems, especially serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5HT) and noradrenaline. The tricyclic antidepressants are 5HT and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, although they tend also to have other pharmacological actions that increase the side effect burden. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants now are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine and fluoxetine. Other commonly used antidepressants include venlafaxine, which has both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) properties. Mirtazapine has a slightly different mode of action and is described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the net effect of its action is to increase serotonergic and to some extent noradrenaline transmission. Use of mirtazapine is increasing rapidly and accounted for 13% of prescriptions in England for antidepressants in 2013.</p>
                <p id="Par39">Due to marked pharmacological similarities between the antidepressants it is usually assumed that they share a common mode of action and any differences in efficacy are likely to be relatively minor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] of the different classes of antidepressants have found no evidence to suggest that the tricyclics, SSRIs and SNRIs differ in their effectiveness as a maintenance treatment.</p>
                <p id="Par40">We have chosen not to use paroxetine as it has a short half-life and is associated with a more marked withdrawal syndrome and might not be tolerated by some individuals when they are withdrawn after randomisation. Escitalopram is not widely used in primary care in the UK and has not been included in many primary care formularies. Venlafaxine tends to be used more by secondary care than primary care doctors, can be poorly tolerated and also has more marked withdrawal effects. Amitriptyline is often used for treatment of pain and insomnia, and much less often now as an antidepressant because it is less well tolerated than SSRIs and potentially more lethal in overdose. Moreover, amitriptyline is not recommended as a first-line antidepressant—we have omitted it here.</p>
                <p id="Par41">We will therefore recruit primary care patients who are on maintenance treatment with the SSRIs citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg. We have also included mirtazapine 30 mg given its increasing use. Together these medications currently comprise about 75% of all long-term antidepressant prescriptions in England (personal email communication with Prof. Irene Petersen) and are all licensed for treatment of depression.</p>

                <p id="Par42">The ANTLER trial is a double-blind, individually randomised, parallel group controlled trial. We will recruit individuals in primary care who are currently on one of four of the most commonly used antidepressant medications but are currently well enough to consider stopping medication. Participants will be recruited from primary care practices in four UK sites: London, Bristol, Southampton and York.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Our trial will compare continuing the antidepressant medication (citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg or mirtazapine 30 mg) with replacement of the medication with an identical placebo after a tapering period. The trial intervention will be for 52 weeks and we will follow up the participants at 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks.</p>

                  <p id="Par44">Eligible participants will be primary care patients who are being treated for depression; have had at least two episodes of depression; are aged 18–74 years; have been taking antidepressants for 9 months or more and are currently on citalopram 20 mg, sertraline 100 mg, fluoxetine 20 mg or mirtazapine 30 mg; and are well enough to consider stopping their antidepressant medication. We have a pragmatic approach to the ‘well enough’ definition and will not expect to have an accurate timeframe of how long patients have been feeling well prior to enrolment into the trial. To be eligible, participants must also have adhered to their medication. We will use the same criteria as used in the MIR trial to define adherence using a five-item self-report measure of compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; the questions are available from the authors on request.</p>

                  <p id="Par45">Participants will also be excluded if they meet internationally agreed (ICD-10) criteria for a depressive illness assessed using the CIS-R. GPs will be asked to exclude patients who have bipolar disorder, psychotic illness, dementia or a terminal illness; are unable to complete self-administered questionnaires in English; have contraindications for any of the prescribed medication; are concurrently enrolled in another investigational medicinal product (IMP) trial; are women who are currently pregnant or planning pregnancy or lactating; are using monoamine oxidase inhibitors; or have allergies to placebo excipients.</p>

                <p id="Par46">We plan to recruit 479 participants over 2 years from approximately 200 practices across our four research centres, based in England, using two methods: record search and in-consultation recruitment.</p>
                <sec id="Sec9">
                  <title>Method 1: record search</title>
                  <p id="Par47">GP practice staff or NHS employed Clinical Research Network (CRN) staff will carry out record searches to identify potentially eligible patients and write to these individuals so that they can consider joining the study. The mail-out procedure will involve an initial letter sent by the GP surgery to the identified patients, followed by a reminder invitation letter if there is no response. Those patients who reply positively to the invitation letter will be reviewed by their GP, who will inform the local Principal Investigator (PI) on inclusion/exclusion criteria from the patients’ medical notes. The GP could also decide that the person was unsuitable to take part in the trial on any other grounds.</p>

                  <p id="Par48">GPs will introduce the trial to suitable patients at consultation and ask for their permission for release of contact details to the study team. The information will be sent by secure email or fax to the study team. A study researcher will contact the patient to confirm eligibility for the trial and arrange the baseline visit.</p>

                <title>Screening of potential participants</title>
                <p id="Par49">Patients who have been identified by either method of recruitment will answer a depressive symptom questionnaire (PHQ-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) and questions on adherence to medication either over the phone, by post or by email. The PHQ-9 score will be used to indicate whether the individual is likely to meet the ICD-10 criteria for depressive illness at baseline, and therefore if the patient scores 15 and above they will not be invited to the baseline assessment. Potentially eligible patients will be invited for a baseline assessment that will establish any remaining eligibility criteria. The assessment will take place in the patient’s home, at their general practice or on university premises.</p>

              <sec id="Sec12">
                <title>Baseline assessment</title>
                <p id="Par50">At the baseline meeting, the researcher will explain the study in detail and obtain written informed consent for the baseline assessment. The potential participants will complete the following assessments: the Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to assess ICD-10 criteria for depression, past medical history questions including any physical illness contraindications and past psychiatric treatments, and sociodemographic and other background information. The participants will be asked for details of their prescribed medication and prior use of antidepressants.</p>
                <p id="Par51">Potential participants who do not have an ICD-10 primary diagnosis of depression using the CIS-R will be told that they are potentially eligible to enter the trial (pending confirmation by PI) and will be asked to provide further consent for trial participation.</p>
                <p id="Par52">All participants invited to a baseline assessment will also complete the following questionnaires: depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety symptoms GAD-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], EQ-5D-5L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), adverse effects of antidepressants (a modified Toronto Side Effects scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], adherence to study medication, health-related quality of life SF-12, and withdrawal symptoms based on the DESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Potential participants will be asked to perform computerised emotional processing tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Women of child-bearing age will carry out a pregnancy test.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Once the baseline assessment is complete, final eligibility status will be confirmed by the local PI.</p>

              <sec id="Sec13">
                <title>Randomisation procedure and unblinding</title>
                <p id="Par54">Following completion of the baseline assessment and provision of written consent, participants will be randomised using the automated randomisation service provided by Sealed Envelope (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sealedenvelope.com">https://sealedenvelope.com</ext-link>). The randomisation will be minimised by the four study centres, the four medications and the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline (two categories measured using the CIS-R). The dispensing pharmacy (University Hospitals Bristol Pharmacy) will be informed of the randomised allocation and post the medication by recorded delivery to either the participant’s home or GP surgery at regular 8-week intervals. The researcher will send a letter to the participant’s GP informing them of the patient’s enrolment into the trial. Trial participants, clinicians and all members of the research team will be blinded to the trial treatment allocation. Participants will be free to withdraw from the medication at any time.</p>
                <p id="Par55">Together with the study medication, participants will be provided with a contact card so that any treating clinician can be unblinded to treatment allocation in case of a medical emergency (‘emergency unblinding’) or early unblinding to enable treatment decisions. If unblinding is required, a formal request by a clinician will be made to the trial pharmacy (through the 24-h contact number provided on the contact card) that has a list of the participants’ treatment allocations. The treating physician will manage the medical emergency as appropriate upon receipt of the treatment allocation.</p>
                <p id="Par56">The PI or delegate will record any breaking of the code and reasons for doing so on the Case Report Form (CRF)/data collection tool and in the site file. Where possible, members of the research team should remain blinded. Those participants who have not required emergency or early unblinding will be unblinded on completion of the trial (‘routine unblinding’).

They will be randomised either to remaining on their current medication or to placebo. For those in the placebo group, in the first month they will take the same medication at half the dose (citalopram 10 mg, sertraline 50 mg, or mirtazapine 15 mg). In the second month they will take half the dose and placebo on alternate days, and from the third month until the end of the study they will take the placebo. There is no 10 mg capsule for fluoxetine so those taking fluoxetine at baseline who are allocated to the placebo arm will alternate between a 20 mg tablet and a placebo tablet for 1 month. During the second month they will take placebo as fluoxetine has a long half-life.</p>

                <title>Mechanistic outcomes</title>
                <p id="Par66">We included three computerised emotional processing tasks (described in the following) to investigate the neuropsychological markers of antidepressant action. It has been consistently found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] that antidepressants acutely affect performance even in healthy volunteers on emotion processing tasks, even though there is no subjective awareness of any change or improvement of mood. These markers of antidepressant response could be a factor that might be useful in predicting the likelihood of relapse.</p>
                <p id="Par67">The word recall task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] tests memory of socially rewarding and socially critical information. The participant is presented with 20 likeable (e.g. cheerful, honest) and 20 dislikeable (e.g. untidy, hostile) personality characteristic words on a laptop screen in a random order for 500 ms. Words are matched according to length, usage frequency and meaningfulness, and they differ at each time point. After each word, participants indicate whether they would ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ to hear someone describing them in this way by pressing a key on the keyboard. At the end of the task, participants are asked to recall as many words as possible in 2 min. This is a surprise recall task (at baseline), to test incidental memory. The number of positive and negative words accurately recalled (hits) and the number of false responses (intrusions) are also recorded.</p>
                <p id="Par68">In the go–no-go task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], each trial includes three events: the presentation of a fractal image; the presentation of a target; and a probabilistic outcome. At the beginning of each trial, one of four possible fractal images is presented on a computer screen, which indicates whether the best choice in a subsequent target detection task is a go (pressing a key on the keyboard) or a no-go (withholding a response to the target). The fractal also indicates the valence of any outcome dependent on the participant’s behaviour (reward/no reward or punishment/no punishment). The meaning of fractal images (go to win, no-go to win, go to avoid punishment, no-go to avoid punishment) is randomised across participants, and participants have to learn these by trial and error. Participants are informed that the correct choice for each fractal image is either a go (button press) or a no-go (withhold button press). Actions are required in response to a target circle that follows the fractal image. After a brief delay, the outcome is presented (an upward arrow indicates a win, a downward arrow indicates a loss and a horizontal bar indicates the absence of a win or a loss). On go-to-win trials, a button press is rewarded; on go to avoid punishment, a button press avoids punishment; in no-go to win, withholding a button press is rewarded; and in no-go to avoid losing trials, withholding a button press avoids punishment. The task consists of 240 trials in total (60 trial per condition). The participant can win between £1 and £10.</p>
                <p id="Par69">For the face task, prototypical ‘happy’ and ‘sad’ composite images were generated from 20 individual male faces showing a happy facial expression and the same individuals showing a sad expression from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], using established techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These were used as end-points of a linear morph sequence that changed in displayed emotion incrementally from unambiguously ‘happy’, through ambiguity, to unambiguously ‘sad’. The task has 15 images and each image is presented three times, resulting in 45 trials in total. Each stimulus is presented for 500 ms and followed by a pattern mask (250 ms) to disrupt any visual after images. Participants are required to judge faces from a morphed sequence as either sad or happy.</p>
                <p id="Par70">The results of the mechanistic outcome will not be presented in the main trial paper that will describe the primary and secondary outcomes, because these analyses do not address the primary aim of the trial, which is the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance antidepressants treatment compared with a placebo. The mechanistic outcomes will be published in a separate paper or papers after the main trial results have been published. The paper(s) will aim to investigate hypotheses concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant medication.</p>

Once participants have stopped their trial medication, they may not resume trial treatment. If participants withdraw, the reason for and type of withdrawal will be documented.</p>

The decision to withdraw will be based on factors such as depressive symptoms and suicidality and any other factor which the GP or PI thinks makes withdrawal in the best interests of the patient.</p>

Summary statistics for continuous variables will be the mean, median, SD, lower quartile and upper quartile, and will be reported appropriately according to distribution.</p>
                <p id="Par84">The primary outcome will be the time in weeks to the beginning of the first episode of depression after randomisation. The primary outcome will be assessed using a modified and shortened standardised psychiatric assessment (CIS-R) that will ask the participants retrospectively over the previous 3 months and will be used at follow-up points of 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. The retrospective CIS-R is based on five out of 14 CIS-R sections (depression, depressive ideas, concentration, sleep and fatigue), but asked retrospectively about symptoms at the worst point in the previous 3 months. The assessment also asks participants about the time before the assessment when the symptoms began and this is used to determine the time to relapse. This shortened CIS-R includes questions asking about depressive symptoms, such as restlessness, suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, feeling low for prolonged periods, unresponsiveness of mood, retardation, loss of sexual interest, lack of concentration, reduced self-esteem and feeling of guilt. An episode will be defined as those having two or more depressive symptoms included in the retrospective CIS-R for a period of at least 2 weeks. The precise definition will be included in the analysis plan.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Frank et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] provided a theoretical conceptualisation and rationale for definitions of the five stages (response, remission, recovery, relapse and recurrence) in the course of depressive illness. However, in practice it is challenging to distinguish between relapse and recurrence because assessments rely on retrospective recall and symptoms usually vary over time. We will therefore not differentiate whether the first episode of depression after randomisation is a relapse (a return of symptoms of an ongoing, although suppressed, episode) or recurrence (a new episode of depressive disorder).</p>
                <p id="Par86">We propose to analyse the primary outcome using an exact Cox proportional hazards model (to account for ties), adjusting for the depressive symptom score from the CIS-R at baseline.

              <p id="Par114">To our knowledge, the ANTLER trial will be the first large trial with a long follow-up of 12 months to investigate the effectiveness of antidepressants as maintenance treatment for patients who are already on long-term maintenance. Prof. Dee Mangin and the team carried out a similar trial in New Zealand in 2008, looking at maintenance vs gradual withdrawal of antidepressants in prevention of depression recurrence in primary care in patients with unipolar depressive disorder. The trial’s medication was fluoxetine and included patients (<italic>N</italic> = 263) who had been on antidepressants for 1 year or longer. It was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trail Registry: ACTRN12608000613303. The sample size was reduced after the Christchurch earthquakes in 2010–2011 when a decision to stop recruitment at the primary site (Christchurch) was made in consultation with the Data Safety Monitoring Board—all patients enrolled continued in the trial in Christchurch and other sites. The results have not yet been published. The ANTLER trial will provide UK data on a more representative sample of antidepressants. Utilising both trials’ data together would create an opportunity for an individual patient meta-analysis for greater precision of estimates.</p>
              <p id="Par115">The ANTLER trial looks at the four most commonly prescribed antidepressants in primary care and these are off patent and relatively inexpensive. Due to the pharmacological similarities, we believe the results of the trial will be applicable to all major classes of antidepressants.</p>
              <p id="Par116">The results of the trial will address an important aspect of current clinical practice, by providing a valid and generalisable estimate of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of long-term maintenance treatment with antidepressants in UK primary care. The trial participants will be recruited from a wide range of primary care settings across the four study centres, based in urban and rural, affluent and deprived areas across the UK, maximising the external validity of the findings (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par117">The trial began recruiting participants in March 2017 and recruitment will be ongoing until the end of February 2019. At the time of writing (September 2018), 370 participants have been randomised into the study. It is expected that data collection will be completed by February 2020.</p>
              <p id="Par118">This article describes protocol version 6 dated 3 August 2017; when all initial approvals (REC, HRA and MHRA) were received, the protocol was version 2 dated 22 February 2016. Following a substantial amendment, the protocol was amended with changes in the pharmacy arrangements, changes in Sponsor representative and a 6-week follow-up added, and it became version 5 dated 18 November 2016. As a result, when recruitment started the trial was following protocol version 5; since then it has been amended once to version 6 dated 3 August 2017: PHQ-9 assessment was removed from the eligibility criteria and instead is being used more flexibly at the screening stage to identify potentially eligible patients.</p>
