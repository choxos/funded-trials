                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Scabies is a significant contributor to global morbidity, affecting approximately 200 million people at any time. Scabies is endemic in many resource-limited tropical settings. Bacterial skin infection (impetigo) frequently complicates scabies infestation in these settings. Community-wide ivermectin-based mass drug administration (MDA) is an effective control strategy for scabies in island settings, with a single round of MDA reducing population prevalence by around 90%. However, current two-dose regimens present a number of barriers to programmatic MDA implementation. We designed the Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial to investigate whether one-dose MDA may be as effective as two-dose MDA in controlling scabies in high-prevalence settings.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>RISE is a cluster-randomised non-inferiority trial. The study will be conducted in 20 isolated villages in Western Province of Solomon Islands where population prevalence of scabies is approximately 20%. Villages will be randomly allocated to receive either one dose or two doses of ivermectin-based MDA in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective of the study is to determine if ivermectin-based MDA with one dose is as effective as MDA with two doses in reducing the prevalence of scabies after 12 months. Secondary objectives include the effect of ivermectin-based MDA on impetigo prevalence after 12 and 24 months, the prevalence of scabies at 24 months after the intervention, the impact on presentation to health facilities with scabies and impetigo, and the safety of one-dose and two-dose MDA.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Scabies is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by infestation with the mite <italic>Sarcoptes scabiei</italic> var. <italic>hominis</italic>. Scabies is a significant contributor to global morbidity, estimated to cause 455 million annual incident cases.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Transmission occurs primarily as a result of skin-to-skin contact (and rarely due to fomites) and is more common in overcrowded settings, including in many tropical environments where crowding and poverty are prevalent and access to treatment limited.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> The burden of disease is substantial in many Pacific Island Countries where scabies affects one in five people and up to one in two children.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>Scabies infestation causes intense itch and discomfort. Furthermore, it is responsible for a considerable proportion of bacterial skin infection (impetigo) in many resource-limited settings.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> Scabies causes a breach in the skin barrier from scabetic lesions and subsequent scratching, creating an entry point for bacteria, including <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>. Resulting impetigo can in turn cause severe infection and immune-mediated disease, including sepsis, glomerulonephritis and possibly rheumatic fever.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref></p>
              <p>Treatment guidelines for scabies recommend treatment of the infected individual as well as household contacts.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> Most guidelines recommend treatment with topical acaracides such as permethrin or benzoyl benzoate.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> These medications are effective, if applied to all affected areas for the correct duration, but re-infestation frequently occurs in highly endemic settings where individuals may be exposed to infected household or community members, many of whom may be asymptomatic.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Therefore, attention has shifted to simultaneous treatment of whole communities, including those without symptoms of infestation, to reduce prevalence and the rate of transmission.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This strategy of mass drug administration (MDA) has been used to successfully control a number of NTDs, including onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma and soil-transmitted helminths, and there is a growing body of evidence to support MDA for scabies control.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–22</xref></p>
              <p>Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug in the avermectin class that is active against the scabies mite. Ivermectin-based MDA for scabies involves offering ivermectin treatment to the whole community, with the exception of young children, pregnant women and others with a contraindication to ivermectin. Permethrin cream is offered as an alternative to ivermectin for these groups. Several studies in Pacific Island Countries with high-prevalence have shown ivermectin-based MDA can reduce the population prevalence of scabies by around 90%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 17 23</xref> The Skin Health Intervention Fiji Trial (SHIFT) study in Fiji was the first comparative study to demonstrate the effectiveness of ivermectin MDA for scabies control, finding a reduction in the population prevalence of scabies from 32% at baseline to less than 2% at 12 months.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These trials have all used an MDA strategy involving two doses of medication, given 7 to 14 days apart (either to the whole community or those with clinical signs of scabies).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 23</xref> This is consistent with clinical recommendations for treatment of individuals.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Ivermectin is known to lack ovicidal activity, therefore the second dose aims to kill newly hatched mites.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>In 2017, the WHO recognised scabies as a NTD, and identified the need for public health action to control scabies in endemic settings.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Neglected Tropical Diseases called for further research into control strategies for scabies and the development of guidelines for the public health use of avermectins.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p>
              <p>While ivermectin-based MDA shows great promise as a control strategy for scabies, the requirement for two doses of medication at each MDA round presents barriers to implementation. Drug and implementation costs are doubled compared with single-dose MDA. Distribution is more complex and integration with programmes for other NTDs is difficult. These challenges are amplified in remote island settings where the population is dispersed across difficult to reach villages and funding for programmes is limited. These hurdles may be prohibitive to widespread implementation of scabies control, particularly in low-income settings. Therefore, the optimum dosing strategy for MDA remains an important knowledge gap.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For this reason, we designed the Regimens of Ivermectin for Scabies Elimination (RISE) trial.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>The RISE trial is a prospective, open-label comparison of one dose versus two doses of ivermectin-based MDA for the population-level control of scabies (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Using a cluster-randomised design, 20 villages will be randomised to one of two intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation will occur at the village level, rather than the individual level, as the objective is to determine the dosing regimen for controlling scabies within whole communities. Randomisation minimises the possibility of the anticipated difference in the outcome between each group being confounded. A two-dose regimen is an appropriate comparator (rather than no-treatment or placebo) as two-doses of ivermectin-based MDA is the currently accepted dosing regimen. We chose a non-inferiority design because it is unlikely that a one-dose regimen would be superior in effectiveness to a two-dose regimen.</p>

                <title>Aims</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this study is to determine if ivermectin-based MDA with one dose is non-inferior to two doses in reducing the prevalence of scabies 12 months after the intervention. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of ivermectin-based MDA on: population prevalence of scabies after 24 months; population prevalence of impetigo after 12 and 24 months; the number of presentations to health clinics with scabies and impetigo before and after the intervention; the number of adverse events measured by passive surveillance in the 12 months after MDA in each study group. The trial will also be measuring outcomes related to the impact of ivermectin MDA on the prevalence and intensity of soil-transmitted helminths; however, this paper focusses on scabies and impetigo outcomes.</p>

              <sec id="s2-3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p>This study uses ivermectin-based MDA because the SHIFT trial in Fiji demonstrated the greatest reduction in scabies prevalence after ivermectin-based MDA.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Ivermectin is currently the only oral therapy available for scabies and it allows greater compliance than with topical therapy. Oral therapy can be directly observed, ensuring adherence to treatment. Although ivermectin only kills the mature scabies mite and not the eggs, a single dose of treatment simultaneously administered to a whole village may reduce transmission sufficiently to reduce population prevalence. A recent Cochrane review did not find a difference in efficacy of one dose of oral ivermectin compared with two doses of oral ivermectin, but confidence in the effect estimates was low-to-moderate, with poor reporting being a major limitation.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A retrospective study in Zanzibar of six rounds of annual single-dose ivermectin MDA for LF showed a 68% to 98% decline in clinical presentations and treatments for scabies, suggesting a one-dose strategy may significantly reduce transmission.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> By contrast, annual ivermectin MDA for LF did not reduce the prevalence of scabies in Tanzania where the baseline prevalence was less than 5%.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>

                <title>Study setting and participants</title>
                <p>The study will be conducted in Western Province of Solomon Islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2">figures 1 and 2</xref>). Solomon Islands is a nation in the South Pacific with a population of over 650 000 spread across 900 islands, a geography that presents many challenges for health service delivery.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Solomon Islands is classified as a least developed country. It is ranked 152 out of 189 on the Human Development Index.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The majority of the population depend on subsistence agriculture in rural locations. We chose Western Province for this study for several reasons: first, there is a high burden of scabies—a 2014 survey estimated an all-age scabies prevalence of 19.2%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; second, we expect that there will be relatively little mixing between villages because of the island geography of isolated villages with no road transport; third, there are many villages of appropriate population size (between 180 and 300) for the cluster-randomised design.</p>

Community awareness and the informed consent process will be conducted in Solomon Islands Pijin and study staff who speak the local regional language will be available to provide further information or clarification as required. Results of the study will be communicated to community leaders and members by the study team.</p>

                <p>Oral ivermectin will be offered to all participants, unless there is a contraindication to ivermectin. A dose of 200 µg/kg of ivermectin is recommended for the treatment of individuals with scabies.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 31</xref> We will aim to dose ivermectin within a range of 150 to 250 µg/kg, as this dose has been effective in previous trials.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> We will use 6 mg scored tablets. Doses will be rounded to the nearest 3 mg. The tablets will be accurately halved on the score line using a pill cutter as required. As weight scales are generally unsuitable for implementation of MDA, we will use dosing strategies appropriate for larger scale programmatic roll-out.</p>
                <p>We will use height-based dosing for children aged less than 15 years, with doses ranging from 3 mg to 12 mg, as is standard for MDA for onchocerciasis and LF.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Adults will receive a standard dose of 12 mg, with doses adjusted based on visual assessment of body shape (9 mg for adults assessed to be malnourished and 15 mg for adults assessed to be obese). Drug distribution staff will make these assessments based on a series of body shape silhouettes.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Dosing of medications for MDA based on physical appearance has been shown to be accurate and safe.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Staff will undergo training and validation for these dosing techniques. Ivermectin will be administered by trained study staff who will directly observe swallowing of the tablets.</p>
                <p>Topical permethrin 5% cream will be given to participants meeting exclusion criteria for ivermectin. Permethrin will be dosed according to clinical guidelines.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Participants or carers will be counselled to apply the cream to the whole body from the neck down (in infants cream should also be applied to the scalp) and to leave it for 8 to 14 hours, or 4 hours in infants less than 2 months of age.</p>

                <p>All participants will undergo assessment for symptoms and signs of scabies, impetigo and other skin disease.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Assessment will include history questions regarding the presence of itch, contact history and a simplified skin examination. Skin examination will be limited to areas that are usually exposed (arms from above elbow to fingers, legs from above knee to toes, and head and neck). Other areas (including breasts, groin or genitals) will not be examined. Data suggest that, in this setting, a limited examination detects more than 90% cases of scabies.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The skin of children less than 2 years age will be examined more generally, as scabies may be more widespread in this age group.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
                <p>Scabies will be diagnosed according to consensus criteria established by the International Alliance for the Control of Scabies (2020 IACS criteria).<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Categorisation will be based on the identification of typical scabies lesions, typical body distribution of lesions and presence of itch and/or positive contact history. Diagnosis will therefore use levels B (Clinical Scabies) and C (Suspected Scabies) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Microscopy was not used as it is not feasible or practical for programmatic roll-out in these remote settings. Confirmation of diagnosis with dermatoscopy was not considered feasible as the specialist skills required exceeded the training of the local health workers.</p>

Second, we will calculate the proportion of clinic presentations for scabies and impetigo by dividing the number of presentations for scabies and impetigo by the total number of clinic presentations for any condition. We will calculate this proportion for the 12 months before MDA, 1 to 12, and 13 to 24 months after MDA. Calculating the proportion will account for any changes in population size or operational status of health facilities. Third, we will compare the number of clinic presentations for scabies and impetigo in the clinics that service the study villages and compare this with clinic presentation for scabies and impetigo in other clinics in the province, this will be adjusted for population size.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Scabies is a common disease in many tropical and low-income settings and has been prioritised for control by WHO, but there are still gaps in knowledge to determine the optimum approach to control in settings where scabies is highly endemic.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The results of this trial will have an impact on national, regional and global strategies for scabies control.</p>
              <p>Island communities in the Pacific have among the highest global prevalence of scabies and understanding how to implement MDA in these settings has the potential for translation into huge public health impact for these communities.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the results may not be generalisable to populations with a much lower prevalence of the disease, to settings with higher population density or to urban settings. The non-inferiority margin of 5% was determined using available evidence but may not represent the appropriate level of public health significance in all circumstances. A greater or lesser margin may be considered non-inferior in other settings, depending on factors, including baseline disease prevalence, number of rounds planned, costs of implementing each regimen and available resources. This trial is designed to assess a single round of MDA, there is scope for further research to assess the efficacy of repeated annual rounds of MDA. The cluster-randomised design will allow analysis of the impact of MDA at the community level. We will be able to assess the impact of the intervention on the whole community, even for those who will not receive MDA.</p>
              <p>If the RISE trial finds that one-dose ivermectin MDA is inferior, then the need for two doses of ivermectin-based MDA would need to be taken into account in decision-making around control strategies for scabies. It would also provide impetus for further research to identify new treatments for scabies that may be able to be implemented with one dose. Approaches may include novel treatments that are ovicidal or other medications with a longer half-life such as moxidectin.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> If one-dose ivermectin-based MDA is found to be non-inferior to two-dose, then this strategy will be highly attractive for implementation as a public health programme. The lower cost, simplified logistics and ability to integrate with other programmes would make scabies control programmes more feasible in low-income settings.</p>
