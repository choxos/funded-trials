                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Fifty adults aged ≥55 years old with hip and/or knee OA.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants were allocated 1:1 to the intervention or control group using an online randomisation service. Intervention group participants received usual care (information resources) and up to eight community-based self-management support sessions delivered by a peer mentor (trained volunteer with hip and/or knee OA). Control group participants received usual care only.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Key feasibility outcomes were participant and peer mentor recruitment and attrition, intervention completion and the sample size required for a definitive RCT. Based on these feasibility outcomes, four success criteria for proceeding to a definitive RCT were prespecified. Patient-reported outcomes were collected via questionnaires at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Ninety-six individuals were screened, 65 were eligible and 50 were randomised (25 per group). Of the 24 participants who commenced the intervention, 20 completed it. Four participants did not complete the 6-month questionnaire. Twenty-one individuals were eligible for the peer mentor role, 15 were trained and 5 withdrew prior to being matched with a participant. No intervention-related harms occurred. Allowing for 20% attrition, the sample size required for a definitive RCT was calculated as 170 participants. The intervention group showed improvements in self-management compared with the control group.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The feasibility outcomes achieved the prespecified criteria for proceeding to an RCT. The exploratory analyses suggest peer mentorship may improve OA self-management. An RCT of the OA peer mentorship intervention is therefore warranted with minor modifications to the intervention and trial procedures.</p>

              <p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal conditions, with hip and knee OA affecting over 300 million individuals worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Furthermore, the prevalence of OA is increasing due to the ageing population and rising obesity levels.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Individuals with OA often experience severe pain, impaired function and reduced quality of life.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> OA can have a profound psychosocial impact<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and results in substantial economic burden.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>
              <p>National and international guidelines emphasise that patient education, self-management strategies and exercise are core elements for managing OA.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, implementation of OA guidelines is currently poor.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Patients report receiving insufficient information about OA management<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and having a limited understanding of the condition.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 9</xref> This negatively impacts patients’ health behaviours.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 9</xref> A need for tailored interventions to support OA self-management has therefore been highlighted.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>Peer support interventions are an established approach for supporting chronic condition self-management.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Various peer support models have been described, such as peer-led group programmes and peer mentorship.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The latter involves a trained individual with a particular health condition (the ‘peer mentor’) providing one-to-one support to another individual with the same condition.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This approach is likely to be particularly valuable for individuals with OA due to the heterogeneous nature of the condition, which means tailored support is crucial.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 14</xref></p>
              <p>Previous studies have highlighted the value of OA interventions incorporating peer support.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, no previous studies have explored an OA peer mentorship intervention. Although such an intervention offers multiple potential benefits, peer mentorship interventions can present feasibility/acceptability issues, such as high peer mentor attrition.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, this feasibility trial aimed to develop and trial a peer mentorship intervention to improve OA self-management. Its key objectives were to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the OA peer mentorship intervention in terms of: the feasibility/acceptability of the intervention and trial procedures; participant recruitment and retention; questionnaire completion rates; generating the sample size required for a definitive RCT; and estimating the intervention costs. Additionally, the potential impact of the intervention on patient-reported outcomes and resource use was explored.</p>

                  <title>Intervention development</title>
                  <p>The OA peer mentorship intervention was developed in two stages. The first stage included a rapid review of published primary studies investigating one-to-one peer support interventions. The review aimed to identify: the range of methods and approaches used in delivering peer support interventions; training and support approaches for peer mentors involved in intervention delivery; and challenges of developing and implementing face-to-face peer support to improve self-management of long-term conditions. Using Medline, CINAHL and PsycInfo, a search of the literature between 2007 and 2018 was undertaken using the terms and synonyms ‘peer support’, ‘long term condition’ and ‘intervention’. Thirteen papers were included.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 24–35</xref> The findings highlighted the importance of encouraging a person-centred approach and retaining flexibility within the peer mentorship sessions. There was little information about ‘matching’ the mentee with the peer mentor, although some studies based this on factors such as gender and age. There were issues around recruitment of peer mentors and a need to provide support and guidance to peer mentors throughout the intervention.</p>
                  <p>A preliminary version of the OA peer mentorship intervention was developed based on the rapid review findings and the following sources:</p>

                  <p>The above-mentioned sources were also used to develop a draft peer mentor educational resource pack. The pack was designed to supplement peer mentor training sessions and be used a resource during mentorship sessions. The pack included a range of handouts that peer mentors could give to participants.</p>
                  <p>The second stage of the development process consisted of expert review sessions conducted with the following key stakeholders: study patient and public involvement (PPI) members (n=2); other older individuals with OA (n=5); health professionals (n=4); voluntary/community organisation representatives (n=4); and researchers (n=2). Review sessions were conducted face to face (group, paired or individual meetings), via telephone or via email. The stakeholders were provided with information about the provisional OA peer mentorship intervention and a copy of the draft educational pack. Stakeholders’ opinions of these were assessed using a pro forma.</p>

                <title>Finalised intervention</title>
                <p>The finalised OA peer mentorship intervention aimed to improve participants’ health outcomes through increasing their engagement with self-management behaviours. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents a logic model of the intervention, including the proposed mechanisms of action. The intervention involved up to eight 1-hour self-management support sessions delivered by a trained peer mentor. During the sessions, the peer mentor provided guided support that incorporated multiple behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and covered a combination of core and optional topics (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). In line with a person-centred approach, the implementation of BCTs and the choice and order of topics covered was flexible and participant led. However, peer mentors were encouraged to cover all core topics at least once and set/review goals with the participant weekly. <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Online supplemental table 3</xref> provides examples of the implementation of the key BCTs employed.</p>

                <p>The volunteer coordinator attended the start of each initial session to introduce the participant and peer mentor, remind them of the trial and intervention aims and answer questions. The remainder of the initial session and all subsequent sessions were undertaken by the mentor alone. The volunteer coordinator contacted the participant and peer mentor following the initial session to check they were happy to continue with subsequent sessions with their mentorship match. Peer mentors completed a ‘session summary’ in writing following each session, detailing the topics covered during that session, any challenges encountered and their reflections on the progress made.</p>

                <title>Peer mentor training and matching</title>
                <p>Three training events were held due to varying peer mentor availability and staggering of the mentor recruitment, which meant it was not possible to train all mentors in one event. The first training event was provided by two external facilitators from Arthritis Care Northern Ireland and a trial team member (physiotherapist specialising in activity pacing/chronic pain management). The remaining events were provided by three trial team members (volunteer coordinator, the physiotherapist who facilitated the first training event and another musculoskeletal physiotherapist). Feedback from the first event was used to refine the content/delivery of the subsequent events.</p>
                <p>The training events involved presentations and interactive activities covering OA self-management topics, mentorship skills and the practicalities of the peer mentor role (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>Participant/mentor matching was undertaken by the volunteer coordinator and the researcher who completed the baseline researcher visit. The initial intention was to base matching on location, gender preference, age and OA site(s). However, due to peer mentors’ preferences and discrepancies in the availability of intervention group participants and trained peer mentors, these criteria were relaxed.</p>

                <title>Patient-reported outcomes</title>
                <p>Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using paper self-report questionnaires administered at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months. The baseline questionnaires were administered by a researcher or the volunteer coordinator. The majority of baseline questionnaires were administered after the participant had been informed of their group allocation. This approach was chosen due to the fluctuating availability of trained peer mentors. This meant there was sometimes a delay between participants being allocated to the intervention group and being able to commence their mentorship sessions. Therefore, most intervention group participants completed the baseline questionnaire with the volunteer coordinator immediately prior to their initial mentorship session to avoid a delay between completion of the baseline questionnaire and commencement of their mentorship sessions.</p>
                <p>The 8-week and 6-month questionnaires were administered and returned via post. Non-responders were followed up with a second questionnaire posting 2 weeks later and a telephone call 4 weeks later.</p>
                <p>The questionnaires covered participants’ sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and included validated tools assessing the biomedical/psychosocial outcomes specified below.</p>

                <p>Participant recruitment took place between 22 November 2018 and 30 May 2019. The final questionnaire was completed on the 16 February 2020. At least 345 individuals were approached (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Ninety-six individuals were screened, of whom 65 were eligible. The most common reason for ineligibility was being listed for joint replacement (n=8). Fifty individuals were randomised. Therefore, the participant recruitment rate was 77%. The most common reason for declining participation was insufficient time/other commitments (n=7). Most participants were recruited through the primary care physiotherapy department (n=44).</p>

                <p>One intervention group participant withdrew due to ill-health prior to completing the baseline questionnaire and commencing the intervention. Of the 24 participants who commenced the intervention, 20 completed at least three mentorship sessions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). The intervention completion rate was therefore 83%. Reasons for discontinuing the intervention largely related to participants feeling the intervention was not relevant to their needs, for example, due to having mild OA symptoms and/or feeling they did not require additional self-management support. The mean number of mentorship sessions received was 5.79 (SD=2.25; median=7). No harms/unintended effects related to the intervention occurred.</p>
                <p>One intervention participant who discontinued the intervention after two mentorship sessions withdrew (no reason provided). One additional intervention participant who discontinued the intervention after two mentorship sessions did not complete the follow-up questionnaires. One control group participant did not complete the follow-up questionnaires. A family member of this control group participant returned his 6-month questionnaire indicating he had died. The attrition rates were therefore: 8% overall, 12% in the intervention group and 4% in the control group.</p>

Minor issues were noted with the resource use sections. Some participants duplicated details, for example, by recording the same physiotherapy appointments under ‘Hospital services’ and ‘Services outside the hospital’. Additionally, the ‘day activities’ reported by participants largely related to their hobbies, such as yoga and dancing, rather than social/community support activities.</p>

                <p>Peer mentor recruitment took place between May 2018 and January 2019. Thirty-two individuals enquired about the role, of whom 21 were eligible (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure 1</xref>). Five eligible individuals were unable to attend the training events, one withdrew due to ill-health and 15 were trained. The peer mentor recruitment rate was therefore 71%. Five trained mentors withdrew prior to being matched, most commonly due to ill-health (n=3). The peer mentor attrition rate was therefore 33%. The most successful peer mentor recruitment approach was a local community magazine advertisement, which led to recruitment of five active peer mentors.</p>
                <p>Nine active peer mentors were female and one was male. Their mean age was 68 years old (SD=5.5; range=57–75). All had been living with hip and/or knee OA for at least 3 years. Nine were retired, although three had only recently stopped work, and one worked full-time. Each active peer mentor supported between one and four participants (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table 1</xref>).</p>

After 8 weeks, the mean PIH score improved in the intervention group (mean change=2.6; SD=13.2) and deteriorated in the control group (mean change= −7; SD=12.3). Thus, the intervention group participants appeared to have better self-management knowledge/behaviours than the control group participants at 8 weeks (effect size=8.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 14.4) (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). At 6 months, the intervention group’s mean PIH score was similar to the group’s score at 8 weeks, while the control group’s mean PIH score increased but remained lower than at baseline. Overall, the intervention group had higher PIH scores than the control group after 6 months (effect size=4.4; 95% CI −2.8 to 11.6) (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>).</p>

              <p>This feasibility trial aimed to develop and trial a peer mentorship intervention to improve OA self-management. All four prespecified success criteria for proceeding to a definitive RCT (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) were achieved. The peer mentor recruitment rate (71%), peer mentor attrition rate (33%) and intervention completion rate (83%) all compare favourably with previous peer mentorship studies.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 32 53 54</xref> This suggests the OA peer mentorship intervention can be delivered in practice and is acceptable to participants and peer mentors. However, some participants discontinued the intervention due to having mild OA symptoms and feeling they did not need self-management support. This could be overcome by specifying a minimum symptom severity threshold and/or a maximum arthritis-related self-efficacy threshold in the eligibility criteria to prevent inclusion of individuals who have mild symptoms and/or already feel confident about managing their symptoms.</p>
              <p>The participant recruitment rate was 77% and hence well above the prespecified minimum threshold of 60%. However, this recruitment rate did not account for individuals lost prior to screening. The overall participant attrition rate at 6 months was 8% and hence well below the prespecified maximum threshold of 20%. This suggests that additional strategies to improve participant recruitment and retention would not be needed for a future RCT. Allowing for 20% attrition, the sample size required for a definitive RCT was calculated as 170 participants (85 per group). Assuming each peer mentor supports two participants, this would require 43 mentors. This target RCT sample size is achievable. However, only 10 active peer mentors were recruited during this trial. Additional strategies would therefore be needed to recruit sufficient mentors. These could include using multiple recruitment sites across a wider geographical area, recruiting mentors over a longer time-period, using snowballing recruitment with previously trained peer mentors and optimising recruitment through media outlets, such as magazine advertisements.</p>
              <p>The findings for the remaining feasibility outcomes were also encouraging. The questionnaire completion rates were consistently high (96%–100%). However, minor modifications to the resource use sections would be beneficial to avoid participants duplicating details/reporting unnecessary details. The session summary data indicated intervention fidelity was good overall, with most participant/mentor dyads covering four of the five core topics. The remaining core topic, getting connected with friends/services, was only covered by six dyads. This may be because the participants already had good social support networks, as suggested by their relatively high MSPSS scores. Additionally, most dyads covered the optional topic of pain management. Therefore, changing getting connected to an optional topic and pain management to a core topic warrants consideration.</p>
              <p>The estimated costs of training peer mentors and delivering the intervention were £239 per mentor and £274 per participant respectively. The training costs would have been lower if fewer training events had been run with more mentors per event. This was not possible due to varying peer mentor availability and staggering of the mentor recruitment. A similar issue was noted in a study of peer mentorship for people with advanced cancer<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> and would need accounting for in a future RCT.</p>
              <p>This trial included exploratory analyses of the impact of the OA peer mentorship intervention on patient-reported outcomes. These analyses provide a preliminary insight into the potential effectiveness of the intervention. However, the results must be interpreted cautiously because the present trial was not powered to detect statistically significant differences. The exploratory analyses suggest the OA peer mentorship intervention may improve self-management knowledge/behaviours (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). However, no significant effects of the OA peer mentorship intervention on other outcomes, such as pain and arthritis-related self-efficacy, were observed in the present trial.</p>
              <p>A Cochrane review identified low to moderate quality evidence indicating self-management education programmes for people with OA do not result in any clinically meaningful benefits.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Despite this, the authors concluded that trials investigating alternative self-management support approaches, particularly those involving tailored support, are warranted. One such approach is the Staying Connected Programme, a tailored one-to-one 8-week self-management programme delivered by trained volunteers.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A recent quasi-experimental study identified significant improvements in pain and arthritis-related self-efficacy among individuals with arthritis who participated in this programme.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The Staying Connected Programme volunteers were not required to have an arthritis diagnosis, despite peer support being recognised as a valuable approach for supporting self-management.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> In addition, the Staying Connected Programme aimed to support individuals with various types of arthritis and other long-term conditions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The present trial’s intervention therefore aimed to replicate some key elements of the Staying Connected Programme while also incorporating peer support and being tailored specifically to the needs of people with OA. Although there are disparities between the findings of the present trial and the Staying Connected Programme study, neither was an adequately powered RCT. Future work is therefore required to determine the effectiveness of both the present trial’s OA peer mentorship intervention and the Staying Connected Programme.</p>
              <p>In addition to drawing on the Staying Connected Programme, the development of the OA peer mentorship intervention incorporated multiple other sources and an expert review with key stakeholders. This approach, combined with extensive PPI, helped ensure the intervention is feasible, acceptable and focused on the needs of individuals with OA. The substantial investment in the development process will also maximise the chances of the intervention proving effective during a future definitive RCT. A potential limitation is that the development process was not based on a single behaviour change theory or theoretical framework. However, the broad range of sources considered and input from multidisciplinary experts helped ensure that the intervention has a sound theoretical basis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). In particular, the focus on enhancing self-efficacy is consistent with other peer support interventions aimed at improving chronic condition self-management.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 32 56 57</xref></p>
              <p>This trial also presents additional limitations. Notably, 88% of participants were recruited through a physiotherapy service and hence had already received some self-management support. This could be addressed through using alternative recruitment sites, such as GP practices. Furthermore, the majority of participants were older, white, well-educated females, and a Cochrane review identified that the impact of self-management education programmes for OA may vary between Caucasian, educated females and other subgroups.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Additionally, peer support interventions may be most effective among the ‘hardly reached’, such as individuals with lower education levels.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Targeting the OA peer mentorship intervention to specific subgroups could therefore be valuable. Participants and peer mentors’ experiences of the OA peer mentorship intervention were explored through a nested qualitative study (reported elsewhere). However, the impact of providing the intervention on the peer mentors was not quantitatively assessed. This is an important consideration because providing peer mentorship may have positive and/or negative effects on peer mentors.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 26</xref> Another limitation of the present trial was that most participants were aware of their group allocation when completing the baseline questionnaire, which may have influenced their questionnaire responses.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> This could be overcome in a future definitive RCT by ensuring a greater number of trained peer mentors are available and/or administering the baseline questionnaire by post/online.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this trial’s findings suggest peer mentorship is a feasible, acceptable and promising approach for improving OA self-management. Further investigation of the OA peer mentorship intervention is therefore warranted. However, minor modifications to the intervention and trial procedures should be considered, particularly regarding the participant and peer mentor recruitment procedures.</p>
