                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Health-promoting dietary fibre including inulin often triggers gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS, limiting their intake. Our aim was to test if coadministering psyllium with inulin would reduce gas production.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>A randomised, four-period, four-treatment, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 19 patients with IBS. Subjects ingested a 500 mL test drink containing either inulin 20 g, psyllium 20 g, inulin 20 g+ psyllium 20 g or dextrose 20 g (placebo). Breath hydrogen was measured every 30 min with MRI scans hourly for 6 hours. Faecal samples from a subset of the patients with IBS were tested using an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> fermentation model. Primary endpoint was colonic gas assessed by MRI.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Colonic gas rose steadily from 0 to 6 hours, with inulin causing the greatest rise, median (IQR) AUC<sub>(0–360 min)</sub> 3145 (848–6502) mL·min. This was significantly reduced with inulin and psyllium coadministration to 618 (62–2345) mL·min (p=0.02), not significantly different from placebo. Colonic volumes AUC<sub>(0–360 min)</sub> were significantly larger than placebo for both inulin (p=0.002) and inulin and psyllium coadministration (p=0.005). Breath hydrogen rose significantly from 120 min after inulin but not psyllium; coadministration of psyllium with inulin delayed and reduced the maximum increase, AUC<sub>(0–360 min)</sub> from 7230 (3255–17910) ppm·hour to 1035 (360–4320) ppm·hour, p=0.007.</p>
                  <p>Fermentation <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> produced more gas with inulin than psyllium. Combining psyllium with inulin did not reduce gas production.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Psyllium reduced inulin-related gas production in patients with IBS but does not directly inhibit fermentation. Whether coadministration with psyllium increases the tolerability of prebiotics in IBS warrants further study.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Patients with IBS often report an unpleasant awareness of intestinal gas associated with a sensation of abdominal distension, commonly described as bloating. The connection between intestinal gas and gut symptoms is complex as signalling from gut to brain is influenced by many factors in patients with IBS including mood and somatisation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although cross-sectional studies of unselected patients with IBS have not shown excessive intestinal gas compared with healthy controls,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> increases in gas have been related to symptom induction possibly related to visceral hypersensitivity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Inulin-type fructans worsen some symptoms in IBS particularly when given at higher doses.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Despite the apparent clinical benefit of a low-fermentable oligoaccharide, diaccharide, monosaccharide and polyols (FODMAP) diet,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> it inevitably reduces intake of substances which act as prebiotics, leading to a reduction in key bacterial genera in the gut including <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacteria</italic>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> with potential negative consequences.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Alternative approaches to control of colonic fermentation in IBS are therefore being actively pursued.</p>
              <p>Viscous fibres such as psyllium, an arabinoxylan polymer that resists digestion in the human upper gastrointestinal tract,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> improve symptoms in unselected IBS<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> though until now the mechanism was unclear. We have recently used MRI to show that psyllium’s open network of polymers traps water in the small bowel and increases ascending and descending colon water content. We believe that this is the basis of its laxative effect, softening stool so that it is easier to pass.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, the small bowel effects may also be important since psyllium forms a highly viscous solution in the upper small intestine which interferes with absorption.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Psyllium is only slowly fermented so its viscosity effects are likely to persist for some hours after it reaches the colon. We have previously used radio-isotopic imaging to demonstrate that psyllium 3.5 g three times a day substantially reduced lactulose-associated acceleration of proximal colonic transit in healthy volunteers, but limitations of the method used means the mechanisms of action was unclear.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>The current study uses MRI to test the hypothesis that psyllium can reduce the increase in colonic gas induced in IBS by inulin. Inulin is a macropolymer which reaches the colon largely intact. There it is rapidly fermented producing large amounts of gas<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which correlates with symptoms of flatulence, bloating, discomfort and pain in patients with IBS.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> We further investigated the potential mechanisms of action by assessing the viscosity of test substances, known to affect fibre functionality,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> and their <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> gas production by microbiota derived from stool donated from the participants with IBS.</p>

              <title>Materials and methods</title>
              <p>Two studies were performed, both investigating the effect of psyllium and inulin, both alone and when coadministered, on gas production in IBS. An <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> study used MRI and breath hydrogen in patients with IBS and an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> study measured the viscosity of test solutions and their fermentation in a laboratory model of colonic fermentation using stool samples from participants in the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> study.</p>
              <p>The carbohydrates used were inulin (Orafti HP, Beneo, Mannheim, Germany) which is 99.9% pure with average degree of polymerisation &gt;23 and psyllium husk (Supernutrients, Bath, UK) which is 88.9% dietary fibre with 23.5% being soluble,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> degree of polymerisation being &gt;2800.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The placebo used was food grade dextrose (Thornton &amp; Ross, Huddersfield, UK).</p>
              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>Human MRI study</title>
                <p>This was a single-centre, four-period, four-treatment, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Each treatment was administered once to each participant, with randomisation of treatment order. The treatments were test drinks containing inulin, psyllium, inulin and psyllium and dextrose as a control.</p>

                  <p>Participants were recruited through the digestive diseases services at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Circle Treatment Centre, through primary care via the NIHR Clinical Research Network in England and through general advertisement. Eligible participants were aged over 16 years, fulfilling Rome IV criteria<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant IBS. Exclusion criteria included: pregnancy, contraindications to MRI scanning, inability to cease use of supplementary fibres or laxatives, inability to stop drugs affecting GI motility, history of other pre-existing gastrointestinal disorders or resection, intention to change smoking habit during the study, excess alcohol intake or anyone who in the opinion of the investigator would be unable to comply with the study protocol.</p>

                  <p>Participants were provided with a low-fibre, low-FODMAP meal to eat at home the evening prior to and during the study day in order to standardise intake of foods likely to increase colonic gas (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental tables S1A, B</xref> for nutritional information).</p>

Inulin and dextrose were dissolved in boiling water which was subsequently cooled in a refrigerator overnight. Test drinks containing psyllium were divided into four 125 mL drinks with a quarter of the psyllium added to each just prior to ingestion to avoid gelling which gave the solutions an unpleasant texture. The other drinks were imbibed at the same rate so that the 500 mL total for all test substances was consumed over 5 min. All test substances were stored in a sealed container in a cool, dry and dark environment prior to consumption.</p>

                  <p>Participants were provided with written information about the study at least 24 hours prior to informed consent. Eligibility was confirmed and information including medical history, current medications, height, weight and smoking history was recorded. Their IBS subtype was confirmed according to Rome IV criteria using a 1-week stool diary documenting stool frequency and consistency on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and the Patient Health Questionnaire 12 Somatic Symptom Scale<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> questionnaires. Eligible participants were randomised to the order of test drink intake using <ext-link xlink:href="www.randomization.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.randomization.com</ext-link> and given a dietary advice sheet for the day preceding each study day. Participants were provided with a low-fibre, low-FODMAP evening meal to eat at home before 20:00 on the evening prior to MRI scans (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1A</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Participants fasted from 20:00 the day prior to the study day and were allowed only sips of water for essential tablets as necessary. On the morning of the study they attended the University of Nottingham Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre and underwent a fasted MRI scan on a 1.5 T GE MRI scanner using a parallel imaging 12-element torso coil (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref> MRI endpoints and methods for details). They also had breath hydrogen measured by exhaling into a gas analyser (GastroCH4ECK, Bedfont, UK) and recorded symptoms of flatulence, bloating and abdominal pain using a modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This asks subjects to rate their symptoms on a 7-point scale 0–3 with intervals of 0.5 units, with anchors being 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe. Participants then consumed the allocated test drink. MRI scans were performed immediately after the drink and then hourly for 6 hours, while hydrogen breath tests and symptom scoring occurred every half hour (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental figure S1</xref> for study day details). After 210 min, participants received a 338 kcal meal of rice pudding, jam and orange juice (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental table S1B</xref> for nutritional information) and completed a hydrogen breath test and symptom score. Participants spent approximately 15 min inside the MRI at any one time. A washout period of at least 6 days was used between study days. Subjects collected their own stool samples at home using a dedicated stool collection kit (see <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref> for details). Samples were double bagged and frozen at −20°C in a domestic freezer before being brought to the unit in an insulated bag on an ice pack to avoid thawing. Samples were consecutive samples requested from all subjects and were thus a random sample with no selection criteria.</p>
                  <p>The primary endpoint was the change from fasting values in colonic gas assessed from the area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 360 min in arbitrary units with secondary endpoints being colonic volume AUC (L·min) and small bowel water content (SBWC) AUC (L·min), all measured by MRI. Other secondary endpoints included breath hydrogen in parts per million and severity of pain, bloating and flatulence, each scored 0–3.</p>

                  <p>Using the time for breath hydrogen to rise more than 10 ppm from baseline, we can estimate that inulin, when given alone, passed rapidly through the small bowel reaching the caecum within 143±86 min (n=19). Adding psyllium to the inulin slowed this somewhat to 176±86 min (n=8) but the change was not significant, p=0.26. However, it should be noted that in 11 subjects, breath hydrogen after psyllium plus inulin did not rise by 10 ppm and so transit time could not be calculated nor could a transit time for psyllium or dextrose alone. Using MRI detected arrival of fluid in the ascending colon as a marker of orocaecal transit was not possible with inulin as it does not trap fluid and so does not produce a clear increase in signal intensity to mark caecal arrival.</p>

              <p>Our study confirms previous data from healthy volunteers and patients with IBS<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 14</xref> that inulin has little effect in the small bowel but is rapidly fermented in the colon causing a rise in colonic gas and breath hydrogen. Previous studies have shown that psyllium,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> wheat bran and prickly pear cactus fibre (nopal)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> increase colonic volumes but did not study the impact of coadministered inulin on fermentation. The current study confirmed our hypothesis that both rise in colonic gas and breath hydrogen after inulin can be largely inhibited by concurrent ingestion of psyllium.</p>
              <p>We chose inulin as an important example of poorly absorbed dietary polysaccharide commonly found in wheat, onion, banana, garlic, and leeks,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> food types often associated with symptoms in patients with IBS.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Food manufacturers seeking health benefit claims have sought to use inulin, a storage fructan polymer easily obtained from chicory root, to increase the fibre content of many processed foods. However, its simple linear structure means that compared with other sources of fibre it is rapidly fermented meaning it often causes symptoms. This is particularly true for patients with IBS in whom distension of the colon by fermentation of inulin generates symptoms not seen with healthy volunteers.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Whether fermentation produces gas depends on complex cross-feeding networks in which some bacteria degrade inulin, while others such as <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacteria</italic> use the products of degradation to generate short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including butyrate.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The production of H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> after ingestion of large amounts of inulin reflects its rapid fermentation in an anaerobic environment. It is possible that slowing fermentation would allow more efficient metabolism with transfer of reducing equivalents to acetate and other SCFAs rather than gas. We have previously shown both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> that psyllium is poorly fermented and produces a much smaller rise in breath hydrogen than equal doses of more readily fermentable fibres including wheat bran and the prickly pear cactus fibre, nopal.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It follows therefore that adding psyllium to inulin would not be expected to increase the gas burden but why it reduces colonic gas requires further explanation.</p>
              <p>Our <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies were designed to explore the possibility that combining inulin and psyllium would inhibit fermentation directly. However, this actually enhanced gas production in the model where complete mixing was facilitated by the low viscosity of the concentrations used. Thus, the effect we observed <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> was not due to any direct inhibition of colonic fermentation by psyllium. Furthermore, we showed that the inulin and psyllium combination had the same high viscosity seen with psyllium alone which did not per se inhibit fermentation. We hypothesise therefore that the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> effect is due to the increase in chyme viscosity leading to both a reduction in the rate of delivery of inulin to the colon together with restriction of mixing of colonic microbiota with the inulin bolus.</p>
              <p>This hypothesis is supported in part by our observation in subjects that produced hydrogen, that orocaecal transit time (OCTT) was delayed by around 23% by psyllium. However, this needs further study using a method of measuring OCTT which does not depend on fermentation, since in this study, using the breath hydrogen technique, it was only possible to measure OCTT in 8/19 subjects coadministered psyllium. Considerations of subject comfort and inconvenience meant that our study was limited to 8 hours so we cannot be certain that the total hydrogen production over 12–24 hours might not have been similar. Nevertheless, we can be certain that the rate of fermentation in the first 6 hours was significantly reduced.</p>
              <p>When we simulated <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> the concentrations of psyllium likely to occur in the colon we found a high viscosity, 10 Pa·s, which is likely to impede mixing in the colon and thereby delay access of colonic bacteria to the inulin. Previous MRI studies show that chyme passing through the ileocaecal valve, which coming from the small bowel has a low bacterial count, is distributed largely in the middle of the colon.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Tagging studies show that within the haustra, close to the colonic wall, there is much less movement and mixing which may favour anaerobic fermentation.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We hypothesise that psyllium impairs movement from the main stream into the haustral pockets and hence delays fermentation.</p>
              <p>It is worth pointing out that MRI gas measurements are based on selecting a minimum of five adjacent voxels with signal intensity below a threshold (defined from an area outside the patient) which occupy volumes greater than 0.1 mL, so will miss smaller, more homogenously dispersed gas. The values therefore are the minimum amount of gas present. The technique measures all gases equally. The large interindividual variation in gas volumes can in part be explained by our observation that large gas pockets can rapidly move through the colonic regions and be expelled, causing large differences in gas volumes seen on MRI from one scan to the next. This is in keeping with earlier studies which used a ventilated tent and a smaller dose of poorly absorbed carbohydrate and showed that a substantial amount of hydrogen was expelled per rectum.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p>
              <p>We had intended to measure methane as well as hydrogen but technical failure prevented this. Methane producers do produce less hydrogen when exposed to poorly absorbed carbohydrate,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> however they are found in only a third<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> or a fifth<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> of study populations, so with our small numbers we would have been unlikely to be able to show this. Furthermore, since each individual acted as their own control it is unlikely to have altered our findings.</p>
              <p>While the 20 g dose of inulin we used substantially exceeds the UK average daily intake which is around 4 g, the dose is less than the 25–30 g recommended as daily intake of total dietary fibre so for a mechanistic study it is not unphysiological. Ileostomy<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and intubation studies<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> show that &gt;85% of ingested inulin enters the colon intact where it is largely completely metabolised since very little is excreted in stool.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Inulin supplements in humans selectively increase <italic toggle="yes">Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Anaerostipes</italic>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> genera which comprise a quarter of the colonic bacteria and in concert with other bacteria are capable of rapidly fermenting inulin and producing large amounts of SCFAs, especially butyrate which is thought to underlie its potential health benefits. The findings that both inulin and inulin plus psyllium resulted in more gas and pain in IBS-D also support the idea that the faster orocaecal transit, noted in previous MRI studies,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> would increase the rate of delivery of substrate to the caecal microbiota. We hypothesise that this would overwhelm the microbiota’s ability to use the excess reducing equivalents generated, which would therefore be disposed of as hydrogen or methane rather than used to generate SCFAs. However, to confirm or refute this hypothesis requires more detailed study.</p>
              <p>Our mechanistic study was powered on MRI gas volume and was not adequately powered for symptoms, however the fact that the greatest colonic volume was seen with the psyllium and inulin coadministration with no apparent worsening of symptoms suggests that other factors are important. Previous studies have indicated that increased tone is a more important determinant of pain during distension than volume alone.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Psyllium, by slowing fermentation, reduces not only gas but also other products of fermentation such as SCFAs. These activate enteroendocrine cells and potentially stimulate motility and tone.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Thus, reducing these products may reduce symptoms such as pain despite the greater volume. Future studies which measure both volume and microbial metabolites would help resolve these questions.</p>
              <p>The 20 g dose of psyllium we used would be expected to transit through the small intestine largely intact and be distributed within the ascending and transverse colon, a volume of 400–600 mL<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. The unusually high side-chain density of psyllium limits bacterial access so that it is poorly fermented in the colon compared with other viscous fibres,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> producing little gas as the current study confirmed. Although time constraints on scanning prevented study of events later in the day, from other studies we can expect the fermentation to continue slowly during transit through the distal colon. Further benefits from delaying fermentation in the proximal colon would include shifting SCFA production and particularly butyrate production more distally, where the highest cancer risk lies. Exactly how this will alter colonic physiology is uncertain but increases in butyrate can stimulate enteric nerve growth<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and potentially sensitise the colon.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Whether our psyllium intervention would achieve a big enough change to produce such changes should be further investigated.</p>
              <p>Possibly more relevant are the studies which have shown that adding wheat bran fibre reduced carcinogenesis in rats fed resistant starch from raw potato,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> thought to be mediated by changes in fermentation though the precise mechanism was unclear. Subsequent studies showed that fermentation of resistant starch in pigs was delayed and shifted distally by coadministration of wheat bran,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> a phenomenon confirmed in humans.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Such changes in fermentation throw new light on the epidemiological associations between colorectal cancer and fibre intake and suggest future studies will need to take in account the type of fibre and not just its amount.</p>
              <p>While our studies suggest ways of relieving symptoms without restricting prebiotic intake, it is worth pointing out that evidence for a significant health benefit from prebiotics is largely based on the strong epidemiological associations between fibre intake and disease with relatively few direct intervention studies.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> These show significant changes in microbiota and their metabolites but more long-term studies will be needed to confirm that these translate into significant health benefits.</p>
              <p>The water trapping softens stool leading to increased stool frequency in both healthy and constipated subjects<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> without however changing transit, despite an increase in colonic volume. This lack of effect on transit is unexplained since distension of the colon by balloon<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> or osmotic laxatives such as macrogols<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> stimulates propulsive colonic contractions. A possible explanation is that psyllium dampens the response to distension by reducing access to colonic sensors of luminal stimulants such as bile acids and faecal proteases. A recent study using xyloglucan supports the idea that enhancing the barrier between lumen and mucosa by dietary means has promise in the treatment of IBS.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Further studies are plainly warranted of this simple and safe method of alleviating symptoms in patients with IBS.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our small mechanistic study has demonstrated that adding psyllium to inulin reduces gas production in patients with IBS and suggests that by choosing diets with adequate amounts of viscous fibre, patients may be able to obtain the prebiotic health benefits of high-fibre diets without exacerbating their IBS symptoms, particularly flatulence. Larger clinical trials are now indicated to confirm the clinical value of such mechanistic insights.</p>
