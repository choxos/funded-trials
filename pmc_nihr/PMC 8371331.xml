                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Although therapeutic hypothermia reduces death or disability after neonatal encephalopathy in high-income countries, its safety and efficacy in low-income and middle-income countries is unclear. We aimed to examine whether therapeutic hypothermia alongside optimal supportive intensive care reduces death or moderate or severe disability after neonatal encephalopathy in south Asia.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a multicountry open-label, randomised controlled trial in seven tertiary neonatal intensive care units in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. We enrolled infants born at or after 36 weeks of gestation with moderate or severe neonatal encephalopathy and a need for continued resuscitation at 5 min of age or an Apgar score of less than 6 at 5 min of age (for babies born in a hospital), or both, or an absence of crying by 5 min of age (for babies born at home). Using a web-based randomisation system, we allocated infants into a group receiving whole body hypothermia (33·5°C) for 72 h using a servo-controlled cooling device, or to usual care (control group), within 6 h of birth. All recruiting sites had facilities for invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, and access to 3 Tesla MRI scanners and spectroscopy. Masking of the intervention was not possible, but those involved in the magnetic resonance biomarker analysis and neurodevelopmental outcome assessments were masked to the allocation. The primary outcome was a combined endpoint of death or moderate or severe disability at 18–22 months, assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (third edition) and a detailed neurological examination. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02387385" id="interrefs20">NCT02387385</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>We screened 2296 infants between Aug 15, 2015, and Feb 15, 2019, of whom 576 infants were eligible for inclusion. After exclusions, we recruited 408 eligible infants and we assigned 202 to the hypothermia group and 206 to the control group. Primary outcome data were available for 195 (97%) of the 202 infants in the hypothermia group and 199 (97%) of the 206 control group infants. 98 (50%) infants in the hypothermia group and 94 (47%) infants in the control group died or had a moderate or severe disability (risk ratio 1·06; 95% CI 0·87–1·30; p=0·55). 84 infants (42%) in the hypothermia group and 63 (31%; p=0·022) infants in the control group died, of whom 72 (36%) and 49 (24%; p=0·0087) died during neonatal hospitalisation. Five serious adverse events were reported: three in the hypothermia group (one hospital readmission relating to pneumonia, one septic arthritis, and one suspected venous thrombosis), and two in the control group (one related to desaturations during MRI and other because of endotracheal tube displacement during transport for MRI). No adverse events were considered causally related to the study intervention.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Therapeutic hypothermia did not reduce the combined outcome of death or disability at 18 months after neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries, but significantly increased death alone. Therapeutic hypothermia should not be offered as treatment for neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries, even when tertiary neonatal intensive care facilities are available.</p>

                      <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                    </p>
                    <p id="para70">One Cochrane review and three other systematic reviews have reported that therapeutic hypothermia reduces death or disability after neonatal encephalopathy, but these meta-analyses were primarily focused on clinical trials from high-income countries. Given the massive encephalopathy burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines (2015) recommended that therapeutic hypothermia using low-cost cooling devices could be offered in these settings, but acknowledged that the underlying evidence was weak and called for adequately powered randomised controlled trials to be done. Before the development of the hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy in low-income and middle-income countries (HELIX) trial protocol, we did a systematic review to identify all randomised controlled trials of therapeutic hypothermia in LMICs. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from Jan 1, 1995, to Nov 30, 2012) with the keywords “hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy”, “therapeutic hypothermia”, and “LMIC”. We excluded trials done in high-income countries. After the completion of the HELIX trial, we updated the search in Dec 1, 2020. No language restrictions were applied. We identified 15 randomised controlled trials, of which nine were from India, three from China, and one each from Uganda, Turkey, and Egypt. Five trials used selective head cooling devices, and the other ten administered whole-body cooling using low-cost methods such as frozen gel packs (five trials), phase change material (four trials), and water bottles (one trial). Although the pooled data from these studies, involving a total of 1249 infants, found a significant reduction in death during neonatal hospitalisation with cooling therapy (risk ratio 0·64, 95% CI 0·51–0·81), the individual trials were small pilot studies, and of poor quality. Few data were available for long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

                      <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                    </p>
                    <p id="para90">To our knowledge, HELIX is the largest neonatal cooling trial undertaken to date and the only rigorously done multicountry randomised controlled clinical trial that is adequately powered to examine the safety and efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia in LMICs. Therapeutic hypothermia did not reduce the combined outcome of death or disability at 18 months, but significantly increased mortality compared with a control group who received supportive intensive care alone. Among survivors, no difference was seen in severe disability, microcephaly, or survival without disability between the hypothermia and control groups. We found no difference in brain injury between the groups using conventional MRI scores, proton MRI spectroscopy peak area metabolite ratios of lactate:N-acetylaspartate (NAA), NAA:choline, and NAA:creatine; absolute concentrations of NAA; or whole brain white matter fractional anisotropy. However, most infants had a white-matter injury suggesting intermittent hypoxic injury. Most infants had clinical seizures within a few hours of birth, indicating a much earlier onset of fetal brain injury than in high-income countries. These data provide conclusive evidence for an absence of neuroprotection and harm from therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy in LMICs, even when optimal tertiary neonatal care, ventilatory support, and servo-controlled cooling devices were available.</p>
                    <p id="para100">
                      <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                    </p>
                    <p id="para110">The absence of hypothermic neuroprotection might be related to the subacute nature of brain injury in LMICs. Although the HELIX trial was done in well resourced south Asian tertiary neonatal units, the trial results are likely to be widely applicable to all LMICs, because a therapy that is unsafe and ineffective in a well resourced setting is unlikely to be beneficial in sub-Saharan Africa. Future research should focus on understanding the origins and timing of brain injury in these settings and in preventing neonatal encephalopathy.</p>

                <p id="para120">All participating neonatal units had facilities for assisted ventilation, cardiovascular monitoring, and support; access to 3 Tesla MRI scanners; and were managed by a two-tier system of trainee doctors and neonatal consultants who were experienced in dealing with therapeutic hypothermia. At each site, one neonatal intensive care nurse cared for two to four babies at a time. In addition, we appointed neonatal research nurses and research fellows at each recruiting site for the trial. Only one centre had a facility for inhaled nitric oxide. Two participating centres admitted only infants who were born at locations outside the participating hospital (including other health-care facilities or those born at home), one admitted only babies who were born within the participating hospital, and the other four admitted both.</p>
                <p id="para130">All infants born at 36 weeks of gestation or later with a birthweight of 1·8 kg or more who were admitted to the neonatal unit within 6 h of birth were screened for eligibility and recruited to the trial if they met both of the following two criteria of eligibility: first, a need for continued resuscitation at 5 min of age or an Apgar score of less than 6 at 5 min of age (for babies born in a hospital), or both, or an absence of crying by 5 min of age (for babies born at home); and second, evidence of moderate or severe encephalopathy at any time between 1 h and 6 h of age based on a structured clinical examination using modified Sarnat staging done by a certified examiner after admission to the neonatal unit.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The stage of encephalopathy was established based on the predominant degree of neurological abnormality (none, mild, moderate, or severe) across the six categories.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> We excluded infants who had no heart rate at 10 min of age despite adequate resuscitation, those with major life-threatening congenital malformations, or if the parents were unable to attend follow-up assessments.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para150">We randomly assigned infants either to the group given hypothermia with supportive intensive care or the group given usual intensive care alone (control group) with a ratio of 1:1 using a web-based randomisation system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sealedenvelope.com" id="interrefs30">Sealed Envelope</ext-link>). The randomisation sequence was computer generated. The minimisation method was used to control for encephalopathy stage and study centre, with a probability of 0·85 of being assigned to the treatment group that minimised an imbalance in the number of infants assigned to each group within each prognostic factor. One of the clinical team members approached the parents for trial participation. Once parental consent was obtained, a study personnel at the site entered the basic clinical details, including date and time of birth and the stage of encephalopathy, into the randomisation system (Sealed Envelope) using a secure login. Each randomisation generated an automated e-mail to the team at Imperial College London, who then cross-checked the date and time of birth of the infant and adherence with the assigned group.</p>
                <p id="para160">Infants who were randomly assigned to the control group had usual neonatal intensive care including invasive ventilation and inotropic support, avoidance of iatrogenic hyperthermia by restricting the use of overhead radiant warmers during resuscitation where possible, setting lower (36·0°C) thresholds in servo-controlled warmers, close monitoring of clinical and laboratory variables, and prompt correction of any metabolic or coagulation derangement.</p>
                <p id="para170">Babies who had been allocated to the hypothermia group had a controlled reduction of their rectal temperature to 33·5°C for 72 h, followed by automated re-warming at 0·5°C per h with the use of a servo-controlled whole-body cooling device (Tecotherm Neo; Inspiration Health Care, Crawley, UK) in addition to the supportive intensive care. However, passive cooling before neonatal unit admission was not permitted.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para190">We measured rectal temperatures in all babies every hour until 96 h of age, followed by measurements every 8 h during the first week. The clinical protocols for supportive intensive care, including inotropes, sedation, blood products, and anticonvulsants, were standardised to reduce variability across sites. Haemoglobin, leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein, glucose concentrations, coagulation profile, and blood gas measurements were obtained once per day for the first 4 days after birth. Blood cultures (measured using BD Bactec, NJ, USA) were obtained at the time of admission and repeated after 72 h in all infants. A single perinatal pathologist who was masked to the treatment allocations examined all umbilical cords for funisitis, defined by the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Non-evidence-based therapies, including steroids or mannitol, were not permitted. We maintained a low threshold for antibiotic therapy, and for blood product replacement for coagulopathies. A certified examiner (NB, PBan, JS, UBK, ARaj, SK, CNK, IAT, UDR, RSo, VKu, HS, PVa, KG, MSu, AS, PVi, MSa, KDM, JMo, SM, KD, SMB, PK, VB, SPat, MSh, SCM, IJ, MAM, SKD, RR, RSu, SSa, and ARah) did daily encephalopathy staging until day 4 after birth, and again on day 7 after birth and at discharge.</p>
                <p id="para200">Infants undergoing hypothermia were sedated if they were distressed (shivering or unexplained tachycardia, or both). Hypothermia was discontinued if the neonate showed refractory hypotension despite optimal inotropic and volume support, or a life-threatening or massive haemorrhage, or if there was a parental or clinician request to stop cooling.</p>
                <p id="para210">We did cerebral MRI 1–2 weeks after birth on a 3 Tesla scanner, which was a Philips scanner (Amsterdam, Netherlands) at one site (Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital and Medical College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), a Siemens scanner (Munich, Germany) at five sites, or a GE Healthcare scanner (Chicago, IL, USA) at one site (Trivandrum Medical College, Kerala, India), with the same protocol. The MR protocol (acquisition time) comprised T<sub>1</sub>-weighted and T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI (15 min) and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI; 7 min), proton MR spectroscopy metabolite peak area ratios (7 min), and metabolite absolute concentrations (13 min).<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> We acquired magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a single 15 × 15 × 15 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel centred on the left thalamus (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 9 pp 11–17</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para220">Pseudonymised raw MR data were centrally post-processed after a predefined quality check to exclude poor-quality data before the data analysis. MR spectroscopy data were analysed using LCModel (version 6.3), and DTI data were analysed using Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (version 6.0). Voxel-wise statistical analysis of the fractional anisotropy data was done using tract-based spatial statistics to evaluate the differences in whole brain white matter diffusivity between the hypothermic and control group.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para230">All MR images were reported jointly by two neonatal neurologists (ST and PMo) with more than 10 years of experience with MR imaging using a previously validated scoring system,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> masked to all clinical information, with additional input from a paediatric neuroradiologist (WKKC).</p>
                <p id="para240">Dedicated research nurses (IS, MSe, MB, and SJR) maintained regular contact with the families after discharge. A neurodevelopmental paediatrician (SM, RC, IAT, RSw, SSu, SCM, and IJ), masked to the allocation, assessed each infant at 18–22 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (third edition) and did a detailed neurological examination. We administered the Bayley Scales in the appropriate local languages (Hindi, Marathi, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Singhalese, Telugu, or Bangla).</p>
                <p id="para250">We used search teams to trace families who were lost to follow-up, with input from local health workers, the British Red Cross Society, village heads, mobile phone network-based location tracing, and local police. The assessment team travelled long distances, using air travel and overnight stays, to assess families who had relocated to other parts of the country and hence were unable to attend hospital appointments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we did the neurodevelopmental assessments in the open air or in ventilated rooms using appropriate personal protective equipment.</p>
                <p id="para260">Finally, for infants who could not be assessed in person by any of the aforementioned means, we contacted the parents over telephone and collected clinical information using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://agesandstages.com" id="interrefs40">Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires</ext-link> (third edition). Because disability cannot be sufficiently characterised using these questionaries, we used these data only for the assessment of death.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para270">The primary outcome was death or a moderate or severe disability. We defined severe disability as any one of the following: a cognitive composite score of less than 70 based on the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development third edition (Bayley-III), a gross motor function classification system level 3–5,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> a profound hearing impairment requiring hearing aids or a cochlear implant, or blindness. We defined moderate disability as a cognitive composite score (Bayley-III) of 70–84 and one or more of the following: a gross motor function classification system level 2, a hearing impairment with no amplification, or a persistent seizure disorder, assessed between 18–22 months.</p>
                <p id="para280">Short-term secondary outcomes were death before hospital discharge, a major intracranial haemorrhage on cranial ultrasonography, gastric bleeds, persistent hypotension, a pulmonary haemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension, prolonged blood coagulation requiring blood products (abnormal increase in coagulation tests as per the local laboratory standards), culture-proven early-onset sepsis, necrotising enterocolitis, cardiac arrhythmia, severe thrombocytopenia, persistent metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, renal failure, subcutaneous fat necrosis, an abnormal neurological examination at discharge, and duration of the hospital stay, all assessed at the time of hospital discharge. Longer-term secondary outcomes were death from any cause at 18 months, severe disability among those who survived, and microcephaly, assessed at 18–22 months.</p>
                <p id="para290">Exploratory MRI biomarker outcomes included brain injury scores on a conventional MRI; thalamic N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) concentrations; lactate:NAA, NAA:creatine, and NAA:choline peak area ratios; and whole brain white matter fractional anisotropy. Exploratory neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes included moderate disability; survival without disability; Bayley-III cognitive, motor, and language composite scores; persistent seizure disorder; disabling cerebral palsy; gross motor function classification system level; blindness; hearing impairment; severe microcephaly; wasting; and stunting. The local site investigators also reported all other serious adverse outcomes that were not part of the predefined trial outcomes to the HELIX trial manager and to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee within 24 h of the occurrence using a standard proforma.</p>

We used the Mann-Whitney test to analyse continuous outcomes with a skewed distribution and the log-rank test to compare survival times between the groups. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to compare brain injury between the hypothermia and control groups. Stata version 15.1 was used for data analysis.</p>

After 168 exclusions, 408 were randomly assigned to groups at the seven hospitals in India (n=347), Bangladesh (n=33), and Sri Lanka (n=28). 202 infants were allocated to the hypothermia group and 206 infants were allocated to the control group.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para520">In this multicountry, randomised controlled trial done in tertiary neonatal intensive care units in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, therapeutic hypothermia alongside optimal neonatal intensive care did not reduce the composite primary outcome of death or moderate or severe disability, but increased death alone. The HELIX trial enrolled a large number of babies from three countries using centralised random assignment, the groups were well balanced at baseline, protocol deviations were low, outcome assessors were masked to group allocations, and the loss to follow-up was minimal. The HELIX trial findings are therefore likely to be robust, and they do not support the use of hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy in LMICs.</p>
              <p id="para530">Apart from being the largest neonatal cooling trial reported to date, to our knowledge, HELIX is the largest prospective systematic clinical evaluation in neonatal encephalopathy using advanced 3 Tesla MRI biomarkers that has been undertaken. A rigorous approach to research governance was adhered to, including extensive training of the local teams to ensure informed parental consent without coercion, a centralised audit of audio-visual consent records, and continuous engagement with the parents and their extended families after discharge.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> These processes ensured that a high (97%) follow-up rate was achieved, despite frequent changes in addresses and telephone numbers.</p>
              <p id="para540">The primary outcome measure of the HELIX trial and the event rates in the control group were similar to previous cooling trials undertaken in high-income countries.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A composite primary outcome was chosen to address the competing effects of death and disability, because any intervention increasing the risk of death in infants who would otherwise survive with disability might falsely appear to have a neuroprotective effect. Hence, the HELIX sites with higher rates of death had lower rates of neurodisability (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 9 p 22</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para550">Although the HELIX trial protocol was similar to the NICHD cooling trial,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> we used 5-min rather than 10-min Apgar scores, and we did not mandate umbilical cord blood acidosis as an inclusion criterion to increase the generalisability in LMICs, particularly for infants born outside of hospitals that offer cooling therapy. Despite these changes, none of the infants had mild encephalopathy, nor had any alternative metabolic or genetic causes for encephalopathy or perinatal stroke. Furthermore, the blood gas analysis at admission confirmed metabolic acidosis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 9 p 2</xref>) and the MRI results were consistent with hypoxic ischaemic brain injury. We also excluded infants who had no heartbeat at 10 min of age despite adequate resuscitation, because these infants are unlikely to survive in LMICs.</p>
              <p id="para560">The unexpected absence of neuroprotection and increased death seen in this study is in contrast with previous trials from high-income countries.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Three factors could influence hypothermic neuroprotection: suboptimal supportive care during cooling,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> ineffective cooling devices,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and differences in the population.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The HELIX trial was carefully designed to eliminate the first two factors.</p>
              <p id="para570">First, the HELIX trial was done in tertiary neonatal units with facilities for invasive ventilation including high-frequency oscillation, and all infants were cared for by a team of senior neonatologists, neonatal junior doctors, and nurses trained in cooling therapy. All recruiting sites were monitored closely by the Imperial College London team, who have extensive experience of therapeutic hypothermia, using real-time video conferencing to discuss clinical status daily, in addition to site visits every 3–4 months and training during the recruitment period. Although these units did not have advanced therapies such as inhaled nitric oxide and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation available, these are rarely required during hypothermic neuroprotection. Unlike the original cooling trials,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> most infants undergoing hypothermia in the UK at present do not require invasive ventilation or substantial cardiovascular support.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para580">Second, hypothermia was administered using the same servo-controlled cooling device used in the UK, and the core temperatures were closely within the target range of 33·0–34·0°C. We sedated infants who were distressed, and almost all cooled infants were on sedative anticonvulsants, although the role of routine sedation during cooling is unclear.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Unlike the trials from high-income countries,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> few infants in the control group of HELIX trial had hyperthermia, which might have diluted the treatment effect.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para590">Despite the steps taken to ensure optimal care and effective cooling, hypothermia was uniformly ineffective and increased the incidence of death at all trial sites, irrespective of the place of delivery (born at a participating hospital or referred from another hospital), perinatal sentinel events, growth restriction, or coexistent sepsis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix 9 pp 18–22</xref>). Several secondary outcomes were worse in the cooled infants; specifically, hypothermia increased persistent hypotension, length of hospital stay, metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, prolonged blood coagulation, and gastric bleeding. Hypothermia also increased the need for inotropic support. The increased incidence of death in this group might be related to the hypothermia-induced suppression of hepatic metabolism in an already compromised liver, leading to persistent metabolic acidosis and myocardial depression.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Although coexistent Gram-negative sepsis negates hypothermic neuroprotection in preclinical models,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> we did not find any relation of bloodstream-positive sepsis and hypothermic neuroprotection. Previous antibiotic therapy might have reduced culture-positive early-onset sepsis among infants referred from other hospitals (4%); however, the early-onset sepsis among infants born at the participating sites in the HELIX trial (10%) in which blood cultures were obtained before antibiotics was similar to the incidence of sepsis reported in cooling trials from high-income countries.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p id="para600">To our knowledge, HELIX is the first clinical trial to systematically acquire and use 3 Tesla MRI scanners in a large group (n=284) of infants globally, including spectroscopy and DTI using validated cross-platform sequences<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> with careful harmonisation of the MRI scanners using phantom studies and adult volunteers before the start of recruitment. The MRI biomarker data do not suggest any beneficial effect of hypothermia on brain injury. Again, these results contrast with both the NICHD trial<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> (n=136) and the TOBY trial (n=131) data,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> in which hypothermia reduced brain injury on conventional MRI in a subgroup of infants who had 1·5 or 3 Tesla MRI scans as a part of clinical care.</p>
              <p id="para610">Although none of the infants in the HELIX trial had an established brain injury, around 80% had a white-matter injury, suggesting a subacute or partial prolonged hypoxia,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> which might explain the absence of hypothermic neuroprotection. Basal ganglia injury, which is suggestive of an acute intrapartum hypoxic event, was seen only in 25% of the HELIX trial infants, as opposed to 79% in the TOBY trial<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and 48% in the NICHD trial.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Furthermore, acute perinatal sentinel events were reported in less than 13% of the cases recruited to the HELIX trial, as opposed to more than 60% in the NICHD trial.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para620">Most infants in the HELIX trial had clinical seizures within a few hours of birth, suggesting that an intrapartum hypoxic injury might have occurred several hours before birth. In preclinical models, the onset of seizures indicates a secondary energy failure,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and hypothermia might not be neuroprotective once seizures are well established.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In the CoolCap trial, no neuroprotection was seen in infants who had seizures on amplitude-integrated electroencephalography at random assignment.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In the HELIX trial, we did not use electroencephalography, and hence clinical seizures might have been over-reported.</p>
              <p id="para630">In the HELIX trial, many infants were born outside of hospital and hence we were unable to evaluate the quality of intrapartum, resuscitation, and preadmission neonatal care, particularly when the infants were referred from small nursing homes. Although the trial was done in south Asian tertiary neonatal units with good resources, the trial results are likely to be widely applicable to all LMICs; a therapy that is unsafe and ineffective in a well resourced setting is unlikely to be beneficial in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, we examined only umbilical cords for funisitis, and, hence, we cannot exclude chorioamnionitis and fetal inflammation. Mechanistic studies using multiomics approaches might provide further insights into absence of hypothermic neuroprotection in LMICs.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para640">Given the subacute nature of fetal brain injury, addressing the socioeconomic and nutritional risk factors of encephalopathy alongside high-quality intrapartum monitoring for early identification of a subtle fetal compromise might be important in reducing the encephalopathy burden in these settings. Preclinical models of acute hypoxic insult or dual hit infection and hypoxic insult<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> are unlikely to capture the complexity and clinical heterogeneity of encephalopathy in LMICs and might be misleading. Future research exploring the origins and timing of birth-related brain injury might help to develop effective neuroprotective interventions. Neuro-regenerative therapies such as erythropoietin<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> might be more effective in these settings than therapies with an acute neuroprotective effect alone.</p>
              <p id="para650">In summary, the HELIX trial data suggest that therapeutic hypothermia alongside optimal tertiary neonatal intensive care do not reduce brain injury on MRI, nor improve the combined outcomes of death or disability after neonatal encephalopathy in LMICs, but significantly increase the incidence of death relative to a control group.</p>
