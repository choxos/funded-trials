                  <title>Background:</title>
                  <p>Caregivers frequently provide support to people living with long-term
conditions. However, there is paucity of evidence of interventions that
support caregivers in their role. Rehabilitation EnAblement in Chronic Heart
Failure (REACH-HF) is a novel home-based, health-professional-facilitated,
self-management programme for patients with heart failure (HF) and their
caregivers.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="section2-1474515119850011">
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>Based on the random allocation of individual adult patients with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF) and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45%
within the past five years, the caregiver of patients was allocated to
receive the REACH-HF intervention over 12 weeks (REACH-HF group) or not
(control group). Caregiver outcomes were generic health-related quality of
life (EQ-5D-5L), Family Caregiver Quality of Life Scale questionnaire
(FamQol), Caregiver Burden Questionnaire HF (CBQ-HF), Caregiver Contribution
to Self-care of HF Index questionnaire (CC-SCHFI) and Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS). Outcomes were compared between groups at 4, 6 and
12 months follow-up. Twenty caregivers receiving REACH-HF were purposively
selected for qualitative interviews at 4 and 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>Compared with controls (44 caregivers), the REACH-HF group (53 caregivers)
had a higher mean CC-SCHFI confidence score at 12 months (57.5 vs 62.8,
adjusted mean difference: 9.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.8–16.8,
<italic>p</italic> = 0.016). No significant between group differences
were seen in other caregiver outcomes. Qualitative interviews showed that
most caregivers who received the REACH-HF intervention made positive changes
to how they supported the HF patient they were caring for, and perceived
that they had increased their confidence in the caregiver role over
time.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion:</title>
                  <p>Provision of the REACH-HF intervention for caregivers of HF patients improved
their confidence of self-management and was perceived for some to be helpful
in supporting their caregiver role.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Heart failure (HF) is an unpredictable life-limiting condition that is challenging to
self-manage. People with HF typically experience poor levels of health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) due to episodes of breathlessness, oedema, fatigue and
associated anxiety and depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Families and social networks frequently support people living with long-term
conditions, including HF.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
Caregivers for people with HF have identified three distinct needs: (1) supporting
HF management, including coping with the variability of HF symptoms, understanding
and managing medicines, providing emotional support, promoting exercise and physical
activity; (2) developing the caregiver role, including communicating with health
professionals, managing their own well-being; and (3) developing skills to engage
social support, and voluntary and services while recognizing that the long-term
future may uncertain.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
However, there is currently a paucity of evidence on interventions that support
caregivers of people with HF in their role.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="bibr7-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr9-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Home-based programmes can widen access to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and have been
shown to be as effective as centre-based models for people after myocardial
infarction and coronary revascularisation.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Moreover, home-based
programmes also have greater potential to involve the caregivers in the
rehabilitation process and offer them support. Rehabilitation EnAblement in Chronic
Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is a de novo rehabilitation self-management programme for
patients with HF and their caregivers. The REACH-HF intervention is novel in a
number of ways: (1) theory-based; (2) co-developed with stakeholders (patients,
caregivers, clinicians, service providers); (3) based on intervention mapping; (4)
delivered in home-based setting (in contrast to the traditional
hospital/centre-based venue) by trained health-professionals; and (5) and directed
at both patients with HF and their caregivers.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr14-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p>A multicentre randomized controlled trial has shown that, compared to usual care
alone, the addition of the REACH-HF intervention improves the disease-specific HRQoL
of people with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and is a cost-effective use
of healthcare resources.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The aims of this paper are twofold: first, to compare the
caregiver outcomes between the REACH-HF and control groups; second, to report the
views and perceptions of caregivers on their experience of using the REACH-HF
intervention.</p>

HFrEF on echocardiography or angiography (i.e. left ventricular ejection
fraction &lt;45% within the preceding five years) were recruited from primary
and secondary care settings in four centres in the United Kingdom (Birmingham,
Cornwall, Gwent and York). At study entry, patients were asked to nominate if
they had a caregiver, i.e. a spouse, other relative or friend, who provides
unpaid support to patients. Unpaid support includes emotional support, prompting
with taking medications, observing for signs and symptoms of HF, getting
prescriptions, encouraging participation in social events and physical activity,
helping with household tasks or providing physical care.</p>
                <p>Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by investigator site
and baseline plasma N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide levels (⩽2000 vs
&gt;2000 pg/ml), using minimization to facilitate balance between the groups.
Randomization numbers were computer generated and assigned in strict sequence at
the point of randomization. To maintain concealment, the Peninsula Clinical
Trials Unit used a password-protected, Web-based randomization system to
allocate participants after consent was obtained and baseline assessment data
entered. Caregivers were allocated to receive the REACH-HF intervention
(REACH-HF group) or not (control group) in accord with the random allocation of
their patient partner.</p>
                <p>The investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the North West Lancaster Research Ethics Committee
(14/NW/1351). Written informed consent was obtained from both patient and
caregiver participants.</p>

                <p>Twenty caregivers in the REACH-HF group were selected for interview at 4 and 12
months using maximal variation sampling that took account of patient and
caregiver baseline HRQoL scores, caregiver demographics (age, gender and
ethnicity), and geographical location. Home interviews were conducted by two
experienced qualitative researchers (JW, Lucy Moore). Caregivers were encouraged
to describe their views and experiences of the REACH-HF intervention.
Interviewers were guided by answers from the interviewees and used further
probing questions such as ‘tell me more about …?’ Other techniques to enhance
the interview included reflecting on what was said and using non-verbal
communication to show that the researcher was actively listing. Interviewers
summarized the content of the interview at the end of the discussion and invited
the participant to add anything else they wanted to share. The interview topic
guide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1474515119850011">Supplementary table 1</ext-link>) was reviewed throughout the study so that
the questions were informed by relevant emerging topics, e.g. the impact of
roles outside the home and the difficulties encountered by caregivers who did
not live with the cared for person. Interviews were audio recorded and
researchers wrote field notes at the end of each interview detailing
observations of the home and social context; reflections on researcher
performance and potential influence on the interview; how the participant
responded to the questions; and initial thoughts about the main points arising
from the interview.</p>

                <p>One caregiver declined to be audio recorded and was excluded from the analysis.
The 19 caregivers who agreed to be interviewed had similar demographic
characteristics to the overall study cohort of caregivers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1474515119850011">Supplementary table 2</ext-link>). All 19 caregivers were interviewed at
four months and 16 were interviewed at 12 months (one withdrew as her husband
was unwell and two declined to take part). The majority of interviews were
conducted in the patient’s home (usually with the patient present) and the
average duration of interviews was 51 min (range 15–103) and 43 min (range
13–100) at 4 and 12 months respectively.</p>
                <p>Two overarching themes emerged from interviews: (1) engagement with the REACH-HF
intervention and (2) impact on caregiver role. These themes and related

evidence that some caregivers actively chose to not engage with the
facilitator and obstructed facilitator efforts to engage. Proactive
engagement was enhanced when the patient made perceived improvements in
HRQoL, especially if there was an improvement in social activities.
These engaged caregivers were also more likely to have a wider close
social support network, and there are examples where the ‘family and
friends resource’ as shared with this social network. Conversely, fear
of hospitalization of the cared for person could also act a factor
motivating active engagement.</p>

address their own health and wellbeing. Employed caregivers had no or
little facilitator contact. One facilitator attempted on multiple
occasions to contact a caregiver but the caregiver did not return the
calls, and this obstructed engagement. Non-engaged caregivers often felt
they already had the knowledge and skills they required.</p>

caregivers who were proactive or ‘enabling’ in supporting self-management
activities and (2) caregivers who believed the locus of control for
self-management should be with the cared-for person. As a result of the
REACH-HF intervention, some caregivers adopted a more supportive role using
the advice in the ‘Family and Friends Resource’ to discuss how the person
was feeling and then agree a mutual management plan.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We report the impact on caregivers of REACH-HF – a novel, home-based, self-management
intervention aimed at both HF patients and their caregivers. Compared to control,
there was no significant difference in caregiver outcome with exception of CC-SCHFI
confidence score. However, our qualitative research showed that most caregivers who
received the REACH-HF intervention, made positive changes to how they supported the
HF patient they were caring for, and perceived that they had increased their
confidence in the caregiver role.</p>
              <p>Our findings provide important evidence of the impact of a rehabilitation and
self-management intervention for HF patients on caregiver outcomes. We know of only
one previous randomized trial that was undertaken in a single centre UK setting.
Witham et al assessed a 24-week exercise-based CR intervention in functionally
impaired elderly (⩾70 years) HF patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Compared to no exercise control, the authors reported no significant
difference at 8 or 24 weeks in either patient or caregiver outcomes. Caregiver
outcomes collected were similar to the present study, i.e. mental wellbeing (HADS
anxiety and depression) and burden/strain (Zarit Burden Interview). Whilst the
Witham trial encouraged caregivers to involve themselves in the exercise training
sessions of patients, there was no mention of involvement of caregivers in the
intervention development or delivery (only 10/71 caregivers in the trial accepted
the invitation to participate in the exercise programme). In contrast, the REACH-HF
intervention was co-designed with several stakeholders, including caregivers, and
included a formal element of the intervention (‘family and friends resource’)
specifically aimed at caregivers.</p>
              <p>Strengths of this study included its multicentre design, collection of a range of
questionnaire-based outcomes intended to assess mental wellbeing, burden and HRQoL
of caregivers, and the mixed methods design that included in depth interviews with
caregivers. However, this study has some important limitations that may explain the
lack of quantitative differences between the intervention and control groups. First,
baseline mean HADS depression, Fam-Qol and CBQ-HF scores indicated consistently good
levels of caregiver functioning and, therefore, little room for further improvement.
Second, caregivers were not themselves randomized to intervention and control
groups, increasing the risk of selection bias and cofounding in the comparison of
REACH-HF and control groups. Third, given the primary aim of the trial was to assess
the impact of REACH-HF on HF patients, the study sample size was powered on the
between-group difference in patient rather than for caregivers. For example, if we
had powered the trial based on detection of a minimum clinically important
difference for the HADS score of 1.4 would have required a sample size of 227
caregivers per group (at 90% power and 5% alpha).<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As this minimum clinically important difference lies well inside the 95% CI
for the between-group difference in HADS anxiety and HADS depression seen in the
current study at 12 months, we cannot rule out a clinically important effect of
REACH-HF intervention upon caregivers. Finally, our trial process evaluation found
that healthcare staff facilitating the REACH-HF intervention appeared to be less
effective in involving of caregivers than patients.</p>
              <p>There is a growing interest in including caregivers in intervention
delivery.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr4-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> One of the key
implications of this study is the need to better engage caregivers in rehabilitation
and self-management interventions for HF patients. We recognize that actively
working with caregivers may have been a new experience for many of the healthcare
facilitators who participated in this trial and we are currently making adaptations
to reflect this in our REACH-HF facilitator training. A structured caregiver
assessment tool may assist facilitators to plan and deliver this aspect of the intervention.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1474515119850011" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Further high quality evidence is required to confirm the benefits of actively
involving caregivers in the development and delivery of rehabilitation and
self-management interventions for HF and other chronic diseases.</p>
