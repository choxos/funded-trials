                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The need for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in different age groups and populations is a subject of great uncertainty and an ongoing global debate. Critical knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 vaccination include the duration of protection offered by different priming and booster vaccination regimens in different populations, including homologous or heterologous schedules; how vaccination impacts key elements of the immune system; how this is modified by prior or subsequent exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and future variants; and how immune responses correlate with protection against infection and disease, including antibodies and effector and T cell central memory.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The Platform Trial In COVID-19 priming and BOOsting (PICOBOO) is a multi-site, multi-arm, Bayesian, adaptive, randomised controlled platform trial. PICOBOO will expeditiously generate and translate high-quality evidence of the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and cross-protection of different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants/subvariants, specific to the Australian context. While the platform is designed to be vaccine agnostic, participants will be randomised to one of three vaccines at trial commencement, including Pfizer’s Comirnaty, Moderna’s Spikevax or Novavax’s Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine. The protocol structure specifying PICOBOO is modular and hierarchical. Here, we describe the Core Protocol, which outlines the trial processes applicable to all study participants included in the platform trial.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">PICOBOO is the first adaptive platform trial evaluating different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies in Australia, and one of the few established internationally, that is designed to generate high-quality evidence to inform immunisation practice and policy. The modular, hierarchical protocol structure is intended to standardise outcomes, endpoints, data collection and other study processes for nested substudies included in the trial platform and to minimise duplication. It is anticipated that this flexible trial structure will enable investigators to respond with agility to new research questions as they arise, such as the utility of new vaccines (such as bivalent, or SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific vaccines) as they become available for use.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par42">The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an ongoing threat to global health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is destined to become endemic, it is hard to anticipate how the transition to stable endemicity will unfold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The durability of protection offered by vaccination is likely to be influenced by the host (including prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2), the evolution of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the vaccine dose, the dosing interval and type of vaccines administered and the differential impacts of homologous versus heterologous schedules on immune responses (antibodies, B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. = Despite extensive research investment, critical uncertainties about the optimal strategies for COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination remain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These include the duration of protection offered by different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies in different populations, especially children; how vaccination impacts key elements of systemic and mucosal immunity; how this is modified by prior or subsequent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection or homologous or heterologous vaccines at varying dosing intervals; and how these immune responses correlate with protection against infection and disease—especially against future variants/subvariants of concern (VoC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par43">The Platform Trial In COVID-19 priming and BOOsting (PICOBOO) is a multi-site Bayesian, adaptive, randomised controlled, platform trial designed to simultaneously generate and translate high-quality evidence to fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination and natural infection on the immune system, to inform immunisation practice and policy. PICOBOO has been designed in consultation with the Australian COVID-19 Community Reference Group (CRG) and members of national COVID-19 policymaking bodies.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The documentation specifying PICOBOO is modular and hierarchical (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Here, we present the Core Protocol, which describes the study procedures that apply to all participants and aspects of the trial, while a Substudy Specific Protocol (SSP) applies to describe study procedures that relate to participants enrolled in a specific nested substudy. This structure is intended to standardise outcomes, endpoints, data collection and other study processes for nested substudies included in the trial platform and to minimise duplication. SSPs and the statistical appendix are beyond the scope of this manuscript and will be detailed separately. The laboratory appendix is available from the corresponding author upon request.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Modular PICOBOO protocol structure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2023_7225_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p>

While the platform is designed to be brand-agnostic, the vaccines that will be evaluated at the commencement of the trial will include Pfizer’s Comirnaty® (Pf), Novavax’s Nuvaxovid® (Nx) and Moderna’s Spikevax® (Mod). If the vaccines studied at the commencement of the trial are superseded by alternatives, such as bivalent vaccines, a decision to substitute the vaccine intervention(s) with newer alternatives may occur, at the discretion of the trial steering committee (TSC). A maximum of three interventions per stratum will be evaluated at any given time.</p>

If a participant withdraws from the study, storage of samples will continue, unless the participant requests otherwise. Any data collected before the withdrawal of the participant will still be used in the analysis in order to maintain safety and trial integrity. If a participant withdraws due to what they perceive to be an intolerable adverse event (AE), they will be given appropriate immediate treatment and returned to the care of their treating physician.</p>

For the second level, information is borrowed across age groups within intervention allocation and vaccine history. Finally, for the third level, information is borrowed across mRNA vaccine intervention allocation, for the ancestral subtypes only, within vaccine history.

All investigators will have the opportunity to review publications (e.g. manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) prior to submission. Authorship will be determined in line with the uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.</p>

              <p id="Par128">This document sets out a Core Protocol for PICOBOO; an adaptive platform trial designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and cross-protection offered by different COVID-19 priming and booster vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants/subvariants. Currently, it is unclear whether periodic boosting will be necessary in the future, and if so, whether this should be recommended for all Australians, or targeted to specific vulnerable populations or age groups. This trial is designed to generate high-quality evidence to inform Australian immunisation practice and policy, but with global relevance; this will be critical to achieving national and global control of COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="Par129">The primary outcome measure will be the geometric mean concentration of anti-spike IgG ~ 28 days after randomisation to the vaccination intervention. This endpoint has been chosen to align with Com-COV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], COV-BOOST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and international COVID-19 vaccination trials, as well as Bringing Optimised COVID-19 Vaccine Schedules To ImmunoCompromised Populations (BOOST-IC; NCT05556720), which is a platform trial evaluating different booster vaccination strategies in immunocompromised hosts in Australia. Currently, there are no recognised correlates of protection against COVID-19 infection and disease, although recent studies indicate that anti-spike neutralising antibody levels likely correlate with vaccine-induced protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is hoped that prospectively aggregated data generated by PICOBOO will add to the international databank to enable further exploration of the clinical correlates of COVID-19 infection and disease.</p>
              <p id="Par130">We have defined the statistical analyses for this trial using the estimands framework; this approach is recommended in the latest version of the ICH statistical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Each estimand, defined as an inferential target for estimation, is defined by five key attributes. These include (i) the population of interest, (ii) the endpoint (analysed parameter), (iii) a description of the treatment intervention(s), (iv) intercurrent events that occur following randomisation that might impact on the treatment effect and (v) the population level summary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This framework is designed to ensure that the objectives of the trial align with the design and conduct of the study and to improve transparency regarding the analysis and reporting of results, to improve the value of the research that is conducted.</p>
              <p id="Par131">This Core Protocol sets out the establishment of the first adaptive platform trial within Australia, and one of the few established platforms internationally, to enable the evaluation of different COVID-19 vaccination strategies, concurrently. It is envisaged that this platform will enable the evaluation of multiple COVID-19 vaccination interventions (e.g. different booster numbers) in various population cohorts and/or subgroups. The use of an adaptive platform design has the benefits of flexibility and efficiency compared to conventional trials. This platform will enable researchers to respond with agility to new policy questions as they arise, including the potential rollout of new vaccine formulations (such as bivalent formulations or vaccines targeted to specific variants) become new VoC arise in Australia, prompting evidence-based changes in strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par132">The overarching PICOBOO platform will facilitate separately funded, nested mechanistic substudies by established research networks, which will benefit from the established governance, research, and analytic personnel, recruiting sites and digital and trial infrastructure. This will allow sharing of resources and cost-savings across multiple distinct but closely related trials, which traditionally would have been conducted sequentially or in parallel, rather than simultaneously. It is envisaged that data collection, endpoints and methods for analysis and reporting of results will be standardised across these nested or closely related projects, where possible.</p>
              <p id="Par133">There are two major advantages in using this trial design and protocol structure. Firstly, borrowing information across statistical models when the treatment effect is similar in different strata will contribute information to inform an estimation of the posterior probability in another stratum. Secondly, this flexible trial structure will enable investigators to respond to new policy questions and vaccination interventions as they arise (for example, the impact of primary vaccination on younger age cohorts).</p>
              <p id="Par134">PICOBOO will establish a national biobank of serum, plasma, PBMCs and saliva for future use by Australian researchers. It will be possible to apply emerging technologies assessing cellular, humoral, and mucosal immunity against existing and future SARS-CoV-2 variants/subvariants using these banked samples.</p>
              <p id="Par135">Designed in consultation with the National COVID-19 Community Reference Group (CRG), PICOBOO will improve our understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on humoral and cellular immunity, and thereby improve public confidence in the evidence-underscoring policy decisions, which will be critical to achieving national and global control of COVID-19.</p>
