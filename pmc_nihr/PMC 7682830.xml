                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody approved for the preventive treatment of migraine.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluated fremanezumab monthly or quarterly in adults with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM). Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse event (AE) monitoring (performed by the investigators), systematic local injection-site assessments (immediately and 1 hour after injection), laboratory/vitals assessments, and immunogenicity testing. Prespecified exploratory evaluations included change from baseline in the monthly number of migraine days, headache days of at least moderate severity, and days with any acute headache medication use. Change from baseline in headache-related disability (6-item Headache Impact Test scores) was also measured.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Of 1,890 patients enrolled, 551 and 559 patients with CM received quarterly and monthly dosing; 394 and 386 patients with EM received quarterly or monthly, respectively. The most commonly reported AEs were injection-site reactions (induration 33%, pain 31%, and erythema 26%). Fremanezumab reduced monthly migraine days (CM quarterly â7.2 days, CM monthly â8.0 days, EM quarterly â5.2 days, EM monthly â5.1 days) and headache days of at least moderate severity (CM quarterly â6.4 days, CM monthly â6.8 days, EM quarterly â4.4, EM monthly â4.2 days) from baseline to 12 months. Reductions in any acute headache medication use and headache-related disability were also maintained over 12 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Fremanezumab quarterly and fremanezumab monthly were well tolerated and demonstrated sustained improvements in monthly migraine days, headache days, and headache-related disability for up to 12 months in patients with migraine.</p>

            <p>Oral medications currently used for migraine preventive treatment were not originally developed to target migraine pathophysiology.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> They are often associated with significant side effects, leading to discontinuation and poor treatment outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Observational studies have shown that persistence varies widely, ranging from as low as 19% to 79% at 6 months and from 7% to 55% at 12 months.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Switching or reinitiating treatment after initial discontinuation of an oral migraine preventive medication leads to even lower persistence rates.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Monoclonal antibodies targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway are a new class of preventive therapy that specifically target the pathophysiology of migraine.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> They have notable advantages over conventional oral migraine preventive medications such as not requiring dose titration, having a long half-life that enables monthly or quarterly administration, and having a favorable safety profile.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Fremanezumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2Îa)<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> that selectively targets CGRP, is approved in the United States, the European Union, and Australia for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. The efficacy and safety of fremanezumab were demonstrated in 2 pivotal 12-week phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy studies (HALO) in patients with chronic migraine (CM) (HALO CM) and episodic migraine (EM) (HALO EM).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab in adults with CM or EM from the 12-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 study are reported here.</p>

                    <p>This long-term study was an extension of the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Administration of Fremanezumab (TEV-48125) for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine (HALO) chronic migraine (CM) and episodic migraine (EM) studies that allowed an additional subset of new patients who had not previously participated in the HALO studies to directly enroll. BL = baseline; EOS = end of study; EOT = end of treatment; PBO = placebo. <sup>a</sup> Monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every 4 weeks (28 days). <sup>b</sup> To maintain the study blind, all patients received 3 injections at visits 2,5, 8, and 11. A single injection was administered all other months. <sup>c</sup> Baseline refers to the 28-day run-in period (for headache variables only) and day 0 of the HALO CM or EM studies for rollover patients or to the 28-day run-in period (for headache variables only) and day 0 of this long-term study for new patients. <sup>d</sup> Rollover patients who received placebo during the HALO CM or EM studies and new patients not rolling over from one of the HALO CM or EM studies who met eligibility criteria after completing a 28-day run-in period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio on day 0 of this long-term study to receive fremanezumab quarterly at 675 mg or monthly at 225 mg (CM monthly group received a single 675 mg dose of fremanezumab at baseline). <sup>e</sup>For patients who began this long-term study (visit 2) on the same day as the EOT visit of the HALO CM or EM study, the EOT visit procedures/assessments for the HALO CM or EM study were completed before procedures/assessments for this study began.</p>

Eligible patients were adults 18 to 70 years of age, inclusive, with a history of migraine (according to International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd Edition, beta version [ICHD-3 beta] criteria<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>) for â¥12 months before screening. Patients were classified as having CM or EM on the basis of headache data recorded daily in an electronic headache diary (e-diary) device during a 28-day run-in period and the following protocol-specified criteria: patients with CM fulfilled ICHD-3 beta criteria for CM and had headache of any severity and duration occurring on â¥15 days, with â¥8 days fulfilling specific ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine, while patients with EM had headache of any severity and duration occurring on 6 to 14 days (rollover patients) or on 4 to 14 days (new patients), with â¥4 days fulfilling specific ICHD-3 beta criteria for migraine. A maximum of 1 (rollover patients) or 2 (new patients) concomitant migraine preventive medications were allowed, provided that the medication was recognized as having at least moderate efficacy and dosage had been stable for â¥2 consecutive months at screening. Patients could use acute migraine medication as needed.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of fremanezumab in the preventive treatment of migraine. All additional efficacy analyses described here were prespecified.</p>
                <p>Safety and tolerability were assessed via adverse events (AEs), including injection-site monitoring (immediately and 1 hour after study drug administration); clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs (12 lead); physical examinations; and electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Injection-site assessments were performed immediately and 1 hour after administration of each dose of study drug. Injection sites were evaluated for erythema, induration, ecchymosis, and pain, with erythema, induration, and ecchymosis graded according to measurements (absent, mild [5ââ¤50 mm], moderate [&gt;50ââ¤100 mm], severe [&gt;100 mm]) and pain graded on a 5-point scale (0 = no pain to 4 = worst possible pain). If a patient had severe injection-site induration, erythema, or ecchymosis or severe or worst possible injection-site pain 1 hour after study drug administration, the patient was reassessed by the investigator 3 hours after administration and hourly thereafter until the reaction/pain was of moderate or less severity. For all other AEs, the investigator asked about AEs at each patient contact using an open-ended question concerning any symptoms or medical problems since the last visit. The investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to the study drug and procedures, as well as the severity and seriousness of each AE, according to protocol-specified criteria.</p>
                <p>Prespecified exploratory efficacy evaluations included mean change from baseline in the monthly number of migraine days, headache days of at least moderate severity, headache days of any severity, and days with any acute headache medication use at months 3, 6, and 12. The proportions of patients with an â¥50% reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days at months 6 and 12 were also assessed. e-Diary entries capturing headache data from the previous day were completed daily during the first 3 months beginning on day 1 (rollover patients) or during the first 4 months beginning on day â27 (new patients). All patients completed daily entries during the 4-week periods after visits 7 and 13.</p>
                <p>For patients with CM, mean change from baseline in headache-related disability score at months 6 and 12 was measured by the 6-item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6), as specified in the protocol. The HIT-6 is a reliable and validated tool for measuring headache impact, with total scores ranging from 36 to 78 and higher scores reflecting greater impact.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> For patients with EM, the mean change from baseline in headache-related disability score at months 6 and 12 was measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire, as specified in the protocol. The MIDAS is a brief, self-administered questionnaire validated to quantify headache-related disability over a 3-month period. Total scores are used for grading disability, with scores of 0 to 5 indicating little or no disability, 6 to 10 indicating mild disability, 11 to 20 indicating moderate disability, and â¥21 indicating severe disability.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
                <p>As described in the protocol, immunogenicity was assessed by evaluating the incidence of ADAs and their potential impact on clinical outcomes, measured from blood samples with an appropriately validated method. Samples were collected at visits 2 (new patients only), 5, 8, 14, and 15.</p>

The full analysis set included all randomized/rolled over patients (intention-to-treat population) who received â¥1 dose of study drug and had â¥10 postbaseline e-diary efficacy assessments. All safety data and efficacy variables were summarized with the use of descriptive statistics.

One of the cerebrovascular accidents was an acute right frontal stroke that occurred in a 62-year-old patient with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. CT results indicated acute and old ischemic changes in the brain. The event was severe and resolved without sequelae. The second cerebrovascular accident was an ischemic left middle cerebral artery stroke that occurred in a 58-year-old postmenopausal patient on hormone replacement therapy. CT showed plaques in the right and left carotid bifurcation extending into proximal left and right internal carotid artery, with &lt;50% diameter narrowing. The patient was overweight and had a medical history of patent foramen ovale, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The event was mild and resolved on the same day; the patient discontinued the study because of the event. Per the investigator's assessment, alternative etiologies included suspected atrial fibrillation. The third cerebrovascular accident was the single reported death resulting from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm described above. The remaining serious CVAEs were intracranial aneurysm (n = 2), deep vein thrombosis (n = 2), hypertension (n = 1), hypovolemic shock (n = 1), venous thrombosis limb (n = 1), arteriovenous malformation (n = 1), cerebrovascular arteriovenous malformation (n = 1), atrial fibrillation (n = 1), pericarditis (n = 1), and sinus tachycardia (n = 1).

Five patients had significant (&gt;8 times the ULN) but transient AST/ALT elevations. However, factors in the patients' medical histories such as gall bladder disease, infection with concomitant use of antibiotics known to have liver side effects (e.g., azithromycin), and Epstein-Barr virus infection could better account for these events. No liver enzyme elevations were serious or met the criteria for the Hy law, and none needed treatment.</p>
                <p>No severe hypersensitivity events, including anaphylaxis, were observed during the study. No safety signal was observed for ophthalmic AEs, which were monitored due to unconfirmed preclinical findings in monkeys.

In the HALO CM and EM studies and the current study, injection sites were proactively monitored and graded systematically, as required by the protocols, for pain, erythema, induration, and ecchymosis immediately and at 1 hour after study drug administration.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> This proactive monitoring may have resulted in the higher rates of injection-site reactions observed in these studies compared with earlier or subsequent studies. Despite these higher rates, most injection-site reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and only 3% to 5% of patients discontinued due to an AE.</p>
              <p>CVAEs were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and occurred with similar frequency across treatment groups and patient populations. The most frequent CVAE was hypertension. The vast majority of these events were single occurrences as opposed to sustained blood pressure elevations, were considered unrelated to study drug, and were observed in patients with a history of hypertension. Among patients with hypertension at baseline, mean and median systolic and diastolic blood pressures showed a downward trend across the course of the study.</p>
              <p>Two patients had serious CVAEs leading to discontinuation. One patient with CM receiving fremanezumab monthly had venous thrombosis of the left leg that was moderate in severity and resolved 107 days later after treatment with rivaroxaban. The event was not considered related to study drug by the investigator or sponsor because the patient had a recent diagnosis of endometrial cancer (a risk factor for hypercoagulability) and a report of recent air travel, which may be associated with increased venous stasis and risk of lower extremity venous thrombosis. The other patient was in the EM group receiving fremanezumab quarterly and experienced atrial fibrillation that was severe, was not related to study drug, and resolved the same day. This patient was treated with rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation, acarbose and losartan for elevated blood pressure, and diltiazem and flecainide acetate for the prevention of atrial fibrillation. Due the association of migraine with CVAEs and the theoretical concern of systemic CGRP antagonism to result in vascular effects,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">â</xref><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> caution is warranted.</p>
              <p>Six women were discontinued due to pregnancy during the study. Four of these women had AEs (&lt;1%), with 2 cases resulting in the loss of pregnancy. In an evaluation of the 20 pregnancies that have occurred in the clinical development of fremanezumab (15 in the fremanezumab arms, 5 in the placebo arm), there is no evidence of an increased rate of complications in the fremanezumab vs the placebo arms, nor is there evidence of any dose-response relationship between the occurrence of pregnancy complications and treatment assignment. It is important to note that the rate of fetal defects observed in the general US population is â3% to 5%.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The pregnancy data available for fremanezumab should be considered limited, and as a precautionary measure, pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant should avoid the use of fremanezumab. To provide further safety information, a pregnancy registry and database study are currently planned.</p>
              <p>No safety signal was observed for ophthalmic AEs of at least moderate intensity. The study sponsor decided to define any ophthalmic events of at least moderate severity as AEs of special interest on the basis of data from a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys, which indicated slight perivascular inflammation around the ciliary vessels of the eye. The perivascular nature (minimal grade of severity), location, and appearance of the inflammation suggested a species-specific immunogenic response to the humanized monoclonal antibody. Ophthalmic events occurred infrequently, and none were considered related to the study drug by the investigator or the sponsor.</p>
              <p>A â¥50% reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days, a response considered clinically relevant in controlled trials of preventive treatment for migraine,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> was observed in more than half of patients with CM and approximately two-thirds of patients with EM at 12 months. Across the different outcomes, including the reduction in monthly number of migraine days and headache-related disability achieved in the placebo-controlled phase, effects were maintained for the additional 12-month treatment period regardless of fremanezumab dosing regimen. Specifically, the proportions of patients who had a â¥50% response rate continued to increase over time. While discontinuations may be responsible for some of the increase in responder rates, the low incidence of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (4%) suggests that this impact is likely to be small or negligible. Another possibility is that patients may experience a delayed onset of response to therapy or accumulate additional response to therapy over time. In practice, patients who see some improvement but who have not yet achieved desired responses may benefit from a longer trial duration before a clinical decision is made to discontinue the medication. To help guide clinical decisions, future studies should also clarify whether patients who do not benefit from fremanezumab would still be likely to benefit from a different therapy that targets the CGRP pathway (or vice versa) or whether a different class of therapy should be considered.</p>
              <p>The safety profile of fremanezumab, combined with its efficacy and flexible dosing regimens, has the potential to improve medication persistence and clinical outcomes, as demonstrated by the low percentage of treatment withdrawal due to tolerability issues (4%) and lack of efficacy (4%). In a pooled analysis of 2 6-month pivotal North American migraine prevention trials of topiramate, which typically has high persistence for an oral migraine preventive medication,<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> 52.9% completed topiramate treatment, with the most common reasons for discontinuing treatment being AEs (22.2%) and lack of efficacy (8.5%).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Strengths of the current study include blinding of patients to treatment regimen (fremanezumab quarterly or monthly) and allowing patients to remain on concomitant migraine preventive medication. Outcomes for safety, tolerability, and efficacy were similar between quarterly and monthly dosing regimens and between patients taking and not taking concomitant preventive medications.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Given a lack of outcome differentiation between the quarterly and monthly doses, other patient-related factors may drive decision-making during selection of the optimal dosing option (e.g., patient preference).</p>
              <p>There were also several limitations to this study. There was no placebo control. The study was not powered to detect efficacy differences between treatment groups. For patients receiving fremanezumab monthly, the 675-mg starting dose used in the current study for patients with CM is not an approved dosing regimen.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> However, the impact of this loading dose over the 12-month treatment period is considered low. Patients with â¥2 failed preventive drug classes and those with continuous headache were excluded, which may limit generalizability. Results from a separate double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase 3b study (An Efficacy and Safety Study of Fremanezumab in Adults With Migraine [FOCUS]; NCT03308968) evaluating fremanezumab in patients with CM and EM with documented failure to 2 to 4 classes of preventive therapies showed that, compared with placebo, treatment with fremanezumab quarterly or monthly was associated with significant reductions in the monthly number of migraine days.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> This provides insight into the effectiveness of fremanezumab in a patient population that has been difficult to treat with traditional migraine preventive medications. Furthermore, there were small numbers of patients in the current study with treatment-emergent positive electronic C-SSRS responses (n = 8) or suicidal ideation AEs (n = 4). These AEs were considered not related to study drug. It is worth noting that depression is common in the migraine population.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The impact of fremanezumab on depression was not systematically evaluated in this study.</p>
              <p>This study provides evidence for the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab as either a quarterly or a monthly dosing regimen. Fremanezumab continues to change the landscape of migraine prevention and treatment and provides a treatment option for patients with EM or CM to reduce their pain and disability while improving their quality of life.</p>
