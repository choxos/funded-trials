                  <p>From early in the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence suggested a role for cytokine dysregulation and complement activation in severe disease. In the TACTIC-R trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2, and ravulizumab, a monoclonal inhibitor of complement C5 activation, as an adjunct to standard of care for the treatment of adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>TACTIC-R was a phase 4, randomised, parallel-arm, open-label platform trial that was undertaken in the UK with urgent public health designation to assess the potential of repurposing immunosuppressants for the treatment of severe COVID-19, stratified by a risk score. Adult participants (aged ≥18 years) were enrolled from 22 hospitals across the UK. Patients with a risk score indicating a 40% risk of admission to an intensive care unit or death were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to standard of care alone, standard of care with baricitinib, or standard of care with ravulizumab. The composite primary outcome was the time from randomisation to incidence (up to and including day 14) of the first event of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, cardiovascular organ support, or renal failure. The primary interim analysis was triggered when 125 patient datasets were available up to day 14 in each study group and we included in the analysis all participants who were randomly assigned. The trial was registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04390464" id="interrefs20">NCT04390464</ext-link>).</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between May 8, 2020, and May 7, 2021, 417 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to standard of care alone (145 patients), baricitinib (137 patients), or ravulizumab (135 patients). Only 54 (39%) of 137 patients in the baricitinib group received the maximum 14-day course, whereas 132 (98%) of 135 patients in the ravulizumab group received the intended dose. The trial was stopped after the primary interim analysis on grounds of futility. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for reaching the composite primary endpoint was 1·11 (95% CI 0·62–1·99) for patients on baricitinib compared with standard of care alone, and 1·53 (0·88–2·67) for ravulizumab compared with standard of care alone. 45 serious adverse events (21 deaths) were reported in the standard-of-care group, 57 (24 deaths) in the baricitinib group, and 60 (18 deaths) in the ravulizumab group.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Neither baricitinib nor ravulizumab, as administered in this study, was effective in reducing disease severity in patients selected for severe COVID-19. Safety was similar between treatments and standard of care. The short period of dosing with baricitinib might explain the discrepancy between our findings and those of other trials. The therapeutic potential of targeting complement C5 activation product C5a, rather than the cleavage of C5, warrants further evaluation.</p>

              <p id="para10">SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and the outbreak was designated a pandemic in March, 2020. At a time when there were no effective treatments for COVID-19 and no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, data from China and Italy, and emerging UK data, indicated that COVID-19 manifested as mild-to-moderate respiratory illness in the majority of people, but that approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 developed severe disease.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The progression to severe disease was noted to be contemporaneous with the development of an aggressive adaptive immune response.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The TACTIC-R trial was designed in March, 2020, when it was clear that tissue damage in the lungs was associated with spread of the virus through the epithelial barrier and both innate and adaptive effector cascades, including aberrant activation of proinflammatory cytokine networks, the coagulation and complement cascades, and the development of endothelialitis, sometimes with thrombosis.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and the outbreak was designated a pandemic by WHO on March 11, 2020. We designed this trial in March, 2020, at which time there were no effective treatments for COVID-19 and no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. It was imperative to rapidly identify medications with efficacy to reduce mortality and morbidity from COVID-19. Emerging data from China reported that severe COVID-19 developed in susceptible individuals 7–14 days after infection with the virus. Tissue damage appeared to be caused by an aberrant immune response and microangiopathy with thrombosis. Evidence from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002–03 and a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that complement activation contributed significantly to tissue damage. TACTIC-R was designed as an adaptive platform trial that would enable a number of licensed immunosuppressive agents to be evaluated for efficacy in COVID-19. During this period, a number of other clinical trials in COVID-19 were being planned to test immunosuppressives, including dexamethasone and tocilizumab. Two immunosuppressives licensed for use in other diseases were selected for TACTIC-R. The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib, licensed in the UK for rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata, inhibited signalling from a variety of cytokines, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, GM-CSF, IL-12, IL-23, and type I and II inteferons. Baricitinib had also been reported to provide some independent inhibition of receptor-mediated uptake of SARS-CoV-2. The monoclonal complement C5 inhibitor, ravulizumab, licensed in the UK for use in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, generalised myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optca spectrum disorder, was chosen as a blocker of the amplification of inflammation (C5a) and the cytolytic membrane attack complex (C5b-9). We searched PubMed from database inception to May 20, 2020, for reports published in any language using the search terms (“SARS COV2” AND “baricitinib” AND “randomised clinical trial”) OR (“COVID-19” AND “baricitinib” AND “randomised clinical trial”) OR (“SARS COV2” AND “ravulizumab” AND “randomised clinical trial”) OR (“COVID-19” AND “ravulizumab” AND “randomised clinical trial”). We found no randomised clinical trials for either baricitinib or ravulizumab in COVID-19 at the start of the TACTIC-R trial.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">This is the first clinical trial to have evaluated ravulizumab in patients with moderate COVID-19 (patients who had been admitted to hospital but not given invasive ventilation) and the fourth largest randomised controlled trial to have evaluated baricitinib (RECOVERY had 8156 participants, COV-BARRIER had 1630 participants, and ACTT2 had 1033 participants). TACTIC-R did not show efficacy of baricitinib in COVID-19. However, the relatively small numbers and short dosing period in over 50% of the baricitinib group, might explain the discrepancy between the results of this trial and the results in the RECOVERY trial. TACTIC-R provides no evidence for efficacy of ravulizumab in COVID-19.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">A randomised controlled trial of zilucoplan, a non-biologic inhibitor of complement C5 activation, also showed no efficacy. However, randomised controlled trials of inhibitors of the complement C5 activation product, C5a, have returned mixed results and require further evaluation. The largest trial evaluating baricitinib in COVID-19 was the RECOVERY trial. Data from this, and a meta-analysis of all the trials evaluating JAK inhibitors (including COV-BARRIER and ACTT2) suggest a modest benefit of treatment with baricitinib in addition to standard of care.</p>
                </boxed-text>

              <p id="para90">Cytokine dysregulation is prominent in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and baricitinib, a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 that is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and severe alopecia areata and was considered in the TACTIC-R trial and other studies as a potential treatment option for severe COVID-19 because of its ability to inhibit a broad range of proinflammatory mediators. Unlike other JAK1/2 inhibitors, baricitinib also has a direct antiviral effect by inhibiting endocytic internalisation of SARS-CoV-2.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The involvement of complement activation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was initially inferred by extrapolation from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome. A study of SARS-CoV infection in mice demonstrated less severe tissue damage in complement C3-deficient mice than in wild-type mice.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> SARS-CoV had been shown to activate complement directly via the lectin pathway.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection, complement activation was demonstrated by increased levels of circulating C5a and by deposition of components of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) on bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and infiltrating leucocytes.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para100">The temporal association of the clinical features of COVID-19 with the development of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was consistent with complement involvement via the classical pathway of activation. Direct evidence of complement activation at sites of tissue damage in COVID-19 was shown by the deposition of complement components in biopsies of the livedoid rash that is associated with COVID-19, as well as by antemortem and post-mortem lung tissue.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Microvascular injury was characterised by endothelial necrosis and thrombosis. Both infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus and pseudovirions colocalised with complement activation products, including C4d, MASP2, and C5b-9, indicating activation of both the early and late complement cascade.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> A high-throughput proteomic assay showed consistent activation of classical pathway components (C1r and C1s), alternative pathway components (factor B and its modulators, factor I and factor H),<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and C8 alpha chain in the sera of patients with severe COVID-19.

              <p id="para110">Eculizumab and ravulizumab are monoclonal IgG2/4 kappa antibodies that share the same antigen-binding site. These antibodies recognise an epitope on complement component C5 and the binding of either antibody inhibits its cleavage into C5a and C5b. This inhibition reduces amplification of the innate inflammatory response through decreased chemoattraction by C5a and inhibits the assembly of the membrane attack complex, thereby reducing complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Ravulizumab is licensed for use in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, a rare acquired anaemia in which red blood cells are destroyed by aberrant activation of complement, and also for atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, in which a systemic thrombotic microangiopathy is caused by dysregulated complement activation.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Ravulizumab differs from eculizumab in the constant region of the immunoglobulin and has a longer half-life of approximately 50 days.</p>
              <p id="para120">In the TACTIC-R trial, we addressed the hypothesis that JAK1/2-dependent cytokines and terminal complement activation contribute to disease severity in COVID-19. We investigated whether the addition of either baricitinib (for up to 14 days) or a single ravulizumab infusion to standard-of-care treatment improved outcomes in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19.</p>

                <p id="para160">Baricitinib was administered as a 4 mg oral daily dose (two 2 mg tablets) for 14 days, or until the patient was discharged from hospital or met other cessation criteria. A reduced daily dose of 2 mg was given in patients aged 75 years or older or with an estimated Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance of 30–60 mL/min (inclusive) at screening. In the ravulizumab group, the drug was administered as a single intravenous infusion, at a concentration of 5 mg/mL through a 0·2 μm filter. A weight-based regimen was used to deliver 2·4 g ravulizumab for people with a bodyweight of 40–60 kg, 2·7 g for people with a bodyweight of 60–100 kg, and 3·0 g for people with a bodyweight of more than 100 kg.</p>
                <p id="para170">Patients were evaluated at screening (1 or 2 days before baseline: review of medical history and examination, medication review, full blood count and differential of white cell count, calculated Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance, alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase concentration, C-reactive protein concentration, pregnancy test [blood, for patients in whom pregnancy is possible], chest x-ray, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] and Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale [MRC] scores), at baseline (day 0 [at first dose]: days since onset of symptoms, demographics, anthropomorphic data, vital signs, position on 7-point ordinal scale, SARS-CoV-2 PCR result [if available], extraction of clinical data from medical records, and ECOG and MRC scores), and then daily until day 14 or discharge, whichever was sooner (days 1–14: vital signs, position on the 7-point ordinal scale, SARS-CoV-2 PCR result [if available], and review of adverse events). Additional assessments were made on days 2, 6, and 14 (±2 days), which were full blood count and differential of white cell count, calculated Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance, alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase concentations, and retrieval of clinical data. Further evaluations were done on day 28 and day 90 (±2 days), which were discharge status, vaccination status (ravulizumab group only), return to normal function status, mortality status, adverse event reporting, and ECOG and MRC scores.

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para180">The primary endpoint was the time from randomisation to incidence (up to and including day 14) of the first event of death, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), cardiovascular organ support (balloon pump or inotropes), or renal failure (estimated creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula &lt;15 mL/min or haemofiltration or dialysis). A competing risk event occurred if the patient was discharged from hospital before a primary endpoint event and a censored observation occurred if the patient reached day 15, or withdrew, before a primary event or discharge. Secondary endpoints for formal statistical inference, in order of importance, were as follows: clinical status, as assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale at day 14; time to discharge from hospital; all-cause mortality at day 28; time to pulse-oximetric oxygen saturation of more than 94% on room air; duration of oxygen therapy in days; time to clinical improvement (defined as &gt;2 point improvement from day 1 on the 7-point ordinal scale); incidence of adverse events of special interest (AESI; venous thromboembolism or new infection requiring antimicrobials); duration of hospitalisation (time to death, discharge, or observing the primary event) from the date of admission; and time to first negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The points on the pulmonary 7-point ordinal scale were as follows: (1) death; (2) IMV or ECMO; (3) non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; (4) low-flow oxygen; (5) hospitalised, no supplemental oxygen; (6) discharged from hospital, normal activities not resumed; and (7) discharged from hospital, normal activities resumed. In addition, the time to each of the individual components of the composite primary endpoint being met was evaluated. Exploratory endpoints included changes in biochemical predictors and immunoinflammatory signatures of therapeutic response.</p>
                <p id="para190">All serious adverse events (SAEs), including serious adverse reactions (SARs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), were collected. The safety population included all patients who were randomly assigned to a group. The trial was designed not to collect clinical features of progressive COVID-19 and associated complications as adverse events. Data on two AESI, new infection requiring antimicrobial treatment and venous thromboembolism, were collected. We recorded SAEs and AESI at screening, baseline, daily until day 14 (or discharge), and then at day 28 and day 90 (data were collected by a telephone and by retrieval of clinical data from the whole medical record after discharge). The occurrence of venous thromboembolism was determined from imaging results (ultrasound or MRI with contrast) or from autopsy reports.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para200">The TACTIC-R trial was designed in March, 2020, at which point there was a dearth of evidence to inform power calculations. We used an adaptive design with an interim analysis planned after 125 patients were recruited to each group. There were provisional plans for second and third interim analyses to be done after recruitment of 229 and 469 patients per group. This decision on the timing of interim analyses was informed by Bayesian posterior distributions for the treatment effects on the primary outcome of each experimental treatment. Specifically, the independent data monitoring committee was provided with estimates of the probabilities for each treatment group relative to control relating to efficacy (hazard ratio [HR] &lt;1·00), moderate or greater efficacy (HR &lt;0·80), similarity (HR &gt;0·80 and &lt;1·25), and harm (HR &gt;1·00). At the first interim analysis, the data monitoring committee reviewed the primary outcome and safety data and determined whether recruitment to each treatment group should cease due to a demonstration of efficacy, futility, or a safety signal. The final analysis was frequentist to avoid any issues with the choice of prior probability distribution and to be readily interpretable. As there were no preceding interim analyses, there was no requirement to account for multiple looks at the data and the comparison was between the two groups versus the standard-of-care treatment, as if the trial had been run as a three-arm conventional trial (with no added or dropped groups). Simulation studies of this blend of Bayesian interim and final frequentist analysis were done and showed satisfactory frequentist operating characteristics, in terms of type I error and power.</p>
                <p id="para210">The chosen event rate of 20% was based on data from the first 200 admissions with COVID-19 at Kings College Hospital (James Galloway, unpublished). Aside from reaching the end of the 14-day follow-up period, censoring was assumed to be negligible. The trial did not have a fixed sample size.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The decision about timing for interim analysis was based on a provisional sample size. This provisional sample size was based on a theoretical study that compared treatment to standard of care with a fixed sample size for two groups. Using 80% power to detect a clinically relevant difference in the primary outcome (one-sided α 0·025), the required sample sizes per group were calculated to be 125 to detect an effect size of 0·5, 229 to detect an effect size of 0·6, and 469 to detect an effect size of 0·7. The statistical properties of the Bayesian interim analysis, stopping guidelines, and sample sizes, in terms of type 1 error and power, were studied subsequently using simulation techniques.</p>
                <p id="para220">For the primary endpoint, we compared standard of care alone with standard of care plus either baricitinib or ravulizumab using a frequentist Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for a random-site effect. We applied proportional hazards tests and diagnostics based on weighted residuals to check the assumption of constant HRs.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The predictors and subgroups were all binary variables and, therefore, there was no linearity assumption. An intention-to-treat paradigm was adopted and the population included all patients who were randomly assigned, which excluded deaths, discharges, or withdrawals before randomisation. The Fine-Gray method was used to handle the competing event of discharge.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> The model was fitted across all three groups simultaneously. Each active investigational medicinal product group (baricitinib or ravulizumab) was compared, independently, with standard-of-care treatment. No adjustment for multiple testing of the two active treatment groups was done because, conceptually, two individual studies could have been done to compare each group with standard of care with no adjustment to their statistical significance level. For secondary endpoints, we used a hierarchical approach within each comparison of the active treatment groups to standard of care, with the endpoints ordered as described under Outcomes, and formal statistical significance was claimed for an endpoint only if all the preceding endpoints were also significant.</p>
                <p id="para230">We analysed the time-to-event secondary endpoints using Cox proportional hazards models, with the exception of duration of hospitalisation, which estimated the absolute difference of restricted mean survival time up to 14 days from hospital admission. We analysed the 7-point ordinal scale at day 14 using proportional odds logistic regression, adjusting for the baseline value and a random site-level intercept. The risk of AESI was compared by estimating the relative risk (RR). The medians of all possible pairwise differences were tested by Mann-Whitney U test. We performed subgroup analyses for the components of the risk score used to determine eligibility, dichotomised using the thresholds from the risk score. Covariates were individually included as adjusters in the regression model and treatment effects were estimated within each subgroup. We calculated the RRs (95% CI) of AESI according to Altman.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p>

Ravulizumab differs from zilucoplan, avdoralimab, and vilobelimab in that it blocks the activation of complement component C5 and, therefore, the production of both C5a and C5b. It is plausible that blockade of C5a has at least some benefit in COVID-19—eg, by reducing aberrant neutrophil recruitment and activation. However, global inhibition of C5a and C5b (and membrane attack complex) formation might promote viral persistence or secondary bacterial pneumonia.</p>
              <p id="para390">Systemic inflammation, with a prominent rise in IL-6 concentration, has been recognised to be associated with severe COVID-19 from early in the pandemic.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Deep immunophenotyping has recently demonstrated the strong association of an early increase in IL-6 levels with severe disease.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Longitudinal immunophenotyping has also shown that complement activation is implicated early in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> In individuals who subsequently developed severe COVID-19, higher levels of early complement activation were detected. Therefore, it remains plausible that a subset of patients with early, excessive IL-6 levels or complement activation might benefit from inhibition of either IL-6 signalling pathways or C5a activity, respectively. Blockade of these pathways might be beneficial earlier in the disease trajectory than was possible in patients who had been hospitalised, before the prescription of corticosteroids, or in individuals with detrimental IL-6 production or complement activation.</p>
              <p id="para400">There were no new safety signals with the addition of either baricitinib or ravulizumab to the standard-of-care regimen, as assessed through analysis of SAEs and AESI. There were more occurrences of venous thromboembolism in the baricitinib group than in either of the other groups, but the numbers were too small for significance testing. Despite anticipated immunosuppression associated with baricitinib and ravulizumab, no increase in infections requiring antimicrobials was noted. With respect to terminal complement blockade, no cases of meningococcal meningitis emerged.</p>
              <p id="para410">The advantages of the TACTIC-R trial included the randomised design, with no element of clinician selection of the trial group. The 22 recruiting sites included a range of secondary and tertiary hospitals, and randomisation was stratified by site to control for any site-related variation in outcomes. TACTIC-R was also designed to select patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 who had a high risk of severe disease, which was done by using a threshold on a clinical risk score indicating approximately a 40% risk of admission to an ICU or death.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> This trial collected all SAEs and two AESI. Venous thromboembolic events were of particular interest in patients who received baricitinib in view of reports of increased venous thromboembolic events in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with JAK inhibitors and the recognised prothrombotic state in severe COVID-19. The incidence of infection was relevant to both interventions due to their immunosuppressive properties.</p>
              <p id="para420">There are some important limitations associated with the TACTIC-R dataset. Patients were recruited across two waves of the pandemic, with 387 (93%) of 417 participants recruited in the second wave. The nature of the eligible patient group and viral strains changed during the course of the trial. The standard of care also evolved during this period. The use of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 became prevalent from June, 2020,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and tocilizumab was added to standard of care in January, 2021.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> TACTIC-R had been designed in a landscape with no effective treatments for COVID-19. However, it was conducted with standard-of-care glucocorticoids and during rollout of the first dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The TACTIC-R dataset suggests the rapid effect of dexamethasone, given the improvement in ECOG and dyspnoea scores between screening (shortly after admission) and baseline datasets. This result would be expected to decrease the power of the study to specifically detect an effect of inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines or of complement activation, since these pathways would already have been inhibited by corticosteroids.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> The number of patients recruited (417) further reduced the power of the TACTIC-R trial relative to ACTT2 (1033 patients), COV-BARRIER (1630) and, most strikingly, RECOVERY (8156).<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para430">Less than 40% of patients in the baricitinib group received the maximum 14-day course. The main reason for this was that many patients were discharged rapidly, particularly during the pandemic peak. Discharge was often within the first few days after random assignment into the trial. The patients in the baricitinib group of TACTIC-R received less of the drug compared with 73 (14%) of the 515 patients given baricitinib in ACTT2 and 120 (16%) of 764 in COV-BARRIER. In the RECOVERY trial, baricitinib was administred for 10 days, or until discharge; dose day equivalents received was not reported. Since ravulizumab was administered as a single intravenous infusion, this limitation did not affect the ravulizumab group (132 [99%] of 135 patients received 100% of the intended dose).</p>
              <p id="para440">TACTIC-R reports that neither baricitinib nor ravulizumab, as administered in this study, was effective in the reduction of disease severity in patients selected for severe COVID-19. However, baricitinib has been reported to be effective in three other trials. The discrepancy might be related to the short dosing period in more than 50% of the TACTIC-R baricitinib group. It remains possible that inhibition of selected effectors in the complement cascade has benefits in other patient subgroups, such as those earlier in the disease course, patients intolerant of corticosteroids, or patients selected on the basis of aberrant complement activation.</p>
