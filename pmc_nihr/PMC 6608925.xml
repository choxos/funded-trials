                <p>Effective perpetrator programmes should be embedded within a community response, engage all types of perpetrators and involve an educational approach that integrates the survivor’s voice. The Domestic Abuse Prevention Partnership (DAPP) is a transformative partnership based in the UK that aims to provide an integrated approach for perpetrators and survivors. This pragmatic mixed methods study was conducted to examine the baseline characteristics and individual outcomes of the main perpetrator programme within the DAPP. Applying a triangulation design, routine police re-offending aggregated data, pre- and post- perpetrator programme questionnaires, in-depth interviews with survivors, and focus-group discussions with perpetrators (clients) were integrated. Statistical analysis and thematic analysis were applied to quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The majority of clients (47%) referred through the DAPP (n = 228) described <italic>wanting to make their relationship better</italic> as the main reason for engaging with the main perpetrators programme. Post-perpetrator programme questionnaires identified positive changes in both emotional behaviours and physical behaviours amongst clients, which were also supported by examples of improved relationships with their children described in survivor interviews. Three themes were described: first, <italic>making positive progress;</italic> second, <italic>impact of the children’s module;</italic> and <italic>concerns around sustaining new behaviours</italic>. Over the monitoring period, 1 in 5 clients were either suspected or convicted of domestic abuse crimes following the programme. This suggests that further maintenance of positive behaviours and reinforcements are required for some clients. Given that clients felt children were a strong motivating factor for completing a programme, it seemed paradoxical that no specialist services were made available for them. Future reiterations of the DAPP model should at least address how best to work with children in families where domestic abuse occurs.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>National statistics for England and Wales estimate that 6.0% of adults aged 16–59 experienced domestic abuse in the last year, with a higher proportion experienced by women (7.9%) versus men (4.2%) [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These estimates are based on the latest UK government’s definition of domestic abuse, as <italic>‘any incident or pattern of in</italic>cid<italic>ents of controlling</italic>, <italic>coercive</italic>, <italic>threatening behaviour</italic>, <italic>violence or abuse</italic>, <italic>between those aged 16 or over who are</italic>, <italic>or have been</italic>, <italic>intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality’</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Domestic abuse has wider cost implications for the health and social care system, with direct medical and mental healthcare costs approximating £1730 million per annum in the UK [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Intimate partner violence is particularly prevalent among both survivors and perpetrators receiving mental health services. Although the relationship is likely bi-directional, domestic abuse is associated with mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given that the majority of domestic abuse survivors are women, the development and implementation of perpetrator programmes often take a gendered view by examining the role, and influence, of power and control within the relationship. Most domestic violence perpetrator programmes (DVPPs) are therefore embedded in an understanding of heterosexual relationships; apply cognitive behavioural, pro-feminist or psychodynamic treatments; whilst 50% reportedly use a combination of multiple treatment types [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over the years, DVPPs have developed through a process of critical reflection and engagement using the National Practitioners Network (NPN), as well as from listening and responding to perpetrators [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>Voluntary community based programmes work with perpetrators of domestic abuse referred from community services, such as Children’s Services and the family courts. Such programmes often involve multiple agencies, meaning that there is increased opportunity for inefficiency, duplication and poor decision making [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Many community agencies, with a focus on survivors, also lack the adequate knowledge and competency of working with perpetrators. To circumvent some of the issues around dealing with perpetrators, voluntary community based programmes may use co-location, whereby referral agencies are supported through additional training and engagement. Given the complexity of embedding DVPPs within the community, and concerns around quality and efficiency, there is particular interest in modelling a multi-agency approach and evaluating the process of undertaking DVPPs, in addition to reporting the outcomes of such programmes [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>The effectiveness of perpetrator programmes has long been debated. However, it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of these programmes, primarily due to the difficulties arising from study methodology. Limitations in study design include small sample sizes, low response rates during follow-up, and no equivalent comparison or control group [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, evidence suggests that programmes embedded within a coordinated community response, that aim to identify, treat and retain perpetrators, lead to the most positive response in terms of re-assault prevention [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="sec002">
                <title>The Domestic Abuse Prevention Partnership (DAPP)</title>
                <p>The DAPP is a multi-agency initiative based in Hampshire, UK led by a third sector organisation. The DAPP is a novel community based partnership that provides a tiered, flexible and needs-led approach; bridging specialist services for domestic abuse, with a focus on working directly with perpetrators. The DAPP is considered novel as it provides a voluntary programme (i.e. not court-mandated) for perpetrators and ensures that survivors are offered support at the same time. Furthermore, the DAPP provides one to one support for perpetrators whose lives are considered too chaotic to manage group work; in addition to the psycho-educational support offered through the one to one work, such individuals may be given additional support to find housing or employment, for example.</p>
                <p>Under the DAPP, perpetrators (clients) engage with a 20-week programme, named the RADAR/ADAPT programme, consisting of modular group work. The modules include awareness raising, relationship dynamics, children and domestic abuse and parenting.</p>
                <p>The aim of this study was to add to the limited evidence around community perpetrator programmes, and what they achieve, by evaluating motivations for engagement, type of abuse committed, as well as behavioural change outcomes following the 20-week programme, using data from both client and survivor.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>This was a mixed methods study with a triangulation design model, which aims to examine the effectiveness of the DAPP model by simultaneously triangulating both quantitative and qualitative data [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>

                <title>Police data on reoffending (Record Management System)</title>
                <p>Police reoffending data was used as a proxy indicator of harm caused to the partners, or former partners, by those who had attended the main perpetrator programme within the DAPP. Hampshire Constabulary provided aggregated police monitoring data on 80 clients who completed the programme between 01 April 2016 and 30 September 2017. The data included the total number of clients linked to any crime, as well as domestic-abuse related crime, either suspected or convicted.</p>

                <title>IMPACT monitoring (Pre- and post-programme questionnaire)</title>
                <p>The IMPACT monitoring toolkit was developed by the Work with Perpetrators European Network to harmonise and enhance the monitoring and evaluation of work with perpetrators across Europe [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The IMPACT toolkit consists of a questionnaire that examines, through self-report, perpetrator behaviour (towards their partner or former partner) including type of abuse; their well-being; the impact on children; and their current relationship with their partner. To monitor progress through the main perpetrator programme offered through the DAPP, clients filled out the IMPACT questionnaire before (T0), and after, the main programme (T3).</p>

                <title>In-depth interviews</title>
                <p>The qualitative methods included focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The in-depth interview was chosen to explore outcomes for survivors, whose partner (or former partner) had engaged with the main programme. One-to-one interviews were considered the most appropriate means for exploring personal experiences and perceptions, as compared to any other qualitative methods. A support worker from the third sector organisation contacted and identified survivors who were willing to be interviewed. The majority of survivors did not have regular contact with their perpetrator and therefore could not provide accounts of the programme. Based on the difficulties of consenting survivors to be interviewed about their partner’s (or former partners) engagement with the programme, and the limitations in numbers, a maximum of 10 participants were to be recruited. The inclusion criteria included: survivors that acknowledged incidence of abuse through case reporting; survivors that were currently in contact with staff at the third sector organisation; and survivors that expressed willingness for feedback regarding clients’ progress through the programme.</p>

                <title>Focus group discussions</title>
                <p>Focus group discussions were considered as the most appropriate way to draw on the experiences and perceptions of the majority of clients–as their experiences of the RADAR/ADAPT programme were constructed as a group. Due to the nature of running a 20 week programme, it was not possible to choose groups at random, as selection occurred during a short research period window of three months, when only a small number of groups were running. Based on feasibility, a maximum of two focus groups were selected, and took place before, or after, the planned programme session.</p>

                <title>Interview protocols</title>
                <p>All in-depth interviews were carried out by SM, and the focus group discussions by both SM and BM. Whilst all participants engaged within focus group discussions were male, it is also necessary to acknowledge that both SM and BM are female researchers. A semi-structured topic guide was developed based on the literature, with both structure and flexibility, so that the order in which the topics were discussed followed a natural course. All interviews took place in a private location without any outside disturbances. Consent was required from each participant before the start of the interview. The recorded interviews were later transcribed.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>For quantitative data, statistical analysis was undertaken using Stata version. 14. For both IMPACT and police data, which were based on individual data, complete case analysis was used. Using the IMPACT data, descriptive statistics were used to summarise the client’s individual variables. Clients were asked about their behaviours reporting on a Likert scale: <italic>never</italic>, <italic>sometimes</italic> or <italic>often</italic>. There were a total of 14 descriptive questions of physical behaviour; 11 of emotional behaviour; and 7 of sexual behaviour. These responses were recoded into binary codes: 0 –never; and 1 to include those that responded either <italic>sometimes</italic> or <italic>often</italic>. These were then used to produce an overall continuous score for each behavioural type (emotional, physical, sexual) and are presented as prevalence (%).</p>
                <p>To examine change over time, individuals were matched at T0 and T3, and behaviours were compared. Reoffending rates were determined using aggregated police data for those completing the programme over one year; showing the total crimes committed (as suspect or convicted) amongst completers, the proportion of total crimes that related specifically to domestic abuse, and the total number of clients (completers) that were implicated.</p>
                <p>For qualitative data, the transcripts were exported into NVivo version 10, a qualitative data management software package. Using the thematic approach outlined by Braun and Clark, a six phase process was undertaken; in which patterns were identified, analysed and reported within the dataset [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, negative case analysis was undertaken to look for patterns that contradicted patterns in the dataset.</p>

                <title>Research ethics</title>
                <p>Ethical permissions were granted by the University of Southampton Ethical Committee (ID: 26211). Upholding ethics, good governance and quality in practice was central to all processes. These include the moral principles guided by four main principles of bioethics–as suggested by Beauchamp and Childress [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The principles are autonomy (informed consent), non-maleficence (do no harm), positive beneficence (benefits of research outweigh the risks) and justice (research strategies and procedures are just and fair). The social workers consented for routine data, from both clients and survivors, to be shared for the purposes of the evaluation by using a consent tick box on an assessment form. This routine data was shared for the research purposes as wholly anonymised data. During the evaluation, analysis, and write-up, no data was linked to the names of participants. For qualitative interviews, formal informed consent was obtained by researchers (SM, BM) for each participant. For survivors, the research interviews were conducted by phone for ease and privacy; verbal consent was obtained and audio-recorded. For clients, written consent forms were obtained. The qualitative quotes have been pseudonymised in this written report. All interview materials were approved by the Ethical Committee.</p>

                  <title>Qualitative evaluation</title>
                  <p>Overall two focus groups (n = 12) were conducted with clients (perpetrators) who had either completed, or were close to completing, the programme. A further eight survivors were interviewed during data collection, to explore the extent and nature of any behavioural change observed in their partners, or former partners. Of the survivors interviewed, approximately five were in contact with the partner concerned. Overall there were three major themes, which are outlined in further detail below.</p>

                  <p>A richer understanding into how the RADAR/ADAPT programme brought about change was gained through focus group discussions. The clients were asked about how their behaviours had been influenced by the programme. Overall, clients indicated that they were making positive progress by attending programme, that the RADAR/ADAPT programme had a big impact compared to other treatments (sub-theme 1), and that both the effort and time spent on the programme were integral to such progress (sub-theme 2). One respondent felt that the programme had enabled him to accept responsibility for his behaviour and suggested that the relationship with his wife had improved as a result of this,</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study provides unique evidence on the outcomes of behaviour, reasons for engagement, as well as the types of abuse committed by clients on a community perpetrator programme by using a triangulation design of various data sources including police data. At the individual-level, the data provided through the IMPACT Toolkit showed positive changes in both the physical and emotional behaviours related to domestic abuse after completion of the programme. This is consistent with previous evaluations, which found significant reductions in both physical and sexual violence between baseline and twelve months after programme, taken from the survivors’ perspective [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Within the DAPP, survivors also reported improved relationships, particularly in regards to the clients’ relationships with children. The qualitative findings were also supported by police data, showing that just over one in four of the individuals enrolled on the DAPP will go on to commit, or be suspected of, any crime after completion the programme. However, domestic abuse crimes amounted to less than half of these total crimes committed by one in five individuals.</p>
              <p>These individual level changes were attributed to the quality and length of the programme. In particular, men felt that the time invested in the programme was necessary to embed new behaviours. This finding is consistent with the evaluation conducted on the Tyneside DVPP, whose programme was <italic>specifically designed</italic> to be long enough to effect real change in men’s abusive behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, clients on the RADAR/ADAPT programme cited that both the intensity and peer support were required to facilitate change. In the Mirabel evaluation that examines DVPPs across eleven sites, group work sessions were described as being both informative and useful in promoting change; furthermore the one-size fits all was considered the most acceptable approach [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consistent with findings here, input from both facilitators and other men within the group context enabled this behavioural change process.</p>
              <p>As found in previous evaluations, the children’s module was often mentioned by clients, in particular the sessions where clients were asked to put themselves in the position of children living with domestic abuse [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The power-control wheel was also frequently mentioned by clients as a useful framework for conceptualising abusive behaviour. The most cited motivating factor for men to join a programme was a willingness to improve relationships, particularly with their children. However, motivation is inherently individual, and there were a number of clients that engaged with a programme who did not have children. As is personal development, with different men being at different stages in their journey towards addressing their own behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to the transtheoretical model, individuals could be at any stage within the behavioural change process. [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Some participants had taken steps to initiate change before even starting the programme; for example, by meeting counsellors or therapists. As with other models of behaviour change, change is not a linear process, and some individuals may regress to old behaviours. The RADAR/ADAPT programme is specifically designed to reinforce notions around positive behaviour, moving them towards positive action. However, our results showed that one in five will go on to be a suspect or convicted of a domestic abuse crime after completion. This suggests that, for some individuals, it is difficult to embed new behaviours. Evidence shows that lasting behavioural change can take between six months to five years, supporting the need to maintain new behaviours beyond the end of the programme [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>When interpreting these findings, it is important to acknowledge the following limitations. Firstly, the outcome data was limited to small numbers (n = 34). The IMPACT Toolkit was relatively new to the DAPP, and therefore it took some time to implement its use, which led to missing data on outcomes. Secondly, the end of intervention questionnaire was only completed by clients of the group, and not by survivors (partners or former partners), due to the practicalities around doing this. It was therefore not possible to triangulate these results with the survivors’ perspective. Some questions in the before/ after questionnaire assessed the insight of the perpetrator, and how his behaviour <italic>affected</italic> his partner. It would therefore be more accurate to evaluate impact of harm through the survivor’s responses. Thirdly, the RADAR/ADAPT programme was specific to the domestic abuse experienced between intimate partners within heterosexual relationships. The implications are that a number of individuals may not find the programmes appropriate to their context, particular those within lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer (LGBTQ) relationships. Finally, the police data included information on those who had completed the programme only. This meant that a comparative analysis, of those who engaged versus those who did not, could not be carried out which would of otherwise provided valuable information.</p>

              <title>Implications</title>
              <p>Given that children were a strong motivation for completing a programme, it seemed almost paradoxical that there were no specialist services made available for children within the DAPP model. Consistent with other evaluations on DVPPs, there is a need for a more dedicated support service for children of men on DVPPs, as this is an opportunity to safeguard children. Recent national strategies advocate for early prevention and intervention for domestic abuse, addressing issues <italic>earlier in the cycle</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0218408.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although there is compelling evidence to suggest that men changed their behaviours following the programme, police reoffending data suggests that, for a minority of individuals, more work is required to fully embed positive behaviours. A mentoring service may support such aims.</p>
              <p>To further support evidence on behavioural change, long term outcomes related to survivor harm should be measured for example, through a short questionnaire filled out by current or former partners. As suggested previously, follow-up periods to DVPPs may be too short. [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Both nationally, and internationally, there is a need to demonstrate the long term outcomes related to programmes, and to triangulate data with survivors’ views. Given that survivor engagement may be poor, shorter versions of questionnaires undertaken by a phone interview may offer a more practical solution [<xref rid="pone.0218408.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
