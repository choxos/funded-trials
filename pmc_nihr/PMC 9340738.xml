Due to difficulties in obtaining representative respiratory samples and insensitive standard microbiological methods, the microbiological aetiology of CAP is difficult to ascertain. With a few exceptions, standard-of-care diagnostics are too slow to influence initial decisions on antimicrobial therapy. The management of CAP is therefore largely based on empirical treatment guidelines. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated in the primary care setting, affecting diagnostic tests based on conventional bacterial culture in hospitalized patients. Implementing rapid molecular testing may improve both the proportion of positive tests and the time it takes to obtain test results. Both measures are important for initiation of pathogen-targeted antibiotics, involving rapid de-escalation or escalation of treatment, which may improve antimicrobial stewardship and potentially patient outcome.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients presenting to the emergency department of Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) in Bergen, Norway, will be screened for inclusion into a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT). Eligible patients with a suspicion of CAP will be included and randomised to receive either standard-of-care methods (standard microbiological testing) or standard-of-care methods in addition to testing by the rapid and comprehensive real-time multiplex PCR panel, the BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel <italic>plus</italic> (FAP <italic>plus</italic>) (bioMérieux S.A., Marcy-l’Etoile, France). The results of the FAP <italic>plus</italic> will be communicated directly to the treating staff within ~2 h of sampling.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">We will examine if rapid use of FAP <italic>plus</italic> panel in hospitalized patients with suspected CAP can improve both the time to and the proportion of patients receiving pathogen-directed treatment, thereby shortening the exposure to unnecessary antibiotics and the length of hospital admission, compared to the standard-of-care arm. The pragmatic design together with broad inclusion criteria and a straightforward intervention could make our results generalizable to other similar centres.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par28">Lower respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), are a leading cause of hospital admissions and mortality in all age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Pneumonia places a large burden on healthcare resources, with associated enormous annual costs in Europe, mainly due to hospitalization and absence from work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par29">Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, with accompanying inflammation. Typical clinical symptoms include cough with or without sputum, fever, dyspnoea and chest pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, elderly patients, who represent most admissions for pneumonia, present without many of these features. Moreover, chest radiography is hampered by suboptimal sensitivity to detect pulmonary infiltrates, especially in the initial phase of the disease and in elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In light of the diagnostic difficulties, the reported incidence of hospital-treated CAP varies considerably: between 10 and 420 cases per 10,000 adults per year in developed countries, with higher numbers in children and elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, estimated mortality rates are between 1 and 48% and consistently found to increase with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A prospective study conducted at Drammen Hospital, Norway, found that 1- and 5-year mortality rates were 8.9% and 27.1%, respectively, among hospitalized CAP patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par30">As CAP is a potentially serious infection, antibiotics are often given rapidly after presentation to hospital. Due to uncertain microbial aetiology, patients are initially treated with empirical antibiotics that cover a broad range of potential pathogens. The microbiological aetiology of CAP based on conventional routine microbiological testing is achieved in up to 30–40% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. With a few exceptions, standard-of-care diagnostic methods are too slow to influence early decisions on antimicrobial therapy. Culture-based techniques are also affected by prior use of antibiotics. Furthermore, sampling from the lower respiratory tract is problematic due to contamination and colonization from the upper respiratory tract flora. The management of CAP therefore largely relies on national empirical treatment guidelines that reflect the prevailing local epidemiology and microbial resistance profiles. Improving microbiological identification and enhancing rapid detection of significant pathogens could have a major impact on the decision-making process, by providing real-time information for treatment decisions within the emergency department. Rapid molecular testing for CAP aetiology may facilitate pathogen-directed treatment, reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, shorten length of hospital stay, improve viral detections and treatment and rationalize isolation facility use. However, limited evidence exists to support its use over standard-of-care microbiological testing. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the use of molecular testing for respiratory viruses in hospitalized CAP patients in UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Molecular testing was associated with a greater proportion of patients being treated with brief courses of antibiotics, improved antiviral use, reduced length of stay and was considered safe. Moreover, respiratory viruses were detectable in up to 45% of hospitalized adults with acute respiratory illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These findings need confirming in other studies that include rapid molecular tests, targeting both viral and bacterial pathogens and with alternate outcome measures.</p>
                <p id="Par31">Tests using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can reduce the time to results compared with standard PCR panels from 12 to 48 h to about 2 h, with the potential to direct initial antimicrobial choice. The new generation BioFire® FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel <italic>plus</italic> (FAP <italic>plus</italic>) (bioMérieux S.A., Marcy-l’Etoile, France) includes the automated detection of 27 relevant bacterial (including atypical bacteria) and viral respiratory pathogens together with seven antimicrobial resistance genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The assay requires a 2-min hands-on time and a run time of about 1 h. We hypothesize that utilizing the FAP <italic>plus</italic> panel in CAP patients can improve both the time to and the proportion of patients receiving pathogen-directed treatment, thereby shortening the exposure to unnecessary antibiotics and the length of hospital admission.</p>

We hypothesize that the FAP <italic>plus</italic> may lead to an increase in the proportion of patients treated with, and shorten the time to, pathogen-directed treatment of CAP and so will reduce unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of CAP.</p>

In an allocation ratio of 1:1, eligible patients will be randomised to receive either standard-of-care methods (standard microbiological testing) or standard-of-care methods in addition to testing by the FAP <italic>plus</italic>. The trial is pragmatic with a PRECIS-2 rating of the nine domains as follows: eligibility: 4, recruitment: 5, setting: 5, organization: 5, flexibility (delivery): 4, flexibility (adherence): 5, follow-up: 5, primary outcome: 5, primary analysis: 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

                <title>Feasibility</title>
                <p id="Par34">To inform the trial, a prospective cohort feasibility study was carried out with 104 patients with suspected CAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The feasibility study mirrored the procedures described in the full-scale trial but without randomised of respiratory samples into two treatment arms. All lower respiratory tract samples were tested both by standard microbiological testing and by the FAP <italic>plus</italic>. The feasibility study was used to assess several parameters including the feasibility of recruitment, the included clinical and laboratory procedures and the usability and efficiency of the data entry process, data transfer and data analysis using the study-specific electronic case report form (eCRF) provided by Viedoc (Viedoc Technologies, Uppsala, Sweden). Thus, the feasibility study informed on any procedural or design refinements that were needed for the ensuing full-scale trial. Results from the feasibility study are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par47">The trial evaluates the utility of diagnostic tests used for diagnosing the microbiological aetiology in CAP. Blood tests and cultures, urine sample for urine antigen tests, chest x-ray and samples from the respiratory tract are collected in all patients following inclusion. Due to local infection control measures, the patients’ SARS-CoV-2 status needs to be clarified before collecting samples from the lower respiratory tract. Following consent, all patients are tested for their SARS-CoV-2 status. A confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is defined as a positive result on the rapid XpertXpress SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2/FLU/RSV test run on the GeneXpert system (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, U.A.) or on Cobas SARS- CoV-2 &amp; Influenza A/B test run by the Cobas Liat System (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) using naso-/oropharyngeal swab samples. Lower respiratory tract samples are collected after sputum induction or by endotracheal aspiration in both arms. On receipt of the lower respiratory tract sample at the Department of Microbiology, the patients are randomised to the following arms:</p>
                <sec id="FPar3">
                  <title>The standard-of-care arm</title>
                  <p id="Par48">The comparator arm corresponds to standard-of-care diagnostics currently provided to CAP patients at HUH. As described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], this includes bacterial culture of respiratory tract samples and blood according to current guidelines (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Blood culture isolates and relevant respiratory isolates are identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) using the Bruker’s microflex LT instrument, MBT Compass software ver. 4.1 and Compass Library DB-8468 (Bruker Daltonics, MA, USA). Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs are examined by an in-house real-time PCR test to detect respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (influenza A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, <italic>Bordetella parapertussis</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>). The total turn-around time for the in-house PCR test is up to 48 h and is comparable to other centres nationally. Standard methods also include the pneumococcal urine antigen test (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, USA). Any additional tests requested by the treating physician are noted and counted as part of standard methods. A positive SARS-CoV-2 result, growth in blood cultures and positive pneumococcal antigen test results are phoned to the treating staff.</p>

                  <p id="Par57">Since lack of microbiological identification is a major problem in CAP patients and enhancing rapid detection of significant pathogens could have a major impact on the clinical decision-making process, we selected two correlated primary outcomes with both time to and provision of pathogen-directed treatment. Limited evidence exists to support the use of these new molecular microbiological methods over standard of care, which uses standard microbiological testing. In a retrospective study including rapid molecular diagnostics, it has been suggested that de-escalation from broad-spectrum to pathogen-directed antibiotics could be undertaken in 77% of patients with CAP, while escalation should be done in 6%; however, a RCT is needed to confirm these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par94">To ensure a sufficiently large sample size to address the multiplicity issue introduced by considering two primary outcomes, we take a slightly conservative approach of assuming that the two outcomes are uncorrelated, implying that separate sample size calculations for the two outcomes must be carried out at a significance level of 0.025 instead of 0.05.</p>
                <p id="Par95">In a prospective study on hospitalized CAP patients, with stringent inclusion criteria (that included the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph), we showed that microbial aetiology with a combination of molecular and conventional methods could be established in 63% of included patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, for the proportion of patients with change in treatment from empirical antimicrobials to pathogen-guided treatment, we expect to be able to identify a pathogen in at least 50% of the cases using FAP <italic>plus</italic> versus 40% with the current standard-of-care methods.</p>
                <p id="Par96">The required sample size needed is 470 per arm (assuming a significance level of 0.025 and a power of 0.8), i.e., in total 940. Additionally, allowing for a 10% dropout rate results in a total sample size of 1045 patients. For the time to change from empirical treatment to pathogen-directed treatment, we have no data from previous studies on effect size to gauge the sample size calculation and therefore we will define the effect size in terms of the variation in the outcome (the standard deviation) as done in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par97">We find it clinically relevant to be able to detect a difference of 0.2 standard deviations, e.g., if the standard deviation of the time to change is 3 days, then we can detect a difference of 0.2‧3 = 0.6 day; if the standard deviation was 5 days, we would detect a difference of 1 day. The required sample size needed is 477 per arm (assuming a significance level of 0.025 and a power of 0.8), i.e., in total 954. Additionally, allowing for a 10% dropout rate results in a total sample size of 1060 patients.</p>
                <p id="Par98">In conclusion, a sample size of 1060 will ensure that we have 80% power to detect a difference in at least one of the two primary outcomes (at a significance level of 0.05).</p>

Patients with known obstructive lung disease and patients with hypoxemia or signs of airway obstruction upon physical examination are additionally treated with a bronchodilator (salbutamol and/or ipratropium bromide) prior to sampling. If sputum induction is unsuccessful, endotracheal aspiration is performed. Spontaneous sputum is accepted as an exception if an induced sputum or endotracheal aspiration cannot be collected</p>
                  <p id="Par108">The standard methods include culture of respiratory tract samples and blood according to current guidelines (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Blood culture isolates and relevant respiratory isolates are identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) using Bruker’s microflex LT instrument, MBT Compass software ver. 4.1 and Compass Library DB-8468 (Bruker Daltonics, MA, USA). Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs will be examined by an in-house real-time PCR test to detect respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria (influenza A and B, human parainfluenza viruses 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, <italic>Bordetella parapertussis</italic>, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>). Standard methods also include the pneumococcal urine antigen test (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, USA). Any additional tests requested by the treating physician are also noted and counted as part of standard methods.</p>
                  <p id="Par109">The representativeness of all sputum samples is evaluated by Gram staining (adapted from 22). Samples containing ≥ 10 squamous epithelial cells per field in at least 10 fields with 10× enlargement are considered non-representative. However, this criterion is disregarded if a significant amount of both leukocytes (≥ 10 times the amount of squamous epithelial cells per field of view) and a morphologically uniform microbe (&gt; 5 microbes per field of view with 100× enlargement) are present. Samples are analysed by the FAP <italic>plus</italic> and cultured on agar plates, irrespective of their representativeness. Abundant growth of plausible respiratory pathogens is reported regardless of the representativeness of the sputum sample. Non-abundant growth is only considered in samples considered representative.</p>

Risk stratification of patients at admission is required to guide management and treatment decisions. The most established score systems (such as the CURB-65 score, Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score) may accurately predict the severity and mortality in some CAP patients, but do not automatically identify patients that benefit from aggressive management strategies. We will register and evaluate several validated scoring systems: the CRB-65-score, CURB-65-score, SOFA-score, PSI-score, Charlton Comorbidity Index, Clinical Frailty scale, South African Triage Scale (SATS), Triage Early Warning Score (TEWS) and National Early Warning score 1 and 2 (NEWS 1 and 2).

              <p id="Par139">The COVID-19 pandemic spread to Norway during March 2020 and forced us to adapt to new routines and infection control measures deployed at hospitals and in the society at large. The planned start of the trial was therefore delayed with about 6 months. The time available to collect data and complete inclusions at the emergency department was initially restricted due to shortage of isolation facilities and a large inflow of patients. Initially, each patient is screened for SARS-CoV-2 before an induced sputum sample can be collected at the emergency department, with the subsequent risk of delaying the lower respiratory tract sampling. This is minimized by rapidly sending an oro- or nasopharyngeal swab for analysis by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test, which provides results within 1 h.</p>
              <p id="Par140">With the national infection control measures, including social distancing, use of facemasks and home office solutions, the number of hospital admissions for lower respiratory tract infections at Bergen Health Trust fell during the first year of the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This has resulted in slower inclusion rates than anticipated. Finally, COVID-19 and related quarantine among study staff has led to problems with optimal recruitment and timely pursuit of pre-defined study milestones due to absenteeism.</p>

Recruitment of patients is ongoing and expected to be completed in May 2023. The investigators may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early stopping may include, but are not limited to, demonstrated efficacy, futility or inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigators.
