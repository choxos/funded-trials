                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Without surgical repair, flexor tendon injuries do not heal and patients’ ability to bend fingers and grip objects is impaired. However, flexor tendon repair surgery also requires optimal rehabilitation. There are currently three custom-made splints used in the rehabilitation of zone I/II flexor tendon repairs, each with different assumed harm/benefit profiles: the dorsal forearm and hand-based splint (long), the Manchester short splint (short), and the relative motion flexion splint (mini). There is, however, no robust evidence as to which splint, if any, is most clinical or cost effective. The Flexor Injury Rehabilitation Splint Trial (FIRST) was designed to address this evidence gap.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">FIRST is a parallel group, superiority, analyst-blind, multi-centre, individual participant-randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assigned 1:1:1 to receive either the long, short, or mini splint. We aim to recruit 429 participants undergoing rehabilitation following zone I/II flexor tendon repair surgery. Potential participants will initially be identified prior to surgery, in NHS hand clinics across the UK, and consented and randomised at their splint fitting appointment post-surgery. The primary outcome will be the mean post-randomisation score on the patient-reported wrist and hand evaluation measure (PRWHE), assessed at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include blinded grip strength and active range of movement (AROM) assessments, adverse events, adherence to the splinting protocol (measured via temperature sensors inserted into the splints), quality of life assessment, and further patient-reported outcomes. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of each splint, and a qualitative sub-study will evaluate participants’ preferences for, and experiences of wearing, the splints. Furthermore, a mediation analysis will determine the relationship between patient preferences, splint adherence, and splint effectiveness.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">FIRST will compare the three splints with respect to clinical efficacy, complications, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. FIRST is a pragmatic trial which will recruit from 26 NHS sites to allow findings to be generalisable to current clinical practice in the UK. It will also provide significant insights into patient experiences of splint wear and how adherence to splinting may impact outcomes.</p>

                  <title>The personal and economic burden resulting from finger flexor tendon injuries</title>
                  <p id="Par45">Hand injuries in the UK have increased by 57% in 15 years, accounting for 20% of emergency presentations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There were 7346 flexor tendon injuries in 2018–2019; 75% were in working age men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Such injuries most frequently occur from a direct laceration to the tendon in the finger or palm of the hand. Without surgical repair and rehabilitation, divided tendons do not heal; patients cannot bend fingers, grip objects, or effectively care for themselves and others. Long-term prognosis can be poor: 50% of patients report pain and functional limitations 10 years post-injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Flexor tendon repair requires optimal rehabilitation, but the evidence base is limited</title>
                  <p id="Par46">The outcome of flexor tendon surgery relies on effective rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients routinely attend weekly appointments for up to 3 months after surgery, with full recovery (when achieved) taking up to 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are two components to rehabilitation: exercises to prevent hand stiffness and promote tendon glide/excursion and the provision of a splint to protect the repair.</p>
                  <p id="Par47">In the UK, there are three main custom-made splints used in the rehabilitation of zone I/II flexor repairs; however, there is insufficient evidence to inform the efficacy of these splints. A systematic review comparing rehabilitation following flexor tendon surgery suggested that future high-quality randomised controlled trials were required to establish which rehabilitation regimes are safe and most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>

                <title>Long—forearm and hand-based splint</title>
                <p id="Par48">A survey of UK current practice used to inform the feasibility of FIRST found that the long splint is the most commonly used splint following flexor tendon repairs. This has been the mainstay of clinical practice in the UK since the 1980s. This splint protects the newly repaired tendons by preventing movement at the wrist and reducing extension of the fingers.</p>

              <sec id="Sec7">
                <title>Short—hand-based splint</title>
                <p id="Par49">This was developed to allow combined wrist and finger movement and is believed to reduce the risk of complications such as stiffness, fixed flexion deformities of the interphalangeal joints (IPJs), and tendon adhesions due to the increased excursion of the repaired tendons through the synergistic motion of the wrist and hand. This has been reported in a case-series comparing the short and long splint for zone I/II flexor repairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our recent survey showed that the short splint has been incorporated into rehabilitation regimes for zone I/II repairs in approximately 50% of hand centres across the UK.</p>

                <title>Relative motion flexion splint (Mini)—finger-based splint</title>
                <p id="Par50">Over the last 5 years, there has been a worldwide shift in the management of extensor tendon repairs moving from using a long splint to the relative motion extension splint (RMES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. More recently, the concept of relative motion splinting has also been introduced into clinical practice for flexor tendon repairs. The relative motion flexion (RMFS (mini)) splint positions the affected digit into relative flexion and therefore utilises the quadriga effect to reduce the biomechanical pull on the repaired tendon. It is also worn in combination with a wrist splint for the first 3 weeks in order to limit full extension of the wrist. The mini splint is thought to provide less protection than the long and short splints described above, but the patients’ function may be improved whilst wearing the splint. This may lead to reduced joint stiffness.</p>

              <sec id="Sec9">
                <title>Rationale for current trial</title>
                <p id="Par51">Patients and clinicians need to know if one splint provides superior outcomes in terms of pain and function: this is the main justification of conducting this RCT. The process evaluation will help us understand how patient-level factors moderate adherence and how adherence mediates benefit and harm outcomes, which is critical for decision-making. Economic evaluation is essential because, while splint costs are comparable and relatively small, the costs of treatment failure and reintervention are substantial. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP).</p>

Participants may withdraw their consent to continue with follow-up for the RCT at any time, without providing a reason for this. Any data collected up to the point of the participant’s withdrawal will be retained, and used in the final analysis, and this will be made clear to the patient at the time of consent.</p>
                <p id="Par117">Participants who wish to withdraw from follow-up will be given the option to withdraw only from RCT visits and continue to complete follow-up remotely, where possible. Similarly, participants who do not attend a research follow-up visit(s) may be given the option to complete this follow-up visit remotely. This will ensure lost data is minimised and that the primary outcome is collected in a timely manner. Non-responders to email/postal questionnaires at all time points may be followed up by the CTRU research team using contact details provided by the participant.</p>
                <p id="Par118">The primary outcome is currently collected routinely at some sites, but not at all. Where applicable, if a patient chooses to withdraw from the entire RCT, they will be asked if they are happy for the RCT team to use their routinely collected data in order to inform the primary outcome. This will be optional, but if the patient agrees, it will help to maintain the statistical power and reduce the potential of bias introduced due to missing data when assessing RCT outcomes. Participants with ongoing adverse events at the point of withdrawal will also be asked if they are agreeable for routinely collected data to be used to inform safety outcomes. The RCT team will document this discussion on a RCT specific form and provide the participant with a copy for their records.</p>
                <p id="Par119">Efforts will be made to keep participants engaged in RCT follow-up. Regular updates will be posted on the RCT website and/or communicated via email or newsletter. Vouchers will be provided, and prize draws may take place, for participants who complete follow-up questionnaires. Follow-up visits have been aligned with routine clinic visits where possible, and routine outcome data will be used wherever possible, to minimise the additional burden on participants. Participants will only be considered lost to follow-up if they have not returned the week 52 questionnaires at the point of RCT closure. Where participants do not attend a scheduled appointment, or cannot be contacted to schedule an appointment, questionnaires will be sent via email and contact will be attempted again at each subsequent time point, unless the participant withdraws from the RCT.</p>

First, a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (i.e. economic evaluation alongside clinical trial (EEACT)) will be performed, and second, an analysis of the long-term cost-effectiveness will be conducted using a de novo decision analytic model. The cost-effectiveness of three splints will be estimated as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using full incremental analysis, accounting for any dominance. In the within trial analysis, QALYs will be estimated by calculating the area under the curve for health utility using the EQ-5D-5L, and the costs will be estimated for the health service resource use up to 1 year multiplied by national average costs. Long-term cost-effectiveness modelling will use the data from the RCT (on proportions of patients with complications and adverse events) to estimate the lifetime QALYs and costs. Sensitivity analyses will explore the potential impact of parameters upon costs, QALYs and ICERs. Parameter uncertainty will be included in probabilistic sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation.

The analysis will be based on the primary analysis model with the addition of an interaction term between the treatment and subgroup to assess the stability of the result in different populations. For simplicity, the interaction between treatment and time will be excluded from this model. Treatment effect estimates for the mean PRWHE post-randomisation scores with 98.3% confidence intervals will be calculated for each sub-group. The results will be displayed graphically using forest plots.

                <p id="Par146">The impact of missing PRWHE outcome data will be minimised to some extent by using the linear mixed model, which allows the inclusion of intermittent responders in the primary analysis. PRWHE scores for complete and intermittent responders will be compared descriptively. The impact of missing data will additionally be assessed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE). Missing outcome and covariate data will be predicted by age, rupture rate, hand dominance, available PRWHE data at other follow-up time points, and any baseline covariates found to be predictive of the outcome data. The estimates of the treatment effects and their associated confidence interval from the imputation model will be graphically displayed alongside the results for the observed data. Additional sensitivity analysis will consider scenarios whereby participants with missing data have outcomes worse than those with available data (missing not at random scenarios). The primary analysis approach will be based on the as-randomised population, analysing participants in their randomised groups regardless of adherence to their randomised intervention.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par179">FIRST aims to inform rehabilitation practices for flexor tendon ruptures by comparing the effectiveness of the three different splints currently used in standard care, in terms of patient-reported pain and function (assessed by the PRWHE). The results will inform national hand therapy and hand surgery guidelines. Embedded qualitative and health economic analyses will highlight factors influencing splint adherence and any cost-effectiveness differences between the three splints.</p>
              <p id="Par180">FIRST is a pragmatic RCT, which therefore sought to evaluate the study splints in a real-world setting. However, as different study sites had different levels of experience using the FIRST splints, a potential issue for the research was around the ability of therapists to fabricate the splints required at the different sites. To address this, face-to-face splint fitting training sessions are held with hand therapists from participating sites, to ensure consistency of fabrication across the sites. Splint fitting videos were also developed as a resource for site staff to refer back to and for use in training new staff members unable to attend the in-person sessions. Similarly, training videos for measurement of AROM were developed to promote consistency in AROM measurement across sites. Regular PI drop-in sessions are held as an opportunity for the sites to communicate with the RCT management team and each other and ask questions about the RCT protocol.</p>
              <p id="Par181">In addition to providing guidance on the rehabilitation of flexor tendon ruptures, the training described above is an important component of FIRST and has contributed to the impact that FIRST has had both on clinical development and also the opportunities that have been created for hand therapists to be involved in research. Through participation in the RCT, hand therapists from hand centres across the UK have been trained in fabrication of a splint, or splints, that were not previously used in all centres. Additionally, hand therapy teams with differing levels of experience in clinical research have been trained in the delivery of research, supported by the NIHR associate PI scheme.</p>
              <p id="Par182">The hand therapy community’s support for the RCT is clear and there is a high level of engagement from clinical teams. At the time of protocol publication, the 8-month internal pilot data has been reviewed by the RCT oversight committees and funder, who have agreed the RCT is feasible and advised that it should continue to full recruitment as per the current protocol. Additionally, the study oversight committees have raised no concerns about the per group data (including rupture rates) to date.</p>
