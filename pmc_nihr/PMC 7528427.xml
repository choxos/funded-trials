                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Fungal infections of the cornea, fungal keratitis (FK), are challenging to treat. Current topical antifungals are not always effective and are often unavailable, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries where most cases occur. Topical natamycin 5% is usually first-line treatment, however, even when treated intensively, infections may progress to perforation of the eye in around a quarter of cases. Alternative antifungal medications are needed to treat this blinding disease.</p>
                  <p>Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Previous pilot studies suggest that topical chlorhexidine 0.2% compares favourably with topical natamycin. Full-scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical chlorhexidine 0.2% are warranted to answer this question definitively.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will test the hypothesis that topical chlorhexidine 0.2% is non-inferior to topical natamycin 5% in a two-arm, single-masked RCT. Participants are adults with FK presenting to a tertiary ophthalmic hospital in Nepal. Baseline assessment includes history, examination, photography, in vivo confocal microscopy and cornea scrapes for microbiology. Participants will be randomised to alternative topical antifungal treatments (topical chlorhexidine 0.2% and topical natamycin 5%; 1:1 ratio, 2–6 random block size). Patients are reviewed at day 2, day 7 (with reculture), day 14, day 21, month 2 and month 3. The primary outcome is the best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) at 3 months. Primary analysis (intention to treat) will be by linear regression, with treatment arm and baseline BSCVA prespecified covariates. Secondary outcomes include epithelial healing time, scar/infiltrate size, ulcer depth, hypopyon size, perforation and/or therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant), positive reculture rate (day 7) and quality of life (EuroQol-5 dimensions, WHO/PBD-VF20, WHOQOL-BREF).</p>

              <p>Fungal keratitis (FK) is a severe and potentially blinding corneal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The burden is greatest in tropical and subtropical countries, probably due to a combination of climate (higher temperatures and humidity) and frequent agriculture-related eye injuries.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is one of the causes of microbial keratitis (MK) and accounts for between 20% and 60% of corneal infections diagnosed in tropical regions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is often inadequately treated with significant barriers to receiving appropriate, timely intervention, compounded by indiscriminate and inappropriate use of conventional medicines such as topical corticosteroids or harmful traditional eye medicines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 5</xref> Furthermore, when appropriate treatment is available, up to 30% of patients receiving current ‘gold-standard’ therapy progress to corneal perforation and/or eye-loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6 7</xref></p>

              <p>Treatment for FK almost always involves topical antifungal agents. Surgical intervention, usually in the form of therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK), is generally reserved for cases of corneal perforation or progressive infection refractory to medical therapy. Corneal transplantation is also performed for visual rehabilitation after the acute infection has resolved. There are a limited number of antifungals available for treating FK, which fall into four main groups: imidazoles, triazoles, polyenes and fluorinated pyrimidines. These may be available topically, orally or by intravenous injection. Subconjunctival, corneal stromal or intracameral injections may also be given. The treatment of yeasts (<italic>Candida spp</italic>) is often different to filamentous fungi, with the former being more common in temperate climates and the latter in hot and humid locations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref></p>
              <p>There have been several clinical trials comparing treatment options for FK, which have been systematically reviewed.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Natamycin (NATA), which was approved in the 1960s by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for FK, has been compared with a number of newer agents, including voriconazole. Natamycin and voriconazole have been compared in four trials, with the meta-analysis favouring natamycin.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 10 12–14</xref></p>
              <p>As a result, first line management of filamentous FK is usually with topical natamycin 5% when this is available. This was added to the WHO Essential Medicines List in 2017 for this indication. However, even when intensive topical natamycin is initiated, infections frequently progress relentlessly to perforation and loss of the eye in about a quarter of cases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6 7</xref> Moreover, in many countries, antifungal eye-drop treatments are simply not available. This includes most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, some Asian countries and some countries in Europe.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Natamycin is relatively expensive even if it is available. Therefore, additional alternative and more affordable drugs are clearly needed if the outcome of these infections is to improve.</p>
              <p>Chlorhexidine (CHX) is an antiseptic agent, with both antibacterial and antifungal properties. It is a widely used broad-spectrum biocide, killing micro-organisms through cell membrane disruption.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15–17</xref> CHX has been used in ophthalmology for over 30 years as an eye-drop preservative and for sterilising contact lenses, and has also been used to treat <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and FK.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 18–22</xref> In a study of potential antifungal treatments, CHX was effective both in vitro against FK isolates from India and Ghana, as well as in an Indian case series.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Subsequently, two pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CHX for FK were conducted. In the first, three CHX concentrations (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%) were compared with each other and natamycin 5%; this concluded CHX 0.2% had reliable antifungal action.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The same concentration is used in mouthwash to prevent oral candidiasis. In the second trial, CHX 0.2% was compared with topical natamycin 2.5% (half standard concentration). There was evidence CHX produced a more favourable response by 5 days (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A systematic review found a trend favouring CHX over natamycin in ‘curing’ by 21 days (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.09), suggesting CHX might prove superior in adequately powered trials.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> CHX is safe and well tolerated at these concentrations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19 22 24</xref> Based on this, CHX is used for treating FK in several countries.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 9 11</xref> However, the combined size of these two pilot trials comparing CHX and natamycin is not sufficient to reach firm conclusions. Currently, the meta-analysis indicates equipoise in terms of which treatment is the best for treating FK.</p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Objectives</title>
                <p>The primary objective of this study is to determine if topical CHX 0.2% is non-inferior to topical natamycin 5% for treating filamentous FK, in terms of vision at 3 months. The secondary objectives are: (1) to determine whether either treatment (CHX 0.2% or natamycin 5%) is superior to the other, in terms of vision at 3 months and (2) to determine whether there is a difference between CHX 0.2% and natamycin 5% in terms of secondary clinical outcomes including infiltrate/scar size, time to re-epithelialisation, reculture rates at 1 week and the effect of the alternative treatments on the Quality of Life of participants.</p>
                <p>CHX is cheap, stable and easily prepared by aqueous dilution. If CHX is found to be non-inferior (or even superior) to natamycin this offers the potential of an effective, affordable and accessible treatment for FK, which could benefit millions of people each year who currently have no treatment options. This trial is a response to this expressed need from both clinicians and patients for a readily available and affordable medication for fungal infection.</p>

The non-inferiority design of this trial offers a clinically pragmatic way to address this important question: if CHX is found to be within the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.15 logMAR (about 1.5 Snellen lines) then CHX may prove to be a sustainable solution for this aspect of the complex problem of FK.</p>

                <title>Trial summary</title>
                <p>This RCT follows a two-stage recruitment process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). All patients presenting with acute MK are reviewed and enrolled into stage 1, following written, informed consent. This involves history, examination and investigations (corneal scrapes for microbiological assessment and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)). If there is evidence of fungal hyphae on smear or confocal microscopy, patients then proceed to stage 2. A trial eligibility checklist is completed and stage 2 written informed consent is conducted. We will recruit 500 patients into stage 2. Eligible FK patients are then randomised 1:1 to receive either natamycin 5% or CHX 0.2% topical treatments hourly for the first week, then 2 hourly for the subsequent 2 weeks. Ongoing treatment duration will then be tailored to clinical response. Study personnel are masked to the treatment allocation. Patients are usually initially admitted and followed up on day 2, day 7 (with reculture), day 14, day 21, month 2 and month 3. The primary outcome is the best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) at 3 months.</p>

                <title>Trial setting</title>
                <p>Low-land Nepal, a region with a high burden of FK, provides a suitable location to conduct a clinical trial that requires a relatively large sample size. This trial will be conducted in Sagarmatha Choudhary Eye Hospital (SCEH), Lahan, Siraha District in south eastern Nepal. SCEH treats approximately 800 cases of keratitis per month, half of which is attributable to fungal infection.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 25</xref> SCEH is a tertiary-level ophthalmic hospital, with several satellite Eye Care Clinics (ECCs) that refer patients to SCEH directly as required. SCEH and its ECCs serve an estimated population of about 5 million people. Due to its proximity to the border, approximately 50% of the outpatients are Indian nationals. It is anticipated that the study participants will present to the hospital from multiple districts within the region. Potentially eligible individuals will be recruited from outpatient clinics or referred directly by the ECCs to the study team. Based on the numbers of patients attending, it should be possible to complete recruitment of 500 participants within 6–12 months. A second separate trial in East Africa (Tanzania and Uganda) will also be conducted to compare CHX 0.2% to natamycin 5% following a very similar protocol to the one described here. This will be registered as a separate trial. This will enable us to assess the generalisability of the findings in two geographically distinct regions with potentially different fungal aetiologies and susceptibility patterns.</p>

                <title>Eligibility criteria</title>
                <p>Potential participants need to meet all the inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria listed in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. In summary, they need to have an active FK defined as acute MK characterised by corneal epithelial ulceration (&gt;1 mm in diameter), corneal stromal infiltrate and signs of acute inflammation (eg, conjunctival injection, anterior chamber inflammatory cells, hypopyon) in conjunction with evidence of a filamentous fungal infection on smear microscopy and/or IVCM. There is strong evidence supporting the use of IVCM for diagnosing filamentary FK. Studies have reported sensitivities of 85.7%–89.2% and specificities of between 81.4% and 92.7%, respectively.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref> As some patients will be enrolled on the basis of the results of IVCM which is unable to detect most bacteria reliably, some patients with microscopically confirmed fungal infection will subsequently also be found to have had mixed infection at the time of being recruited into the study, as bacterial cultures may become positive a few days after enrolment. Based on previous experience at SCEH this is likely to account for about 10% of cases. These patients are included in the study but excluded from the primary analysis of the primary outcome (see below). Secondary analyses will include mixed infections.</p>

                <p>There are two independent consent stages in this trial: stage 1, where all adult patients with MK are eligible; and stage 2, only for FK patients meeting the eligibility criteria. The two-stage process enables data collection on all potential patients at baseline before a diagnosis of FK is confirmed. All patients who are eligible to participate will be given a participant information sheet in Nepali and its contents read to them. There will be an opportunity to discuss any questions that they might have. If the patient would like to participate, they will be asked to read and sign or place a thumb print on the study consent form. The consent will be witnessed by the eye health worker, confirmed by a signature on the form. For patients who are unable to read the documentation a second witness who is unrelated to the study is required.

It asks respondents 26 questions how much (frequency) they have experienced and/or were able to do things (eg, feel safe, able to concentrate, enjoy life) in the past 4 weeks and how satisfied they are with certain aspects of their lives (eg, sleep, capacity for work). Each question is scored between one and five in a positive direction, with one being attributed for a very low or dissatisfied quality of life, and five being very good or very satisfied with their quality of life (ie, higher scores denote a higher quality of life). Each domain has its own score calculated by calculating the mean of the item scores within each domain. In addition, there are two items that are examined separately: question 1 asks about an individual’s overall perception of quality of life and question 2 asks about an individual’s overall perception of their health. These are scored on the same positive scale from one to five. The mean domain scores can then be multiplied by four in order to make domain scores comparable with the scores used in the WHOQOL-100.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></td>

The statistician who will perform the primary analysis will be masked to the allocation and only receive the actual allocation code sequence from the independent statistician after the analysis code has been prepared and pre-tested with a test sequence. The primary outcome is visual acuity at 3 months assessed by an optometrist who will not have been involved in any other aspects of the trial and masked to the allocation. By 3 months, the treatment courses are likely to be completed. There will be masked grading of the photographs to independently confirm outcome measures and assess for any systematic bias on the part of the clinical examiners.</p>

                  <p>In patients with progressive FK despite 7 days or more of trial medication, additional treatment options will be considered and offered. After repeating microbiological tests to rule out a mixed bacterial infection, deteriorating patients are started on topical voriconazole 1% hourly if the ulcer is superficial only. For ulcers that are deeper than 75% of the corneal thickness, oral ketoconazole 200 mg two times a day is added (with monitoring of liver function). The choice of ancillary treatment is due to local availability. If, following 7 days of additional treatment, despite these measures there is ongoing progression, surgical management such as a TPK can be considered.</p>

This will be measured by a trial-certified optometrist, independent of all other aspects of the study and masked to allocation. This has been the primary outcome of several other trials and will therefore facilitate comparison. Three months is the time at which clinical experience suggests most corneal ulcers have usually healed. BSCVA is chosen as it is easy to measure and is of functional significance. We will measure the BSCVA using an LED-backlit, Tumbling-E LogMAR chart (Good-Lite, Illinois, USA) under controlled conditions. We will also measure vision using Peek Acuity, a validated smartphone application, in situations where the patient is unable to attend the hospital for follow-up and outcome data is only available through a domiciliary visit.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> For patients who have counting fingers (CF) vision or less, predefined logMAR values will be assigned based on previous clinical trials.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> Similarly, for patients who undergo a corneal transplant (TPK), a predefined visual acuity of 1.9 logMAR will be given, or last observation carried forward (whichever is the better vision), as per previous studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>

                <p>Participants will be reassessed at 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 2 months and 3 months following enrolment. Additional examinations, outside the trial protocol schedule may be conducted by the supervising clinician as indicated. The specific assessments to be carried out at each visit are indicated in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>. These will be conducted in the same way described for the baseline assessment as described (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). At each follow-up assessment, the participant will be asked about adherence to treatment and symptoms, including side effects, if still receiving trial treatment. This will be recorded in the case record file. To monitor trial medication adherence, the study participants will be asked to bring their eye-drop bottles to the 1-week, 2-week and 3-week follow-ups. The amount of remaining medication will be measured by weighing the bottle and will be compared with the anticipated remaining amount provided the drops were being used as instructed, resulting in a ratio of actually remaining to what is anticipated. Participants will be resupplied with medication as needed. The presenting visual acuity will be measured on each visit. In addition, the BSCVA will also be measured at the 3-month follow-up (primary outcome measure). At the final 3-month follow-up, the three quality of life questionnaires will be repeated. On each occasion the eyes will be examined using a slit-lamp and the cornea photographed. The IVCM will be repeated at 1, 2 and 3 weeks to determine whether there is evidence of fungal hyphae resolution with the fragmentation of linear elements. At the 1-week follow-up if the ulcer has not healed it will be rescraped for repeat culture to determine whether the keratitis is now culture positive or culture negative. We will give the study participants appointment cards for the next follow-up and they will be reminded about the follow-up a week prior to the date. Public transport costs will be paid for participants who are outpatients.</p>

                <title>Sample size considerations</title>
                <p>The study is powered to test the hypothesis that CHX is non-inferior to NATA in terms of the primary outcome (BSCVA at 3 months) at a prespecified non-inferiority margin (Delta) of 0.15 logMAR units. It is possible that CHX is non-inferior to NATA, given pilot RCT data that showed no statistically significant difference between CHX and NATA, with a Cochrane review finding a non-significant trend favouring CHX over NATA.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 18 19</xref> Despite this trend favouring CHX, we have chosen to carry out a non-inferiority trial rather than a superiority trial as this is a more clinically pragmatic approach. It would be counterproductive to conduct a superiority trial and find no statistically significant difference between the two treatments leading clinicians to potentially disregard CHX as a treatment, when in fact it may be ‘non-inferior’ to NATA, and be the only available or most cost-effective treatment.</p>
                <p>The choice of delta: This clinically meaningful difference of 0.15 logMAR was chosen as a difference of 0.15 logMAR corresponds to approximately 1.5 lines on a Snellen chart; any difference greater than this is clinically significant, as a difference of less than 0.15 log MAR could potentially be accounted for by testing/retesting error.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Furthermore, it was used in the MUTT1 trial, providing methodological consistency between studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, previous studies have suggested treated ulcers improve at a mean of four Snellen lines from baseline.</p>
                <p>Sample size was calculated for 90% power and adjusted final alpha of 0.0492, taking account of a single interim analysis using O’Brien-Fleming approach to maintain type-1 error rate of 5%. A sample size of 452 is required to detect a non-inferiority margin of 0.15-logMAR in BSCVA 3 months after enrolment between arms, assuming 0.5 SD for 3 months BSCVA and 15% drop-out. However, given approximately 10% of infections are mixed and these will be excluded from the primary analysis, 500 patients will be recruited. This sample size provides 90% power to detect superiority in BSCVA at 3 months if there is ≥0.17 LogMAR units difference as a secondary analysis.</p>

                  <p>The primary analysis will be conducted using all available data, missing data due to lost to follow-up will be excluded. The primary analysis of the primary outcome (BSCVA at 3 months) will be by linear regression, with treatment arm and baseline BSCVA as prespecified covariates. This controls for the baseline BSCVA. The treatment group is the primary predictor. Primary analysis will exclude mixed fungal and bacterial infection (isolated in the baseline sample).</p>
                  <p>We will use our alpha of 0.0492 to test the null hypotheses at 0.0492 significance. The null hypothesis for non-inferiority is that the mean BSCVA at 3 months for CHX is greater than or equal to 0.15 logMAR worse than the BSCVA when natamycin is used. Significance will be assessed using a two-tailed test at 0.0492 level for assessing non-inferiority. CHX will be non-inferior if the upper one-sided 95% confidence level for this regression coefficient (ie, the effect of CHX controlling for baseline BSCVA) exceeds 0.15 logMAR.</p>

This is particularly important if CHX has a better outcome than NATA, as the adjusted treatment effects may account for this observed imbalance while the unadjusted analyses may not. Sensitivity analyses will allow us to show that any observed positive treatment effect is not solely explained by imbalances at baseline in any of the covariates.</p>
