                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for infants born ≥36 weeks gestation with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE); consensus on optimum nutrition during therapeutic hypothermia is lacking. This results in variation in enteral feeding and parenteral nutrition (PN) for these infants. In this study, we aim to determine the optimum enteral nutrition and PN strategy for newborns with HIE during therapeutic hypothermia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will undertake a retrospective cohort study using routinely recorded electronic patient data held on the United Kingdom (UK) National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD). We will extract data from infants born ≥36 weeks gestational age between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2016, who received therapeutic hypothermia for at least 72 hours or died during therapeutic hypothermia, in neonatal units in England, Wales and Scotland. We will form matched groups in order to perform two comparisons examining: (1) the risk of NEC between infants enterally fed and infants not enterally fed, during therapeutic hypothermia; (2) the risk of late-onset blood stream infections between infants who received intravenous dextrose without any PN and infants who received PN, during therapeutic hypothermia. The following secondary outcomes will also be examined: survival, length of stay, breast feeding at discharge, hypoglycaemia, time to full enteral feeds and growth. Comparison groups will be matched on demographic, maternal, infant and organisational factors using propensity score matching.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>In this study, we will use deidentifed data held in the NNRD, an established national population database; parents can opt out of their baby’s data being held in the NNRD. This study holds study-specific Research Ethics Committee approval (East Midlands Leicester Central, 17/EM/0307). These results will help inform optimum nutritional management in infants with HIE receiving therapeutic hypothermia; results will be disseminated through conferences, scientific publications and parent-centred information produced in partnership with parents.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>In high-resource countries, therapeutic hypothermia is standard of care for infants born ≥36 weeks gestational age with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Although the process of ‘cooling’ itself is well defined, based on high-quality randomised controlled trials,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> there are few data to inform provision of nutrition to infants with HIE during and after therapeutic hypothermia. This leads to variation in the provision of both enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition (PN); a recent UK survey of nutrition practices during therapeutic hypothermia reported that only 31% of responding units have feeding guidelines for this group, 59% of neonatal units routinely start enteral feeding, 29% routinely administer PN and 37% provide intravenous dextrose fluids without feeds or PN.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>In relation to the enteral component of nutrition, withholding enteral (milk) feeds during therapeutic hypothermia is practised in the belief that it may reduce the risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), despite lack of evidence that such an approach is beneficial even among higher risk groups, such as preterm infants.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Conversely, starting enteral feeds during hypothermia is applied as it may have benefits, such as improved feed tolerance, earlier establishment of full enteral feeds, earlier discharge home<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and improved parental bonding.</p>
              <p>Until enteral feeds are established, commonly used options for parenteral support during therapeutic hypothermia include provision of intravenous dextrose, provision of PN and a combination of both intravenous dextrose and PN. Intravenous dextrose provides sufficient hydration and energy to prevent hypoglycaemia, but does not provide protein and fat necessary for tissue growth; it is unknown how a short period of undernutrition impacts growth or the secondary and tertiary recovery phases that follow brain injury.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 6 7</xref> On the other hand, PN is nutritionally superior but may increase the risk of infection, as seen in other paediatric studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, PN is expensive<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and, if not beneficial, or indeed harmful, avoiding or reducing its use would reduce costs.</p>
              <p>The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme in the UK commissioned this study to determine the optimum enteral nutrition and PN strategies for newborns with HIE during and after therapeutic hypothermia. As adverse outcomes such as NEC are relatively rare among term and near-term infants receiving therapeutic hypothermia, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be costly, burdensome and time-consuming. In this protocol, we describe an observational study that will apply propensity score matching to form groups for comparison with near-identical distributions of background variables and therefore minimise the influence of potential confounders. We will use an existing population-level data set, the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD), and will apply methods previously published.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> We aim to determine the optimum enteral nutrition and PN strategy for newborns with HIE during and after therapeutic hypothermia.</p>

                <p>This is a retrospective cohort study using anonymised, routinely recorded clinical data held in the NNRD. The NNRD holds data from all infants admitted to National Health Service (NHS) neonatal units in England, Scotland and Wales (approximately 90 000 infants annually); all NHS neonatal units in England and Wales have been contributing data to the NNRD since 2012, all NHS neonatal units in Scotland have been contributing to the NNRD since 2015. Contributing neonatal units are known as the UK Neonatal Collaborative (UKNC). Data are extracted from point-of-care neonatal electronic health records completed by health professionals during routine clinical care. A defined data extract, the Neonatal Dataset of approximately 450 data items,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> is transmitted quarterly to the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit at Imperial College London and Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust where patient episodes across different hospitals are linked and data are cleaned (queries about discrepancies and implausible data configurations are fed back to health professionals and rectified).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Data items include demographic and admission items (eg, maternal conditions, gestation, birth weight), daily items (eg, respiratory support, feeding information), discharge items (eg, feeding and weight at discharge) and ad hoc items (entered if and when they occur, eg suspected infection, ultrasound scan findings, abdominal X-ray findings).</p>

                  <p>For the comparison between infants fed milk feeds during therapeutic hypothermia with infants that were not, the primary outcome will be NEC, defined according to the UKNC case definition of Battersby <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This case definition uses clinical and X-ray findings recorded using an ad hoc form in the summary electronic patient record from which the NNRD is derived.

                  <p>For the comparison between infants that received parenteral (intravenous) nutrition during hypothermia with infants that received only intravenous dextrose, the primary outcome will be late-onset BSI (&gt;3 days after birth). This will be defined according to the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) National Neonatal Audit Programme (NNAP) case definition as pure growth of pathogen from blood <italic>OR</italic> either a pure growth of a skin commensal or a mixed growth with ≥3 clinical signs at the time of blood sampling, recorded &gt;3 days after birth.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This definition uses data that are recorded using an ad hoc form in the summary electronic patient record from which the NNRD is derived.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>To address potential confounders (e.g., infants with hypotension who receive inotropes may be more likely to have feeds withheld and also to have poorer outcomes), we will use propensity matching to form subgroups of infants with similar characteristics including how sick they were when therapeutic hypothermia was started. As a consequence of such matching (balancing), any difference found is either a result of chance or reflects the difference in nutritional practice between the groups. For each infant, the propensity of the nutritional exposure (treatment) will be estimated by logistic regression that includes all background variables as covariates. Exposures that occur after therapeutic hypothermia is commenced will not be included in the propensity analysis as they are not background variables. The fitted propensities for the infants will be divided into 10 propensity groups (separated by deciles), or 20 propensity groups, depending on the extent to which the propensities of the two exposure groups overlap. Matched pairs will be formed within these groups with one infant from either exposure group. The pairs will be matched also on two important variables: (1) Cord blood gas pH (in bands: &gt;7.0, 6.9–7.0, &lt;6.9) and (2) birth year (in 2 year bands). The propensity model will be supplemented with transformations and interactions to obtain a good balance on all the background variables within matched groups. Balance plots will be used to assess the balance, and the procedure will be iterated until no further improvements can be achieved. Outcomes in the resulting two matched subgroups will then be compared using methods identical to those for a randomised trial with absolute and relative risks of serious adverse outcomes derived. The standard error of the estimate of the treatment effect will be obtained by combining the within and between-replication standard errors.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> All p values reported will be two-sided. Analyses will be performed using SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) and R.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The optimum nutritional strategy for infants with HIE during therapeutic hypothermia is unclear. The findings of this study will help establish the risk–benefits of feeding versus withholding feeds and administering intravenous dextrose versus PN, on key neonatal morbidities, NEC and BSIs and other important secondary outcomes. The application of a novel analytical method (propensity scoring) to a population-level database (the NNRD) is well suited to studying important clinical uncertainties such as modes of nutrition, particularly in this situation where a randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be challenging due to high costs and the requirement for large sample sizes. The increasing availability of high-quality, routinely recorded health data, such as that held in the NNRD, has great potential to reduce clinical uncertainty and variation in neonatal care. As with all research, there are both avoidable and inherent biases in observational studies using routinely recorded health data. One well-identified potential bias stems from incomplete or unclear reporting<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; by publishing our study protocol a priori, in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data (RECORD) guidance,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and including details of the database and data items to be used and describing the matching process with the covariates to be used, we hope to reduce avoidable bias in this study.</p>
              <p>The proposed study has a number of strengths. The robustness of core NNRD data (birth weight, sex, length of stay and death) has been previously demonstrated for research purposes,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 22</xref> and data are used for multiple purposes including national audit including the UK Healthcare Quality Improvement PartnershipHQIP-funded NNAP and analyses for the Department of Health, NHS England and the Chief Medical Officer. Routine data have the advantage of being recorded prospectively prior to the occurrence of the adverse outcome, therefore not susceptible to recall bias. In contrast to RCTs, studies that use population-based data sources, such as in this study, avoid recruitment bias: data from all eligible infants are included and hence findings are more generalisable. The major limitation of observational studies is the non-random assignment of the intervention, which can lead to confounding as the decision for the intervention is influenced by patient characteristics. However, a major strength of the NNRD is its comprehensive data set of infants and maternal variables; this permits the use of propensity analysis, which seeks to mimic randomised allocation and compare outcomes between matched cohorts with similar background characteristics but different exposures.</p>
              <p>At present, there is insufficient evidence to recommend optimal feeding and PN strategies during therapeutic hypothermia for infants with HIE. This protocol describes a retrospective observational study that seeks to address this important clinical uncertainty.</p>
