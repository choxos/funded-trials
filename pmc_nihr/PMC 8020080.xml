                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To determine whether adding web-based support (e-coachER) to an exercise referral scheme (ERS) increases objectively assessed physical activity (PA).</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Multicentre trial with participants randomised to usual ERS alone (control) or usual ERS plus e-coachER (intervention).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Primary care and ERS in three UK sites from 2015 to 2018.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>450 inactive ERS referees with chronic health conditions.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Participants received a pedometer, PA recording sheets and a user guide for the web-based support. e-coachER interactively encouraged the use of the ERS and other PA options.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Primary and key secondary outcomes were: objective moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes (in ≥10 min bouts and without bouts), respectively, after 12 months. Secondary outcomes were: other accelerometer-derived and self-reported PA measures, ERS attendance, EQ-5D-5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and beliefs about PA. All outcomes were collected at baseline, 4 and 12 months. Primary analysis was an intention to treat comparison between intervention and control arms at 12-month follow-up.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>There was no significant effect of the intervention on weekly MVPA at 12 months between the groups recorded in ≥10 min bouts (mean difference 11.8 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −2.1 to 26.0; p=0.10) or without bouts (mean difference 13.7 min of MVPA, 95% CI: −26.8 to 54.2; p=0.51) for 232 participants with usable data. There was no difference in the primary or secondary PA outcomes at 4 or 12 months.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>

              <p>Low levels of physical activity (PA) are a significant contributor to a wide range of chronic physical and mental health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis and depression<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–6</xref> and associated healthcare cost.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Primary care exercise referral schemes (ERSs) have small positive effects on self-reported PA, compared with usual care. However, most of these trials are underpowered, and do not necessarily include physically inactive participants with chronic conditions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> The format of ERS range from considerable exercise practitioner contact at an exercise facility to a signposting service to community PA options with minimal sustained contact.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This variation in ERS makes a broader national approach to improving the quality of the patient experience and effectiveness challenging. Given that only 66%–81% ever attend the referral scheme, that only 43%–49% complete it<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and that the health benefits seem to be small,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> new ways are needed to improve uptake and adherence to ERS, and to foster sustainable PA from ERS.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective in supporting short-term changes in (mostly self-reported) PA among the general population and those with clinical conditions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–18</xref> However, no studies have explored their use alongside ERS offering face-to-face support. Along with service users, we developed a bespoke support system called e-coachER, using the LifeGuide platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lifeguideonline.org/">https://www.lifeguideonline.org/</ext-link>), seeking to empower ERS participants with physical and mental health conditions to become more physically active and to remain motivated to do so. If shown to be an effective adjunctive intervention, such a system could be scaled up relatively cheaply and routinely offered to thousands of patients per year in hundreds of schemes in the UK.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>We undertook a multicentre parallel two-group randomised controlled trial to determine the impact of the addition of web-based behavioural support for ERS referral on PA and health outcomes in inactive people with chronic disease.</p>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>Between July 2015 to March 2017, we recruited low active adults with at least one chronic condition (from obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, lower limb osteoarthritis and depression) in Greater Glasgow, Birmingham or Plymouth and adjacent rural areas, who had been or were about to be referred by a primary care practitioner to a local ERS.

                <title>Randomisation and blinding</title>
                <p>Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to either usual ERS alone (control arm) or usual ERS plus e-coachER (intervention arm). Randomisation was stratified by site with minimisation by the participant’s perceived main reason for their referral to the ERS (ie, chronic condition) and by self-reported IT literacy/confidence using a 10-point scale.</p>
                <p>Blinding to trial allocation among the trial statistician and most of the research team (excepting those involved in the qualitative process evaluation) was not broken until the primary and secondary analyses were reported to the Project Management Group.</p>

              <sec id="s2-4">
                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants allocated to the intervention group were mailed a small box containing a user guide for accessing the e-coachER web-based support system, a pedometer (step-counter) and a fridge magnet with tear-off sheets to record weekly step counts or minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). The user guide provided a summary of the content on the website and guidance on how to register to access a range of interactive opportunities to enhance participants’ motivation to take up the ERS and to become more physically active, whether or not they engaged with their local ERS. A logic model for the intervention and a more detailed description of the content, in compliance with the TiDIER checklist and Behaviour Change Techniques mapping has been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</p>
                <p>The interactive e-coachER support system adopted effective features from other interventions.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It involved seven ‘Steps to Health’ designed to take about 5–10 min each to complete each week. We defined getting to step 5 (setting a goal and reviewing a goal online) as a sufficient ‘dose’ of the intervention to impact on minutes of MVPA, although we recognise that merely mailing a pedometer could, for some, be an effective intervention.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

                <p>At 4 and 12 months post randomisation, participants were sent an accelerometer and questionnaire booklet by post, and prepaid envelope to return to Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit. Reminder letters and phone calls aimed to increase follow-up rates. Participants returning the device received an online/high street store voucher for £20 on each occasion.</p>

                <title>Outcomes measures</title>
                <p>The primary outcome was the number of weekly minutes of MVPA, recorded in ≥10 min bouts, measured objectively by GENEActiv Original accelerometer (Activinsights; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.geneactiv.org/">https://www.geneactiv.org/</ext-link>), over a 1-week period at 12 months post randomisation. A description of our procedures for processing accelerometer data is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP4">online supplementary material appendix 4</xref>. Briefly, GENEActiv PC software (V.3.0_09.02.2015) was used with software R using package GGIR V.1.2-8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGIR/index.html</ext-link>)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> to identify data for the primary analysis if participants achieved a minimum of 16 hours of wear time for a minimum of 4 days (including at least 1 weekend day).</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>In the absence of a published minimally important difference for MVPA, we assumed a ‘small-to-moderate’ standardised effect size of 0.35, and estimated that 413 participants were required at 88% power and a two-sided alpha of 5% assuming for 20% attrition, or 90% power at a two-sided alpha of 5% allowing for 16% attrition (using ‘sampsi’ in STATA V.14.2). Based on the baseline SD for MVPA total weekly minutes in ≥10 min bouts of 104 to 113,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> an effect size of 0.35 would correspond to a mean between group differences of 36–39 min of MVPA per week at 12-month follow-up.</p>
                <p>All statistical analyses were conducted to a predefined analysis plan prior to end of data collection and any comparison of follow-up outcomes. The primary analysis compared primary and secondary outcomes between groups in accordance with the principle of intention to treat (ITT) (ie, based on original random allocation) in participants with complete outcomes at 12 months, adjusting for baseline outcome values and stratification and minimisation variables. Following assessment of baseline demographics, mean age and gender were also added to the adjusted model.</p>
                <p>Two secondary analyses were undertaken to compare groups across all follow-up points using a mixed model repeated measures approach and complier average causal effect (CACE) analyses undertaken to examine the impact of adherence to the intervention, (ie, (a) simply registering to access the website or not and (b) completing five or more ‘Steps to Health’ or not) on primary and secondary outcomes at 12 months.</p>
                <p>The primary analysis model was extended to fit interaction terms to explore possible subgroup differences in intervention effect in stratification and minimisation variables for the primary outcome at 12 months. Given the low power for testing interactions, these results were treated only as exploratory. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for four additional wear time criteria (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP6">online supplemental table appendix 6</xref>): Multiple imputation was used to replace missing outcome data using baseline outcomes and other explanatory covariates (eg, treatment group, age), assuming unobserved measurements were missing at random. Given that the proportion of patients with missing accelerometry data was &lt;3% out of the total number of participants who fulfilled the wear time criteria of includable PA data (n=243), no imputation was undertaken for the accelerometry related primary and secondary outcome. Using the same primary analysis model as described above, between-group outcomes were compared in ITT complete case and imputed data sets for non-accelerometry related secondary outcomes at 12 months. All analyses were conducted by a blinded statistician using STATA V.14.2.</p>

                <p>To our knowledge this is the first randomised study to assess the effects of adding web-based behavioural support to usual ERS support on objectively assessed long-term minutes of MVPA among participants with chronic physical and mental health conditions. Augmenting usual ERS using web-based behavioural support (e-coachER) provided a (none statistically significant) weak indicative effect on objectively assessed minutes of MVPA (when recorded in ≥10 min bouts or not) at 12 months among inactive or moderately inactive patients. Various sensitivity analyses supported these findings. We also found no evidence of benefit in terms of ERS uptake and patient-reported outcomes. The extent of engagement with e-coachER was modest, but this factor did not influence the findings.</p>

                <title>Understanding the findings</title>
                <p>Despite our best efforts, we were unable to get follow-up data from as many participants as we had planned and this may have reduced power to find a statistically significant effect. This has been a challenge for other ERS studies as well involving both device-based <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and subjectively<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> captured PA; for example, the latter study<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> followed up only 55.6% of participants at 6 months. The e-coachER study was initially powered to detect differences in numbers achieving 150 min of MVPA based on our systematic review.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Due to early recruitment issues, the sample size was recalculated as reported, with the primary outcome based on ≥10 min bouts. The scant available data from device-based assessed PA in comparable trials made the power calculation somewhat uncertain, and we also need to know more about what is a clinically significant change in device-based assessed MVPA to justify sample sizes.</p>
                <p>Our prespecified analysis plan, involving a measure of MVPA in bouts of ≥10 min, meant that a larger proportion of the sample than expected recorded zero minutes. This required us to explore a number of analysis models for the primary analysis, none of which were ideal but did provide a consistent conclusion. Given that other studies have reported findings using a different accelerometer wear time (eg, Harris <italic>et al</italic> reported MVPA minutes from ‘at least 1 day’ to estimate weekly activity<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> we also considered our data with a range of wear time criteria, and again the findings were consistent.</p>
                <p>The primary focus was on differences in MVPA minutes at 12 months, but both groups showed an increase at 4 months. Our aim was to increase uptake and long-term change in MVPA, given concerns that ERS only foster short-term change,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but providing the e-coachER intervention at the same time as what was somewhat effective ERS support may have limited the perceived need for e-coachER engagement. Also, digital support interventions are renowned for having relatively short-term engagement and effects, so it may be that greater digital support is needed after 4 months (the typical duration of ERS).</p>
                <p>In line with guidelines for ERS research,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> we tried to make the intervention as accessible as possible to participants from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, which we achieved to some extent, but with an increasing array of devices for self-monitoring and setting goals for PA, and it may be that many participants in both arms of our sample were independently accessing these, which thereby negated any benefits from the e-coachER intervention.</p>

                <title>Other considerations</title>
                <p>We found a large discrepancy between the proportion of the sample who achieved 150 min of accelerometer recorded MVPA when assessed in ≥10 min bouts (4%) or not (80%), and by self-report (36%) at baseline, despite selecting sedentary or inactive participants for the trial. This finding also aligns with recently reported data from the USA, which identified a range of 3.4%–95.6% of people achieving 150 min of MVPA depending on how the accelerometer data were processed.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This is important given the recent removal of the ‘≥10 min bouts’ in UK and international guidelines.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29 30</xref> It has been suggested that data collected using accelerometers is incompatible with guidelines of 150 min of MVPA per week and a value of about 1000 unbouted minutes of MVPA would need to be recommended for public health benefits.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Our sample at baseline recorded only 346 min of unbouted weekly MVPA, which highlights the uniqueness of the study involving attempts to support change in such a low active sample, who potentially have the greatest to gain in terms of health from increases in MVPA.</p>
                <p>A final consideration is that there was a small indication of imbalance in educational status between the groups at baseline, with a greater proportion of those with no qualification, and a slightly smaller proportion with higher qualifications, in the control group. However, given the relative small numbers of those in the respective categories for educational status, the fact that we had not specified inclusion of this variable in our statistical analysis plan for the primary analysis, and the absence of between group differences in IT confidence, we chose not to further explore any confounding effects of educational status.</p>

                <title>Further research</title>
                <p>The focus on accumulating ≥10 min bouts for health benefit has now been dropped in global guidelines but in presenting both bouted and unbouted total MVPA the present study will provide valuable device-based information to inform future related research. Changes in international guidelines have removed the importance of completing PA in ≥10 min bouts, which in turn changes the basis for powering studies since a much greater proportion of the population are likely to meet the new unbouted target of 150 min of MVPA per week.</p>

                <title>Practical implications</title>
                <p>There remain digital opportunities to provide support for patients to facilitate greater uptake of ERS and sustained change in PA for the management of chronic conditions. Bespoke software, drawing on some of the concepts and content in e-coachER could be used to ensure better links between the referee in primary care and patient. There can be confusion about what the ERS involves, compounded sometimes by delayed starting. Beyond the formal ERS, digital systems could be implemented to maintain long-term MVPA.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Augmenting ERS referrals with web-based behavioural support had only a weak, non-significant indicative effect on accelerometer recorded MVPA at 12 months, and no effect on ERS engagement. Overall, there was only modest engagement in the e-coachER web-based support, but degree of engagement did not influence the overall findings.</p>
