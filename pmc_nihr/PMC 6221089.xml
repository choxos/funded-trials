                  <p>To investigate the effects of semaglutide vs placebo on glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones during hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D).</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, single‐centre trial, we randomized 38 men and women (treated only with metformin) 1:1 to 2 12‐week crossover periods of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide or placebo, each followed by a hypoglycaemic clamp procedure. The primary endpoint was change in glucagon concentration from target plasma glucose (PG) level 5.5 mmol/L to nadir (target 2.5 mmol/L).</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The mean (range) participant age was 54.2 (41‐64) years, body mass index 29.4 (23.3‐36.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, glycated haemoglobin 60.8 (44.3‐83.6) mmol/mol (7.7 [6.2‐9.8]%), and diabetes duration 4.5 (0.3‐13.2) years. A total of 35 participants completed the trial and were included in the analyses. During the hypoglycaemic clamp from 5.5 mmol/L PG to nadir, the absolute change in mean glucagon concentration was similar for semaglutide vs placebo: 88.3 vs 83.1 pg/mL (estimated difference 5.2 pg/mL [95% confidence interval −7.7 to 18.1]). Concentrations of other counterregulatory hormones increased with both treatments, with a statistically significantly lower increase for noradrenaline and cortisol with semaglutide vs placebo. The glucose infusion rate to maintain constant clamp levels was similar for each treatment group, suggesting an overall similar counterregulatory response. The mean hypoglycaemic symptom score and proportion of participants recognizing hypoglycaemia during the study were lower for semaglutide vs placebo treatment at nadir, but cognitive function test results were similar. No new safety issues were observed for semaglutide.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder involving increased insulin resistance, coupled with progressive loss of β‐cell mass and function, and leading to dysregulation of insulin and glucagon secretion.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> While many treatment options for T2D are available, one limitation is the risk of hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>
</p>
              <p>Glucagon is a key hormone in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> The counterregulation of hypoglycaemia depends largely on increases in glucagon and adrenaline secretion and decreased insulin secretion.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> In people with insulin‐deficient diabetes, the key counterregulatory responses of increased glucagon and suppressed insulin are impaired and the sympathoadrenal response, mainly adrenaline, becomes important.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Counterregulatory hormone deficiencies tend to be mild in the early stages of the T2D,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> developing only as the disease advances and endogenous insulin secretion declines.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1), an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal L cells in response to food intake,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> inhibits glucagon secretion and stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Semaglutide (Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark), a GLP‐1 analogue, is approved in major markets for the treatment of T2D. With 94% homology to native GLP‐1, semaglutide has three structural modifications that prolong its half‐life to ~1 week, making it appropriate for once‐weekly administration.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> In phase III trials, semaglutide led to improved glycaemic control and decreased body weight, with a safety profile similar to other GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs).<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Liraglutide, having a similar structure to semaglutide but a different pharmacokinetic profile, was found to have no effect on the counterregulatory responses to hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> These responses have not been evaluated in people treated with semaglutide. Because of the ability of semaglutide to suppress glucagon, it is important to establish that the glucagon counterregulatory response during hypoglycaemia is preserved.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the present study, therefore, was to investigate the effect of semaglutide vs placebo on the glucagon response during hypoglycaemia in people with T2D, and effects on other counterregulatory hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone), hypoglycaemic symptoms, cognitive function and vital signs.</p>

              <title>PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS</title>
              <p>This was a randomized single‐centre, double‐blind, crossover clinical pharmacology trial in 38 people with T2D treated only with metformin. The protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and participants were recruited at the Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Internal Medicine at the Medical University of Graz, Austria. Written informed consent was obtained before trial‐related activities began. The trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier NCT02147431) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>

                <p>Men and women (age 18‐64 years) with T2D were eligible for participation. Inclusion criteria were: on stable metformin treatment for 90 days before screening; glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 47 to 86 mmol/mol (6.5%‐10.0%); and body mass index (BMI) 20 to 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Key exclusion criteria were: treatment with any glucose‐lowering agent(s) other than metformin within 90 days before screening, except for short‐term treatment (≤7 days in total) with insulin for intercurrent illness; history of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis; personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2; and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (&gt;1 event during the last 12 months), or hypoglycaemic unawareness as judged by the investigator.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment sequences: semaglutide 1.0 mg/placebo or placebo/semaglutide 1.0 mg (Figure <xref rid="dom13422-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Participants were assigned by the investigators at the trial site to the lowest available randomization number on a participant‐specific pre‐packed trial product (Novo Nordisk). The sponsor, trial participants and investigators remained blinded to treatment allocation during the trial. Once‐weekly treatment with the pre‐packed trial product was self‐administered subcutaneously using PDS290 pen‐injectors (Novo Nordisk). As per usual practice, the semaglutide dose was escalated, starting at a dose of 0.25 mg for 4 weeks, with subsequent dose escalation to 0.5 mg for 4 weeks, followed by the maintenance 1.0‐mg dose for 5 weeks. Throughout the trial, dosing was to occur on the same week day at any time of day. The participants' background metformin treatment remained unchanged. Each group underwent two treatment periods, each followed by a hypoglycaemic clamp procedure and 5 weeks of pharmacokinetic blood sampling, separated by a 1‐ to 3‐week washout period, with a follow‐up visit in the final week of the second sampling period (Figure <xref rid="dom13422-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A).</p>

                <title>Hypoglycaemic clamp</title>
                <p>Approximately 48 hours after the last (13th) treatment dose, coinciding with the expected maximum concentration of semaglutide,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> a stepwise hypoglycaemic clamp was performed during a 4‐day in‐house visit (Figure <xref rid="dom13422-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Participants were admitted to the clinical research centre where, on day 1, they received the last treatment dose. On the evening of day 2, participants received a variable intravenous infusion of glucose or human soluble insulin (Novo Nordisk) to maintain glucose levels at a 5.5 mmol/L target in a euglycaemic clamp.</p>
                <p>The hypoglycaemic clamp was initiated in the morning of day 3 by increasing the insulin infusion to a constant rate of 2.5 mU/kg/min, based on the participant's body weight at randomization. The target plasma glucose (PG) level of 5.5 mmol/L was maintained continuously for 60 minutes before induction of hypoglycaemia, when PG was allowed to decline to 3.5 mmol/L and subsequently nadir (target 2.5 mmol/L). At each level, a variable glucose infusion rate (GIR) was used to maintain the target stable for 30 minutes and assessments of the hypoglycaemic response were made, including blood sampling. PG was not permitted to fall below 2.2 mmol/L. After 20 minutes at nadir, the insulin infusion was terminated and the variable GIR used to maintain stable PG levels for 10 minutes, after which the glucose infusion was tapered off to allow spontaneous recovery from the hypoglycaemia, if possible. If PG had not reached the level of 4.0 mmol/L within 40 minutes of termination of the insulin infusion, an intravenous glucose infusion was started at a constant rate of 5.5 mg/kg/min. The clamp was terminated when the PG concentration reached 5.5 mmol/L, or when deemed safe by the investigator. Throughout the clamp, participants remained fasted (water was allowed) in a supine or semi‐supine position.</p>

                <title>Endpoints and assessments during the hypoglycaemic clamp</title>
                <p>The primary endpoint was the change in mean glucagon concentration from the target PG level 5.5 mmol/L to nadir. Secondary endpoints included absolute concentrations of counterregulatory hormones, C‐peptide and insulin and changes from 5.5 to 3.5 mmol/L and nadir (Figure <xref rid="dom13422-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Changes from fasting PG levels (the morning of the day before the hypoglycaemic clamp) to each target level were evaluated for glucagon only, and changes from nadir to recovery (PG ≥4.0 mmol/L) were evaluated for each counterregulatory hormone. During each of the 4 30‐minute target levels of the clamp, the mean of each variable was calculated as an average of 3 measurements at 10, 20 and 30 minutes (the fasting value was based on one measurement). The area under the curve for GIR (AUC<sub>GIR</sub>) was assessed at each target PG level. The time to reach recovery was also recorded.</p>
                <p>Other secondary endpoints assessed during the clamp at each target PG level included symptoms of hypoglycaemia, measured using the Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia Scale,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> hypoglycaemic recognition, evaluated based on participants' responses (yes/no) to the question, “Do you feel hypo?” and cognitive function tests (the Trail Making‐B test,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> the Digit Symbol Substitution test<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and the Four‐Choice Reaction Time test<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>).

                <p>A sample size of 30 completing participants was determined based on the criterion that the width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatment comparison of the primary endpoint was within ±23.3 pg/mL with 80% probability. This was based on a within‐participant SD of 40 pg/mL from a previous trial.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Assuming a 20% dropout rate, at least 38 randomized participants were required to obtain 30 trial‐completing participants.</p>
                <p>The pre‐specified analyses used data from the full analysis set of all randomized and exposed participants with at least one post‐baseline assessment. The safety analysis set included all exposed participants. The primary endpoint, absolute change in glucagon concentration from target level 5.5 mmol/L to nadir, was analysed using an analysis of covariance model, with treatment, period and participant as fixed effects. As an additional analysis of the primary endpoint, the relative change was calculated and analysed based on log‐transformed values, using a similar statistical model. Secondary clamp‐related endpoints were analysed as per the primary endpoint, except that hypoglycaemic recognition was summarized descriptively. The AUC<sub>GIR</sub> was calculated using the linear trapezoidal technique and analysed on the original scale. The time to reach recovery (PG ≥4.0 mmol/L) was log‐transformed and analysed as per the primary endpoint. The proportion of participants in each group who recovered spontaneously 40 minutes after termination of the insulin infusion was analysed by logistic regression, with treatment and period as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Additional secondary endpoints were summarized descriptively. The statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

                <p>As expected, similar mean PG levels in the semaglutide and placebo groups were achieved at the 5.5‐ and 3.5‐mmol/L target PG levels. The mean time taken to achieve the target was similar with each treatment: 17.2 vs 18.0 minutes to reach 3.5 mmol/L for semaglutide vs placebo and 62.2 vs 61.3 minutes to reach nadir. The nadir target of 2.5 mmol/L was not reached by 13 participants (35%) with semaglutide and 15 (43%) with placebo; 9 participants (26%) did not achieve the target with both treatments. Hence the mean (range) PG level at nadir of 2.9 (2.4−3.9) mmol/L with semaglutide and 2.9 (2.4−4.4) mmol/L with placebo was slightly higher than the target level.</p>

At the fasting PG level and at each target level, except nadir, the mean glucagon level was lower with semaglutide than with placebo. The estimated absolute change in mean glucagon concentration from 5.5 mmol/L to nadir (primary endpoint) was similar between treatments (Table <xref rid="dom13422-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>); however, a higher relative increase in glucagon concentration was observed with semaglutide vs placebo, primarily driven by the lower mean glucagon concentration at 5.5 mmol/L with semaglutide. Mean absolute and relative changes in glucagon from 5.5 to 3.5 mmol/L glucose and from fasting glucose levels to each target level were not statistically significantly different for semaglutide vs placebo, except that the relative change from fasting to nadir was greater with semaglutide (estimated treatment ratio 1.23 [95% CI 1.01‐1.49]).</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Absolute concentrations of glucagon during induced hypoglycaemia from 5.5 mmol/L to nadir were similar for semaglutide and placebo, despite the lower glucagon concentration at fasting glucose levels, indicating that semaglutide did not alter the primary counterregulatory response in participants with T2D. Whilst the relative glucagon increase was higher with semaglutide vs placebo, this was primarily driven by the expected lower mean glucagon concentration at 5.5 mmol/L with semaglutide.</p>
              <p>In general, the physiological response to hypoglycaemia depends on the primary corrective actions of decreased insulin and increased glucagon concentrations.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Semaglutide, similarly to other GLP‐1 analogues, inhibits glucagon secretion at fasting glucose concentrations,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> as observed in the present trial, which helps to improve glycaemic control.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> It is, nevertheless, important that the glucagon inhibition does not impair the counterregulatory response under hypoglycaemic conditions. The effect of GLP‐1 and GLP‐1RAs on the counterregulatory response to hypoglycaemia has been investigated in several studies because impaired counterregulation could potentially limit the use of treatment. Native GLP‐1 had no effect on the response to hypoglycaemia in healthy volunteers,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> neither did other GLP‐1RAs in people with type 1 diabetes or T2D.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The present trial included participants with T2D treated only with metformin, to ensure an adequate glucagon response during the clamp; inclusion of participants with more progressed disease would have lessened the likelihood of detecting an effect of semaglutide. The fact that participants exhibited a robust glucagon response might also explain why not all attained the nadir target of 2.5 mmol/L PG level, despite the constant insulin delivery. More than half of those participants who did not achieve the nadir target failed to do so with both treatments.</p>
              <p>Absolute concentrations of other counterregulatory hormones exhibited a smaller increase with semaglutide than with placebo, statistically significantly so for noradrenaline and cortisol; however, the observed differences were unlikely to be of clinical relevance and may have been influenced by improvements in glycaemic control with semaglutide. Adrenaline, as a third defence against hypoglycaemia, normally becomes important only when glucagon is deficient; noradrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone play even smaller roles.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>The higher absolute concentrations of C‐peptide, a marker of endogenous insulin production, observed with semaglutide vs placebo at each target PG level during the clamp were consistent with the ability of GLP‐1RAs to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose‐dependent manner.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Importantly, C‐peptide levels decreased with progressing hypoglycaemia; the decrease being more pronounced for participants treated with semaglutide vs placebo. This probably illustrates the expected loss of insulinotropic activity of semaglutide as blood glucose fell into the hypoglycaemic range. The higher C‐peptide concentration with semaglutide at each hypoglycaemia target was influenced by the higher concentration at the start of the clamp procedure and the much longer half‐life of C‐peptide compared with insulin.</p>
              <p>The GIR was similar for both treatments throughout the clamp, confirming no compromised counterregulatory response with semaglutide. Neither did semaglutide appear to interfere with recovery from hypoglycaemia; no treatment difference was observed with recovery‐related endpoints.</p>
              <p>Participants on semaglutide had lower recognition of hypoglycaemic symptoms at 3.5 mmol/L and nadir vs placebo, as indicated by a lower hypoglycaemic symptom score and fewer positive responses to the question, “Do you feel hypo?” This might be related to lower concentrations of noradrenaline and, to a lesser extent, adrenaline with semaglutide (in the presence of a greater relative increase in glucagon). These are sympathoadrenal hormones which mediate the generation of autonomic symptoms such as palpitations, tremor and anxiety.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Increases in circulating noradrenaline, however, reflect noradrenaline spillover at post‐ganglionic nerve endings and are not a reliable measure of sympathoadrenal activation.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, these observations raise the possibility that semaglutide might reduce hypoglycaemia awareness and so lead to an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia in clinical practice. Reassuringly, the glucagon response during hypoglycaemia, the primary counterregulatory hormone, was unaffected in the presence of semaglutide. Indeed, the relative glucagon response was greater than that observed with placebo and, conceivably, a reduced sympathoadrenal response may reflect more efficient counterregulation during hypoglycaemia. This interpretation is supported by similar GIRs in the two arms and the similar rates of glucose recovery. Furthermore, in the studies of semaglutide conducted to date, no increases in rates of hypoglycaemia have been noted, although these (and indeed the present study) were not powered to evaluate differences in severe hypoglycaemia;<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> however, in the LEADER trial with the closely‐related molecule, liraglutide, a statistically significantly lower incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was seen for liraglutide compared with placebo.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> In summary, the clinical relevance of the observations in the present trial remains uncertain. Providing a definite answer would require a specifically designed, adequately powered trial.</p>
              <p>As expected, semaglutide treatment led to reductions in HbA1c, fasting serum glucose and body weight, and increases in fasting C‐peptide, consistent with findings from larger phase III trials,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> and concomitant with lower glucagon concentrations with semaglutide vs placebo at fasting glucose levels before the clamp. Collectively, data suggest that semaglutide provides effective glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> consistent with its mode of action.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p>
              <p>Semaglutide was generally well tolerated and reported side effects were consistent with other semaglutide trials.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> No unexpected treatment‐related safety issues were identified. The increased heart rate with semaglutide is a known effect of treatment with GLP‐1RAs,<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> although a large cardiovascular outcomes trial showed a significant reduced risk of cardiovascular events with semaglutide.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>
</p>
              <p>A limitation of the present study is the artificial clamp setting in which maximum physiological concentrations of counterregulatory hormones might not have been obtained. Nevertheless, the clamp procedure is a well‐established method for investigating physiological responses to hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="dom13422-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, <xref rid="dom13422-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Also, many participants failed to reach the target nadir of 2.5 mmol/L (average 2.9 mmol/L), which may have affected the counterregulatory response measurements. A strength of the present trial is its crossover design; each participant underwent both treatment periods, acting as their own control.</p>
              <p>In summary, semaglutide did not impair the overall counterregulatory response to experimental hypoglycaemia in people with T2D, consistent with its mode of action to provide effective glycaemic control with a low risk of hypoglycaemia.</p>
