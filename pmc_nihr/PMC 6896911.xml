                  <p>The RESTORE study, a multi-national randomized, placebo-controlled study, showed that erdosteine – a muco-active antioxidant that modulates bacterial adhesiveness – reduced the rate and duration of exacerbations in moderate and severe COPD with a history of exacerbations.

                  <p>This post hoc analysis of the 254 RESTORE participants with spirometrically-defined moderate COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] 50‒79% predicted) examined exacerbation rate and duration, time to first exacerbation, and exacerbation-free time.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Patients with moderate COPD received erdosteine 300 mg twice daily (n=126) or placebo (n=128) added to usual COPD therapy for 12 months. During this time, there were 53 exacerbations in the erdosteine group and 74 in the placebo group, with 42.1% and 57.8% of patients, respectively, experiencing an exacerbation. There was a 47% reduction in the mean exacerbation rate with erdosteine compared to placebo (0.27 vs 0.51 exacerbations per-patient per-year, respectively, <italic>P</italic>=0.003), and a 58.3% reduction in the mild exacerbation rate (0.23 vs 0.53 mild exacerbations per-patient per-year, <italic>P</italic>=0.001). Mean duration of exacerbations was 26% shorter in erdosteine-treated patients (9.1 vs 12.3 days for placebo, <italic>P</italic>=0.022), with significant reductions in the duration of mild and moderate-to-severe exacerbations. Mean time to first exacerbation was prolonged by 7.7% (182 days for erdosteine vs 169 days for placebo, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and the mean exacerbation-free time was increased by 51 days (279 days for erdosteine vs 228 days for placebo; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

              <title>Plain-Language Summary</title>
              <p>Patients with COPD often experience exacerbations, when their symptoms worsen and they require additional medication, emergency treatment, or hospital admission. A recent 1 year clinical trial found that COPD patients with moderate or severe breathing problems and a history of exacerbation events experienced fewer exacerbations if they took a medication called erdosteine, as well as their usual treatment for COPD. This study reexamined the clinical trial data by looking only at the group of patients with moderate breathing problems. The results showed that patients taking erdosteine had fewer exacerbations that not only took longer to occur, but also lasted a shorter amount of time. Thus, the overall burden of exacerbations was reduced in such patients. These findings suggest that erdosteine may be a useful medication for patients with less severe COPD.</p>

              <p>Exacerbations of COPD are significant events for patients leading to a worse quality of life, use more health care resources, and are at an increased risk of dying.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Preventing exacerbations is an important goal of COPD treatment,<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but exacerbation reduction remains suboptimal with current treatment strategies.<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As lung function declines more rapidly in the early stages of the disease,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and is accelerated by exacerbations,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> increasing treatment intensity to prevent exacerbations in patients with moderately severe airflow obstruction might be a useful treatment strategy.</p>
              <p>Exacerbations of COPD are generally classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to the treatment and/or health care resource use required in their management.<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The duration of exacerbations can vary widely, but longer events are associated with greater morbidity, poorer health status, hospitalization, an increased risk of recurrence, and a faster decline in lung function.<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Time to first or subsequent exacerbation has been used as an outcome measure in some clinical trials.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Moreover, determining exacerbation-free time is a useful way to assess the impact of exacerbations.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>A variety of treatment approaches to prevent exacerbations have been described,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> including medications that improve lung mechanics,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> or use of anti-inflammatory agents.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The latter agents appear to be most effective in individuals with higher blood eosinophil counts, who are at increased risk of exacerbation.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> An alternative strategy is to use antioxidant-based therapies.

              <p>Erdosteine is an oral mucoactive agent with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that also reduces bacterial adhesiveness and enhances the effects of antibiotic therapy;<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> all of these properties may be useful for the prevention and treatment of COPD exacerbations.

                <p>The RESTORE study (NCT01032304) was a Phase III multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 10 European countries. Full details of the study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria, ethical approval and results have been reported.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Briefly, following a 2-week run-in period of continued usual COPD therapy, 467 patients with moderate or severe COPD (grade II/III, GOLD 2007 classification) were randomized to receive either oral erdosteine (300 mg twice daily, n=228) or placebo (n=239) for 12 months in addition to their usual COPD therapy. Written informed consent was provided by each participant prior to enrolment. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was granted locally as outlined in the <underline><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=221852.docx">Supplementary appendix</ext-link></underline>.</p>
                <p>For this post hoc analysis, we reclassified patients participating in the RESTORE study using the spirometry criteria from the GOLD 2017 guidelines.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Thus, patients with moderate COPD (GOLD 2) were defined as having a post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> between 50% and 79% predicted, and patients with severe COPD (GOLD 3) had a post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> between 30% and 49% predicted; both subgroups had a post-bronchodilator fixed ratio FEV<sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity [FVC] &lt;0.70. Participants were outpatients aged 40‒80 years, current or ex-smokers (≥10 pack-years), on a stable therapeutic regimen for ≥8 weeks prior to inclusion who had experienced ≥2 acute COPD exacerbations requiring medical intervention in the previous 12 months, but with no exacerbations in the preceding 2 months.</p>

                <p>A COPD exacerbation was defined as a worsening of symptoms beyond normal day-to-day variation that required a change in regular medication and/or health care resource utilization.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Exacerbations were confirmed by the investigators from the variation in daily symptom (dyspnea, cough, sputum) scores, changes in regular medication, use of additional medication or emergency hospitalization for COPD, as recorded in the patient diary. The severity of each exacerbation was graded by investigators as mild, moderate or severe (<xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The duration of an exacerbation was determined from the diary card data. The onset of a COPD exacerbation was defined by the presence of at least two days of symptomatic worsening and/or an increased level of health care utilization. Resolution of a mild exacerbation was determined by a return to pre-event symptomatology. Similarly, the end of a moderate or severe exacerbation was determined as the cessation of additional treatment and return to background therapy or hospital discharge and return to background therapy. At least 10 consecutive days without symptom variation and/or additional medication and/or re-hospitalization since the previous episode were required before a new event could be registered. Exacerbation-free time was defined as the number of days without an exacerbation present while the patient was participating in the study. All diary card assessments were conducted blind to treatment allocation as described in the appendix to the primary publication<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and explained in the supplement to this manuscript.<table-wrap id="T0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Classification Of Exacerbation Severity In The RESTORE Study Based On Health Care Utilization<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exacerbation Severity</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Level Of Health Care Utilization</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mild</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient has an increased need for medication (bronchodilators), which he/she can manage in own normal environment</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient has increased need for medication (antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids) and feels the need to seek additional medical assistance</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Severe</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient/caregiver recognizes obvious and/or rapid deterioration in condition, requiring hospitalization or an emergency department visit</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

                <p>All post hoc efficacy analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat (ITT) principles on randomized patients who received at least one dose of study treatment and had at least one available post-baseline efficacy evaluation. Likelihood-based methods were used to handle missing data. The adverse events reported for the moderate COPD subgroup were based on all patients randomized to treatment.</p>
                <p>Baseline characteristics are reported using descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations [SD] or percentages). Comparisons between treatment groups were performed using the chi-squared test followed by Fisher’s exact test.</p>
                <p>The frequency of exacerbations was analyzed using a Poisson mixed regression model, with correction for overdispersion and including the following covariates: treatment, age, sex, body mass index, and FEV<sub>1</sub> at baseline, as described previously.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The COPD exacerbation rate over the 12-month follow-up period was calculated as the mean exacerbation rate per-patient per-year.

                <p>The duration of an exacerbation was calculated as the sum of days the patient was affected by a COPD exacerbation, as defined earlier. Time to first exacerbation was calculated as the time in days from the beginning of the study to the first exacerbation. Time free from exacerbation was calculated as the difference between the total days the patient was involved in the study and the number of days during which the patient experienced a COPD exacerbation. Comparisons between treatment groups used the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for exacerbation duration and the log rank test for time to first exacerbation.</p>

                <p>Blood eosinophil counts are summarized using descriptive statistics. Exacerbation rate among patients with moderate COPD was analyzed by stratification of baseline blood eosinophil counts (&lt;150 cells/μL and ≥ 150 cells/μL) in keeping with previous reports in patients not using dual bronchodilator therapy.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p>

Among patients with moderate COPD, the mean exacerbation rate was higher in patients with blood eosinophil counts ≥150 cells/μL, but erdosteine treatment significantly reduced the mean exacerbation rate compared with placebo in both subgroups with &lt;150 cells/μL and ≥150 cells/μL (<xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).<fig id="F0004" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Exacerbation rate by blood eosinophil count (&lt;150 cells/μL and ≥150 cells/μL) for patients with moderate COPD by treatment group.</p></caption><graphic content-type="print-only" xlink:href="COPD-14-2733-g0004"/></fig></p>
              <p>A total of 305 adverse events were reported during the study in the subgroup of patients with moderate COPD: 136 adverse events in the erdosteine group (3 serious adverse events) and 169 in the placebo group (4 serious adverse events).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The RESTORE study demonstrated that erdosteine administered twice daily at the licensed dose (300 mg) reduced the overall exacerbation rate in COPD patients with a history of exacerbations in the previous year, many of whom were already receiving previously standard therapy with ICS.<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The primary report of the RESTORE study did not seek to identify which subgroup of patients would benefit the most from erdosteine treatment, so we addressed this issue in the current exploratory post hoc analysis. The results suggest that erdosteine use has a significant effect on exacerbations in patients with less severe COPD defined spirometrically (FEV<sub>1</sub> 50‒79%), as the relative effect of treatment on the overall exacerbation rate was almost doubled compared to placebo. A similar effect was seen on mild exacerbations classified by treatment intensity, but there was no reduction in the number of exacerbations observed in patients with severe COPD. Similarly, the reduction in the duration of mild exacerbations was most evident in patients with moderate COPD. In this subgroup, erdosteine therapy was associated with a significant increase in both the time to first exacerbation and the total time without exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbations. Unlike other anti-inflammatory agents, the positive effects of erdosteine were not restricted to patients with a higher blood eosinophil count. Encouragingly, there was no evidence of a significant adverse event profile in these less impaired COPD patients. These findings potentially impact the way in which we view COPD exacerbations and for the treatment options to be considered for preventing exacerbations.</p>
              <p>Stratification of the treatment effect by baseline lung function has been examined with other treatments known to prevent COPD exacerbations, including inhaled bronchodilators<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and long-acting inhaled bronchodilator–ICS combinations.<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In general, categorizing patients in this way has little impact on the overall efficacy of these treatments, although the results of the FLAME (Effect of Indacaterol Glycopyronium vs Fluticasone Salmeterol on COPD Exacerbations) study indicated that inhaled long-acting bronchodilator combination therapy may be relatively less effective in patients with very severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;30% predicted, GOLD stage IV).<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, applying this approach to the RESTORE study data gave a different answer. Although the ITT analysis reported a 19% reduction in exacerbation rate of the total study population, this difference was driven by patients in the spirometrically-defined moderate COPD subgroup, where a 47% reduction in exacerbation rate was seen with erdosteine therapy compared to placebo. By contrast, there was little difference in the exacerbation rate among patients with worse spirometry when erdosteine therapy was compared with placebo. Although there were fewer patients in this severe COPD subgroup, it seems unlikely that the comparison is underpowered statistically given the lack of difference in event rates between the two treatment groups.</p>
              <p>Recent reports have identified differences in the way that exacerbations are treated dependent on the background therapy taken.<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The SUMMIT (Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity) study included patients with spirometrically-defined moderate COPD as in the RESTORE study but, unfortunately, did not characterize exacerbations as carefully as we did and so data about mild events, where routine treatment is intensified but new therapy is not started, were not available in that large study.<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In the present analysis, we found significant reductions in the duration of mild exacerbations in the subgroup of patients with moderate COPD treated with erdosteine and this played an important role in increasing the time to first event for all exacerbations. Although meta-analysis of a number of studies of mucolytic drugs suggest that they are useful in preventing COPD exacerbations,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> such an effect has not been reported in individual studies, which likely reflects their differing study designs and inclusion criteria. Our findings of a longer time to first exacerbation and a longer exacerbation-free time with erdosteine in patients with spirometrically-defined moderate COPD lends support to the major effect of this drug being in patients with milder airflow obstruction.</p>
              <p>A particular strength of the RESTORE study was the prespecified recording of exacerbation duration. To date, only regular macrolide therapy has been shown to decrease exacerbation duration,<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> which is a known risk factor for subsequent hospitalization in COPD patients.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> As anticipated, exacerbations did not last as long in patients with moderate COPD as compared to severe disease, and exacerbations classified as mild were shorter than those where antibiotics and/or corticosteroids were used. However, in all these subgroups, erdosteine treatment was associated with shorter exacerbation events compared with placebo, a difference that was statistically significant in patients with moderate spirometric impairment. Given the greater variation in exacerbation duration in the subgroup with severe COPD, it is likely that comparisons in these patients are underpowered to detect a significant difference; although, if present, the difference between erdosteine and placebo groups is likely to be of smaller magnitude than in the patients with moderate COPD. Overall the total number of days that patients experienced symptoms related to an exacerbation was lower in the erdosteine treated subjects when compared to those receiving placebo in addition to their usual treatments. This may be relevant as data from population studies and early disease cohorts suggests that exacerbations including unreported events have an important impact on patient health status and well-being at an earlier stage of COPD than previously appreciated.<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p>
              <p>There has been much discussion about the use of the blood eosinophil count as a stratifying variable when selecting anti-inflammatory therapy for patients with COPD. Like others we found that patients with higher blood eosinophil counts experienced more exacerbations, but unlike data obtained from patients treated with ICS and roflumilast<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we saw no differential effect of treatment based on eosinophil numbers. However, our event rates were relatively low and we could not stratify for higher eosinophil counts as was done in some other trials. Nonetheless, the similarity of the mean data in the high and low eosinophil groups supports the idea that erdosteine’s effects are not substantially influenced by the blood eosinophil count.</p>
              <p>Our study has several strengths beyond data collection of mild exacerbation events. Erdosteine was well tolerated in both subgroups of patients with moderate and severe COPD. This likely reflects its use at licensed doses rather than the high doses of other antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which were needed to show an effect on exacerbation rate in patients with COPD.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Concerns about the potential of further harm at high-dose NAC has led some investigators to curtail clinical research with this formulation.<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> As erdosteine had so few side effects there was no substantial difference in the withdrawal rate from either treatment arm (see <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), a factor that has complicated interpretation of other studies.<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Our patients were predominantly Caucasian and were using appropriate background medication throughout the study, including ICS in 75% of patients. An earlier European trial found no benefit of NAC in patients with COPD who used ICS.<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In the present analysis, we found no interaction between ICS use and the effects of therapy in our patients with moderate COPD in terms of exacerbation number or duration. Nonetheless, there are limitations to our analysis. This is a pre-specified post hoc analysis and so the significance levels we report should be considered as only nominally significant. We did not have information that would allow us to classify patients according to the current GOLD system, so our patients must be considered to be in either groups C or D of that classification system.<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The entry criteria for the RESTORE study specified that patients should have a prior exacerbation history, but the mean exacerbation rate in the placebo arm of the study was lower than expected. This is not unique to our study, having been seen in other treatment studies with similar recruitment criteria.<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> This lower than expected exacerbation rate in the RESTORE study may reflect an improved patient adherence to existing therapy on study entry or the marked variability in exacerbations over time as seen in recent reports from the large SPIROMICS (SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study) and TIOSPIR (TIOtropium Safety and Performance in Respimat®) studies, where a large percentage of participants with a history of frequent exacerbations did not subsequently experience these events during 2–3 years of follow-up in the study.<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The use of diary cards to define events can be criticized as being imprecise, but it has been used widely by other groups<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and the methodology used here has been covered in detail in the appendix to the original RESTORE publication<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Given the blinded nature of the study we believe the data on number and duration of events are likely to be correct.</p>
              <p>This post hoc analysis has a number of clinical implications. It provides further evidence for the heterogeneity of exacerbation events, at least in terms of their response to therapy with differences in the ability of an oral antioxidant like erdosteine to prevent events according to the severity of the patient’s airflow obstruction and the type of treatment thought necessary to manage the episode. Whether this reflects differences in the etiology of the exacerbations, the host response to the triggering factor, or a combination of these two remains unclear. However, the present results do emphasize the value of knowing the severity of airflow obstruction when considering what prophylactic therapy to prescribe as erdosteine did not reduce the number of moderate or severe events reported by our patients. Currently, there is renewed interest in the factors in early COPD leading to disease progression,<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and a need to identify well tolerated treatments that can be used earlier in the natural history of COPD than those previously considered. Our data suggests that drugs like erdosteine, which are orally active, well tolerated and can prevent exacerbation events that are common in less severe disease, may prove useful in the management of the less severely impaired COPD patient with a history of exacerbations.</p>
