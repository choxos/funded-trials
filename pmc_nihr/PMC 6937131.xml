                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Type 2 diabetes is common, affecting over 400 million people worldwide. Risk of serious complications can be reduced through use of effective treatments and active self-management. However, people are often concerned about starting new medicines and face difficulties in taking them regularly. Use of brief messages to provide education and support self-management, delivered through mobile phone-based text messages, can be an effective tool for some long-term conditions. We have developed messages aiming to support patients’ self-management of type 2 diabetes in the use of medications and other aspects of self-management, underpinned by theory and evidence. The aim of this trial is to determine the feasibility of a large-scale clinical trial to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared with usual care.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The feasibility trial will be a multicentre individually randomised, controlled trial in primary care recruiting adults (≥35 years) with type 2 diabetes in England. Consenting participants will be randomised to receive short text messages three times a week with messages designed to produce change in medication adherence or non-health-related messages for 6 months. The aims are to test recruitment methods, retention to the study, the feasibility of data collection and the mobile phone and web-based processes of a proposed definitive trial and to refine the text messaging intervention. The primary outcome is the rate of recruitment to randomisation of participants to the trial. Data, including patient reported measures, will be collected online at baseline and the end of the 6-month follow-up period. With 200 participants (100 in each group), this trial is powered to estimate 80% follow-up within 95% CIs of 73.8% to 85.3%. The analysis will follow a prespecified plan.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common long-term conditions affecting 422 million people worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and 4.7 million people in the UK.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It can lead to major complications including cardiovascular disease, renal failure and neuropathy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The global burden of diabetes is projected to reach up to 2.2% of global gross domestic product,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and many of these costs are due to preventable complications. Prevention includes the use of treatments of proven efficacy<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> alongside supporting self-management.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, concerns about medicines and difficulties in taking them regularly, whether intentional or unintentional, are common<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and lead to poor diabetes control and increased use of health resources.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The cost of non-adherence to diabetes medication in the UK has been estimated at £100 million per year in avoidable treatment costs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A wide range of services are available to support people in better use of their medicines, but evidence of their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is weak.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These services are often targeted at particular groups of individuals and are frequently designed as ‘one-off’ interventions. Examples include medication reviews, education and addressing cost issues.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Understanding and improving this situation could make a major contribution to health and healthcare costs.</p>
              <p>Systematic reviews do not provide strong evidence to support the wider use of current approaches to developing interventions to improve adherence.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Brief messages delivered at a wide scale and low cost via digital health systems added to usual care have been shown to be effective in improving health for some conditions and are a promising approach to the problem.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p>
              <p>Systematic reviews of text messages to support patients to adhere to treatment, and of mobile health interventions in diabetes, identify some effective interventions. There are a few trials testing the impact of brief messaging in type 2 diabetes; although some have systematically developed messages mapped to theoretical constructs, many are at risk of bias and may be limited in their application to specific contexts.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> Recent trials of text messaging for cardiovascular risk prevention and blood pressure lowering have shown clinically relevant changes in outcomes compared with usual care.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref>
</p>
              <p>In addition, there is substantial evidence that tailored interventions are more effective than generic interventions.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Tailored interventions may be seen by recipients as more personally relevant, so they will be more likely to attend to, read, understand and act on them. In addition, tailored interventions are designed to change determinants of the target behaviour that are relevant to particular individuals or to small subgroups of individuals; they therefore more precisely target the determinants of the individual’s behaviour.</p>
              <p>SUpport through Mobile Messaging and digital health Technology for Diabetes (SuMMiT-D) is a programme of work composed of three phases: formative work, a feasibility trial and a large scale, effectiveness randomised controlled trial of a mobile phone-based system intended to deliver brief, tailored, behaviour change messages to people with type 2 diabetes focusing on use of medication. The intervention is intended to focus on a broad range of individuals with type 2 diabetes, but those with younger onset diabetes and using insulin alone were not included, as these features can require care using different pathways. In the formative work for this trial, we identified theoretical constructs and features of intervention content found to be associated with medication adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes and mapped these onto a standard taxonomy for behaviour change techniques (BCTs), that is, active ingredients of interventions used to promote behavioural change.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> We then developed a large set of messages to target each BCT and examined which types of messages are most useful and easy to understand for people starting and taking an oral diabetes medicine and the extent to which it might be helpful for patients to decide on the types of messages they want to receive. We received input from approximately 300 patients with type 2 diabetes and healthcare professionals caring for this patient population. Preliminary findings of this trial development work were used to develop this feasibility trial with scope for further refinement of the system for the main clinical trial.</p>
              <p>The primary objective of the SuMMiT-D Feasibility trial is to test recruitment and randomisation of participants to the trial. We will test collection of planned primary and secondary outcome data in planning for a large, outcomes-based, randomised controlled trial. We will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for patients and healthcare professionals; the willingness of participants to be randomised; follow-up rates; resource use; and trial procedures. We will also carry out a process evaluation of how the system is used and refine the way it is embedded within usual care. Potential mechanisms for the action of the brief messages will be assessed through changes in hypothesised health psychology constructs relating to use of medication, self-report medication adherence,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and questions based on the technology acceptance model.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>SuMMiT-D Feasibility will inform the design of a future large-scale randomised controlled trial, aiming to estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the text messaging intervention and identify difficulties that might be encountered in practice. If effective and implemented in the NHS, this intervention could help reduce the burden of complications and increased costs associated with non-adherence. This research could also offer a model for technology-based self-management support that could be extended to other aspects of diabetes care and other long-term conditions.</p>
