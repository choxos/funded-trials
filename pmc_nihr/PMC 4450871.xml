                <p>Total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR) are usually effective at relieving pain; however, 7% to 23% of patients experience chronic postsurgical pain. These trials aimed to investigate the effect of local anaesthetic wound infiltration on pain severity at 12 months after primary THR or TKR for osteoarthritis. Between November 2009 and February 2012, 322 patients listed for THR and 316 listed for TKR were recruited into a single-centre double-blind randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive local anaesthetic infiltration and standard care or standard care alone. Participants and outcomes assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was pain severity on the WOMAC Pain Scale at 12 months after surgery. Analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. In the hip trial, patients in the intervention group had significantly less pain at 12 months postoperative than patients in the standard care group (differences in means: 4.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-8.54; <italic>P</italic> = 0.015), although the difference was not clinically significant. Post hoc analysis found that patients in the intervention group were more likely to have none to moderate pain than severe pain at 12 months than those in the standard care group (odds ratio: 10.19; 95% CI: 2.10-49.55; <italic>P</italic> = 0.004). In the knee trial, there was no strong evidence that the intervention influenced pain severity at 12 months postoperative (difference in means: 3.83; 95% CI: â0.83 to 8.49; <italic>P</italic> = 0.107). In conclusion, routine use of infiltration could be beneficial in improving long-term pain relief for some patients after THR.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Primary total hip replacement (THR) and primary total knee replacement (TKR) are 2 of the most commonly performed elective surgical procedures, with 76,448 THR operations and 76,497 TKR operations performed in England and Wales in 2012.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Projections indicate increased demand in the coming decades.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Joint replacement is usually performed to relieve pain and improve function related to osteoarthritis and is effective for the majority of patients. However, in the postoperative period, up to half of the patients report moderate or severe pain on the first postoperative day.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In the longer-term, between 7% and 23% of patients with THR and between 10% and 34% of patients with TKR report an unfavourable pain outcome at 3 months to 5 years after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Given the prevalence and impact of chronic pain,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> it is important to investigate interventions to reduce chronic postsurgical pain after joint replacement. Evidence from several types of surgery indicates that severe acute postoperative pain is a risk factor for chronic postsurgical pain. This has been highlighted in joint replacement, breast surgery, inguinal hernia repair, and thoracic surgery.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Mechanisms for the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain are likely to be multifactorial. It is probable that the large amount of noxious input induced by surgery contributes to this transition through hyperexcitability and sensitisation of neurones within the central nervous system, which can lead to long-lasting amplification of pain signalling within the spinal cord.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>In orthopaedic surgery, local anaesthetic infiltration has been found to be effective at significantly reducing pain severity in the first 48 hours after surgery.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, because of a lack of trials with longer-term follow-up, it is not known whether benefits of local anaesthetic infiltration extend to reducing chronic postsurgical pain. Studies on the trajectory of recovery after joint replacement illustrate that although much of the pain relief from surgery occurs in the first 3 months, improvements in pain continue throughout the first year postoperative.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The aim of these 2 double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with allocation concealment was to determine whether intraoperative local anaesthetic infiltration could significantly reduce pain at 12 months after THR or TKR.</p>

              <sec id="s2-1">
                <title>2.1. Design overview</title>
                <p>Two single-centre double-blind RCTs (the Arthroplasty Pain Experience [APEX] trials) were conducted: one with patients undergoing THR and the other with patients undergoing TKR. The design of the 2 trials was similar except for standard anaesthetic care, and these differences are described in more detail below. The protocol for these trials has been published previously.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The APEX trials were approved by Southampton and South West Hampshire Research Ethics Committee (09/H0504/94), and all participants provided informed written consent. The trials were registered as an International Standardised Randomized Controlled Trial (96095682) and as a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product with the Medicine Healthcare and Regulatory Authority (18524/0215/001-0001) and EudraCT (2009-013817-93). Both trials were overseen by a Data Monitoring Committee and Trial Steering Committee, who regularly reviewed safety data and monitored trial conduct.</p>

                <title>2.2. Setting and participants</title>
                <p>Eligible patients were listed for a primary unilateral THR or TKR for osteoarthritis at a UK elective orthopaedic centre. Exclusion criteria were (1) medical comorbidity that precluded spinal anaesthesia, regional blocks, or strong analgesics postoperatively because inability to tolerate these pain relief strategies may have influenced the trial results; (2) severe dementia or psychiatric illness; (3) listing for simultaneous bilateral joint replacement; (4) previous participation in the trial; (5) inability to understand English. Patients were recruited at the preoperative assessment clinic by a research nurse and randomized before surgery by the trial administrator.</p>

                <title>2.3. Randomization</title>
                <p>Treatment allocation was conducted remotely through the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration to maintain allocation concealment. Patients were allocated on a 1:1 ratio to receive the intervention plus standard care or standard care alone using minimisation. Baseline joint pain severity and surgical approach were used as minimisation factors. The trial administrator informed the operating surgeon and anaesthetist of treatment allocation on the day of surgery. Participants and trial research nurses were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>2.4. Standard care and intervention treatment: total hip replacement</title>
                <p>Standard anaesthetic care consisted of a spinal anaesthetic with 3 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine placed at the L3/4 or L4/5 interspace. Intraoperatively, the patient was awake, sedated, or under light general anaesthetic depending on patient and anaesthetic factors. The intervention group received the same anaesthetic regime, plus an intraoperative local anaesthetic infiltration that consisted of 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 in 200,000 adrenaline. The local anaesthetic mixture was injected into the joint capsule and short external rotators (5 mL), fascia (20 mL), fat (15 mL), and subcutaneous tissue (20 mL) before closure of the wound.</p>

                <p>In line with evidence-based guidance from PROSPECT (procedure specific postoperative pain management), standard anaesthetic care consisted of a femoral nerve block and a spinal or general anaesthetic, depending on patient factors.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The intervention group received the same anaesthetic regime, plus an intraoperative local anaesthetic infiltration that consisted of 60 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1 in 200,000 adrenaline. The local anaesthetic mixture was injected directly into the posterior capsule (25 mL), medial and lateral capsule (10 mL), fascia and muscle (10 mL), and subcutaneous tissues (15 mL), before wound closure.

                  <p>Patient-reported outcome measures such as the WOMAC Pain score are bounded (0-100), limiting the ability of the questionnaire to detect improvement beyond the bounds of the scoring. The resulting ceiling or floor effect can generate a nonnormally distributed score, especially if a substantial proportion of the sample is affected. This can impact the robustness of the coefficient SE, confidence intervals, and <italic>P</italic> values obtained from a linear regression (through violations of the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality). To explore the potential impact of the ceiling effect on the intervention effect, 2 further sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, transformations of WOMAC Pain scores using appropriate functions to obtain a continuous primary outcome that could be modelled with a linear regression were investigated. Second, the scores were modelled as an ordered categorical variable using published threshold definitions (severe [0-50], moderate [51-75], mild [76-99], no [100] pain).<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> These categories relate to the original ordinal WOMAC Pain scale, eg, a patient who reports no pain for every item will score 100, a patient who reports mild pain on all the items will score 75 and so forth. A partial proportional-odds regression was used to model this new outcome.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> The model automatically generates logical and systematic groupings of the outcome categories: category 1 vs 2 to 4; 1 to 2 vs 3 to 4; 1 to 3 vs 4. It then performs a series of binary logistic regressions on those different grouping within a single analytical framework. In our context, the model explored the probability of having none, mild, or moderate vs severe pain; the probability of having no or mild pain vs moderate or severe pain; and finally the probability of having no pain vs pain (mild, moderate, severe). The model produced the odds ratio associated with the intervention effect for each of the outcome category groupings adjusted for the preoperative WOMAC Pain scores and surgical approach.</p>

For the THR trial, 322 (51%) patients were recruited and randomized, 163 to the intervention arm and 159 to the standard care arm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A).

Primary outcome data were collected from 281 (87%) patients with THR and 273 (86%) patients with TKR. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were generally well balanced between the arms in both trials (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In the THR trial, some differences between trial arms in gender, living arrangement, and comorbidities were observed.

These trials found some evidence that local anaesthetic wound infiltration can reduce pain severity at 12 months after THR, although the evidence was less clear for TKR. In the a priori analysis of the primary outcome, we found a 4 to 5 point difference in the mean WOMAC Pain score between patients in the intervention and standard care group of the THR trial and a 3- to 4-point difference in the TKR trial. The minimally clinically important difference on the 100-point WOMAC Pain scale is 8 to 9 points.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it could be argued that there is little evidence to support the use of infiltration for long-term pain relief, because although the results were statistically significant in the THR trial, the benefit will not be clinically meaningful. However, it is important to interpret these results in the context of outcomes after joint replacement. The majority of patients report little or no pain after joint replacement.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Therefore, this intervention can only improve the outcome of the patients who would otherwise experience an unfavourable long-term pain outcome, which the literature suggests is approximately 10% of patients with THR and 20% of patients with TKR.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Our post hoc analysis of the WOMAC Pain score highlighted the potential of local wound infiltration to reduce the number of patients with severe pain after THR.</p>
              <p>The findings from these trials suggest that local anaesthetic infiltration could be beneficial in reducing long-term pain severity after THR for some patients. We also found evidence that the intervention reduces neuropathic pain at 12 months after THR, indicating that infiltration could benefit those patients who may otherwise experience the most severe long-term and/or neuropathic pain after THR, both of which can be difficult to treat once established.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> We found no difference in adverse events between trial arms. Our trials are phase IV pragmatic studies of effectiveness, and we were not powered for the analysis of adverse events; however, previous evidence in local anaesthetic infiltration indicates no concerns in safety profile.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Administering local anaesthetic infiltration in THR is not an expensive procedure, has no safety concerns, and has the potential to benefit a minority of patients with the poorest long-term pain outcomes.</p>
              <p>The lack of an effect of the intervention on chronic pain after TKR could be due to the use of femoral nerve block within the trial. Femoral nerve block is a well-established method of providing analgesia after TKR and in our centre is included in the multimodal anaesthesia regimen provided as part of standard care. Consistent with our findings, 2 small RCTs with short-term follow-up showed limited additional pain relief for local anaesthetic infiltration when used in conjunction with a femoral nerve block.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Although they are effective in the management of acute postsurgical pain, femoral nerve blocks are associated with a temporary decrease in quadriceps function that may limit early mobilization, and an increased risk of falls.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Future research should evaluate the long-term effectiveness of local anaesthetic infiltration vs femoral nerve blocks after TKR surgery.</p>
              <p>Strengths of these trials include the long-term postoperative follow-up, use of robust and validated outcome measures, good rates of data collection for the primary outcome measure, and use of an independent allocation system and blinding to minimise bias. The sample is representative of the population undergoing THR and TKR, with a similar disease profile, gender mix and age range as reported by the National Joint Registry of England and Wales<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and other national registries,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and thus we believe the results to be generalisable. However, it is also important to acknowledge the limitations of these trials when interpreting the results. A large number of patients in both trials reported no pain on the WOMAC Pain Scale at 12 months postoperative; the resulting skewness of the data violated the assumptions of our a priori linear regression, and therefore we conducted post hoc analysis of the primary outcome using a categorical version of the WOMAC Pain scores. In this analysis, the number of patients with severe chronic pain was small, and the wide 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios highlight that the results should be interpreted with caution. It is also important to acknowledge that the trials were not powered for the analyses of the primary outcome as categorical variables or to detect differences in the treatment effect for the secondary outcomes.</p>
              <p>For many patients, THR and TKR is an effective treatment for painful osteoarthritis, and additional interventions to improve pain relief are not required. However, a sizeable proportion of people report chronic postsurgical pain.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Preoperative identification of patients at high risk of a poor outcome has proved challenging,<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and until better predictive models can be developed, it is unfeasible to target interventions at high-risk patients. Easily implementable and cost-effective interventions that can be administered to all patients undergoing joint replacement are needed to reduce the number of patients with chronic pain after surgery. Findings of our trials suggest that local anaesthetic infiltration is beneficial for decreasing long-term pain in patients with THR, although further research is required to determine whether the intervention is also beneficial for patients undergoing TKR. Given that approximately 80,000 THR operations are performed annually in England and Wales<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and 7% to 23% of patients are likely to develop severe chronic postsurgical pain,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> our findings suggest that routine use of local anaesthetic infiltration has the potential to improve pain outcomes for between 4600 and 15,300 patients every year. A full economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention within the APEX trials will be reported in a future publication.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, these trials provide evidence that local anaesthetic infiltration reduces chronic pain at 1 year after THR, suggesting that the routine use of infiltration could improve long-term pain relief.</p>
