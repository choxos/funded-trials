                  <p>The 2014 West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease highlighted the urgent need to develop an effective Ebola vaccine.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We undertook 2 phase 1 studies assessing safety and immunogenicity of the viral vector modified vaccinia Ankara virus vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine (MVA-EBO-Z), manufactured rapidly on a new duck cell line either alone or in a heterologous prime-boost regimen with recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus type 3 vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) followed by MVA-EBO-Z. Adult volunteers in the United Kingdom (n = 38) and Senegal (n = 40) were vaccinated and an accelerated 1-week prime-boost regimen was assessed in Senegal. Safety was assessed by active and passive collection of local and systemic adverse events.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The standard and accelerated heterologous prime-boost regimens were well-tolerated and elicited potent cellular and humoral immunogenicity in the United Kingdom and Senegal, but vaccine-induced antibody responses were significantly lower in Senegal. Cellular immune responses measured by flow cytometry were significantly greater in African vaccinees receiving ChAd3 and MVA vaccines in the same rather than the contralateral limb.</p>

                  <p>MVA biomanufactured on an immortalized duck cell line shows potential for very large-scale manufacturing with lower cost of goods. This first trial of MVA-EBO-Z in humans encourages further testing in phase 2 studies, with the 1-week prime-boost interval regimen appearing to be particularly suitable for outbreak control.</p>

          <body>
            <p>The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) resulted in &gt;11300 deaths in West Africa and highlighted the urgent need for development of an efficacious vaccine [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This led to the accelerated development of potential vaccine candidates that can be used both in an outbreak setting and to provide long-term protection in populations at risk of sporadic outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A number of vaccines have been evaluated in phase 1 trials including DNA vaccines, virus-like particles, and viral vectors such as live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV), human and chimpanzee adenoviruses, and recombinant modified vaccinia virus [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3–11</xref>]. The landmark ring vaccination trial in Guinea provided the first evidence of an Ebola vaccine, rVSV expressing the Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein, which is highly efficacious and could be stockpiled to curtail future outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Whether this single-dose vaccine provides durable protection is yet to be elucidated. In addition, it targets only 1 Ebola species and whether it will be licensed remains unclear [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
            <p>The use of different viral vectors, namely a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus followed by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus encoding the same glycoprotein (GP) in a heterologous prime-boost regimen is a leading strategy for developing vaccine regimens with higher potency, immediate protection, and better durability. Simian adenovirus vectors are an attractive vaccine platform as the viruses from which they are derived are not known to cause infections in humans and there is consequently a low human seroprevalence of antibodies to the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3) used here and to other simian vectors [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ChAd3 has been previously tested as a potential vaccine candidate for other infectious diseases, including hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It was also recently evaluated as a vector for potential Ebola vaccines in a number of clinical trials in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Africa [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Overall, these studies have demonstrated the safety of the recombinant ChAd3 vectored Ebola Zaire (ChAd3-EBO-Z) vaccine and as a nonreplicating vector, it has not caused any adverse events (AEs) of significant concern (arthralgia and significant rates of postvaccination fever) such as those reported after vaccination with the replication-competent rVSV vector [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
            <p>The induction of both antibodies and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses is potentially protective against EVD [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ChAd3-EBO-Z administered alone has been shown to induce both antibody and T-cell responses in humans [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although rVSV-ZEBOV elicits comparable humoral responses, there is less evidence of durable cellular immunogenicity induced by this vaccine, particularly with lower doses [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; an ongoing phase 2 trial of these vaccines in Liberia (Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia [PREVAIL]) will directly compare both the nature and durability of immunity [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In macaques, the administration of a ChAd3-vectored vaccine required a boost with an MVA-vectored vaccine to generate a durable protective response to lethal Ebola virus (EBOV) challenge [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recent human studies in the United Kingdom and Africa have shown that boosting with an MVA-vectored vaccine encoding multiple filovirus genes resulted in several-fold higher antibody and T-cell responses, which remained higher at 6 months after boost, compared to 6 months after administration of ChAd3-EBO-Z alone [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A very short prime-boost interval would be of great value in an outbreak setting for use in frontline workers or in a ring vaccination strategy. Alternatively, a longer interval might confer durable protection, and be of use in populations at risk of sporadic outbreaks.</p>
            <p>Here we evaluate a new Ebola vaccine candidate, MVA-EBO-Z (modified vaccinia Ankara virus vectored Ebola Zaire vaccine), manufactured on an immortalized duck retinal cell line, instead of primary chick embryo fibroblast cells, which have been used to manufacture all previous MVA-vectored vaccines tested in clinical trials to date. We also compared a 1-week prime-boost interval regimen, tailored to outbreak response use, with a 4-week regimen. We conducted a phase 1, first-in-human, open-label clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-EBO-Z alone and heterologous prime-boost immunization with ChAd3-EBO-Z followed by MVA-EBO-Z at 2 doses in 40 healthy UK volunteers aged 18–50 years. After initial safety assessment in this trial, we conducted a phase 1 trial to assess the 1-week prime-boost interval in 40 Senegalese adults.</p>

                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p>The phase 1a study was an open-label observational clinical trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-EBO-Z alone and the heterologous prime-boost regimen of ChAd3- EBO-Z followed by MVA-EBO-Z. Volunteers were first enrolled into group 1a and group 1b in a staggered manner to receive vaccination with MVA-EBO-Z alone at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) and 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU, respectively. Subsequently, the chief investigator and local safety monitor (LSM) deemed it safe to proceed with vaccinations in groups 2 and 3 after review of the 3 volunteers in group 1a at 72 hours postvaccination. Similarly, the chief investigator and LSM deemed it safe to proceed with vaccinations in group 4 after review of the 3 volunteers in group 1b at 72 hours postvaccination. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid region of the arm. Most volunteers received both vaccinations in the nondominant arm. Three volunteers (2 in group 2 and 1 in group 3) received their MVA vaccination in the contralateral arm. An independent LSM provided safety oversight. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02451891).</p>
                <p>The phase 1b study was a randomized, open-label clinical trial assessing the heterologous prime-boost regimen of ChAd3-EBO-Z followed by MVA-EBO-Z 1 week later, either in the same arm or in the contralateral arm, in healthy Senegalese adults. All vaccinations were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid region of the arm. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02485912). An independent data safety and monitoring board and LSM provided oversight and reviewed preliminary safety data before vaccinations commenced. The LSM also reviewed safety data after the first 5 volunteers had been vaccinated with ChAd3-EBO-Z before the remainder of the volunteers in each group were vaccinated. The trial was monitored by an external organization (Margan Clinical Research Organization). Full details regarding the study conduct are provided in the protocols, which can be found in the Supplementary Materials. Details of the safety analysis are also provided in the Supplementary Materials.</p>

                <p>In the phase 1a study, 70 volunteers were screened for eligibility and 40 were enrolled. Baseline demographics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. One volunteer in group 3 was withdrawn and replaced due to ongoing symptoms of chest pain at the time of the boost vaccination. This volunteer with a previous history of costochondritis was admitted overnight to the hospital with intermittent episodes of sharp nonradiating chest pain associated with exertional dyspnea lasting for 48 hours. This volunteer received vaccination with ChAd3-EBO-Z 3 days before the onset of symptoms. Subsequent cardiac investigations were all normal. The volunteer was withdrawn from the study due to ongoing symptoms of chest pain. A causality of “unlikely” to be related to vaccination was assigned to this SAE. Another volunteer in group 4 withdrew due to logistic reasons and was also replaced. Vaccinations took place between 6 May 2015 and 19 November 2015.</p>
                <p>Three volunteers each in group 1a and 1b received MVA-EBO-Z alone at doses of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU and 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU, respectively. In groups 2, 3, and 4, 34 volunteers received priming vaccination with ChAd3-EBO-Z at a dose of 3.6 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral particles. In group 2, 16 volunteers received vaccination with MVA-EBO-Z at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU with a prime-boost interval of 1 week. In each of groups 3 and 4, 8 volunteers were boosted with 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU and 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU MVA-EBO-Z, respectively 4 weeks after ChAd3-EBO-Z prime.</p>

Forty volunteers received ChAd3-EBO-Z followed by MVA-EBO-Z given 1 week later either in the ipsilateral or contralateral arm (20 in each group).</p>
                <p>The safety profile of ChAd3-EBO-Z has been described previously [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and a similar reactogenicity profile was observed after vaccination in the phase 1a study. Most AEs were mild in severity and self-limiting with no severe AEs reported. Four volunteers (11.8%) reported a mild fever postvaccination. Solicited local and systemic AEs related to ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccination in the UK study are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Solicited local and systemic AEs associated with the MVA-EBO-Z boost vaccination given at a 1-week prime-boost interval are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The majority of local and systemic AEs were mild in nature. Three volunteers reported fever, which spontaneously resolved within 24 hours. One of these volunteers reported severe fever associated with severe feverishness, fatigue, and malaise, which resolved spontaneously within 24 hours. One volunteer reported severe local erythema on day 4 postvaccination. The majority of solicited AEs in volunteers receiving MVA-EBO-Z at a 4-week interval were mild in nature (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Increasing the dose of MVA-EBO-Z to 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU did not increase reactogenicity. No fevers or severe AEs were reported in either group.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Monovalent MVA-EBO-Z, the first to be manufactured in an immortalized cell line and administered to humans, was safe and well tolerated in phase 1 trials in UK and West African adults. Adverse events after ChAd3-EBO-Z were predominantly mild in nature, in keeping with previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. MVA-EBO-Z administered at a dose of 1.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU did not increase the reactogenicity compared to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU, and this vaccine showed significantly reduced reactogenicity in African adults.</p>
              <p>MVA-EBO-Z given as a boost following a ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, comparable to a multivalent MVA-BN Filo expressing both Zaire and Sudan Ebola virus GPs [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. T-cell responses peak at M+7 and antibody responses at M+28; therefore, a very short prime-boost interval of 1 week appears suitable for use in a ring vaccination strategy or for outbreak control. There were no significant differences in Ebola GP–specific IgG titers or median ELISpot responses between groups 2, 3, and 4 at any of the time points. The significant induction of cellular immunity (and particularly IFN-γ–producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) may be beneficial for long-term protection against EVD [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this respect, a heterologous prime-boost regimen with the viral vectored vaccines ChAd3-EBO-Z and MVA-EBO-Z may be preferable for the durable protection of healthcare workers and populations susceptible to sporadic outbreaks to rVSV-ZEBOV, which does not induce significant Ebola-specific IFN-γ responses [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Humoral, but not cellular, immunogenicity postimmunization was significantly reduced in Senegalese volunteers compared to the UK cohort. Reduced antibody responses to vaccination in developing countries have been observed previously, although most often in children and infants, and this phenomenon is likely multifactorial with contributing factors including an increased burden of pathogen exposure, genetic differences, microflora composition, and nutritional status [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26–28</xref>]. Despite this, antibody responses in the Senegalese cohort were durable, remaining significantly above baseline 6 months after vaccination and although some preexisting immunity to the ChAd3 vector was detected, this did not correlate with reduced antibody responses.</p>
              <p>There were no significant differences in antibody or T-cell responses measured by ELISpot between the ipsilateral and contralateral regimens. Significant differences were apparent in the cytokine responses measured by intracellular cytokine staining, with the ipsilateral regimen inducing significantly lower frequencies of antigen-specific cytokine-secreting T cells and a distinct cytokine profile. This is an intriguing observation, perhaps dependent on which lymph nodes the boosting vector drains to, and which clearly warrants further investigation in future vaccine trials in both UK and African populations.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study shows that the heterologous prime-boost immunization with ChAd3-EBO-Z followed by MVA-EBO-Z was safe and immunogenic and supports further testing in populations at risk of EVD in phase 2 and phase 3 studies. This was also the first trial of any MVA biomanufactured on an immortalized cell line with capacity for very large-scale manufacturing, high production yields, and lower cost of goods compared to other MVA production technologies. The AE profile was very similar to that of MVA-vectored vaccines manufactured in primary chicken embryo cells, supporting the use of this vaccine production method for other MVA-vectored vaccines.</p>
