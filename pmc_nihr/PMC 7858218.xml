                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Food allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis. Changes in posture during acute reactions can trigger fatal outcomes, but the impact of allergic reactions on the cardiovascular system in nonfatal reactions remains poorly understood.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>Our aim was to systematically evaluate changes in cardiovascular function during acute allergic reactions to peanut.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Participants underwent double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to peanut as part of a clinical trial. Changes in hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, stroke volume, blood pressure, and peripheral blood flow) and electrocardiogram findings during food challenges were assessed using noninvasive continuous monitoring.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>A total of 57 adults (median age 24 years [interquartile range = 20-29]), 53% of whom were female, participated; 22 (39%) had anaphylaxis. Acute reactions were associated with significant changes in stroke volume (mean decrease of 4.2% [95% CI = 0.8-7.6; <italic>P</italic> = .03]), heart rate (mean increase 11.6% [95% CI = 8.4-14.8; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001]), and peripheral blood flow (mean increase 19.7% [95% CI = 10.8-28.6; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001]), irrespective of reaction severity. These changes were reproduced at a subsequent repeat peanut challenge in 26 participants, and could be reversed with administration of intravenous fluids which resulted in faster resolution of abdominal symptoms.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>In this first detailed human study of cardiovascular changes during food-induced allergic reactions, we found evidence for significant fluid redistribution, independent of reaction severity. This provides a sound rationale for optimizing venous return during significant allergic reactions to food. Finally, these data provide a new paradigm for understanding severity in anaphylaxis, in which poor outcomes may occur as a result of a failure in compensatory mechanisms.</p>

            <p id="p0010">Food allergy is a major public health issue, not only having an impact on affected individuals and their families but also with significant implications for food businesses, educational establishments, and health care systems. It is the most common cause of potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), which are an increasing cause of hospitalizations globally.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction involving the release of preformed mediators from mast cells and basophils,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> many of which have known cardiovascular effects.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> However, the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis remains poorly understood,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and severe anaphylaxis is unpredictable and initially, often difficult to distinguish from more mild reactions.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Changes in posture during anaphylaxis have precipitated cardiorespiratory arrest and death,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> implying that circulatory compromise is an important feature of some severe reactions.</p>
            <p id="p0015">The management of anaphylaxis has changed little in the past 3 decades, and the evidence base underlying international guidelines is weak, in part because of the difficulty of undertaking randomized controlled trials in this area.

Similarly, no difference was seen when anaphylaxis reactions treated with epinephrine (because of lower respiratory or severe laryngeal symptoms) were compared with those that were managed without epinephrine (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig E8</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0055">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>).<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig 5</label><caption><p>Changes in cardiovascular parameters at time of OCR from baseline, by reaction severity: SV(<bold>A</bold>), HR (<bold>B</bold>), CO(<bold>C</bold>), systolic and diastolic BP (<bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>), cutaneous blood flow (<bold>F</bold>), low and high frequency domains in HRV (<bold>G</bold> and <bold>H</bold>), and sample entropy (SampEn) (<bold>I</bold>).

                <p id="p0095">We compared cardiovascular parameters to subjects’ own rating of symptom severity using a 10-point VAS. Overall, there was a poor correlation between the change in cardiovascular parameters and participants’ VAS scores. However, a moderate correlation was seen between participants’ VAS scores for gastrointestinal symptoms and the change in SV and HR (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table E1</xref> in this article's Online Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jacionline.org" id="intref0060">www.jacionline.org</ext-link>).

                <p id="p0100">Interestingly, we observed anecdotally that administration of intravenous fluids following reaction was associated with apparent faster resolution of gastrointestinal cramping and pain. To study this further, 20 of the original participants underwent further peanut DBPCFC in a follow-up study (using a similar challenge protocol), in which abdominal pain was treated with intravenous fluids (500-1000 mL of 0.9% normal saline given over 30 minutes) following OCR. In all, 14 participants experienced a reaction similar to their baseline reaction to DBPCFC in terms of objective and subjective measures of organ involvement and symptom severity, including abdominal pain. This allowed a comparison of the changes in HR and SV between the original DBPCFC and subsequent challenge when intravenous fluids were administered to treat abdominal symptoms. Intravenous fluids resulted in a significant increase in SV from 10 minutes after administration compared with baseline DBPCFC, when no intravenous fluids were used (<italic>P</italic> = .04 [<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>]), reversing the decrease in SV observed at OCR.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="p0105">To our knowledge, this is the first study to undertake a detailed evaluation of cardiovascular events during food-related anaphylaxis and more mild reactions in humans. Our data suggest that significant cardiovascular changes occur during both mild and more severe peanut-induced allergic reactions, and this has important implications for clinical management. We observed a reproducible decrease in SV that was associated with increased peripheral blood flow; given the absence of significant peripheral edema during reactions, it is likely that the majority of fluid shifts occurred within the gut rather than into the cutaneous bed and thus contributed to the symptoms of abdominal discomfort reported during challenges. Significant fluid redistribution to the gut during anaphylaxis (including diffuse bowel wall edema confirmed on acute computed tomography scan) has been reported in a single case report of a patient with drug-induced anaphylaxis,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> but this has not yet been formally investigated in food allergy. There is growing evidence that the splanchnic circulation is an important reservoir of the venous circulation (eg, in chronic heart failure), and splanchnic nerve block alters venous return and cardiac preload.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Our data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms are associated with fluid redistribution, resulting in reduced venous return (cardiac preload). Alternatively, allergen-induced splanchnic venodilation may be another mechanism by which SV decreases during acute reactions.</p>
              <p id="p0110">We hypothesize that this decrease in cardiac preload drives a compensatory increase in peripheral vasoconstriction and HR, which maintains CO. The changes in HRV are consistent with sympathetic activation and similar to those reported in a pediatric population<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>; however, they were not reproduced at repeat food challenge. HRV has also been related to emotional arousal and responds to anxiety in a manner similar to that observed with sympathetic activation.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The failure to reproduce the changes in HRV or CO may be related to the greater anxiety reported by participants at initial DBPCFC. Of note, SV would generally increase with sympathetic activation; thus, the decrease in SV is likely to be of even greater significance.</p>
              <p id="p0115">Remarkably, we observed no difference in the decrease in SV with severity: similar changes were seen for both anaphylaxis and milder reactions. This suggests that reduced preload is commonplace during peanut allergy reactions <italic>irrespective of reaction severity</italic>. Despite this, cardiovascular compromise is uncommon during food-induced anaphylaxis.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Together, these observations imply that a major determinant of reaction severity may be the extent to which a host can compensate for the underlying reaction, which represents a new paradigm in understanding factors that contribute to severe outcomes in anaphylaxis.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> None of the anaphylaxis reactions in this study were refractory to treatment (no participant required more than 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine), nor did we observe any significant symptoms of cardiovascular compromise. Patients experiencing anaphylactic shock (ie, anaphylaxis with significant circulatory compromise) are likely to have greater cardiovascular dysfunction, but it would not have been safe or ethical to attempt to evaluate hypotensive anaphylaxis in this study.</p>
              <p id="p0120">Existing data regarding the pathophysiology of food-induced anaphylaxis are limited and are mostly derived from animal models; moreover, results from animal models cannot always be extrapolated to humans.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Vascular changes feature prominently in some animal models, with peripheral vasodilatation, venous pooling, and capillary leak in the splanchnic and hepatic circulation and/or vagal responses leading to reduced CO.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Interstitial capillary leakage and vascular fluid extravasation have also been described.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Data relating to human anaphylaxis are much more limited. Cardiovascular symptoms are less common with food-induced anaphylaxis than for anaphylaxis reactions triggered by non-food allergens. However, circulatory compromise appears to be important in more severe reactions, with a number of reports in the literature of fatal outcomes in food-induced anaphylaxis triggered by a change in posture,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> the putative mechanism being reduced venous return to the heart induced by the change in posture (for example, from lying/sitting to standing position) in the context of peripheral vasodilatation due to the allergic reaction.</p>
              <p id="p0125">In a landmark article, Fisher described 205 patients with perioperative anaphylaxis, many of whom had central venous monitoring <italic>in situ</italic>.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> He reported low right-filling pressures in all patients without cardiac disease. Furthermore, by monitoring serial changes in hematocrit during the reactions in 22 patients, he concluded that anaphylaxis can cause a loss of circulating volume of up to 35% within 10 minutes of reaction. These data lend weight to the possibility that poor outcomes triggered by postural changes during anaphylaxis are due to a failure to compensate for fluid redistribution, with consequent loss of CO. Preexisting cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for severe anaphylaxis<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>; the changes seen in this study may be more significant in those with cardiovascular disease. Our data suggest that acute coronary syndrome as a consequence of anaphylaxis (Kounis syndrome) or arrhythmias are uncommon in this setting of food-induced allergic reactions of mild-to-moderate severity in otherwise healthy volunteers.</p>
              <p id="p0130">Management of anaphylaxis should involve the early administration of intramuscular epinephrine.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Since 2011, the guidelines have also included the recommendation that the affected individual lie in a supine position with the legs raised to optimize venous return (unless this compromises breathing).<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Our data provide an evidence base not only for postural support but also for the administration of intravenous fluids, which is currently recommended only for treating hypotension or circulatory shock,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> both of which are late, preterminal signs in children and young adults, the age groups that are at greatest risk of fatalities due to food-induced anaphylaxis. In this study, administration of 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline restored SV and resulted in faster resolution of abdominal symptoms than treatment without fluids did. This suggests that abdominal pain during anaphylaxis may be linked to visceral angioedema, which can be reversed with rapid fluid administration. We therefore propose that appropriate fluid resuscitation be considered early in cases of food-induced anaphylaxis that are refractory to initial treatment with epinephrine—at least in those <italic>without</italic> preexisting cardiovascular disease—to maintain adequate circulatory volume and aid the distribution of the administered epinephrine.</p>
              <sec id="sec3.1">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p id="p0135">Anaphylaxis research is challenging, primarily because of the risks inherent in inducing potentially life-threatening reactions. Indeed, the evidence for epinephrine as first-line treatment is derived from case series, animal studies, and expert opinion.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of cardiovascular changes during food-induced allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Although 39% of reactions evaluated met the international clinical criteria for anaphylaxis, only 9 (16%) resulted in objective lower respiratory symptoms, and we did not observe any episodes of refractory anaphylaxis or hypotension, which limits the inferences which can be made. Caution is needed when interpreting these data because this was a challenge study and thus is not necessarily representative of peanut-induced allergic reactions occurring in the community. We found evidence that some of the changes seen (such as increased HR and BP) might have been exaggerated by a sympathetic response due to anxiety in study participants. As we have already noted, however, this does not explain the observed decrease in SV, something which was observed at repeat challenge. Whether the other changes seen might have been reproduced had more participants agreed to a further DBPCFC is unclear.</p>
                <p id="p0140">Our findings may also have been limited by the size of the study cohort; all of our participants were relatively healthy adults, mostly with a history of nonsevere reactions. Preexisting cardiovascular disease has been shown to be a risk factor for fatal anaphylaxis; it is therefore possible that different changes may be seen in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease.</p>
                <p id="p0145">Of note, in a case series of 7 patients receiving intramuscular epinephrine for anaphylaxis and monitored by using identical equipment, we observed no significant changes in cardiovascular parameters (including SV) other than for a minor increase in HR.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Therefore, the size of the effect of a single dose of intramuscularly administered epinephrine on cardiovascular parameters during food-triggered anaphylaxis remains unclear, although published case series clearly demonstrate an advantage in administering both intravenous fluids and adrenaline together to treat severe reactions.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Clearly, the majority of anaphylaxis reactions do respond to treatment with epinephrine, without the need for fluid resuscitation; for this reason, we recommend that appropriate fluid resuscitation be considered early in cases of food anaphylaxis that are refractory to initial treatment with epinephrine, or in cases in which significant abdominal pain continues to persist despite resolution of other symptoms.</p>
