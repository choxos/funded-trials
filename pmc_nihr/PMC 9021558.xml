                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very common long-term condition and powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Low-dose aspirin is of proven benefit in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in people with pre-existing CVD. However, in people without CVD, the rates of MI and stroke are much lower, and the benefits of aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD are largely balanced by an increased risk of bleeding.</p>
                  <p id="Par3">People with CKD are at greatly increased risk of CVD and so the absolute benefits of aspirin are likely to be greater than in lower-risk groups, even if the relative benefits are the same. Post hoc evidence suggests the relative benefits may be greater in the CKD population but the risk of bleeding may also be higher. A definitive study of aspirin for primary prevention in this high-risk group, recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2014, has never been conducted. The question has global significance given the rising burden of CKD worldwide and the low cost of aspirin.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par4">ATTACK is a pragmatic multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint adjudication superiority trial of aspirin 75 mg daily vs. standard care for the primary prevention of CVD in 25,210 people aged 18 years and over with CKD recruited from UK Primary Care.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Participants aged 18 years and over with CKD (GFR category G1-G4) will be identified in Primary Care and followed up using routinely collected data and annual questionnaires for an average of 5 years. The primary outcome is the time to first major vascular event (composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death [excluding confirmed intracranial haemorrhage and other fatal cardiovascular haemorrhage]). Deaths from other causes (including fatal bleeding) will be treated as competing events. The study will continue until 1827 major vascular events have occurred. The principal safety outcome is major intracranial and extracranial bleeding; this is hypothesised to be increased in those randomised to take aspirin. The key consideration is then whether and to what extent the benefits of aspirin from the expected reduction in CVD events exceed the risks of major bleeding.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par6">This will be the first definitive trial of aspirin for primary CVD prevention in CKD patients. The research will be of great interest to clinicians, guideline groups and policy-makers, in the UK and globally, particularly given the high and rising prevalence of CKD that is driven by population ageing and epidemics of obesity and diabetes. The low cost of aspirin means that a positive result would be of relevance to low- and middle-income countries and the impact in the developed world less diluted by any inequalities in health care access.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p id="Par61">Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as any abnormality of kidney function or structure with implications for health that is present for more than 3 months. It is classified according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR). The presence of an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or an UACR ≥3 mg/mmol for more than 90 days is diagnostic of CKD.</p>
                <p id="Par62">CKD is common, particularly in older people. The prevalence of CKD is estimated at 12–13% of adults from population data in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An important minority of people with CKD will develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), but the greatest significance of CKD is as a powerful and potentially modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). People with CKD are categorised according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification as being at moderate risk, high risk or very high risk of CVD according to the level of both eGFR and UACR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the USA, 9.2%, 2% and 0.8% of adults are in the moderate risk, high risk and very high risk categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; these proportions were similar in the Health Survey of England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par63">Large-scale robust epidemiological data indicate that the risks of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population increase where the eGFR is less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and/or where the UACR is greater than 1 mg/mmol. The risks are graded: compared with eGFR 95 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality were 1.18 (95% CI = 1.05–1.32) for eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 1.57 (1.39–1.78) for 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and 3.14 (2.39–4.13) for 15 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. UACR was associated with risk of mortality linearly on the log-log scale without threshold effects. Compared with UACR 0.6 mg/mmol, adjusted HR for all-cause mortality were 1.20 (1.15–1.26) for UACR 1.1 mg/mmol, 1.63 (1.50–1.77) for 3.4 mg/mmol, and 2.22 (1.97–2.51) for 33.9 mg/mmol. eGFR and UACR were multiplicatively associated with risk of mortality without evidence of interaction. Similar findings were recorded for cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par64">Albuminuria and eGFR are similarly predictive of mortality, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, in high-risk population cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and kidney disease cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and in people with and without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These findings hold true in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], both sexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and across ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par65">In people without previous myocardial infarction (MI), the rate of MI is higher in those with CKD (without diabetes) than in those with diabetes (without CKD): 6.9 per 1000 person-years (6.6–7·2) vs. 5.4 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 5.2–5.7) ; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy study, excess mortality in people with type 1 diabetes was only observed in those with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, those with kidney disease were found to predominantly account for the increased mortality observed in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par66">The pattern of vascular events in people with CKD varies according to disease severity. For those with the most severe impairment in GFR, and in particular those with ESKD receiving renal replacement therapy, atherothrombotic events are less prevalent and arrhythmia and heart failure more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, in those where the GFR is less severely impaired, and where albuminuria indicates the presence of vascular damage and endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], atherothrombotic events dominate.</p>
                <p id="Par67">The burden of CVD in CKD is substantial. The risk of a cardiovascular events in people with CKD is far higher than the risk of ESKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Overall, CVD is responsible for about one-third of all deaths in the UK. It can have a serious impact upon quality of life and cause considerable disability. CKD is included as a vascular condition within the English Department of Health’s CVD Outcomes Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The financial impact of CVD in CKD is large: assuming unit costs of £12,200 for a stroke and £7734 for an MI and incidence of stroke and MI of 12.0 and 11.9 per 1000 patient-years respectively in people with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the annual costs of strokes and MI in people with CKD in England were estimated in 2009/10 to be in the order of £1bn, greater than the cost of dialysis provision.</p>
                <p id="Par68">Our understanding of how to reduce cardiovascular risk in CKD is limited. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) demonstrated that primary prevention with simvastatin and ezetimibe reduced major atherosclerotic events in people with CKD. CVD event rates were high: 13.4% of a control group (mean eGFR of 27 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) experienced a major atherosclerotic event (including revascularisation) in SHARP over a median follow-up of 4.9 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Even in a lower-risk UK primary care cohort (mean eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 84% without albuminuria), 35% experienced a hospital admission with a cardiovascular event over a mean of 5.1 years of follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and the annual mortality from CVD in those without pre-existing CVD was as high as 0.7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Evidence on additional approaches to prevent CVD in CKD is therefore urgently required.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par69">In patients with CVD, there is good evidence that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of subsequent vascular events (secondary prevention) and that overall these benefits outweigh the risks of major bleeding, which is the principal complication of therapy. A meta-analysis conducted by the Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration (ATC) showed that antiplatelet agents (primarily aspirin) reduced serious vascular events by 22% across five major high risk categories of patients (previous MI, acute MI, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), acute stroke and other high risk). In 195 trials, there were 7705/71,912 (10.7%) serious vascular events in the antiplatelet-treated group against 9502/72,139 (13.2%) in adjusted controls. There was increased risk of major bleeding: 95/47,158 fatal and 440/47,158 non-fatal major extracranial bleeds (1.1%) were seen in the antiplatelet group against 71 and 62/47,168 (0.7%) in the controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended internationally for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with established cardiovascular disease.</p>
                <p id="Par70">In lower-risk populations without pre-existing CVD, the absolute benefits of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD are smaller and offset by an increased risk of bleeding. An ATC meta-analysis of six primary prevention studies reported a 12% proportional reduction in serious vascular events in a lower risk population (0.51% vs. 0.57% per annum) with aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par71">Three more recent aspirin primary prevention studies were published in 2018. ASCEND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and ARRIVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] explored the use of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD in people with diabetes and at moderate CV risk respectively. ASPREE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] examined the effect of aspirin on disability-free survival in healthy elderly subjects; cardiovascular disease was a pre-specified secondary outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The results of these three trials were incorporated into an updated systematic review. This review reported similar findings to previous meta-analyses: a total of 13 trials randomising 164,225 participants with 1,050,511 participant-years of follow-up were included. The median age was 62 years and the median estimated 10-year cardiovascular event rate was 9.2%. Aspirin use was associated with significant reductions in the composite cardiovascular outcome compared with no aspirin (571 per 100,000 participant-years with aspirin and 614 per 100,000 participant-years with no aspirin; hazard ratio [HR] 0.89 [95% credible interval 0.84–0.95]; absolute risk reduction 0.38% [0.20–0.55%]; number needed to treat 265). Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding events compared with no aspirin (231 per 100,000 participant-years with aspirin and 164 per 100,000 participant-years with no aspirin; HR 1.43 [1.30–1.56]; absolute risk increase 0.47% [0.34–0.62%]; number needed to harm 210). For patients at higher risk of CVD (estimated 10-year risk &gt; 10%), the magnitude of both the benefits (absolute risk reduction in composite CV outcome of 0.53%) and harms (absolute risk increase in major bleeding of 0.64%) was higher than in lower risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par72">Despite this substantial body of evidence, uncertainties still remain over whether and under what circumstances aspirin should be used for primary prevention. Whilst the effects on CV events and bleeding appear balanced across the populations studied, determination of the real-world net impact is not straightforward. The definitions of major bleeding employed have been inconsistent, and weighing the overall risks and benefits, and in particular the relative importance of CV and bleeding events, is challenging:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par73">Fatal bleeding events are uncommon overall. A 2016 meta-analysis found that although aspirin increased the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding by 60% there was no increase in fatal bleeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], although far higher rates of fatal or disabling bleeding in the elderly have been reported in an unselected high risk secondary prevention cohort (including some taking dual antiplatelet therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par74">It may be possible to mitigate the bleeding risk, but data on gastroprotection have not been reported consistently in the primary prevention literature. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) reduce the risk of peptic ulcer in at-risk individuals treated with low-dose aspirin by approximately 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is also evidence that H2 antagonists reduce low-dose aspirin-associated bleeding in high risk users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par75">Fatal CV events are more common. The 30-day day mortality in the survivors of a first MI is around 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. UK national data for 2010 indicate a 30-day case fatality rate for MI of 31% overall and 12% in those admitted to hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, in the general population, aspirin does not appear to reduce overall CV mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">Aspirin may reduce the risk of certain cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">The use of aspirin has been associated with a small relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in meta-analyses published before 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] but not in the most recent analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par78">The effect of aspirin on the highest risk primary prevention populations is also unclear. CKD substantially increases the risks of CV events, with a graded relationship between advancing stages of CKD and rates of fatal and non-fatal MI, and the probability of death following MI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The absolute benefits of aspirin may therefore be higher than in lower-risk populations even if the relative risk reductions are similar. People with CKD have not been well-represented in historical or recent primary prevention studies: the proportion with an eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> in ASCEND and ASPREE was 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and 19% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] respectively. A recent post hoc analysis of people with CKD in ASPREE did not confirm a net benefit of aspirin in elderly people with CKD but was not powered to definitively assess the presence of treatment heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par79">It is not clear to what extent any benefits may be offset because people with CKD are also at increased risk of bleeding. Many people with CKD are elderly, which is a risk factor for aspirin-associated bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. There are additional specific mechanisms through which the bleeding tendency may be increased in CKD, including defective platelet adhesion to the sub-endothelium, defective platelet aggregation, and other intrinsic platelet defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A Cochrane review (which included patients at all stages of CKD, including those receiving renal replacement) reported that the use of antiplatelet agents in people with CKD conferred an increased relative risk of major (27 studies, RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10–1.65) and minor bleeding (18 studies, 1.49 (1.12–1.97)) compared with placebo/control. The definitions of bleeding employed within the included studies were variable. The relative risks of major bleeding due to aspirin appeared no higher than those in the non-CKD population, although the absolute excess risks were higher due to the higher risks in the CKD control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par80">The role for gastroprotective agents in people with CKD treated with low-dose aspirin is undefined. Whilst people with CKD may be at higher bleeding risk, an increased incidence of acute interstitial nephritis in users of PPI has been reported. The absolute risks are small, with a nationwide nested case-control study revealing an incidence of 12.0 (95% CI 9.1–15.5) and 1.7 (0.9–1.9) per 100,000 patient-years in current and past users respectively. Observational data have also revealed associations between PPI and incident CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and of adverse chronic renal outcomes (decline in eGFR of more than 30% and ESKD) in those without intervening acute kidney injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Whether such pharmaco-epidemiological data should be used to imply a causal link has been recently challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. H2 antagonists may be an alternative.</p>
                <p id="Par81">Support for a role for aspirin in primary prevention in CKD can be found in data from the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial, which suggest that the relative risk reductions in CVD with aspirin may be greater in people with CKD than in those with normal kidney function. In the overall HOT study population, aspirin reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 15%, but did not affect total mortality or cardiovascular mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, there was evidence of significant heterogeneity by eGFR. Major cardiovascular events were reduced by 9% (95% CI − 9 to 24%), 15% (− 17 to 39%), and 66% (33 to 83%) for patients with baseline eGFR of ≥60, 45 to 59, and &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> respectively (<italic>p</italic> for trend = 0.03). In those with an eGFR of 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 800 (− 700 to 2200) major cardiovascular events were prevented per 100,000 patients treated for 3.8 years, at a cost of 400 (− 200 to 1000) major bleeds; at eGFR&lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 7600 (3100 to 12,100) events were prevented, at a cost of 270 (− 100 to 5500) bleeds. Total mortality was not affected in the CKD group as a whole but was significantly reduced in those subjects with eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. On sensitivity analysis, eGFR appeared to define the threshold for benefit. However, this was a post hoc analysis and only 2.9% of the HOT population had an eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Reporting of bleeding episodes was imprecise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is also unclear how generalisable the findings are to normotensive people with CKD as the criteria for entry into HOT were BP-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par82">A 2016 systematic review exploring the use of aspirin for primary prevention in CKD patients specifically identified three trials from a total of 1314 records screened; two of these provided previously unpublished data. In total, 4468 adults with pre-end-stage CKD and no history of CVD were included. There were 16,740 person-years of follow-up. The trials were assessed as showing medium to high levels of risk of bias, largely related to endpoint assessment and suboptimal identification of CKD. Only one trial, HARP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], was CKD-specific; it did not report cardiovascular events in aspirin and placebo groups. There was no pre-specified CKD analysis in the other two studies, HOT and the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Overall, there was no statistically significant reduction in major cardiovascular events (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.49–1.73, <italic>p</italic> = 0.79). There was a high level of heterogeneity (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 71% <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). In HOT, there were 76/1791 cardiovascular events in the aspirin-treated group and 110/1828 in controls, with a risk ratio of 0.71 (0.53–0.94). The numbers were smaller and the findings divergent in JPAD, with 24/342 and 15/290 events in aspirin and control groups respectively and a risk ratio of 1.36 (0.73–2.54). Overall, there were 100/2241 CVD events in aspirin-treated patients across the included studies and 125/2228 in controls. Mortality was non-significantly reduced in the aspirin group (RR 0.74, 0.55–1.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05, <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> 0%). Aspirin increased the risk of major bleeding (34/2241 episodes aspirin-treated patients vs. 17/2228 in controls (RR 1.98, 1.11–3.52, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02, <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> 0%)).</p>

                <p id="Par92">The adoption of an open-label over a placebo-controlled design offers the advantage of substantially lower trial costs. Assessment of safety is a critical issue. It is not possible in an open trial to fully mitigate the risk that allocation to aspirin will increase the reporting of symptoms. However, the impact of knowledge of treatment allocation on outcome measurement will be minimised with blinded independent outcome adjudication of major clinical endpoints, including all bleeding events that require hospitalisation.</p>

                  <p id="Par96">Active treatment will be aspirin (CAS 50-78-2) 75 mg given once daily. Non-enteric-coated tablets or dispersible preparations may be used interchangeably. Aspirin will be prescribed using the standard NHS prescribing system, which is automatically logged in the GP practice electronic system. Standard labelling and packaging will be used.</p>
                  <p id="Par97">Aspirin exerts an antiplatelet action through the irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1. This prevents the generation of prostaglandins, including thromboxane A2, and endothelial prostacyclin. Thromboxane A2 is an inducer of platelet aggregation and prostacyclin an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. As aspirin is less effective at reducing prostacyclin production than thromboxane A2 generation, the net effect favours reduced platelet aggregation and less thrombus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In total, 75 mg is the lowest proven effective antiplatelet dose of aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Equivalent doses of the enteric-coated aspirin are not as effective as plain aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. No clear clinical benefits in terms of reduction of GI bleeding or ulceration with enteric coating have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>

Such heterogeneity is not captured by current clinical guidelines. ATTACK is a pragmatic study, and a real-world approach will also be applied to this area of clinical uncertainty. The decision to introduce gastroprotection, and the choice of any gastroprotective agent, is not mandated, but rather will be at the discretion of the treating GP. Our GP training materials will provide the necessary information to support a process of shared decision-making, highlighting factors that are likely to increase the risks of bleeding.</p>

However, the estimated risk reduction in ATTACK is conservative and has been carefully considered in the light of other aspirin trials analysed using ITT. As near-complete routine outcome follow-up data will be available, the threat to internal validity as a result of different withdrawal rates between the two arms will be minimal.</p>

The Read coded prevalence of CKD GFR categories 3 to 5 in England is 4.1% of people aged 18 years and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. This is substantially lower than the estimated actual prevalence of 6.1% of people aged 16 and over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]<bold>.</bold> Unlike CKD G3-5, the coding of CKD GFR categories 1–2 has never been incentivised under the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) and is therefore likely to be far less complete than that for CKD G3-5. Miscoding of CKD is also common: 11% of people with a CKD 3-5 Read code in the National CKD Audit did not have current biochemical evidence of CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. For these reasons, both numerical values for eGFR and albuminuria/proteinuria and clinical terms will be used to identify potential participants.</p>
                  <p id="Par134">The search will return a list of potential patients which will be held within the practice. The GPs will check the list of patients to confirm potential eligibility and indicate that patients can be contacted and screened by signing the search list and documenting any exclusions.</p>
                  <p id="Par135">An automated invitation pack will be sent to the eligible patients via Docmail, a highly secure online mail management system. The pack will include a participant invitation letter, a copy of the Research Ethics Committee (REC)-approved Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and informed consent form (ICF), a reply slip and pre-paid return envelope (addressed to the Regional Centre).</p>

                  <p id="Par136">Test searches at practices participating in the <italic>Helicobacter</italic> Eradication Aspirin Trial (HEAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], indicated an average of 370 potentially eligible patients per practice. A rate of randomisation of 15% would give 55 participants per practice. With a more pessimistic set of assumptions, the trial remains feasible. The prevalence of CKD 1–5 is in the order of 12% from population data. The National Diabetes Audit highlighted that there are over 1 million people with diabetes and CKD 1–2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Not all of these patients will have blood and urine tests that are diagnostic of CKD on their GP records. If 8% of adults can be diagnosed with CKD 1–5 on the basis of test results, and of these 70% have no pre-existing CVD, and 80% of these are not taking aspirin, then a typical practice could potentially enrol around 300 eligible patients. A number of these will be excluded on other grounds (for example taking prohibited concomitant medications). If the rate of randomisation is 8%, full recruitment will be possible from the network of 1200 practices participating in HEAT (1257 enrolled, 1163 active [96% in England]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], with whom the ATTACK investigators have existing links through a common trial management team. If the number of eligible patients and/or the consent rate was lower, still there is nonetheless the ability to recruit additional practices outside the HEAT network: overall 48% of general practices across England take part in National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN) Portfolio studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. As in HEAT, there is also scope to extend into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

                  <p id="Par138">Potential participants who respond to express an interest will be contacted, primarily by telephone, to give them further information and allow them to ask questions. Suitable patients will be invited to a consent consultation.</p>
                  <p id="Par139">In the light of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, a decision was taken in Summer 2020 to offer remote consultations. No screening tests will now be taken; instead, laboratory-based checks of eligibility will be based on pre-existing blood and urine test results available within the GP electronic patient record (EPR). The effect of this is to render the trial entirely Covid-secure, as no face-to-face assessment are required at any stage in the trial. This is important as CKD is a risk factor for poor outcomes in Covid-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Prior to this, potentially eligible patients in ATTACK underwent screening eGFR and UACR testing at a face-to-face screening visit to confirm eligibility.</p>
                  <p id="Par140">During the virtual consent consultation, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the patient consented by an appropriately trained research nurse or registered medical professional with suitable study training. If the consenting individual has any concerns over the eligibility of a patient, they will discuss it with the GP at the practice, who will ultimately decide if the patient is suitable.</p>
                  <p id="Par141">Latest blood pressure will be extracted from the EPR. Basic demographic and clinical details will be recorded at consent, including self-defined ethnicity, height and weight, smoking history, and alcohol consumption. All participants will also complete an EQ-5D-5L questionnaire.</p>
                  <p id="Par142">Additional information, including postcode (used to generate Index of Multiple Deprivation), summary diagnoses, cardiovascular risk factors (for example diabetes [type and duration], hypertension and lipid profile) and concomitant medications will also be automatically extracted from the EPR as required.</p>
                  <p id="Par143">The GFR category at entry will be determined according to the most recent CKD-EPI eGFR, currently corrected for ethnicity. For sites where the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) eGFR is reported, CKD-EPI eGFR will be calculated from the standardised serum creatinine. The inclusion of correction factors for ethnicity has been reassessed by the American Society of Nephrology and National Kidney Foundation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], and we have adopted the recommendations from NICE in August 2021 to remove these [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par144">The exclusion of potential participants on the grounds of bleeding diathesis or anaemia is on the basis of investigator opinion. Thrombocytopenia is an important indicator of diathesis, but the risk of bleeding at any given platelet count is likely to be related to many factors including age, blood pressure, kidney function and, in the case of gastrointestinal bleeding, the presence of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection. There are no widely accepted protocols governing the use of aspirin in thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and very limited evidence to guide decision-making. It has been argued that aspirin can probably be safely continued in patients post cardiac bypass surgery with platelet counts below 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, unless clinical bleeding occurs or the count falls below 20 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]; others have recommended (“in the absence of evidence”) stopping antiplatelet agents in people with stable coronary artery disease and a platelet count &lt; 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. We have therefore not specified a fixed platelet count below which participants are automatically ineligible, but where thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 70 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) is present on the latest blood test (within the previous two years), this will be flagged at the Regional Centre for GP review. We will ask the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) to review bleeding risk subdivided by platelet count. Where the latest haemoglobin (within the previous two years) is &lt; 90 g/L (or &lt; 100 g/L with mean cell volume (MCV) ≤75 fL), this will also be highlighted to the potential participant’s GP. Patients will be excluded if, based on a holistic assessment of their bleeding risk, the GP would be unwilling to prescribe aspirin for them (should an indication arise) outside the trial. By applying usual practice, the results of ATTACK should have the greatest applicability to real-world clinical medicine. Where no FBC is available within the last 2 years, the latest available results will be marked for GP review, following the same principle.</p>

                  <title>Estimation of vascular event rate</title>
                  <p id="Par169">It is not possible to predict the control event rate for this trial with certainty. The largest cardiovascular outcome trial in CKD was the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), where the annual rate of major cardiovascular events (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and CV death) was 1.8% in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Compared with the SHARP population (mean age 62, mean eGFR 27 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), the ATTACK participants are likely to be older but have less impaired renal function. This is important: age is a powerful predictor of vascular events, and risk is also related to CKD severity; the net effect of these two opposing factors upon the event rate in ATTACK is not yet clear.</p>
                  <p id="Par170">The observed rate of major vascular events in a given trial population is however likely to be lower now than it would have been 10–20 years ago. More contemporary CKD cohorts also offer important insights. The annual cardiovascular mortality in those without pre-existing CVD in the contemporary Renal Risk in Derby (RRID) primary care cohort was 0.77% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], implying an annual event rate of 2.3% assuming a ratio of 1.8:1 of non-fatal:fatal cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the RRID cohort overall (mean eGFR 52 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 16% with albuminuria, 22% with pre-existing CVD), the annual rate of fatal and non-non-fatal CVD was 2.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In the Alberta CKD cohort, the rate of coronary death or non-fatal MI (i.e. excluding stroke) was 1.3% in an older (age ≥ 50 years) but lower risk CKD population without either diabetes or pre-existing coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par171">ATTACK is a pragmatic study and the estimated event rate of 2% assumes that the trial participants will be rather more representative of the real-world CKD population than a very highly selected group of younger and fitter patients that one might expect to see in a more demanding placebo-controlled study involving multiple visits and additional tests.</p>
                  <p id="Par172">As the event rate will be highly dependent upon the age and CKD severity of patients recruited, the age distribution and CKD stage of participants will be closely monitored during the first phase of the pilot in advance of the formal estimation of the control event rate, which will take place during the second phase. This will allow time to titrate the number of practices according to the recruitment rate per practice and top up our practice numbers in anticipation of a lower event rate, and to focus recruitment on more severe CKD, thereby enriching the ATTACK population with people at higher risk, should the trial population be younger than expected.</p>

                <title>Health economic analysis</title>
                <p id="Par209">Economic analysis will follow the methods and “reference case” recommended by NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Modelling will be used to estimate the net effect of aspirin prescribing on healthcare costs and quality-adjusted survival over a lifetime horizon, using trial data to estimate effects on vascular and bleeding risks, cancer incidence, CKD progression and mortality. Trial data will also be used to estimate health-related quality of life and healthcare costs for the population and associated with adverse events.</p>
                <p id="Par210">Costs will be estimated using individual-level linked HES/GP data, supplemented where necessary with information from the patient questionnaire. Costs will be estimated for services potentially affected by aspirin use, including prescriptions (aspirin, gastroprotective and other related drugs); primary care consultations; unplanned admissions for bleeds and vascular events, with related follow-up (e.g. revascularisations); renal replacement therapy following CKD progression.</p>
                <p id="Par211">Unit costs for services will be obtained from standard national sources: NHS Reference Costs for admissions and other hospital services; Personal Social Services Research Unit estimates for primary care and community services; and British National Formulary/Drug Tariff for drug prices.</p>
                <p id="Par212">Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) will be estimated using data on survival and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. EQ-5D-5L scores (“utilities”) will be calculated using a UK general population value set, as recommended by NICE at the time of analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Costs and QALYs will be discounted at NICE recommended rates (currently 3.5% per year for both).</p>
                <p id="Par213">The model structure, parameter sources and methods of analysis will be specified in a detailed economic protocol paper, informed by a review of high-quality CKD and CVD prevention models. We expect to use an individual-level discrete-event simulation approach to reflect the multiple, competing risks of vascular, haemorrhagic and other related events in this population over a lifetime horizon, taking advantage of the large pragmatic trial dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Distributions of baseline characteristics and risk factors will be estimated from trial data. Control arm data will be used to characterise event rates under usual care: e.g. using Cox proportional hazards predictive equations for CVD events and CKD progression; and parametric survival models (e.g. Gompertz) for all-cause survival (pre- and post-event, and by CKD stage or severity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Relative treatment effects will be taken from the main trial analyses described above under "<xref rid="Sec47" ref-type="sec">Statistical methods</xref>" (Cox proportional hazards or competing hazards regressions). The impact of events on patients’ quality of life (EQ-5D-5L utility scores) and NHS costs will be estimated from trial data by an appropriate regression approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. If an effect on cancer incidence is found, this will be included in the economic model, although we may need to source background risk, cost and utility parameters for this outcome from the literature.</p>
                <p id="Par214">Uncertainty over model results will be explored through sensitivity analysis. Deterministic analysis will be used to investigate the sensitivity of results to input parameters and key modelling assumptions. Probabilistic analysis will be used to assess the extent and impact of uncertainty over model inputs. Results will be stratified by pre-defined subgroups and CVD risk.</p>
                <p id="Par215">Validity of the model will be assessed by a Health Economist not involved in its development. This will include tests of internal validity: checks that input parameters match specified sources and inspection of coding (white box validation), stress testing of model behaviour (black box validation) and comparison of modelled event rates during the trial follow-up period with trial observations. External validity will be assessed by comparison of intermediate model results (event rates) with relevant estimates from the literature (identified by systematic review).</p>

                <p id="Par216">The Sponsor of the trial is the University of Southampton. ATTACK is managed from a central Trial Coordinating Centre based at the University of Nottingham. The Southampton CTU will support all statistical processes, including ongoing central statistical monitoring and preparation of open and closed trial reports, randomisation design, set-up and support.</p>
                <p id="Par217">A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) provides overall supervision on behalf of the Sponsor and Funder and ensures that the project is conducted to the rigorous standards set out in the Department of Health’s Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The Chair and members have been appointed by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme Director according to standard procedures. TSC meetings will have a minimum of 75% majority of independent members, including the Chair. Details of the terms of reference for the TSC are available on request from the ATTACK trial office.</p>
                <p id="Par218">A Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will monitor unblinded comparative data, supplied in strict confidence, and make recommendations to the TSC on whether there are any ethical or safety reasons why the trial should not continue, ensuring that the safety, rights and well-being of the trial participants are paramount. The DMEC comprises a statistician and two clinicians with expertise in the clinical area. All members are independent and have been appointed by the NIHR HTA Programme Director according to standard procedures. Details of the terms of reference for the DMEC are available on request from the ATTACK trial office.</p>

                <title>Data monitoring</title>
                <p id="Par219">Safety will be closely assessed throughout the trial. The absolute and relative risks of major bleeding will be examined by the DMEC and compared with those expected from the literature. All-cause mortality and the primary event rate will also be studied in order to determine net benefit, i.e. benefits minus harms. Aspirin use requires a consideration of the balance of risk vs. benefit in all populations. The DMEC will recommend termination of the trial if, in their view, the randomised comparisons provided have proven beyond reasonable doubt that the level of harm is unacceptable; or the use of aspirin is clearly contraindicated (or clearly indicated) in terms of the net effects. Clinical judgement will be required in interpreting the results of interim analyses and reaching recommendations. The DMEC will consider whether the evidence meets standards for treatment recommendations and practice guidelines, mindful that less evidence should be required to stop the trial for harm than benefit given the primacy of patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The absolute number of major bleeding events during ATTACK is likely to be low, and therefore, the confidence levels around any estimates of absolute and relative risk will be initially wide but narrow throughout the course of the trial. Hazard ratios may be unstable and drift over time into marginal levels of significance. Multiple “looks” at the data may give rise to a transient “signal” of benefit or harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Therefore, criteria of proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely, but in general, a difference of at least three standard deviations in an interim analysis of a major endpoint would be needed to justify halting, or modifying, such a study prematurely, especially for a comparison based on relatively few events (&lt; 100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par220">There are other instances where the DMEC may consider it advisable to advise termination of the study: flaws in design or conduct of the study come to light; or external new information on the treatment becomes available; or resources are inadequate to complete the trial.</p>

Additional objectives are to finalise major event assessment procedures, monitor safety and assess fidelity to allocated group and patient withdrawal rates.

This early review will be based on unadjudicated data due to the anticipated delay in receiving HES data. If the DMEC have concerns that fall short of “beyond reasonable doubt” on the basis of the unadjudicated data they will also have the option to halt the trial pending a process of formal adjudication.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par253">CKD affects at least 12% of adults and is a powerful risk factor for CVD. Evidence on new approaches to prevent CVD in CKD is urgently required.</p>
              <p id="Par254">There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use or avoidance of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in CKD as data on the use of antiplatelet agents in the specific setting of primary prevention in CKD are limited. The literature suggests that the efficacy of aspirin in CVD prevention is at least as great in people with CKD as the general population but the risks may also be greater, and so uncertainty remains about the net balance of benefit and risk. In 2014, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made a research recommendation for a definitive trial of aspirin for primary prevention of CVD in people with CKD.</p>
              <p id="Par255">In the UK, it has been estimated that more than 3 million people with CKD and no pre-existing CVD are not prescribed aspirin and around one million are receiving aspirin in the absence of definitive evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The results of this trial, whether positive or negative, will therefore be directly and immediately applicable to very large numbers of patients. ATTACK is the first definitive trial of aspirin as primary CVD prevention in CKD patients. The open design and pragmatic approach to bleeding prophylaxis and low platelet counts mean that the results will accurately reflect the real-world application of aspirin prophylaxis in the UK and hence will be of great interest to clinicians, guideline groups and policy-makers, in the UK and globally, particularly given the high and rising prevalence of CKD. The low cost of aspirin means that a positive result would also be of relevance to low- and middle-income countries and the impact not diluted in countries such as the USA by issues around income or insurance status.</p>

              <p id="Par256">The current approved version of the Protocol is version 4.0, dated 24th September 2021. The first patient consented on 26th February 2019. The trial was paused as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 and restarted, with a suite of modifications designed to render the study fully Covid-secure in March 2021.
