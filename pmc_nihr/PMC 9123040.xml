                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The purpose was to compare two flexible regimens of intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) with fixed dosing every 8Â weeks, beyond the first year of treatment, in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). VIOLET was a 100-week, randomized, Phase IIIb, non-inferiority study in patients with center-involving DME previously treated with IVT-AFL forââ¥â1Â year according to the European label.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Patients received an initial dose of IVT-AFL at study baseline and were randomlyÂ assigned (1:1:1) to treat-and-extendÂ (T&amp;E), pro re nata (PRN), or fixed regimens. The primary endpoint was mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline (randomization) to Week 52.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par7">Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy and the leading cause of visual impairment in people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DME prevalence is predicted to increase over time due to rising rates of diabetes, an aging population and the increased life expectancy of those with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. First-line treatment for the management of DME is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, such as intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) and ranibizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The VIVID-DME (Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Vision Impairment Due to DME) and VISTA-DME (Study of Intravitreal Aflibercept Injection in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema) Phase III studies showed that treatment with IVT-AFL fixed dosing every 4 or 8 weeks, following five initial monthly doses, was associated with significant improvements in functional outcomes compared with laser treatment, and outcomes were maintained over 3 years in patients with DME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As an alternative to fixed dosing, two flexible treatment strategies are available for the administration of IVT-AFL: treat-and-extend (T&amp;E) and as-needed pro re nata (PRN) regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The aim of flexible management of patients with DME is to reduce the treatment burden associated with anti-VEGF therapy, while maintaining visual acuity gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. T&amp;E involves gradual extension of the treatment interval based on maintenance of functional and anatomical stability, and shortening of the treatment interval if deterioration is observed. This approach reduces the frequency of clinic visits and removes the requirement for monitoring between injections, making the disease more manageable for the patient and physician. PRN involves treatment on an as-needed basis, with regular monthly visits being required for monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Availability of a choice of dosing regimens means that the physician and patient can select the treatment option that best suits individual needs and addresses the burden of treatment. However, there is a lack of data regarding the best regimen to optimize functional and anatomical outcomes with long-term IVT-AFL treatment in patients with DME. The aim of the VIOLET study was to assess whether IVT-AFL administered according to two different flexible dosing regimens provided similar efficacy and safety to fixed dosing every 8Â weeks (q8w) in patients with DME who had already completed 1Â year of IVT-AFL treatment. Here, we report the 52- and 100-week outcomes from the VIOLET study.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par10">VIOLET was a 100-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, Phase IIIb, non-inferiority study that investigated whether IVT-AFL administered according to two different flexible-dosing regimens (T&amp;E and PRN) provided similar efficacy and safety to fixed-dosing q8w in patients with DME who had already completedââ¥â1Â year of IVT-AFL treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par11">The study was conducted at 64 sites in Europe and Canada from November 2016 to September 2019 andÂ in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines E6: Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol and statistical analysis plan can be accessed at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02818998). The protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site (see Supplementary Material for full details). All patients provided written informed consent.</p>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Study Design</title>
                <p id="Par12">Patients enrolled in the VIOLET study had received treatment with IVT-AFL 2Â mg for at least 1 year, initiated with five monthly injections, followed by treatment q8w until enrollment (one missed or delayed q8w dose was permissible) (Fig. S1). Patients were enrolled from either the AQUA study (NCT02581995; an open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate vision-related quality of life in patients who received five initial monthly injections of IVT-AFL 2Â mg, followed by treatment q8w until Week 52) or from outside the AQUA study, if they fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Details of the AQUA study are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par13">In the VIOLET study, if all data needed for enrollment were available, the screening and baseline visits could take place on the same day. In such cases, procedures scheduled for both visits were conducted only once. Randomization (1:1:1) was conducted at Week 0 (baseline) and was stratified according to whether patients had achieved aââ¥â10-letter gain in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS]) from the start of IVT-AFL treatment (â¥â1Â year before baseline).</p>
                <p id="Par14">Patients were randomlyÂ assigned to treatment with IVT-AFL according to a fixed-dose, PRN, or T&amp;E regimen, as detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Secondary endpoints were the mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 100, mean change in central retinal thickness (CRT) from baseline to Weeks 52 and 100, and the proportion of patients with BCVA gains ofââ¥â10 orââ¥â15 ETDRS letters (two or three Snellen lines, respectively) and losses ofââ¥â30 ETDRS letters (six Snellen lines) from baseline to Weeks 52 and 100.

                <p id="Par17">A sample size of 135 evaluable patients per treatment group was planned. Assuming an equal mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 52 in the treatment groups, a standard deviation (SD) of 9, 11, and 11 ETDRS letters for the mean BCVA change from baseline to Week 52 in the fixed, T&amp;E, and PRN groups, respectively, and a family-wise error rate alpha of 2.5% (one-sided tests), this sample size provided power of 90% to demonstrate non-inferiority at a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters for either T&amp;E versus fixed regimens, or for the comparison of the PRN versus fixed regimens at a significance level of 2.5% (one-sided test). The expected dropout rate was estimated to be 17% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; thus, approximately 490 patients were planned to be randomized (the final number of patients was lower; see Supplementary Material for details). The primary analysis was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline BCVA measurement as covariate and the treatment regimen and stratum (10-letter gain from start of IVT-AFL treatment [yes/no]) as fixed factors. The Hochberg procedure was used to control the overall type-1 error of 2.5% (one-sided tests) for the two non-inferiority tests. The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized patients who received the study drug and had a baseline BCVA assessment and at least one post-baseline BCVA assessment; the primary statistical analysis was performed on the FAS. The primary method for replacing missing values for all efficacy analyses was last observation carried forward. Secondary endpoints were analyzed descriptively, including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. Statistical evaluation was performed using Statistical Analysis Software v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>

              <p id="Par27">The VIOLET study showed that, in patients who had already received at least 1Â year of IVT-AFL treatment for DME under the guidance of the European label, both flexible IVT-AFL treatment regimens (T&amp;E and PRN) achieved a non-inferior outcome in mean BCVA change compared with fixed dosing (IVT-AFL 2Â mg q8w) at Week 52 (primary endpoint) and Week 100. No clinically relevant differences were observed between the IVT-AFL fixed and T&amp;E groups, or between the fixed and PRN groups, for the changes in BCVA letter score at Week 52 and Week 100. Differences in CRT changes between treatment groups were not clinically meaningful. Of the three regimens investigated, a reduced treatment burden was observed in the T&amp;E group, which received the lowest number of injections. Furthermore, T&amp;E dosing was associated with a reduced mean number of clinic visits.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Most patients in the VIOLET study had participated in the AQUA study and, in that study, achieved a mean gain in BCVA ofâ+â10 letters after 1Â year of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; therefore, no substantial improvements were expected during the VIOLET study. Improvements in BCVA and CRT achieved in the year prior to enrollment in VIOLET were maintained over the second and third years of treatment with either a fixed, T&amp;E, or PRN dosing regimen. Furthermore, late visual gain was observed in 2â3% of patients who gainedââ¥â15 letters in the second and third years of treatment in this study. Thus, unlike neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), where treatment delays of as little as 6Â weeks impact functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the exact timing of treatment is less critical in DME. Indeed, functionally driven treatment is likely to work well, and this helps to explain why, in contrast to nAMD, PRN and T&amp;E work similarly well regarding functional outcomes. In this study, in addition to a mean 10-letter gain with IVT-AFL treatment prior to randomization, more than 20% of patients with DME gainedââ¥â5 letters in the second year of treatment with IVT-AFL. Most longer-term studies of anti-VEGF agents report change from baseline rather than change beyond Year 1; however, fluid persisting over 2Â years is not a rare or atypical finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Even if a complete response to treatment is not achieved in the first year, treatment continuation will not only prevent further visual deterioration, but may result in a valuable late functional gain in a relevant proportion of patients. Identification of baseline factors associated with outcomes in DME may help to inform physicians regarding treatment expectations and support identification of patients who may be late responders. This has previously been investigated at 12Â months in patients treated with intravitreal ranibizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and requires further research in patients treated with IVT-AFL.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Although little is known regarding the dynamics of DRSS changes due to anti-VEGF therapy in the long term, most of the improvement in DRSS was achieved prior to the study during the first 12Â months of treatment (during which 20.5% and 3.4% of patients had aââ¥â2- andââ¥â3-step DRSS improvement, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), which is consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The present study provides evidence that proportions of change in DRSS remain stable for a further 2Â years following the first year of treatment with IVT-AFL.</p>
              <p id="Par30">As patients with DME are usually younger than those with nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], long-term treatment is often required. Thus, the availability of easy-to-manage and flexible treatment strategies that meet individual patient needs are important. The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) has contributed to substantial advances in the relative benefits of anti-VEGF agents as the first-line therapy for eyes with visual impairment due to DME. Protocol I, the first study of an anti-VEGF agent, ranibizumab PRN (compared with non-anti-VEGF treatment), demonstrated 8â9 letter gains after 1Â year of treatment, with improvements being maintained up to 5Â years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It became apparent that fewer injections were needed after the first year of treatment, and the majority of patients did not receive anti-VEGF injections during the fifth year of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Protocol T, which compared ranibizumab 0.3Â mg with IVT-AFL and bevacizumab (using the same regimen, with a modified PRN protocol based on vision and OCT findings), demonstrated that IVT-AFL was more effective at improving vision in patients with worse levels of visual acuity (â¤â65 letters) after 1 and 2Â years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Beyond Year 2 to the end of Year 5, two-thirds of study eyes received at least one anti-VEGF injection (median four injections in 3Â years; interquartile range 0â12); visual acuity was improved from baseline after 5Â years of treatment, driven by gains in Year 1 and 2, as visual acuity decreased in Years 3â5 compared with the end of Year 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Both Protocol T and Protocol I assessed the role of deferred laser photocoagulation within the management of patients with DME, but neither were designed to compare different anti-VEGF treatment regimens. Thus, VIOLET adds to this evidence base by evaluating three different treatment regimens with a single anti-VEGF agent.</p>
              <p id="Par31">The VIOLET study explored the use of flexible-dosing IVT-AFL regimens, allowing physicians to adopt the optimal treatment plan based on individual patient needs and clinical practice requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The PRN regimen included monthly visits, which may have anÂ impact on adherence in real-world clinical practice due to the frequency of visits and increased burden for patients and physicians due to clinic constraints. Under T&amp;E, treatment intensity is adapted to individual needs, which is more readily accepted and more likely to be adhered to by patients. Treatment is administered at every visit under a T&amp;E protocol, which helps to plan clinic capacity. Furthermore, as the patient knows that they will be treated at every visit, they are prepared to receive an injection, and any uncertainty about treatment is eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this clinical trial setting, the number of injections and subsequent functional outcomes were similar with PRN and T&amp;E dosing. However, the burden of treatment in terms of clinic visits differed, with a notably higher number of visits in the PRN group (25.0 compared with 16.1 [fixed] and 13.3 [T&amp;E] visits). This was due to the nature of the PRN regimen, whereby patients were required to attend the clinic monthly, but did not receive an injection at every visit. Given the flexible nature of the proactive, individualized T&amp;E regimen, 40.8% of patients achieved a treatment interval ofââ¥â12Â weeks, compared with 32.0% of patients receiving PRN IVT-AFL (and no patients receiving fixed dosing). In real-world clinical practice, it is likely that reduced clinic visits may have a positive impact on treatment adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">Regarding study strengths, we investigated the direct comparison of three IVT-AFL regimens, including T&amp;E dosing, from the second year of treatment when physicians are often facing decisions regarding choice of management strategy. Furthermore, this was a long-term study with a large sample size. The safety profile of IVT-AFL for the treatment of DME in this study was consistent with results from prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Limitations include that the results refer to a largely White population and that two-thirds of patients had a glycated hemoglobin value below 8% at baseline, indicating a potential selection bias toward diabetes treatment-compliant patients. In addition, at baseline, most patients had mild-to-moderate diabetic retinopathy, thus limiting the interpretation of DRSS responses.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par33">Results from the VIOLET study demonstrate that, in patients who received at least 1Â year of IVT-AFL treatment for DME under the guidance of the European label, both flexible IVT-AFL treatment regimens (T&amp;E and PRN) resulted in similar functional outcomes to fixed dosing (IVT-AFL 2Â mg q8w) in the second and third years of treatment, with the T&amp;E group requiring the lowest number of injections and clinic visits. Findings highlight the range of flexible-dosing regimens available with IVT-AFL, allowing physicians to adopt the optimal treatment plan based on individual patient needs and clinical practice requirements.</p>
