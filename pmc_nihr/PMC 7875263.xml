                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with placebo in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease and angina despite anti-anginal therapy.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing PCI with placebo. A Markov model was used to measure incremental cost-effectiveness, in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, over 12 months. Health utility weights were estimated using responses to the EuroQol 5-level questionnaire, from the Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable angina trial and UK preference weights. Costs of procedures and follow-up consultations were derived from Healthcare Resource Group reference costs and drug costs from the National Health Service (NHS) drug tariff. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of results to parameter uncertainty. Scenario analyses were performed to test the effect on results of reduced pharmaceutical costs in patients undergoing PCI, and the effect of patients crossing over from placebo to PCI due to refractory angina within 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>200 adult patients with stable angina and angiographically severe single-vessel coronary artery disease on anti-anginal therapy.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>At recruitment, patients received 6 weeks of optimisation of medical therapy for angina after which they were randomised to PCI or a placebo procedure.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The estimated ICER is Â£90 218/QALY gained when using PCI compared with placebo in patients receiving medical treatment for angina due to single-vessel coronary artery disease. Results were robust under sensitivity analyses.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The ICER for PCI compared with placebo, in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease and angina on anti-anginal medication, exceeds the threshold of Â£30â€‰000 used by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence when undertaking health technology assessment for the NHS context.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Despite a substantial fall in age-adjusted mortality rates, the prevalence of coronary heart disease has only decreased minimally over the last 30 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Coronary heart disease represents a major burden to the UK population with an estimated over 2 million people living with the disease and leading to approximately half a million inpatient episodes per year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The cost of treating coronary heart disease in the UK is substantial. Between 1991 and 2014, prescriptions for all cardiovascular diseases increased by 78%, and although the number of coronary artery bypass operations has diminished since a peak in the 1990s, the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures has increased sevenfold over the same time.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>According to the National Reference Costs collection, a total of 76â€‰973 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) EY40 and EY41, were carried out by the National Health Service (NHS) in 2017â€“2018 and these 55â€‰173 were coded as standard (non-complex) procedures at a total cost of Â£150â€‰347â€‰171.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
              <p>Published in 2017, the landmark Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable angina (ORBITA) Study was the first trial to investigate the efficacy of PCI for symptom relief of stable angina in a double blind, placebo-controlled study. The trial randomised 200 patients with angina due to stable single-vessel coronary heart disease to PCI or a placebo procedure with a primary endpoint of exercise time at 6 weeks of follow-up. The trial, which was more than adequately powered, showed that PCI when added to optimal medical therapy had no significant effect on the primary endpoint.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Additionally, the study showed small, but not statistically significant, placebo-controlled differences in secondary endpoints of angina frequency and health-related quality of life. Economic evaluation remains critically important in situations where clinical effectiveness of two interventions is similar but costs differ.</p>
              <p>The ORBITA Study remains the only blinded, randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of PCI in patients with angina and offers a unique opportunity to undertake an economic evaluation of this form of therapy.</p>
              <p>The aim of this paper is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCI compared with placebo when added to optimal medical therapy in patients with angina due to severe, single-vessel coronary artery stenosis. Investing scarce resources for therapies that are not cost-effective reduces the aggregate of health in populations, as alternatives that deliver more health for the money are displaced.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>We conducted an economic evaluation, in the form of a cost-utility analysis, using data from the ORBITA trial, to assess the cost-effectiveness of PCI in patients with stable, single-vessel coronary disease, in the context of the NHS of England.</p>
              <p>Cost-utility analyses use health utility as the measure of health outcome. Health utility is a generic measure of a personâ€™s overall well-being, and takes a value between 1, full health, and 0, equivalent to being dead. It is measured using validated tools such as the EuroQol five-dimension quality of life instrument,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and enables the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). QALYs are calculated by multiplying the health utility of a health state by the length of time a person experiences that health state and are therefore superior to endpoints such as acute events or life expectancy, because they account for both length and quality of life. This is particularly important for chronic conditions, where the main treatment goal may be symptom relief.</p>
              <p>We modelled costs and QALYs arising from the treatment effects of the ORBITA Study, extrapolated to 12 months, and present the results as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as the cost per QALY gained.</p>
              <p>Analyses were conducted using R statistical software (V.3.4.2) in the R Studio environment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> Economic modelling was conducted using the <italic>heemod</italic> package in R.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>

                <title>Model structure</title>
                <p>For our analyses, we used a Markov model. Markov models include health states, which patients transition through over time.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Patients have probabilities of moving during each cycle. Cycle length and the total number of cycles are determined by the disease and treatment trajectory. Our model uses weekly cycles, for 52 weeks. Each health state in a model has health outcomes and costs attached, and patients accrue these as they move through the model.</p>
                <p>For chronic diseases, Markov models have advantages over other methods such as decision trees, as they enable patients to remain in one state over multiple cycles. Decision trees, by contrast, can become unwieldy because new branches may be needed for each chance of moving between health states.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>For our model of treatment for stable single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), all patients enter the model with stable coronary disease and are treated with either medical therapy and placebo intervention, or medical therapy and PCI with stent implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The model uses data from the ORBITA trial, and models extrapolated costs and health outcomes to 12 months. It enables the comparison of costs and health outcomes for these patients under different treatment scenarios.</p>

                <p>We did not include death or myocardial infarction in the model, because previous randomised trials comparing medical therapy and PCI have shown no difference in the risk of these events in patients with stable CAD.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>
                <p>We used a time frame of 1â€‰year because, in previous open-label clinical trials comparing PCI with medical therapy for stable CAD, this is when a gain in quality of life from PCI is most pronounced. For example, in the COURAGE trial, quality of life had diverged between the randomised groups after 4 weeks with the difference sustained at 12 months before converging and becoming not clinically significant at 24 months.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>

                <title>Quality of life</title>
                <p>We used the trial data for estimates of quality of life, based on all available measures of EuroQol 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) at baseline and at completion of follow-up at 6 weeks after randomisation according to the randomised allocation (intention to treat). These are shown as health utility weights derived from the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires using the value set for the UK population, derived by Devlin <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> in the model. In the ORBITA trial, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire was administered to patients at three time points: enrolment, pre-randomisation and follow-up. This questionnaire has been validated for use as a health utility measure, for the purposes of economic evaluation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The combination of responses to the five questions in the EQ-5D-5L is used to generate a health utility score between 0 and 1.</p>
                <p>For the model, we used the mean health utility weight across all patients at enrolment for the CAD state and the mean health utility weight in each group, at completion of follow-up, for each of the treatment health states. We assumed that patients in these health states remained unchanged to 12 months after randomisation.

                <p>When the Markov model is run, the costs and health outcomes arising from the patientâ€™s transition through the health states are summed to estimate the total costs and health outcomes for each treatment: optimal medical therapy plus PCI or optimal medical therapy plus placebo. Results are presented as an ICER. ICERs are simple ratios dividing the change in costs and the change in health outcomes resulting from an investment in a new service or health technology, in this case the use of PCI. ICERs show the additional costs required to achieve one additional unit of health benefit, one QALY, and are expressed as the cost per QALY gained.</p>
                <p>ICERs are assessed against a threshold for cost-effectiveness. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) currently uses a threshold of Â£20â€‰000â€“Â£30â€‰000 per QALY gained, with an accepted upper limit of Â£30 000, which we used for our analyses.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>

                <title>Probabilistic sensitivity analysis</title>
                <p>To test the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty in parameter estimates, we conducted probabilistic sensitivity analyses.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For each parameter where there was uncertainty in the mean, we created a distribution around our baseline estimate.</p>
                <p>We modelled uncertainty in the costs of pharmaceuticals by varying the percentages of people prescribed each drug type, using beta distributions. We did not vary the dosages as we felt this might create unrealistic combinations of prescriptions and dosages which would not reflect reality. Conventionally, gamma distributions are used for healthcare costs, due to their skewed shape which allows for a small number of patients to incur very high costs. However, we did not feel that a gamma distribution would be appropriate for pharmaceutical costs, because there is likely to be little variation across patients. NHS costs for pharmaceuticals are low and most people follow similar treatment regimes.</p>
                <p>We used a normal distribution to model uncertainty in the estimates of health utility, using the mean and SE from the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>For the costs of the PCI procedure, we used only the lowest bracket of HRG EY41. This relates to the least complex patients with the fewest comorbidities. The ORBITA patients were not complex, due to design and inclusion criteria of the study, so we did not consider it appropriate to model higher procedure costs in this analysis. Similarly, we did not model any uncertainty in the cost of cardiology outpatient visits.</p>
                <p>We took 5000 random samples from the distributions for each relevant parameter, generating 5000 ICERs. We calculated the probability of cost-effectiveness by calculating the proportion of the simulated ICERs that fall below the cost-effectiveness threshold of Â£30â€‰000 per QALY gained.</p>

The results show an increase in costs for the PCI group compared with the placebo group, which is accompanied by only a very small health gain of 18 QALYs per 1000 patients. The estimated cost-effectiveness ratio is Â£90â€‰218 per QALY gained when using PCI compared with placebo in addition to medical therapy, in this group of patients. This is far higher than the Â£30â€‰000 threshold used by NICE, and therefore, in these patients, use of PCI would not be considered cost-effective.</p>

It is clear from the plot that fewer blue points fall under the Â£30â€‰000 threshold for cost-effectiveness than fall above it.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study describes the cost-effectiveness of PCI compared with placebo when added to optimal medical therapy, using data derived from the only double blind, randomised trial of PCI in patients with stable single-vessel CAD.</p>
              <p>There are three important findings. First, the baseline analysis shows, with a high level of certainty, that PCI for angina relief, in patients with single-vessel coronary disease on anti-anginals, requires a cost per extra QALY that exceeds thresholds typically used for cost-effectiveness in the NHS. Second, even if PCI eliminated the need for anti-anginal therapy, this has minimal effect on cost-effectiveness. Finally, even if placebo patients were to present with symptoms requiring PCI further down the line, it would require this to happen in more than 80% of patients for the placebo arm to become less cost-effective than the PCI arm. These results appear to be driven by the relatively small difference in quality of life improvements in the PCI group, compared with placebo.</p>
              <p>Our baseline analysis generated an ICER of Â£90â€‰218 per QALY gained when comparing PCI with placebo, and this exceeds the threshold of Â£30â€‰000 often used by NICE when considering the cost-effectiveness of treatments. Supporting the baseline estimate, the probabilistic analysis demonstrates a very high level of certainty in the model outcomes, with less than 12% of simulations favouring routine use of PCI in this patient group. There has been vigorous debate about this threshold recently. Research from the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York, focusing on opportunity cost, or what is foregone when investment in a new technology or service displaces current services, suggests that the threshold should be about Â£13â€‰000 per QALY gained.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21â€“23</xref> This means that investments in new services with ICERs above Â£13â€‰000 per QALY gained would result in overall harm to NHS patients, as resources would be drawn away from services which would generate more QALYs for the same investment.</p>
              <p>These findings support, on a cost-effectiveness basis, the strategy of anti-anginal medication as first line, as advised by international guidelines.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> In clinical practice, non-PCI patients might need additional visits to maintain anti-anginal therapy levels similar to ORBITA. However, even when notional costs of such additional visits are added, the magnitude of the difference between the ICER and the cost-effectiveness threshold suggests that the non-PCI approach remains economically advantageous.</p>
              <p>The ORBITA Study protocol set out to continue medical therapy unchanged until completion of clinical follow-up at 6 weeks following randomisation. To account for the possibility that patients treated with PCI would require less anti-anginal therapy over a longer horizon, we repeated the analysis with a scenario where the costs of all anti-anginal drugs were withdrawn in the PCI group but continued in the placebo group. Because drugs used to treat angina are relatively cheap, this had a minimal effect on the ICER for PCI, which was reduced to Â£85â€‰576 per QALY.</p>
              <p>Another important consideration is that the relatively short 6-week clinical follow-up of the ORBITA Study may have masked longer term clinical benefits of PCI over medical therapy. One specific concern is that, over a longer horizon, patients may experience more angina symptoms than detected at 6 weeks, and that the placebo effect may attenuate over time. To allow for this in our economic evaluation, we explored the proportion of patients that would need to return requiring PCI for refractory symptoms of angina within 12 months, despite optimal medical therapy, before it would be cost-effective to provide routine PCI in all patients. We found that more than 80% of patients would need to return for PCI within 12 months, before it became cost-effective to provide PCI to all patients, at the outset. This rate of crossover seems unlikely based on experience from previous randomised comparisons of PCI and medical therapy for stable CAD. For example, in the COURAGE trial, over 4.6 years of follow-up additional revascularisation occurred in 32.6% of medically treated patients compared with 21.1% of those randomised to PCI.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the ORBITA trial itself, all patients had already been referred for clinical PCI, and therefore after completing their participation in the study, it was assumed that all placebo patients would then go forward for clinical PCI, and indeed most did so. This was not driven by the results of the trial because the results were not available at the time. In light of the lack of significant differences in the primary and secondary endpoints of the study related to angina, functional capacity, frequency of angina and quality of life at 6 weeks, there might be less bias towards PCI as a default treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>The ORBITA trial included only patients with stable single-vessel CAD, and therefore we cannot generalise the results to patients with more complex disease. It is possible that patients with multivessel disease, more symptoms or a higher ischaemic burden may have more to gain from PCI. The ORBITA 2 trial is currently underway, and is designed to investigate the placebo-controlled efficacy of PCI in a wider clinical population.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
                <p>We did not model variation in costs for PCI procedures, because we felt that this best reflected the nature of the procedures and patients included in the study. However, because we used the lowest relevant HRG tariff, this would bias the model in favour of PCI. Inclusion of higher costs would have shown PCI to be less cost-effective.</p>
                <p>We assumed that health states remained stable from the 6 weeksâ€™ follow-up to a horizon of 12 months, for the purpose of the analysis. Given that there was no difference between the groups for the key clinical endpoints in ORBITA at 6 weeks, we assumed that the effect of the intervention on quality of life was sustained over 12 months. Other factors that would affect quality of life over the longer horizon (for example other ill health) are likely to be randomly distributed between the groups and unlikely to have biased our findings.</p>
                <p>Our model was run for a 12-month period and did not include events such as death or myocardial infarction. As noted in the methods, we did not model these events because earlier trials have demonstrated no difference, in patients with stable disease, for the two treatments examined here.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref></p>
                <p>Similarly, we did not run the model over a longer horizon, because other research has shown that improvements in symptom relief and quality of life in this patient group are most pronounced in the short term.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We acknowledge, however, that the outcome of the model would be sensitive to more sustained improvements in symptoms and quality of life, even if these effects are relatively small in magnitude. Publication of the outcome of studies with longer term follow-up (such as the recently published ISCHEMIA trial<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) may help to inform models with a longer horizon. However, the open-label design of these trials leaves measures of health-related quality of life susceptible to bias that can only be controlled for in double blind, placebo-controlled studies, of which ORBITA remains the only trial of this kind at this point in time.</p>
                <p>We were only able to partially allow for the possible effects of withdrawal of anti-anginal therapy in patients following PCI. For example, we are unable to allow for a negative effect of continuing medical therapy (medication disutility), which is likely to be greater than zero.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The disutility attributable to continuation of anti-anginal medication is unknown but is likely to be a complex net effect of beneficial and adverse effects. Given that patients are advised to continue with other medications (including lipid-lowering and antiplatelet agents), the effect of any disutility of continued anti-anginal therapy on our conclusions is likely to be negligible. Additionally, we have observed that in â€˜real-worldâ€™ practice, anti-anginal drugs are often continued in patients following PCI, so our scenario analysis of withdrawal of all anti-anginal therapy in patients following PCI is also likely to be biased in favour of PCI.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p>
                <p>Our analysis is based specifically on costs relating to NHS England and cannot therefore be directly translated to other health systems. However, the costs of PCI are relatively low in the publicly funded NHS by comparison with privately funded healthcare systems. Our model is readily able to be adapted to accommodate costs incurred in different health systems.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our results show that for patients with stable single-vessel CAD and angina on medical therapy, there is a low probability that it is cost-effective to add PCI even in a healthcare system where PCI is relatively inexpensive. This conclusion is resistant to the possibility that PCI may lead to a reduction in downstream costs for anti-anginal drugs and cardiology outpatient visits and/or an increase in subsequent PCI procedures for refractory symptoms.</p>
