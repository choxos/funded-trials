                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Chronic pain is a common health problem that is not efficiently managed by standard analgesic treatments. There is evidence that treatment resistance may result from maladaptive brain changes in areas that are fundamental to the perception of pain. Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most prevalent causes of chronic pain and commonly associated with negative affect. Chronic knee osteoarthritis pain is also associated with altered right anterior insula functional connectivity. We posit that reversal of these brain circuit alterations may be critical to alleviate chronic pain and associated negative affect, and that this can be achieved through non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. Despite growing interest in non-invasive neuromodulation for pain relief and proven efficacy in depression, results in chronic pain are mixed with limited high-quality evidence for clinical and mechanistic efficacy. Limitations include patient heterogeneity, imprecision of target selection, uncertain blinding and protocols that may deliver pulses at subclinical efficacy.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We hence developed an optimised treatment protocol of connectivity-guided intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with accelerated delivery on four consecutive days (allowing 4 days within the same week as protocol variation) with five daily treatment sessions that will be piloted in a sham-controlled design in 45 participants with chronic knee pain. This pilot study protocol will assess feasibility, tolerability and explore mechanistic efficacy through serial functional/structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitative sensory testing.</p>

                  <p>This pilot trial has been approved by the Ethics Committee Cornwall and Plymouth.</p>
                  <p>Results of the pilot trial will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals, presented at research conferences and may be shared with participants and PPI/E advisors.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chronic pain is a major burden for society, economy, health systems and individuals. There is a lack of effective analgesic treatments in chronic pain with an urgent need for novel treatments. Maladaptive brain mechanisms are increasingly recognised as key contributors to the development and persistence of pain.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> A feature is the altered communication between brain areas that are involved in the processing of pain signals and the modulation of the associated pain perception, demonstrated by dysfunctional connectivity of the right anterior insula (rAI).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p>
              <p>These maladaptive functional brain network changes are thought (i) to drive the experience of chronic pain and central pain sensitisation, (ii) to be potentially reversible by non-invasive neuromodulation, and thus support the notion that interventions that normalise the brain’s (and in particular fronto-limbic) connectivity will also reverse central pain augmentation or associated affective experience.</p>
              <p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising tool to non-invasively and focally stimulate the brain through induction of small electrical currents. Choice of stimulation protocols are thought to determine excitatory or inhibitory local and downstream effects with acute and longer-term neuromodulatory effects on targeted brain circuits. The exact mechanism of acute neuromodulatory and neuroplastic effects and the substantial interindividual and intraindividual variability are poorly understood.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Clinical efficacy of rTMS is well-established for the treatment of major depression, approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence in the UK. In chronic pain, to date evidence for effective neuromodulation is limited to invasive protocols and selected indications.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is however considerable recent interest in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) trials in chronic pain yet results to date are mixed. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have described NIBS as having ‘poor or inconclusive’ analgesic effects across sites and pain disorders,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref> ‘minimally clinically relevant’,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to ‘promising’<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and ‘probable efficacy’ for either motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> There are major quality concerns with most studies considered poor<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> due to underpowered sample sizes, lack of blinding, inadequate randomisation or missing sham for comparisons. Moreover, there are uncertainties regarding the most effective brain stimulation site, type of stimulation, target population. Nevertheless, pain relief was frequently found to be &gt;30%<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> which encourages to seek further improvements and address limitations in order to fully assess and exploit the potential that this technology may hold for pain treatment.</p>
              <p>To address these shortcomings we chose to target the left DLPFC as a particularly promising yet relatively understudied target site for rTMS in chronic pain due to its strong modulatory influence on the rAI, a key hub in pain processing with known altered connectivity in chronic pain.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Stimulating the left DLPFC is expected to modulate the prefronto-insular pathway as a putative central pain modulatory effect. This pathway is also a key target in the clinically effective rTMS treatment of major depression suggesting a second putative beneficial effect through reduction of negative affect and related pain augmentation.</p>
              <p>For target selection, we chose resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) based effective connectivity to determine the coordinates within the anatomically defined left DLPFC that show the strongest effective connectivity to the rAI as in our previous work.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> In addition, recently accelerated, optimised TMS protocols were reported to be safe and similarly effective to standard rTMS using intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref> There are several advantages expected from iTBS protocols that are faster than standard rTMS and may have stronger neuroplasticity effects. Also, the multiple treatment blocks per day with 50 min intervals are expected to further enhance effectiveness and allow to deliver a higher cumulative weekly dose with the benefit of shorter overall treatment course.</p>
              <p>Motivated by the promising results of the optimised iTBS protocol in major depression, we translated and adapted the approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain, which, if effective, would greatly improve clinical interest in this technique both for cost and practical reasons. As study population we chose knee osteoarthritis (OA) as one of the most common causes of chronic musculoskeletal pain and to avoid potential heterogeneity from different pain aetiology. Based on the known comorbidity, we anticipate that the study population of moderate chronic knee OA pain will report higher negative affect than the general population which may further increase the likelihood of neuromodulatory efficacy at the chosen target site.</p>
              <p>This parallel, sham-controlled pilot study will investigate a 4-day (over 1 week) intense, imaging-guided iTBS protocol that is individually targeted within the left DLPFC to maximise the connectivity with the rAI. Study participants with moderately severe, chronic knee pain will undergo serial MRI, behavioural and quantitative sensory testing (QST) before and after the iTBS/sham intervention and online recording of patient-reported outcomes until week 18 to guide the protocol and sample size for future RCT interventions.</p>

Participants will be asked to attend for baseline assessments (visit 1) (ca. 2 hours including MRI, and psycho-physical assessment including brief experimental pain exposure) (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Then participants will undergo an intervention week with four visits (visit 2–5) lasting about half a day each. Each visit will consist of five blocks of iTBS or sham with inter-block interval of ~50 min during which participants will be offered refreshments and food in a comfortable waiting area before getting prepared for the next session. The sixth and final study visit is a repeat of the baseline visit, and will be scheduled within 18–72 hours of the last treatment session. This will be followed by online patient self-recording of pain and emotional outcomes up to 16 weeks.</p>

The blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) rsfMRI undergo EPI distortion correction, motion correction, slice timing correction, smoothing, denoising and high-pass filtering.

                <p>The study statistician will generate allocation by randomising blocks of participants, ensuring age and sex matching between arms. Block randomisation (block size 6) will be used and determined using online tools (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/randomize.htm" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/randomize.htm</ext-link>). Initially 30 subjects will be randomised with 3 subjects per group in each block. Given the recruitment rates and feasibility of recruiting all subjects within the time frame, the next subjects will be randomised similarly. However, if recruitment suggests a shortfall of subjects within the time frame the block allocation will be adjusted such that a higher rate of subjects are recruited to the treatment group such as to ensure sufficient numbers in that group. This is expected to be at most a small adjustment such that the block of 6 will still be sufficient to effectively mask assignment, for example, 4 into the treatment group and 2 into the sham group. The study coordinator (BM) will enrol and assign participants.</p>
                <p>Study participants will be blinded to the intervention allocation and participants will be asked whether they can guess the type of intervention as part of a TMS exist interview/questionnaire. The study team involved in delivering the intervention cannot be blinded, but the data analysis team will be blinded to which intervention was delivered. Participants will be unblinded if they were to experience adverse events.</p>

                <title>Adherence, tolerability, withdrawal and pausing of study trial</title>
                <p>Adherence in this study will be measured by participants’ attendance at study visits, completion of all study measures and procedures, and TMS treatments. We will also record the tolerability of 80% RMT and any necessary adjustments of %RMT and NIBS stimulation due to discomfort. Safety instructions also include not being intoxicated by alcohol or non-prescription drugs at any study visit, and any history of heavy binges of alcohol or intermittent hypnotic or benzodiazepine use in the 24 hours before a treatment session because of these behaviours would increase the risk of seizures or syncope with TMS.</p>
                <p>Participants who fail to comply with safety instructions can be withdrawn from the study at any time. Study withdrawal could be requested anytime by the participants.</p>
                <p>Tolerability of the accelerated protocol will be individually monitored in the first 10 participants with planned meeting of the study team with the independent medical safety advisor (RT) for go/no-go decision-making should the study retention exceed expected levels for rTMS studies or based on concerning individual feedback. Within the first 10 participants we did not observe withdrawal due to protocol non-compliance.</p>

                <title>Known side effects and discomfort</title>
                <p>The staff operating the TMS device (SH 3 years, DH 2 years) are trained and adhere to all safety instructions.</p>
                <p>As it directly influences activity of nerve cells, theoretically there is the risk of a seizure although the risk level is considered low. The cumulative number of TMS pulses is 36 000 which is substantially lower than the accelerated Stanford protocol and lower than the FDA approved protocol (48 000–72 000 for 4–6 weeks).</p>
                <p>Staff and participants will be wearing ear protectors because of the risk of tinnitus and hearing impairment from the loudness of the TMS.</p>
                <p>The majority of TMS treatments are very well tolerated, occasionally however a short-lasting headache can occur. Depending on an individual’s facial anatomy, facial nerves can be stimulated at the same time which would result in muscle twitches in the face; these however cease as the stimulation is stopped.</p>
                <p>Should a participant experience any side effects and find it too uncomfortable, the treatment session can be stopped immediately but where possible, adjustments will be made to ease discomfort. To reduce participants' discomfort on the first day of the session, the power was individually ramped to 80% RMT or lower depending on subjective tolerability.</p>
                <p>A standard operating procedure has been developed that defines the discontinuation of the trial intervention, referral to treatment as required and risk management of the most common serious side effect (seizure) and more common side effects like headache and dizziness.</p>

                <title>Safety assessment</title>
                <p>Despite the safety report on accelerated iTBS protocols, side effects and tolerability in a chronic pain population were unknown, hence the trial will be monitored with the intention to stop should a larger than expected number of side effects be reported or low compliance be found. Within the first 10 participants we did not record any serious side effects. Any safety-related termination decision would be taken by the medical safety advisor.</p>

                <title>Feedback from public and patient involvement: a lay interest group for clinical research</title>
                <p>Patients and healthy lay persons interested in clinical research were invited to give feedback on the study concept and separately the specific protocol. Participants of the first public and patient involvement (PPI) were positive about the possibility of a non-invasive treatment that may allow to replace medication. For the specific study protocol, PPI participants indicated that attending the TMS part with its up to 6 hours long visits for 4 days during a week would be a considerable burden for them, especially for those who suffer from pain-related partial disabilities. Other feedback criticised that this is only open for patients who are mobile, not actively working or on long term sick leave, and that a study of such dimension would need to include inconvenience allowances for participants. We hence included failure to recruit and protocol compliance in the feasibility and acceptability assessment.</p>
