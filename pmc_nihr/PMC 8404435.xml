                  <title>Main outcome measures</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome was the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the Oxford Knee Score (a disease-specific measure of function), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Quality of Life subscale, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, 5 dimension, 5 level version of Euroqol (EQ-5D-5L) and physical function assessed using the Figure of 8 Walk test, 30‚Äâs Chair Stand Test and Single Leg Stance.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>621 participants were randomised between March 2015 and January 2018. 309 were assigned to CORKA (Community Rehabilitation after Knee Arthroplasty) home-based rehabilitation, receiving a median five treatment sessions (IQR 4‚Äì7). 312 were assigned to usual care, receiving a median 4 sessions (IQR 2‚Äì6). The primary outcome, LLFDI function total score at 12 months, was collected for 279 participants (89%) in the home-based CORKA group and 287 participants (92%) in the usual care group. No clinically or statistically significant difference was found between the groups (intention-to-treat adjusted difference=0.49 points; 95% CI ‚àí0.89 to 1.88; p=0.48). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on any of the patient-reported or physical secondary outcome measures at 6 or 12 months.</p>
                  <p>There were 18 participants in the intervention group reporting a serious adverse event (5.8%), only one directly related to the intervention, all other adverse events recorded throughout the trial related to underlying chronic medical conditions.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The CORKA intervention was not superior to usual care. The trial detected no significant differences, clinical or statistical, between the two groups on either primary or secondary outcomes. CORKA offers an evaluation of an intervention utilising a different service delivery model for this patient group.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Knee arthroplasty (KA) operations in the UK continue to rise with the National Joint Registry reporting over 100‚Äâ000 in 2017 alone.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This is an increase of over 3% from 2010. The population receiving surgery is getting older, frailer and with more coexisting health conditions. Data from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have shown that most patients achieve a satisfactory outcome. However, between 10% and 15% are unsatisfied or report little or no improvement after surgery.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> We do not yet know how to identify these patients or target rehabilitation to improve their outcomes.</p>
              <p>Physiotherapy provision in the UK varies following discharge from hospital after KA but typically patients will continue to have rehabilitation needs to help restore muscle strength and endurance, range of motion, walking distance and performance of higher-level functional activities. Patients are commonly referred for further physiotherapy in an outpatient setting to assist with these issues. The timing of this referral varies, with some hospitals advocating immediate commencement of therapy after discharge from hospital and others waiting until the first postoperative review at around 6 weeks before considering referral. This typically involves between 4 and 6 sessions of physiotherapy in an outpatient clinic setting. Patients do not routinely receive occupational therapy input following knee arthroplasty surgery unless they are highlighted to have particular difficulties with their daily activities or have specific barriers to discharge home. Concern has been raised that many exercise programmes lack adequate intensity to enable optimal recovery.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Internationally, where much longer courses of physiotherapy are often provided, research has indicated that 12‚Äì18‚Äâhours of physiotherapy<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or a mean of 17 visits<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> may be needed to produce a benefit. These levels of care are substantially higher than those provided in the UK and, in the current economic climate, may be more than the National Health Service (NHS) can afford.</p>
              <p>Given the rising number of operations, the relatively limited therapy resources available, and the increasing age and frailty of patients receiving this surgery, it is important that rehabilitation resources are concentrated on those patients who need the most help to achieve a good outcome. Not all patients need postoperative outpatient physiotherapy and some will make a full recovery using self-directed rehabilitation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7‚Äì10</xref> Current rehabilitation strategies do not meet the needs of all patients, particularly those who are socially isolated, do not have easy access to transport, and are frail.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> It is thus pertinent to focus our resources on those who are most likely to be at risk of a poor outcome, least likely to be able to engage with a self-management approach, and able to benefit most from rehabilitation input To maximise access to therapy and to provide this within a similar cost envelope to current practice we designed an intervention to be delivered in the patients‚Äô homes utilising a workforce model that use rehabilitation assistants supported by qualified therapy staff, drawing on the success of this model in delivering therapy programmes such as the Otago falls prevention intervention.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>This trial was carried out to determine if a targeted home-based intervention for those at risk of poor outcome, delivered by a mix of qualified staff and rehabilitation assistants, offers superior outcomes in patient reported and physical function at 1‚Äâyear following KA compared with traditional outpatient physiotherapy.</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>The CORKA trial was a multicentre prospective, single-blinded, two-arm randomised controlled superiority trial with assessment for the clinical outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The study was carried out according to the published protocol.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from 14 NHS Trusts across England. Patients aged 55 years and over due to undergo knee arthroplasty were sent information concerning the trial prior to their preoperative assessment appointment. Those expressing interest were screened in the clinic using a screening tool developed for the trial. This aimed to identify patients at risk of a poorer outcome based on data collected as part of standard pre-operative assessment screening. The tool was developed using all data from the Knee Arthroplasty Trial dataset and further details of its development has been previously published.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The screening tool had a range of possible scores from 0 to 10, patients with a score of 5 or more were classified as being at increased risk of a poor outcome after 1‚Äâyear defined as an Oxford Knee Score (OKS) of 26 or less (<xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix A</xref>). The performance of the model was fair, as measured by its discrimination. Participants who were eligible were screened again post-operatively to confirm their eligibility and consent. All participants provided written informed consent. Exclusion criteria included any major perioperative complications, further surgery planned within the next 12 months and absolute contraindications to exercise. Screening was performed by research clinicians at the local sites, and screening logs recorded the reasons for ineligibility and why eligible patients declined to participate.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Randomisation took place on the third postoperative day, or on hospital discharge if earlier. Should any participant have experienced a severe medical perioperative event they would not be entered into the trial but continue with usual care as able. Participants were randomly allocated by a web-based randomisation system to either ‚Äòusual care‚Äô or ‚Äòhome-based rehabilitation programme‚Äô in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks of various sizes (sizes 2, 4 and 6 in a 1:2:1 ratio, that is on average there were twice as many blocks of size 4 than either size 2 or size 6) to prevent prediction of treatment allocation, and this was stratified by recruitment site. Once randomised, participants and those delivering the rehabilitation were aware of the treatment allocation due to the nature of the intervention. Those carrying out follow-up outcome measurements remained blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

                  <title>CORKA home-based intervention</title>
                  <p>The CORKA intervention started up to 4 weeks after surgery, with most participants seen within 2 weeks. In the period between surgery and the initial appointment participants continued with a home exercise programme given to them by ward physiotherapists in line with standard current practice.</p>
                  <p>The CORKA home-based intervention is a multicomponent rehabilitation programme developed in collaboration with clinicians and patients; it has been described in detail in a previous publication.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It consisted of an initial assessment appointment and up to six follow-up sessions. Its aim was to improve the function and participation in activities of participants at risk of a poor outcome after surgery. The primary component of the rehabilitation programme was an individually adapted exercise package conducted in participants‚Äô own homes. During the participants‚Äô initial assessment, the physiotherapist focused on tasks that were identified as being problematic. The exercise programme was then tailored to the individuals‚Äô needs and goals. If an exercise was felt to be unsafe for any particular participant, therapists could omit it and substitute with an additional exercise from the package; or use a more stable starting position. Additional components consisted of functional task practice, adherence approaches such as utilisation of techniques such as goal setting and exercise dairies. If required, they were provided with appropriate aids and equipment,</p>
                  <p>The physiotherapist undertook the initial assessment and prescription of the exercise programme, observed by the rehabilitation assistant. For future sessions, the rehabilitation assistant continued the programme and modified as required using treatment algorithms and decision aids to progress. The physiotherapist undertook one further session in the middle of the programme to review the participant‚Äôs progress and their exercise programme. The way this was operationalised is outlined in <xref rid="SP2" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental appendix B</xref>.</p>

                  <title>Usual care</title>
                  <p>Those allocated to the usual care arm received standard postoperative physiotherapy. Usual care after surgery could vary considerably across the trial‚Äôs different UK locations. However, it was highly likely that usual care would include several of the following: between one and six sessions of physiotherapy in an outpatient setting, class-based setting or hydrotherapy; written advice on home exercises on discharge from hospital; and an assessment of any potential home requirements or barriers to discharge by an occupational therapist. To standardise usual care as much as possible, participants were expected to attend a minimum of 1 session and a maximum of six sessions of usual care physiotherapy.</p>
                  <p>Quality assurance checks took place at all CORKA research sites. They included fidelity checks during which assessment and treatment delivery were observed. All aspects of the intervention were checked against a predefined fidelity checklist created in line with the study protocol.</p>

                <p>Baseline data were collected face to face, no more than 4‚Äâweeks before surgery. Follow-up data collection was by face-to-face clinical assessments at 6 and 12 months following randomisation. Where face-to-face assessment was not possible, postal and telephone data collection methods were used to obtain self-reported core data. Baseline data included the Functional Comorbidities index to provide baseline characteristics of the participants.</p>

                  <p>The primary outcome was the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) overall function score. It was developed specifically to assess change in community-dwelling older adults. It assesses and responds to meaningful change in two distinct outcomes: a person‚Äôs ability to do discrete actions or activities using a 32-item function component (primary outcome) and a person‚Äôs performance of socially defined life tasks using a 16-item disability component (secondary outcome).</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>A detailed statistical analysis plan has previously been published.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The LLFDI score was chosen as a clinically relevant outcome for the population and the sample size calculation was therefore based on this variable. As there is no formal minimally clinically important difference for the LLFDI the calculation was based on a moderately small standard effect size of 0.275 which gave a sample of 620 participants (310 per arm) with 90% power, 5% (two-sided) significance, allowing for 10% lost to follow-up.</p>
                <p>Two analysis populations were considered: the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and the per-protocol (PP) population. The ITT population included all randomised participants analysed according to their allocated intervention. The PP population included only participants who received at least one session of their allocated intervention, did not receive more treatment than intended (more than six sessions of usual care or seven sessions of home-based rehabilitation) and provided follow-up data.</p>
                <p>LLFDI function scores at 6 and 12‚Äâmonths postrandomisation were summarised by treatment group and analysed using a linear mixed effects model with repeated measures adjusted for baseline score and recruiting site (stratification factor). Time was treated as categorical and an interaction between the outcome measurement time point and randomised group was included to allow the treatment effect to be estimated at each time point, reported as the adjusted mean difference in LLFDI between groups with 95%‚ÄâCI and associated p value. The underlying assumptions of this model were assessed. A 12-month postrandomisation was considered the primary endpoint. The primary analysis was performed for the ITT population using multiple imputation (MI) to impute missing data. MI was performed separately for each treatment group and the model included type of knee replacement (Total -TKR, Unicompartmental knee replacement UKR), recruiting centre, gender, whether or not the participant had had previous lower limb surgery, Charnley classification score and current mobility support used. As sensitivity analyses this was repeated for the ITT population using available cases, the PP population using available cases and using a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
                <p>Linear mixed effects models with repeated measures, similar to that described for the primary outcome, were used to analyse each of the secondary PROMs (LLFDI disability limitation, LLFDI disability frequency, OKS, KOOS QoL, PASE, EQ-5D- 5L utility and VAS), 30SCST (number of stands) and F8WT (time and steps). Differences between the two groups in SLS times were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test since the assumptions of the linear mixed effects model were not satisfied. All of these analyses were performed for the ITT population using available cases only. For the key secondary outcomes (LLFDI disability limitation, LLFDI disability frequency, OKS and KOOS QoL), these analyses were repeated for the ITT population using MI (imputation model as outlined for the primary outcome) and the PP population using available cases.</p>
                <p>The number and proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported by treatment group, as well as the number and proportion of participants experiencing an SAE. The rates were compared across treatment groups.</p>

A total of 2788 patients were screened for eligibility and 621 participants were randomised, 312 to usual care and 309 to the home based rehabilitation programme. A CONSORT flow chart summarises the flow of participants through the trial including details on the number of participants randomised and the numbers allocated to and receiving at least 1 session of each treatment (see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Of the 621 participants, 34 (5.5%) withdrew from follow-up during the course of the trial. Three participants died between the 6 and 12 months follow ups.</p>

              <p>Participants were defined as complying with usual care if they attended at least one treatment session and for home-based rehabilitation at least four treatment sessions. We used different thresholds for the two treatments as usual care varied considerably between sites including as little as one session. Therefore, compliance in this arm was defined as participants receiving at least one session. For the intervention arm, it was prespecified that at least four of the seven planned sessions were required to be compliant. Therapy compliance was 95.2% in usual care and 87.1% for the CORKA intervention. The median number of sessions for usual care was 4 (IQR 2‚Äì6) and for the CORKA intervention was 5 (IQR 4‚Äì7).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>No statistical or clinically meaningful differences were found between CORKA and usual outpatient physiotherapy. Outcomes across a range of measures were closely matched irrespective of which of the two interventions was received. The use of a workforce model using rehabilitation assistants offered flexibility of staffing and did not result in any increase in adverse events.</p>
              <sec id="s4-1">
                <title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
                <p>Strengths of this study include the large sample size and low lost to follow-up which ensured sufficient numbers to make the study sufficiently powered to detect any between group differences. The trial was pragmatic and utilised an innovative workforce model that could readily translate into NHS practice within existing commissioning and financial constraints. The study offers an alternative service delivery model in line with the latest UK guidance from National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).</p>
                <p>Limitations are that the screening tool did not identify patients that were a good fit of risk of poor outcome for the intervention that we developed. The screening tool has not been validated; but uses items that are used by many knee arthroplasty trials to determine entry, these are broad and inclusive, reflecting common clinical practice. Recent recommendations from the UK NICE noted that it would be useful if a tool existed that indicated those who would benefit from supervised rehabilitation and recognised that there is a significant proportion of patients to whom this will apply.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In developing our screening tool for the trial, we attempted just this, but recognise that there was a poor match between the patients screened and the intervention that we developed. Many of our participants were borderline high risk scoring just above the cut-point of 5, resulting in fewer participants at higher risk than anticipated, which may have affected the results.</p>
                <p>Another limitation, common to all trials of post-operative physiotherapy after knee arthroplasty, was the absence of a control group. As outpatient physiotherapy remains an accepted and expected core component of UK arthroplasty practice it was not deemed ethical or practicable to attempt to recruit to a no treatment comparator in a group who had already been identified as at higher risk of a poor outcome. As with most physiotherapy trials, it was not feasible to blind patients or therapists to treatment allocation. We also chose to deliver an intervention that met current commissioning guidance of around six sessions. It is arguable that more intensive treatment as is common in other countries may have been more effective, but this is not supported by studies using longer interventions.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19‚Äì24</xref>
</p>
                <p>We chose to use the LLFDI as our primary outcome over a more knee focused outcome as it is designed to map to the WHO ICF and assess change in community-dwelling older adults encompassing the range of activities relevant for older, potentially frailer patients after arthroplasty. At the time of designing the trial the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was not published. Subsequently, Beauchamp <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported that substantial changes are reflected in a 5-point change in the overall function scale.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> We found substantial changes from baseline to 1‚Äâyear within both groups, but no between group effect. The CORKA home-based intervention showed an overall change of 8.9 points and usual care 8.7 points, indicating that the combined effect of surgery and rehabilitation unsurprisingly produced a highly significant improvement in function. Most of this improvement was probably due to the surgical procedure, but we cannot disaggregate the contribution of physiotherapy to quantify the contribution of one without the other. We found no significant between group difference. It is arguable that a more specific outcome measure targeted at knee arthroplasty may have been a better choice. We included the OKS as a secondary measure to address this potential limitation. The results of the LLFDI and OKS were well matched.</p>

                <title>Implications for patients and policy</title>
                <p>The benefit of postoperative physiotherapeutic interventions is poorly established. A recent evidence review by NICE, of all patients receiving arthroplasty surgery, found no clinically important differences in quality of life, PROMS or functional outcomes between group or individually based supervision and self-directed rehabilitation. They recommended self-directed rehabilitation as an acceptable option for people who are well enough and have personal circumstances that make it possible; but recognised that there are likely to be subgroups who will benefit from a more supervised rehabilitation programme. The CORKA trial is one of few trials to specifically target individuals who are at risk of poor outcome post surgery. The TRIO trial<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> also targeted physiotherapy at patients considered at risk of poor outcome, based on OKS at 6 weeks. Similar to this study they found no statistical differences between the two treatment arms of outpatient physiotherapy and a single physiotherapy review and home exercise based regimen.</p>
                <p>Although we screened for patients deemed at risk of poor outcome the OKS of 37.8 points was higher than the reported average for all knee arthroplasty patients at 1‚Äâyear of 36 points. The TRIO trial similarly found their results, although a little lower, were similar to the unselected average.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Most of this improvement was probably due to the surgical procedure, but we cannot disaggregate the contribution of physiotherapy to quantify the contribution of one without the other.</p>
                <p>The CORKA intervention was based on preoperative outcome measures, with a home-based rehabilitation programme. There may also be benefits to home supervised rehabilitation that are not captured by the current evidence or the outcome measures used in existing studies. For example, participants in our embedded qualitative study were very positive about the CORKA home-based intervention and the supervision provided by the therapists and rehabilitation assistants.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The CORKA home-based intervention could also benefit, for example, those too frail to travel a significant distance to a larger hospital. Using the CORKA combination of qualified therapists and rehabilitation assistants might be a practical option for certain remote areas of the UK or countries that have large geographical areas not covered by therapists. This suggests that there is an argument for choice, according to personal preference or the practicalities of service provision.</p>
                <p>It also addresses the workforce shortage issue by using an innovative workforce model of advanced rehabilitation assistants, moving UK service provision closer to that which has been proven to be effective in North America, where the use of physical therapy assistant graded staff is well embedded. This is a particular concern given both the projected increased need for joint arthroplasty over the next decade to accommodate an ageing population and the pressure of potential reductions in NHS funding. Evaluating the value of treatment modalities offered to these patients is crucial because many more patients are being discharged home earlier from the acute setting leaving less time available for acute physical recovery, rehabilitation and education in hospital, increasing the potential burden of care for these patients and their families.</p>

                <title>Future research</title>
                <p>Further research should focus on developing a screening tool that is more sensitive in identifying those patients who will benefit from additional input beyond self-directed rehabilitation as recommended by the NICE guidance on primary joint replacement.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
                <p>The CORKA home-based intervention was delivered by rehabilitation assistants supervised by qualified therapists in a ratio of 5:2 sessions. Given the workforce challenges in the NHS further work looking at different workforce models and interventions solely using rehabilitation assistants should be explored.</p>
