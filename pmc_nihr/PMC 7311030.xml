                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>People with intellectual disability (ID) are more likely to experience loneliness and have smaller social networks, which increases vulnerability to depression. Befriending may reduce depressive symptoms in other populations, but randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have not been carried out in this population. This pilot study aims to assess the acceptability and feasibility of carrying out a full RCT of one-to-one befriending by volunteers for people with ID, compared with an active control group.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The trial aims to recruit 40 participants with ID. Participants in the intervention arm will receive weekly visits from a volunteer over 6 months. Community befriending schemes will recruit, train, supervise volunteers and match them to individuals with ID. Both groups will receive a booklet about local activities and have access to usual care. Health and social outcomes will be measured at the end of the intervention and 6 months’ follow-up. The following outcomes will be assessed: (1) recruitment and retention of individuals with ID and volunteers in the trial, (2) adverse events related to the intervention, (3) the acceptability of the intervention, (4) whether the intervention is delivered as intended, (5) changes in health and social outcomes and (6) the feasibility of carrying out a cost-effectiveness analysis in a full trial. Qualitative data from participants, volunteers, staff and carers will identify barriers and facilitators of a future full trial.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>The study has been approved by the London City and East Research Ethics Committee (reference 18/LO/2188). The findings will be presented at conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal and in the National Institute of Health Research journals library. A public engagement seminar will be held at the end of the study aimed at key stakeholders.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Intellectual disability (ID) is a life-long condition characterised by impaired cognitive and adaptive functioning arising before the age of 18 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The UK prevalence of ID is 1%–2%.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> People with ID have the same or higher prevalence of depression than the general population but are more likely to experience chronic depression.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> They have greater exposure to social disadvantage,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> experience social exclusion because of stigma,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have markedly smaller social networks<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> and a higher prevalence of loneliness compared with the general population.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These factors have been associated with depressive symptoms in this group.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref></p>
              <sec id="s1-1">
                <title>Conceptualisation of befriending</title>
                <p>Befriending is ‘a relationship between two or more individuals, initiated, supported and monitored by an agency. The relationship is non-judgmental, mutual, purposeful, and there is a commitment over time’.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Key attributes are that it is a one-to-one friendship-like relationship; it is an organised intervention; and there is a negotiation of power.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> There is a wide variation in the concept and practice of befriending.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> At one extreme, befriending is very close to a friendship, characterised as being reciprocal and is delivered by lay volunteers, and at the other end, it is a professional and therapeutic relationship, focused on the befriendee attaining goals and aspirations (mentoring). Most types of befriending relationships lie midway on this spectrum. Schemes are usually run by voluntary organisations in the community and offer training, supervision and ongoing support to volunteers.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>Befriending aims to help people who are lonely, isolated and have limited opportunities for social participation by increasing social and emotional support and by enhancing social networks and community participation. The causal mechanisms of befriending are unclear, but social support is thought to be important. Social support may act as a buffer to stress, and it may mediate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities to depression through its effects on neurobiological factors and other psychosocial factors (eg, coping strategies).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The befriender may enhance social support and link the befriendee into social activities, which may be sustainable outside of and beyond the end of the befriending relationship, which may result in longer-term benefits. Befriending may also improve health outcomes through its effects on social networks.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
                <p>There are also potential benefits for befrienders. Motivation for befriending often includes a desire for ‘giving’ something back to the community (eg, helping others) and ‘getting’ something in return (eg, acquiring new skills or meeting new people).<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> Positive benefits reported by befrienders include increased self-esteem and confidence, feeling that they have gained a genuine friend themselves and improved attitudes towards people with mental illness.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Volunteering in general has beneficial effects on depression, psychological well-being and life satisfaction, and is associated with lower risk of mortality, although the causal mechanisms for these associations are unclear.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p>
                <p>However, the benefits of befriending may be short-lived, and people with ID have reported feeling distressed following the termination of their befriending relationship.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Other risks include the emotional turbulence that is associated with a natural friendship, or harmful effects if the befriender is not adequately trained or supervised. There may also be undue burden placed on the befriender to take on excessive responsibility.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>

                <title>Effectiveness of befriending</title>
                <p>One meta-analysis found that befriending in people with mental or physical health problems (delivered by social and healthcare professionals, as well as lay volunteers) had a statistically significant but modest effect on reducing symptoms of depression when compared with no treatment or treatment as usual in both the short and long term.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Another systematic review examined a range of health and social outcomes in studies where befriending was delivered by volunteers only.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Befriending was associated with better patient-reported outcomes when all primary outcomes were combined, but the effect size was small.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, in contrast to the previous review, there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of befriending on individual outcomes, such as depression, loneliness or quality of life, when the studies were combined.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A recently published randomised controlled trial (RCT) of befriending by volunteers in people with psychosis provides further evidence for the potential beneficial effects of befriending.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Participants in the intervention arm had significantly more social contacts at the end of the 12-month intervention and at 6 months’ follow-up, suggesting that befriending may help to reduce social isolation in this is group.</p>
                <p>The effectiveness of befriending in people with ID has not been evaluated in a randomised trial. An unpublished single-arm feasibility study of one-to-one befriending by volunteers, conducted by a voluntary organisation,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> recruited 24 volunteers, of which 15 were matched with an individual with ID. Positive change was reported in 60% of individuals with ID; 53% reported a decrease in isolation, and 40% reported an increase in confidence. One Australian study examined the feasibility of using ‘active mentoring’, whereby members of existing community groups were trained to act as mentors to older adults with ID in order to provide social support and to encourage participation in community groups.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The intervention comprised 29 individuals receiving the intervention and a matched comparison group. The participants in the intervention reported better social satisfaction compared with the comparison group, but there were no significant changes in the other outcomes.</p>
                <p>Given the dearth of studies examining befriending in people with ID, there is a clear rationale for carrying out a pilot study prior to a full RCT.</p>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>This is a two-arm, parallel group, researcher blind pilot RCT with 1:1 allocation. Fifty participants with ID who are eligible for the study will be randomly allocated to either the intervention arm (one-to-one befriending by a volunteer) or an active control arm. Both groups will have access to usual care and a booklet of local resources. The duration of the intervention will be 6 months. Outcome assessments will be carried out at baseline, postintervention and at 6 months’ follow-up. A process evaluation, based on mixed methods, will be carried out to examine the delivery and adherence to intervention, and stakeholder views on the acceptability of the intervention and barriers and facilitators that may affect the implementation of a full-scale trial.</p>

                <p>We do not have any estimates of the number of people with ID who are eligible and are likely to consent to taking part in the trial. If we approach 50 participants who are eligible to take part, this will allow us to estimate an expected recruitment rate of 80% (40 people), with a 95% CI of 68.9% to 91.1%. A sample size of 40 recruited people with ID would allow us to estimate a 30% drop-out rate in the trial with a 95% CI of 25.7% to 54.3%. The recruitment period is 6 months. There are two participating befriending services and therefore we will need to recruit 3.3 participants with ID per month at each site. Twenty volunteers will need to be recruited and matched to each participant in the intervention arm.</p>

The emphasis will be on assisting the individual to make choices about the activities that they wish to pursue. The volunteer is not expected to carry out personal care, administer medication or accompany the individual to medical appointments. Contacts by phone/social media can take place, in addition to face-to-face contacts. The pair can spend some sessions in the person’s home, but this should not exceed 50% of the total number of sessions. Sessions may take place during evenings/weekends, depending on the pair’s availability. They will keep a record of their activities in a structured log that will be provided (whether they attended each session, reasons for cancellation, what they did in each session and duration of activity) and record of other types of contact.

                <p>A process evaluation will be undertaken, based on MRC guidance.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The aim will be to examine whether the different components of the intervention were consistently followed; to examine the extent to which volunteers delivered the intervention as intended; to understand the perceived value, benefits and unintended consequences of the intervention so that these are fully measured in a full trial; to determine the contextual factors influencing how the intervention was delivered; and to develop an understanding of the likely mechanisms of action of the intervention. We will interview 16 participants with ID after their 12-month follow-up (eight per site) and carry out two focus groups at each site with five to eight volunteers, staff from each befriending service and five to eight carers. We will use purposive sampling in order to include people with a range of demographic characteristics (eg, gender, age, ethnicity and living arrangements), and both participants and volunteers for whom the befriending relationship broke down, as well as people who completed the intervention. All respondents will be asked about what aspects of the intervention were perceived to be helpful, what aspects require modification and suggestions for improvement, views about trial procedures, and the perceived barriers and facilitators to delivering a larger trial. The interviews and focus groups will be audio-taped and transcribed.</p>
                <p>In order to understand how the befriending intervention was delivered, the location, content of the meetings and the range of activities undertaken will be described based on an analysis of structured logbooks. A framework will be developed to categorise different types of activity to enable different types of befriending support to be distinguished and quantified. Test procedures will be developed for collecting quantitative process data which, in a future larger trial, could be used to explore the relationships between process variables and outcomes. Findings from the process evaluation will inform any necessary refinements to the study intervention or procedures.</p>

                <p>Feasibility outcomes, such as the number of participants who were screened and eligible, the proportion of eligible participants with ID and interested volunteers recruited to the study, and the proportion successfully matched in befriending relationships, will be reported. The number (proportion) of drop-outs of volunteers and participants from the intervention arm and from both arms at each follow-up assessment will also be reported, including reasons why where possible.

                <p>The characteristics and outcomes of participants by trial arm will be summarised using means and SD or medians and IQRs for continuous variables and count and percentages for categorical variables. Appropriate regression models, depending on the type of outcome, adjusted for baseline values and centre will be used to estimate the intervention effect on health and social outcomes where possible. The results will be presented as estimates with 95% CI. All analyses will be carried out as randomised with available data (intention-to-treat principle) and will be used to inform the definitive trial. The characteristics of patients with missing outcome data will be investigated.</p>

                  <p>Transcripts from the focus groups and interviews will be analysed by the study team using thematic analysis supported by computer software (NVivo V.9). The analytical strategy will focus on identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing the intervention successfully, its benefits to participants and mechanisms of effect. Analysis will also allow consideration of themes that arise more inductively from the data. Validity will be enhanced by a collaborative analytical strategy involving members of the research team and the advisory group who will meet together to review the coding framework and agree on the themes.</p>

              <p>This is the first pilot RCT of one-to-one befriending, monitored by community befriending services, in people with ID. The trial will provide data on whether a full trial will be feasible, in terms of recruitment and retention of volunteers and people with ID and data on potential beneficial and adverse effects, acceptability and the extent to which the intervention is delivered as intended by volunteers and the befriending services. It will help to inform modifications that need to be made to enable a future trial to overcome barriers and challenges that may be encountered in this pilot.</p>
              <p>There is currently limited evidence supporting the choice of a primary health outcome, but the use of depressive symptoms is supported by one systematic review.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This pilot study will help to determine whether measuring depressive symptoms is the most appropriate primary outcome for a future trial.</p>
              <p>One of the main challenges of this study will be to ensure that the intervention and the recruitment, training and supervision of volunteers are carried out according to the trial protocol as these aspects vary between befriending services, and was an issue in a recent trial of befriending in people with psychosis.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While both befriending services have committed to the study, there are resource implications for these services as the intervention costs are not covered by the research funding. External factors such as funding cuts to these services could influence the delivery of the intervention and the success of the trial. The process data will allow us to examine whether a future trial would need to be more pragmatic and whether the befriending intervention should permit more flexibility.</p>
