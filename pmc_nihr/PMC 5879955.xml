                  <p>Evaluations of new services for palliative care in non-cancer conditions are few.
OPTCARE Neuro is a multicentre trial evaluating the effectiveness of short-term
integrated palliative care (SIPC) for progressive long-term neurological
conditions. Here, we present survey results describing the current levels of
collaboration between neurology and palliative care services and exploring the
views of professionals towards the new SIPC service.</p>

                  <p>Neurology and palliative care teams from six UK trial sites (London, Nottingham,
Liverpool, Cardiff, Brighton and Chertsey) were approached via email to complete
an online survey. The survey was launched in July 2015 and consisted of multiple

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>33 neurology and 26 palliative care professionals responded. Collaborations
between the two specialties were reported as being ‘good/excellent’
by 36% of neurology and by 58% of palliative care professionals.
However, nearly half (45%) of neurology compared with only 12% of
palliative care professionals rated current levels as being
‘poor/none’. Both professional groups felt that the new SIPC service
would influence future collaborations for the better. However, they identified a
number of barriers for the new SIPC service such as resources and clinician
awareness.</p>

                  <p>Our results demonstrate the opportunity to increase collaboration between
neurology and palliative care services for people with progressive neurological
conditions, and the acceptability of SIPC as a model to support this.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Palliative care has been proposed to help meet the needs of patients with progressive
non-cancer conditions such as long-term neurological conditions (LTNCs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> However, there is little or no evidence on the
best ways of providing palliative care for these patients. Should it be at the
‘end of life’ or earlier such as at the point of diagnosis? Our own phase
II randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients with multiple sclerosis
(MS) showed a reduction in symptoms and caregiving burden, following short-term
integrated palliative care (SIPC) compared with standard care.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> More recently, a pilot RCT in Italy evaluating the impact of a new
specialist palliative care service for patients with a range of LTNCs found significant
improvements in quality of life and physical symptoms.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Whether more people living with different LTNCs can benefit from SIPC and
whether it can be routinely used in practice to improve care quality are of
interest.</p>
              <p>OPTCARE Neuro is a multicentre RCT evaluating the effectiveness of SIPC for progressive
LTNCs (ISRCTN18337380). The SIPC service being trialled is defined as three palliative
care visits over 6–8 weeks. This is a phase III RCT in patients with a range of
LTNCs including: MS, motor neuron disease (MND), idiopathic Parkinson’s disease,
progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy. The overall aim of OPTCARE
Neuro is to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of SIPC to optimise care for
people with LTNCs. In addition to understanding the effectiveness of this service, it is
also important to understand and be aware of current service provisions and the views of
professionals involved in providing care for this patient group. The complexity of
delivering and evaluating palliative care services requires the accumulation of
knowledge from multiple sources and will depend on interprofessional behaviours.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> It is therefore valuable to explore
clinicians’ views and opinions when shaping emerging services and informing
future requirements. With that in mind, we conducted a short online survey with
neurology and palliative care professionals. The main aims of the survey were to:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>understand what current levels of collaboration exist between the two
specialties;</p></list-item><list-item><p>explore the expectations and views of clinicians towards the SIPC service being
trialled.</p></list-item></list>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p>Research teams at six UK trial centres (London, Nottingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, Brighton
and Chertsey) identified local neurology and palliative care professionals who were then
approached via email by the central trial team. Professionals were informed that by
completing the survey, they provided informed consent for use of their anonymised data.
The surveys consisted of multiple choice or open comment questions, 13 (for neurology)
or 10 (for palliative care) with responses collected using online forms. The survey was
launched in July 2015 and closed April 2016. The study was approved by the National
Research Ethics Service Committee London South East (REC number: 14/LO/1765).</p>

              <title>Results</title>
              <p>The survey received responses from 33 neurology and 26 palliative care professionals
(20% response rate). Two-thirds of respondents in both groups had over 10 years
of experience in their respective fields. Current levels of collaboration between the
two specialties were reported as being ‘good/excellent’ by 36% of
neurology professionals and by 58% of palliative care professionals. However,
nearly half (45%) of neurology compared with only 12% of palliative care
professionals rated current levels as being ‘poor/none’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). When asked if there were any particular
disease areas where links were better, both groups reported stronger links for MND. In
addition, both professional groups felt that the new SIPC service being trialled would
influence future collaborations for the better (65%–70% in both
groups).</p>

              <p>Participants were also asked what they thought would be the main barriers for the new
SIPC service (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The most commonly
identified barriers by neurologists were resources, clinician awareness of services
offered, continuing collaborations and communication between teams beyond the trial and
geographical limitations. Similarly, palliative care professionals also identified
resources and clinician awareness (and, importantly, the appropriateness of referrals
they may receive) as barriers. However, the key barrier they identified was that there
may be a possible need for longer-term care beyond that offered by the SIPC service.
They also drew attention to patient perceptions of palliative care as a potential
barrier.</p>

              <p>Our results demonstrate that collaborations can be improved and both specialties are
positive about the impact the new SIPC service will make. However, the barriers
identified highlight areas for consideration and further exploration. Patient
perceptions of palliative care was identified as a potential barrier to the successful
integration of neurology and palliative care services. It is equally important for
neurology professionals to have the right understanding of palliative care and to
recognise the potential benefit of palliative care for their patients. Indeed, previous
studies have demonstrated that the topic of palliative care can still often lead to
anxiety in patients, caregivers as well as healthcare professionals.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> There is an emphasis on the need for
integrated working along with improved education and awareness in order to make
palliative care more recognised and more accessible for non-cancer conditions such as
LTNCs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> As reported by both specialties,
resources must be carefully considered and systems developed for calling on palliative
care specialists when truly necessary. The small number of respondents highlights the
challenges of conducting research among busy health professionals; however, the
geographical variation is an advantage of the survey.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our results demonstrate the opportunity to increase collaboration between neurology and
palliative care services for people with progressive neurological conditions, and the
acceptability of SIPC as a model to support this. This survey will be repeated at the
end of the trial to understand how collaborations and views have changed, whether the
SIPC service has affected the care process and to identify areas for improvement. These
survey results will be integrated with the qualitative trial findings to provide a wider
context about the effects of SIPC on the processes of care, and the ways in which it
might be working effectively.</p>
