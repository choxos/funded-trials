                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Long COVID (LC), the persistent symptoms ≥12 weeks following acute COVID-19, presents major threats to individual and public health across countries, affecting over 1.5 million people in the UK alone. Evidence-based interventions are urgently required and an integrated care pathway approach in pragmatic trials, which include investigations, treatments and rehabilitation for LC, could provide scalable and generalisable solutions at pace.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, cluster-randomised clinical trial of two components of an integrated care pathway (Coverscan™, a multi-organ MRI, and Living with COVID Recovery™, a digitally enabled rehabilitation platform) with a nested, Phase III, open label, platform randomised drug trial in individuals with LC. Cluster randomisation is at level of primary care networks so that integrated care pathway interventions are delivered as “standard of care” in that area. The drug trial randomisation is at individual level and initial arms are rivaroxaban, colchicine, famotidine/loratadine, compared with no drugs, with potential to add in further drug arms. The trial is being carried out in 6–10 LC clinics in the UK and is evaluating the effectiveness of a pathway of care for adults with LC in reducing fatigue and other physical, psychological and functional outcomes at 3 months. The trial also includes an economic evaluation which will be described separately.</p>

                  <p>The protocol was reviewed by South Central—Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (reference: 21/SC/0416). All participating sites obtained local approvals prior to recruitment. Coverscan™ has UK certification (UKCA 752965). All participants will provide written consent to take part in the trial. The first participant was recruited in July 2022 and interim/final results will be disseminated in 2023, in a plan co-developed with public and patient representatives. The results will be presented at national and international conferences, published in peer reviewed medical journals, and shared via media (mainstream and social) and patient support organisations.</p>

              <p>The syndrome of Long COVID (LC), defined by persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms ≥12 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], has affected over 2 million people in the UK alone [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], necessitating health system responses despite incomplete disease characterisation. While many symptoms are reported by individuals with LC, fatigue is the most frequent and most commonly reported to limit quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0272472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among other symptoms are chest pain, ‘brain fog’, dyspnoea, headache, dizziness, palpitations, and sleep disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Unlike acute COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], predictors of poor outcomes and effective management are not yet established for LC [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Integrated care pathways are structured, multidisciplinary plans in care of specific conditions [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], offering coordination across specialties, investigations, treatment, and rehabilitation, as well as opportunities for real-time, iterative improvements in service design and delivery [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>There is variation in access to referral and care, and poor patient experience for LC [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With stretched resources during the pandemic, rationalisation of investigation and rehabilitation across diseases is crucial. In LC, non-hospitalised individuals were more symptomatic, more likely to have psychological impact, and less likely to be fit for work than post-hospitalised individuals. Up to 70% of individuals have mild organ impairment using Coverscan<sup>TM</sup>, a multi-organ MRI protocol [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the context of variable waiting times, resources and practice (with frequent repeating of investigations and referrals to multiple specialists [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]), an early supported, multi-organ investigation strategy like this may direct management, as well as better defining the syndrome, with relevance to other long-term conditions. A negative finding could rule out organ involvement and other disease early, reassuring clinicians and patients, rather than organising multiple investigations with multiple specialists via multiple referrals. By flagging organ dysfunction, early, appropriate specialist referral and management may be initiated. There is no evidence-based treatment or rehabilitation, with few clinical trials to-date, particularly in non-hospitalised individuals, or considering overall care pathways. Although digital rehabilitation platforms (e.g. Living with COVID Recovery<sup>TM</sup>) may be scalable, particularly with strained rehabilitation services, and already being used in some centres, they are not yet evaluated in trials [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite roll-out of 90 centrally funded LC clinics in England, ICPs are neither coordinated nor evaluated. Trials of integrated care pathways could inform diagnosis, care, public health, policy planning, resource allocation and budgeting.</p>
              <p>Antihistamines (e.g., loratadine and famotidine), colchicine and rivaroxaban are examples of medications being widely used among patients and health professionals with rationale for use (<bold><xref rid="pone.0272472.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref></bold>), but without proven efficacy. Platform trials have been used at scale to evaluate therapies in acute COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but not in LC. Since underlying causes are unknown and subtypes poorly defined, trials should test drugs across all individuals with LC, irrespective of individual symptoms or investigation findings, to allow multiple secondary sub-group analyses. Optimal outcomes for LC are yet to be fully defined. Therefore, trials should evaluate a wide range of potential physical, psychological and functional outcomes. We report the protocol for the STIMULATE-ICP (<underline>S</underline>ymptoms, <underline>T</underline>rajectory, <underline>I</underline>nequalities and <underline>M</underline>anagement: <underline>U</underline>nderstanding <underline>L</underline>ong COVID to <underline>A</underline>ddress and <underline>T</underline>ransform <underline>E</underline>xisting <underline>I</underline>ntegrated <underline>C</underline>are <underline>P</underline>athways) trial (<bold><xref rid="pone.0272472.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>).</p>

                <p>This multi-centre trial involves Primary Care Networks and LC Clinics in 6–10 different English areas, covering diversity of geography, demography and clinical service design. Management is by Lancashire Clinical Trials Unit and sponsorship by University College London.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>In this trial, “integrated care” comprises two integrated care pathway interventions, cluster-randomised at Primary Care Network level: Coverscan™ (community based, multi-organ MRI with clinical decision support)(15) and Living with COVID Recovery™ (enhanced community based, digitally enabled rehabilitation)(16). The Coverscan will have a standardised report. For the first 100 scans across sites, there will be report by an independent radiologist, and a virtual, weekly multidisciplinary meeting to discuss any cases and potential implications of findings, management and/or referral to specialists. We did not have or develop an algorithmic management approach (i.e. clinical decision support) or a “manual” because the organ dysfunction in Long Covid is still being defined and a manual would involve approaches to any possible finding in lungs, heart, liver, pancreas and kidneys, which is not feasible, at present.</p>
                <p>“Usual care” comprises usual investigations (e.g. routine blood tests, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph or exercise tolerance test); and self-managed rehabilitation with online resources (Your COVID Recovery™: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk/" ext-link-type="uri">https:\\www.yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk</ext-link>) in the LC clinic pathway, which is standard of care.</p>
                <p>In a nested, open label, adaptive platform trial, a 12-week course of one of three drug arms will be evaluated (individual level randomisation): famotidine+loratadine, colchicine and rivaroxaban, compared with no drugs.</p>

                <title>Sites</title>
                <p>This is a pragmatic trial, comparing two integrated care pathway interventions to usual care, ensuring that research does not impact/change workload for already over-stretched healthcare resources, whilst ensuring equity of access to care.</p>

                <title>Randomisation</title>
                <p>Given current COVID-related health system pressures, individual level randomisation for integrated care pathway interventions (Coverscan™ and Living with COVID Recovery™) at General Practitioner level is not feasible and could potentially increase waiting times in other areas of care, which could affect recruitment. Unlike individual randomisation, cluster randomising at primary care network level allows 50–50 chance of allocation to both Coverscan™ and Living with COVID Recovery™, maintaining access across the total number of referred individuals and equipoise at clinic level. Randomisation will use demographic and socioeconomic data available for each primary care network, ensuring equity of access through deprivation indexes of GP postcodes. Clustering at primary care network level allows Coverscan™ and/or Living with COVID Recovery™ to be provided as uplift to usual care in allocated primary care networks, becoming integrated care within that primary care network without the need for individual consent. Access to and collection of Coverscan™ and Living with COVID Recovery™ data for research will be by individual consent on study entry (by the research staff). Cluster randomisation (2x2 factorial design) provides four groups:</p>

                <title>Randomisation methods</title>
                <p>Block randomisation for the primary care networks will be used with blocks of size 4. There are two factors in the randomisation, and within each clinic: primary care network size (categorised into 2 levels) and primary care network deprivation (categorised into 2 levels). Within each clinic, the strata of primary care networks will be arranged as larger and more deprived; larger and less deprived; smaller and less deprived; and smaller and more deprived, before randomised allocation into the 4 cluster allocations. The randomisation ratio is 1:1:1:1 between the 4 possible treatment pathways.</p>
                <p>Randomisation to the drug trial at the clinic will be at individual participant level using an online system (Sealed Envelope™). Block randomisation will be used with varying block sizes. There will be two factors in the randomisation within each clinic: gender (male vs female) and treatment pathway. The randomisation ratio will be equal between all drug treatment arms (including no drug: “usual care”) open to recruitment at that point in the cluster trial.</p>

                <p>Primary analysis of the trial will be a complete case analysis using all available outcomes, according to cluster randomised allocation of participant’s primary care network (regardless of treatment pathways received) or the stratified randomisation of the individual participant (regardless of treatment received). The primary outcome, FAS at 12 weeks, is expected to be approximately normally distributed [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A multi-level model analysis will be used to evaluate effects of Coverscan™, Living with COVID Recovery<sup>TM</sup>, and their interaction, on FAS at 12 weeks adjusting for baseline FAS, with clinic and primary care network as random effects.</p>

Participants randomly allocated to each drug arm will be compared to those randomly allocated to usual care while both that drug and usual care are options for randomisation (concurrent usual care controls). A multi-level model for FAS, adjusting for baseline, with gender as a fixed effect and clinic and primary care network as random effects, will be applied to the drug trial data. By restricting comparisons of effects of drugs vs. usual care on fatigue to those participants allocated to the treatment pathway incorporating the lowest level of intervention, and potentially the least variation in care, this will give the cleanest and least biased comparison. The total population of participants who are randomised into the drug trial will be used to study effects of drugs in combination/interaction with the pathways.</p>

                <title>Interim analysis</title>
                <p>The first interim analysis point will be after 1200 participants are recruited to the cluster randomised trial and the remaining interim points will be after every 600 participants recruited. The interim analysis time points will apply to both the cluster and drug trials.</p>
                <p>Interim analysis of the cluster interventions will take place among participants receiving usual care only (by allocation in the drug trial to no drug or by refusing or being ineligible for the drug trial). A pathway (a combination of the two cluster interventions) could be found to be superior after the first 1200 participants and every 600 participants thereafter in the study. A statistically significant p-value at the 0.001 two-sided level is required for a pathway to be deemed superior at interim analysis. This is to account for multiple testing (Bonferroni type correction). The analysis at 4520 individuals in total will be at the conventional 0.05 two-sided level. There are practical and operational reasons why a single pathway cannot graduate and become the standard pathway within the recruitment period of this trial.</p>
                <p>For a drug to graduate early and become part of the backbone treatment of the trial, its two-sided p-value at each of the interim time points will need to be &lt;0.001. The final principal analysis for each drug, including only those participants in the standard of care cluster pathway, will be with at least 200 participants in the active arm and 200 concurrent controls, and will use the conventional 2-sided 0.05 level. This analysis has 85% power if Cohen’s D is 0.3 and 97% power if Cohen’s D is 0.4.</p>
                <p>After consideration and consultation with the IDMC, we decided against futility analysis, partly because it would be both very complicated and very difficult to implement across different drug arms and different part of the cluster randomised trial, due to our complex study design. Moreover, futility analyses may lead to underpowering of different arms of the trial.</p>

                  <title>Main study</title>
                  <p>The sample size was calculated using PASS v21.0.1(2021) for a 2x2 cluster factorial trial. The study was powered to detect an interaction on the FAS scale between Coverscan™ and Living with COVID Recovery™. The sample size does not depend on the size of main effects of both individual interventions. Based on published data the standard deviation on the FAS scale for individuals with LC is estimated at 6 units. For context, the difference in means of FAS between people who say they have or have not recovered from LC was 9 points in a recent observational study [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An interaction effect of 3 points [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] on the FAS can be detected with just over 90% power and (two-sided) significance level of 0.05 with 960 participants in 48 primary care network clusters of 20 participants, assuming a conservative intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.02. If there is dropout of 15% (to be conservative) and assuming missingness is roughly equal across the arms, then the number of participants must be inflated by a factor of 100/85 to 1130 (approximately 56.5 centres of 20 participants).</p>
                  <p>Experimental estimates of prevalence of symptoms that remain 12-weeks post-COVID range from 3.0% based on tracking specific symptoms, to 11.7% based on self-classification of LC, using data to 1 August 2021 [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One LC clinic has ~25 new individuals per week [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], suggesting there might be around 1300 new individuals annually per clinic. Most are expected to give consent to data collection even if not willing to consent to randomisation into a drug study. LC referral rates range from 0–2.5/1000 per primary care network. Assuming this rate will not change over the foreseeable future, this will ensure that our 6–10 LC clinics will provide sufficient patients for this study. Moreover, there is a backlog of people waiting for their first LC clinic appointment (from private communication).</p>

                  <p>The total number of individual drugs which will be tested on the platform is currently unknown. The total sample size required in an adaptive platform drug trial, with uncertainty in the timing of the introduction of further drugs, cannot be set in advance, but would need to be updated in consultation with the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (equivalent to the data safety monitoring board) and funder throughout the trial at set interim points in data collection.</p>
                  <p>The treatment effect is unknown, at this time, for the drugs. The plan is to perform interim analysis after 1200 participants in total are recruited and after every 600 participants thereafter. With 200 participants per active arm and corresponding concurrent controls the study has 85% power to detect a Cohen’s D of 0.3 on FAS (difference between means in two treatment arms divided by the standard deviation of the data) at the 0.05 two-sided alpha level. If this number is increased to 300 for the same effect size the power is 95%.</p>

                  <p>To plan and cost the trial a nominal maximum of 4520 recruited participants was proposed based on up to 4 (drug and usual care) parallel arms of up to 1130 evaluable participants. The nested drug trial aims to recruit up to 4520 individuals from a possible pool of 30 000 individuals from 6–10 primary care network areas of England. The trial will continue to recruit participants at least until the recruitment target of 1130 participants for each of the initial arms of the adaptive trial has been reached. If the adaptive trial requires the full 4520 participants, it is estimated it will take approximately 10 to 12 months for the recruitment to complete and by the 16<sup>th</sup> month from the start of the trial, the last visit of the last patient would be completed in the third quarter of 2023. The projected recruitment rate, when all clinics are open to recruitment, is 600 participants per month.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In individuals with non-hospitalised LC, the STIMULATE-ICP trial represents the first major, pragmatic trial to study: (i) drugs in a nested platform design, (ii) components of an integrated care pathway from pre- to post-clinic care, and (iii) fatigue as a primary endpoint. Given the national and international burden of LC, STIMULATE-ICP is important to investigate feasible, generalisable and scalable improvements in care through: (i) widely-used, re-purposable drugs, (ii) accessible interventions (Coverscan<sup>TM</sup> and Living with COVID Recovery<sup>TM</sup>), and (iii) study sites varying in geography and clinical service. This paper presents the protocol (Version 2.1, 05/05/2022) and the full protocol is available on the NIHR and study (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.stimulate-icp.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.stimulate-icp.org/</ext-link>) websites.

The full trial results will be disseminated in Q3 2023 through presentations at national and international conferences, publication in peer reviewed medical journals and regular interaction with media (mainstream and social). As well as the non-trial aspects of STIMULATE-ICP (described in the methods), there are now several nationally funded observational research programmes are underway, including LOCOMOTION, TLC and PC-COS studies [<xref rid="pone.0272472.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

              </p>
              <p>1. Does the manuscript provide a valid rationale for the proposed study, with clearly identified and justified research questions?</p>
              <p>The research question outlined is expected to address a valid academic problem or topic and contribute to the base of knowledge in the field.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the protocol technically sound and planned in a manner that will lead to a meaningful outcome and allow testing the stated hypotheses?</p>
              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->3. Is the methodology feasible and described in sufficient detail to allow the work to be replicable?</p>
              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->4. Have the authors described where all data underlying the findings will be made available when the study is complete?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/materials-and-software-sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.<!-- </font> --></p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p><!-- <font color="black"> -->5. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above and, if applicable, provide comments about issues authors must address before this protocol can be accepted for publication. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about research or publication ethics.</p>
              <p>You may also provide optional suggestions and comments to authors that they might find helpful in planning their study.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: This felt long (at about 6,500 words) and almost a full protocol. My main suggestions are to:</p>
              <p>Abbreviate for the journal manuscript to focus on the main design features. The regulatory and logistical aspects could be left out and the current manuscript provided more as an appendix.</p>
              <p>In line with this, there were many abbreviations that may be familiar to those in the NIHR context but are not to international readers. I suggest the authors look through the manuscript and spell out most of these abbreviations for readability. An example is what does WP mean in Figure 2?</p>
              <p>I was also left with little insight into the actual interventions and the background to those. I would like more details about each intervention - description of what they are exactly, brief background literature review, rationale for choosing these. For example, what is the Coverscan and how is it thought that a multi-organ MRI will help patients?</p>
              <p>In the analysis section, it would be helpful if a figure could be provided that illustrates the various different populations for analyses. Either as a stand-alone figure, or indicated on Figure 3.</p>
              <p>**********</p>

              <p>I still think there needs to be additional rationale provided for use of Coverscan. The authors have still not addressed the previous question sufficiently. It is not clear to me how a multi-organ MRI will result in improved outcomes. Will there be an algorithmic management approach based on the findings? For example, what is proposed if there is pancreatic or renal involvement in the absence of other markers of organ dysfunction? I appreciate the work showing that 70% of a previous cohort had evidence of at least single organ involvement, what is not clear is whether this has any clinical implications and how it might result in changes in management that would ultimately benefit the patient.</p>

              <p>The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception, at the time of publication. The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No</p>
              <p>Thanks- it is unclear why Reviewer 2 has written “No” as we do not provide results/findings in this protocol (since the trial is currently recruiting). We have provided data supporting the choice of drugs as supporting (supplementary) information. See response below.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Thank you, the manuscript is much improved.</p>
              <p>I still think there needs to be additional rationale provided for use of Coverscan. The authors have still not addressed the previous question sufficiently. It is not clear to me how a multi-organ MRI will result in improved outcomes. Will there be an algorithmic management approach based on the findings? For example, what is proposed if there is pancreatic or renal involvement in the absence of other markers of organ dysfunction? I appreciate the work showing that 70% of a previous cohort had evidence of at least single organ involvement, what is not clear is whether this has any clinical implications and how it might result in changes in management that would ultimately benefit the patient.</p>
              <p>Thanks for this remark and apologies if the previous response was not clear. Part of the trial is to understand how the Coverscan may inform or influence care (or not), and it came on the backdrop of high numbers of patients seeking investigation for possible Long Covid with variable waiting times, variable resources for scanning and variable practices with frequent repeating of investigations and referrals to multiple specialists (see reference 3. Heightman M et al. 2021). A multi-organ MRI may improve outcomes in two ways, both by reducing time to treatment. First, a negative finding by ruling out organ involvement and other disease early could reassure the clinician and the patient, rather than organising multiple investigations with multiple specialists via multiple referrals. Second, by flagging organ or multi-organ dysfunction, the MRI may trigger appropriate specialist referral earlier and lead to earlier appropriate management. Of course, the trial may show no effect of Coverscan.</p>
              <p>The reviewer is right that we do not know yet the clinical implications of the single or multiple organ involvement post-COVID and the rate of resolution- these are being investigated in the trial. Therefore, we did not have or develop an algorithmic management approach (i.e. clinical decision support) or “manual” because the organ dysfunction in Long Covid is still being defined and a manual would involve approaches to any possible finding in lungs, heart, liver, pancreas and kidneys, which is not feasible. In answer to the reviewer’s question, “…what is proposed if there is pancreatic or renal involvement in the absence of other markers of organ dysfunction?”, there would be specialist referral to assess the potential relevance or importance of such a finding, which may be incidental and not clinically relevant.</p>
              <p>The Coverscan has a standardised report. For the first 100 scans across the 6 sites, there is report by an independent radiologist, and a virtual, weekly multidisciplinary meeting to discuss any cases and potential implications of findings, management and/or referral to specialists. To summarise, part of the trial is to find out whether the Coverscan changes and/or improves management of people with Long Covid. </p>
              <p>We have added text to the revised manuscript to cover some of these complex issues.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: No mentioning of data safety monitoring board.</p>
              <p>We do mention the Independent Data Monitoring Committee which is the data safety monitoring board (we have now explained this in the new revised text). </p>
              <p>Futility analysis was not considered in the interim analysis.</p>
              <p>Thank you for this important remark. We actually had considered futility analysis in the interim analysis and our study but both our team and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee felt that futility analysis should not be included because:</p>
              <p>1. Our focus is on drugs and integrated pathway components which work</p>
              <p>2. Due to the complex design, a futility analysis plan across different drug arms and different part of the cluster randomised trial was likely to be complicated and very difficult to implement.</p>
              <p>3. In a trial with several moving parts and a moving target in terms of the disease itself, futility analyses may lead to underpowering of arms of the study. </p>
              <p>We and our Independent Data Monitoring Committee (who we consulted again) feel that the plans for interim analysis are robust. </p>
              <p>We have added a sentence regarding futility analysis to reflect these issues in the revised manuscript. </p>
              <p>P value &lt;0.001 is not clearly justified in the interim analysis.</p>
              <p>We do have a sentence in the manuscript already to justify the p value&lt;0.001: </p>
              <p>“A statistically significant p-value at the 0.001 two-sided level is required for a pathway to be deemed superior at interim analysis. This is to account for multiple testing (Bonferroni type correction). The analysis at 4520 individuals in total will be at the conventional 0.05 two-sided level. There are practical and operational reasons why a single pathway cannot graduate and become the standard pathway within the recruitment period of this trial.”________________________________________</p>

              <p>The manuscript should describe the methods in sufficient detail to prevent undisclosed flexibility in the experimental procedure or analysis pipeline, including sufficient outcome-neutral conditions (e.g. necessary controls, absence of floor or ceiling effects) to test the proposed hypotheses and a statistical power analysis where applicable. As there may be aspects of the methodology and analysis which can only be refined once the work is undertaken, authors should outline potential assumptions and explicitly describe what aspects of the proposed analyses, if any, are exploratory.<!-- </font> --></p>

              <p>Descriptions of methods and materials in the protocol should be reported in sufficient detail for another researcher to reproduce all experiments and analyses. The protocol should describe the appropriate controls, sample size calculations, and replication needed to ensure that the data are robust and reproducible.<!-- </font> --></p>
