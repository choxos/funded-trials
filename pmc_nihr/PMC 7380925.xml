                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Health-care workers constitute a high-risk population for acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Capacity for acute diagnosis via PCR testing was limited for individuals with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and a substantial proportion of health-care workers with suspected infection were not tested. We aimed to investigate the performance of point-of-care and laboratory serology assays and their utility in late case identification, and to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a prospective multicentre cohort study between April 8 and June 12, 2020, in two phases. Symptomatic health-care workers with mild to moderate symptoms were eligible to participate 14 days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, as per the Public Health England (PHE) case definition. Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had not developed PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. In phase 1, two point-of-care lateral flow serological assays, the Onsite CTK Biotech COVID-19 split IgG/IgM Rapid Test (CTK Bitotech, Poway, CA, USA) and the Encode SARS-CoV-2 split IgM/IgG One Step Rapid Test Device (Zhuhai Encode Medical Engineering, Zhuhai, China), were evaluated for performance against a laboratory immunoassay (EDI Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 IgG ELISA kit [Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA]) in 300 samples from health-care workers and 100 pre-COVID-19 negative control samples. In phase 2 (n=6440), serosurveillance was done among 1299 (93·4%) of 1391 health-care workers reporting symptoms, and in a subset of asymptomatic health-care workers (405 [8·0%] of 5049).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>There was variation in test performance between the lateral flow serological assays; however, the Encode assay displayed reasonable IgG sensitivity (127 of 136; 93·4% [95% CI 87·8–96·9]) and specificity (99 of 100; 99·0% [94·6–100·0]) among PCR-proven cases and good agreement (282 of 300; 94·0% [91·3–96·7]) with the laboratory immunoassay. By contrast, the Onsite assay had reduced sensitivity (120 of 136; 88·2% [95% CI 81·6–93·1]) and specificity (94 of 100; 94·0% [87·4–97·8]) and agreement (254 of 300; 84·7% [80·6–88·7]). Five (7%) of 70 PCR-positive cases were negative across all assays. Late changes in lateral flow serological assay bands were recorded in 74 (9·3%) of 800 cassettes (35 [8·8%] of 400 Encode assays; 39 [9·8%] of 400 Onsite assays), but only seven (all Onsite assays) of these changes were concordant with the laboratory immunoassay. In phase 2, seroprevalence among the workforce was estimated to be 10·6% (95% CI 7·6–13·6) in asymptomatic health-care workers and 44·7% (42·0–47·4) in symptomatic health-care workers. Seroprevalence across the entire workforce was estimated at 18·0% (95% CI 17·0–18·9).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Although a good positive predictive value was observed with both lateral flow serological assays and ELISA, this agreement only occurred if the pre-test probability was modified by a strict clinical case definition. Late development of lateral flow serological assay bands would preclude postal strategies and potentially home testing. Identification of false-negative results among health-care workers across all assays suggest caution in interpretation of IgG results at this stage; for now, testing is perhaps best delivered in a clinical setting, supported by government advice about physical distancing.</p>

More than 13 800 000 cases have been reported and 593 000 deaths attributed to COVID-19 worldwide, as of July 18, 2020.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Substantial public health isolation measures have been adopted in an attempt to slow the spread of infection. Case finding strategies have predominantly relied on PCR assays during the acute infection phase, through centralised specialist laboratories. In the UK, testing capacity in the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic was mostly limited to patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, and only later extended to include symptomatic health-care workers. Health-care workers constitute a population that is at substantially greater risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the rate and nature of exposure associated with clinical care of positive cases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and stringent infection prevention and control measures aim to mitigate this risk and minimise both nosocomial infection of health-care workers and onward transmission.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> During the initial period, when the case rate was at its peak but PCR testing was not yet widely available, a large proportion of symptomatic health-care workers were not tested. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 prevalence among UK health-care workers remains largely unknown. Where the infection rate in asymptomatic health-care workers is similar to that seen in general community transmission,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> targeted testing of symptomatic individuals might be better placed to inform infection rates among health-care workers.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para40">The evidence for the performance and limitations of various serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is scarce. We searched PubMed for academic publications and online search engines for relevant grey literature on May 1, 2020, and repeated the search on May 26, 2020. A summary provided by Wu and McGoogan in February, 2020, of characteristics and important lessons from China, highlighted the considerable risk to health-care workers of the potential for nosocomial infection. Studies by Hunter and colleagues and Treiber and colleagues provide further insight, through PCR testing, into the burden of COVID-19 in health-care workers in the UK. The capacity to test health-care workers during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK was limited but can now be mitigated by delayed case identification through serology testing, providing insight into the overall burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers. To date, suitably sized studies have not yet been done in the UK.</p>
                  <p id="para50">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">This prospective, multicentre cohort study demonstrates the comparative utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, looking at both lateral flow assays and ELISA approaches. Our study also provides one of the first large-scale insights into seroprevalence data in a cohort of health-care workers with high COVID-19 exposure in the UK. Methodologically, demonstration of colorimetric band intensity on lateral flow assays and its correlation with optical density on ELISA provides a degree of confidence in the interpretation of high-intensity bands but reinforces the limitations of interpretation of lateral flow assays (and risks identification of false positives) when the bands appear weak. Additionally, our study is the first to demonstrate the substantial risks associated with delayed reading of lateral flow assays (in terms of both false positives and false negatives) and is informative when considering delayed reading (eg, postal testing) as part of a testing strategy if shared at this early stage in the planning process.</p>
                  <p id="para70">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Variation in performance characteristics between assays highlights the urgent need for individual evaluation of the large number of commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology tests that have become rapidly available. Practically, the observation of false-negative serology results among health-care workers provides valuable information considering their messaging around interpretation of serology results at this early stage in the scale up of serological testing. False-negative results have a clear impact on the manner in which serological testing might be used to augment and support physical distancing policies, as well as implications for the development of large-scale testing pathways. Further research is required into the full scope of serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and factors associated with failing to mount a detectable immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in otherwise healthy individuals. This study also demonstrates the potential limitations of single-target immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2 and should help inform future research studies, where further evaluation is required not just of alternative assays but also through the comparison of the various epitope targets that are currently available.</p>

              <p id="para90">A variety of pathways to enhance case finding have been considered. These include point-of-care molecular platforms for acute phase testing, and laboratory ELISA or lateral flow serological assays for antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 for delayed case identification.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although lateral flow serological assays potentially offer rapid results in either the point-of-care setting or home reading or postal testing, concern exists around test performance characteristics, particularly in the first 2 weeks after onset of symptoms, as well as their poor positive predictive value when applied to a general population.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> By contrast, although laboratory-based ELISA kits might offer improved test performance characteristics, they have undergone only limited clinical evaluation.</p>
              <p id="para100">We have previously evaluated the performance of lateral flow serological assays against PCR in moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> In the present study we aimed to explore the utility of these assays in a population of health-care workers with mild to moderate community-managed SARS-CoV-2 infection (all health-care workers delivering direct clinical care to high-acuity SARS-CoV-2-positive patients). We compared two lateral flow serological assays against laboratory-based ELISA and PCR, where available, doing an interval analysis of test performance characteristics and their suitability for delayed case identification. Subsequent screening of the remaining symptomatic health-care workers was completed to assess seroprevalence.</p>

                <p id="para110">A prospective multicentre SARS-CoV-2 serological testing programme was implemented on April 8, 2020, and data were collected until June 12, 2020, across two hospitals in London, UK, comprising 6440 employees. Health-care workers were eligible for serological testing if they had delivered direct clinical care to SARS-CoV-2-positive inpatients in cohort areas or isolation rooms involving aerosol-generating procedures; and had experienced mild to moderate symptoms matching the Public Health England (PHE) case definition<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including fever or cough, or both, with breathlessness or anosmia, or both, with onset at least 14 days before testing.</p>
                <p id="para120">Specialist staff (redeployed from HIV and sexual health services) screened staff for clinical symptoms; collected demographic data (including age, sex, ethnicity, and job role); and carried out venepuncture for the serum sample facilitating inoculation of the point-of-care lateral flow serological assay and matched laboratory ELISA.</p>
                <p id="para130">The study was done in two phases. Phase 1 involved an evaluation of serology performance characteristics, comparing the matched lateral flow serological assays with ELISA. Phase 2 comprised an estimate of seroprevalence in symptomatic and asymptomatic health-care workers through further lateral flow serological assay testing. An interval analysis was done once testing had occurred for at least 90% of the reported number of symptomatic health-care workers to human resources during the study period (reached on June 12, 2020). Health-care workers were recruited to the asymptomatic cohort if they had satisfied inclusion criteria as above but had not experienced any PHE-defined COVID-19 symptoms since Dec 1, 2019. Recruitment was consecutive. Statistical analysis was done with IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26).

Lateral flow serological assays were completed as per the manufacturers' instruction leaflets. Lateral flow serological assays were read at 15 min by two clinical staff experienced in the use of point-of-care analysis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>).

As per local hospital guidelines, PCR testing was done where possible between days 1 to 7 inclusive since onset of symptoms. A measure of specificity was derived through testing, with ELISA and lateral flow serological assays, of historical negative serum samples (50 samples from among patients with infectious or inflammatory presentations from August, 2018, and 50 maternal antenatal screening samples from August, 2019). A further evaluation was made on agreement between lateral flow serological assay results and ELISA through interpretation of lateral flow serological assay visual scores in relation to ELISA optical density readings, particularly very weak and weak positive bands, to identify potential issues with variability in reading of lateral flow serological assays. Lateral flow serological assay cassettes were observed at 15 min post-sampling, 2 h post-sampling, and 24 h post-sampling, and readings recorded. If a change was noted in the appearance of a band (negative to positive reading) or disappearance of a band (positive to negative reading) at 2 h or 24 h, a correlation was made against the ELISA result to establish the risk of late readings (eg, if postal return methods are used in conjunction with self-testing).</p>

              <p id="para320">In this study we report good positive and negative predictive values for delayed serological testing in a carefully selected population with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings have the potential to support case identification strategies, depending on the device used. Testing could be particularly useful in improving our understanding of the true prevalence of community managed, mild to moderate infection among high-risk health-care workers while informing the analysis of infection prevention and control strategies for any future waves of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p id="para330">Testing in this high-exposure cohort based in London, UK, has identified several key lessons that could substantially affect future plans for wider serological testing among health-care workers.</p>
              <p id="para340">Although a wide range of rapid diagnostic point-of-care serological assays have emerged in a short period of time, individual assay analysis has been challenging in individuals with mild to moderate infection as numbers of so-called true-positive PCR-tested individuals available for comparison are limited. Concerns about variability in sensitivity between lateral flow serological assays are borne out in our data, when these assays were compared against laboratory ELISAs. We demonstrate good agreement for detection of IgG with the Encode lateral flow serological assay when our pre-test criteria are applied (94·0%); however, there was reduced agreement with the Onsite lateral flow serological assay (84·7%). This result would therefore limit the utility of the Onsite assay even within the high-risk health-care worker population, where a much higher pre-test probability exists than in the general population. Among the PCR-positive subgroup, results were concordant between individual assays, with the Encode lateral flow serological assay identifying 100%, and the Onsite 97%, of health-care workers who were also positive on ELISA. The failure of all three assays to identify PCR-positive health-care workers with PHE-defined symptoms highlights the limitations of relying on any single diagnostic platform, or perhaps identifies a cohort of individuals who did not mount a timely serological response.</p>
              <p id="para350">Where reduced sensitivity among serological assays in the early infection period has been previously described,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> it is clear that any use of such assays in supporting early return-to-work policies could carry considerable risk. Such policies or recommendations should therefore be actively discouraged. Additionally, the proportion of individuals who are seronegative on both ELISA and lateral flow serological assays, despite being PCR-positive, is of concern. Any use of serological testing should be accompanied with a reinforcement of PPE and infection, prevention and control advice, regardless of result, and therefore testing should be undertaken face to face in a clinical setting. Immunity inferred by the presence of antibodies is yet to be determined and clinical counselling of result interpretation at this stage as purely case identification is an important part of the testing process, preventing misunderstanding and incorrect behaviour modification (eg, relaxing physical distancing rules or reducing PPE). This assessment could be done at established UK National Health Service (NHS) facilities, as we have done here, or potentially done via mobile health units as demonstrated by early identification of HIV infection through point-of-care CD4 testing in South Africa.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para360">We found visual scoring of immunochromatography lateral flow serological assay bands to correlate with ELISA optical density. More prominent bands were seen in positive cases and the weakest bands were seen in those initially reported as equivocal. We did, however, find laboratory ELISA-negative samples with very weak lateral flow serological assay bands, casting doubt on the ability to interpret these results. The risk of reporting false positives is likely to be increased further by non-expert reading, such as with home testing seroprevalence studies. Where bands have a strong or medium immunochromatography reading, however, ELISA was positive in almost all (84 [98%] of 86) cases for the Encode lateral flow serological assay, reflecting greater reliability. In comparison, seven of 89 Onsite cassettes with medium to strong bands or strong bands were ELISA negative. Across both lateral flow serological assays, the finding of IgM-only bands might represent greater capability among the lateral flow serological assays to identify positive cases, or false-positive or cross-reactive IgM results. Among the historical negative samples, reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus might have accounted for a false-positive result. Although manufacturers have reported no observed cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses, the sample sizes in the present study were not large enough and further evaluation is required in a larger cohort of health-care workers. An apparent failure to seroconvert to IgG among those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection has been documented in one study and this effect might account for some of the IgM-only cases.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Although we observed IgG-positive results in PCR-positive individuals as late as 2 months after symptom onset, the limited PCR positive rate among health-care workers makes analysis of test performance as a function of time difficult to assess in this study. Further analyses with alternative laboratory ELISA platforms, including those with IgM targets as well as IgG spike-protein receptor-binding-domain targets (in addition to the nucleocapsid protein targets), are urgently required to determine the reasons for these discordant findings. Longitudinal serial testing will also be informative.</p>
              <p id="para370">When considering the utility of lateral flow serological assays, one of the key benefits is the availability of real-time results at the point of testing. Where we investigated delayed reading of lateral flow serological assay cassettes, a considerable number changed at 24 h, becoming either entirely unreadable or leading to the reporting of a different result. This effect has previously been reported with a high incidence of true non-reactive results changing to weak positive when undergoing delayed reading of rapid antibody tests for HIV.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> We therefore strongly advise against any use of lateral flow serological assays in home testing programmes that involve non-expert reading of cassettes or return postage of samples for evaluation at extended time intervals.</p>
              <p id="para380">Early work in PCR testing of health-care workers in the UK, through testing of symptomatic individuals but also through serial screening of asymptomatic individuals, suggests that infection rates in this cohort might reflect wider community transmission rather than primarily nosocomial infection.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This observation is in keeping with first reports of large-scale testing of health-care workers in China.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Where PCR testing is not as widely available, serological testing offers an additional avenue for estimating infection rate among health-care workers. Where fewer than half of those working in the highest risk areas and presenting with PHE-defined symptoms had reactive results, estimation of total rates was similar to previously reported rates. However, we found some discordance in our asymptomatic cohort when compared to previously reported data. Serological screening done among health-care workers in Essen, Germany, found a seropositive rate of 1·6%, of which the majority of individuals did not report PHE-defined symptoms;<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> yet in our study we reported a seroprevalence of 10·6%. Recent data from a study in Oxford, UK, however are supportive of our findings, where 1016 (10·7%) of 9456 IgG-positive results were reported in a large asymptomatic health-care worker cohort.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Although all three studies were done during the same time period, the incidence rate and population density in the UK were considerably higher and such marked variation in seroconversion reflects the impact of geographical variation in exposure intensity and reinforces the need for granular serological data. In stark contrast to seroprevalence among individuals with PHE-defined symptoms (44·7%), the findings from our asymptomatic cohort are perhaps more in keeping with the observed peak among the general population in London (7·1%),<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> with a slight increase reflecting the increased exposure faced by health-care workers. There is growing evidence, however, that those with mild disease are less likely to produce a detectable antibody response than those with more severe disease, and specifically those with lower respiratory tract involvement.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> A relative difference in exposure might also partly explain the observed variability in seroprevalence, with minimal doses of virus perhaps insufficient to induce an adaptive immune response, but instead dealt with by the innate immune system.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In this context, until the differential antibody response and its neutralising capacity in SARS-CoV-2 are better understood, generalised testing of asymptomatic health-care workers, where positive predictive value is substantially reduced, should be done only with considerable caution alongside detailed advice about the current limitations for interpretation. When pre-test criteria are applied (14 days after onset of PHE-defined symptoms), the positive predictive value is substantially increased. Further investigations among this cohort with anti-receptor binding domain assays might provide additional information to the anti-nucleocapsid assay used here, where reduced sensitivity is a clear issue.</p>
              <p id="para390">Although PCR is recognised as the gold standard in the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, our study was limited to a subgroup analysis of PCR-positive health-care workers because of the reduced availability of PCR testing during the early phase of the pandemic. As PCR testing capacity was increased, we conversely noted a substantial decline in health-care workers presenting with acute phase symptoms. Where PCR data were available, reduced sensitivity for all three assays was observed compared to information provided by the manufacturer. This finding might reflect limitations in the use of these assays within individuals with mild to moderate infection, with many assay development characteristics reported in testing of inpatients with severe disease, and supports the requirement of individual assay evaluation within intended populations before widespread use. That our data demonstrate general agreement between lateral flow serological assays and PCR, however, is encouraging, but the reduced agreement among lateral flow serological assays in general is concerning. This potential discrepancy could be explained by the utilisation of separate assay targets (nucleocapsid or spike protein) in lateral flow serological assays. We were unable to discern further target information from both manufacturers. Where clear information remains unavailable for assay targets, as with many currently available commercial lateral flow serological assays, greater understanding of any neutralising effect of different antibodies will be even more important. Although our study was done at multiple sites, its capacity to reflect estimated prevalence in secondary care facilities in London alone and elsewhere was probably limited; appropriately powered studies are now required in locations with a lower estimated prevalence to understand the likely prevalence among health-care workers at a national level. This study is further limited by the use of an IgG-target laboratory ELISA to the nucleocapsid protein only. Additional analysis with a laboratory ELISA capable of detecting the spike protein, and in particular the receptor binding domain, would allow for further evaluation of the reliability of the observed results with lateral flow serological assays.</p>
              <p id="para400">In conclusion, serological testing, whether with laboratory-based ELISA platforms or lateral flow serological assays designed for use at the point of care, offer the potential for late case identification among health-care workers with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found variability in the performance of different lateral flow serological assays when compared against an IgG-target laboratory ELISA. Building on our previously reported work of moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection among inpatients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> we found suitable performance characteristics from the Encode lateral flow serological assay device (and slightly less so with Onsite) but only if utilised in patients with PHE-defined symptoms at least 14 days following symptom onset. Although lateral flow serological assays might provide a clear mechanism to identify those health-care workers who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is crucial to note that cassettes provide incorrect results if delayed reading is done and this must be a key consideration for any future plans for large-scale testing with lateral flow serological assays.</p>

The initial part of this study was deemed a verification of an in-vitro diagnostic test by the Research and Development Office at Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. The second half of this study was undertaken as a service development and registered with the Point-of-care Diagnostics Committee at Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Participants consented for lateral flow assay and subsequent confirmatory ELISA serological testing of their serum samples. Residual sera from historic samples were used as per UK Standards for Microbiology Investigations (PHE gateway number 2015306) and in accordance with The Use of Human Organs and Tissues Act, where ethical approval is not required for the use of residual sera in kit validation or evaluation.</p>
