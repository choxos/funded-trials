                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) is proposed as a treatment mechanism for chronic pain but remains untested in clinical populations. Two interlinked studies; (1) A patient-assessor blinded, randomised, sham-controlled clinical trial and (2) an open-label mechanistic study, sought to examine therapeutic LTD for persons with chronic peripheral nerve injury pain.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">(1) Patients were randomised using a concealed, computer-generated schedule to either active or sham non-invasive low-frequency nerve stimulation (LFS), for 3Â months (minimum 10Â min/day). The primary outcome was average pain intensity (0â10 Likert scale) recorded over 1Â week, at 3Â months, compared between study groups. (2) On trial completion, consenting subjects entered a mechanistic study assessing somatosensory changes in response to LFS.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">(1) 76 patients were randomised (38 per group), with 65 (31 active, 34 sham) included in the intention to treat analysis. The primary outcome was not significant, pain scores were 0.3 units lower in active group (95% CI ââ1.0, 0.3; pâ=â0.30) giving an effect size of 0.19 (Cohenâs D). Two non-device related serious adverse events were reported. (2) In the mechanistic study (nâ=â19) primary outcomes of mechanical pain sensitivity (pâ=â0.006) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (pâ=â0.043) significantly improved indicating reduced mechanical hyperalgesia.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Results from the RCT failed to reach significance. Results from the mechanistic study provide new evidence for effective induction of LTD in a clinical population. Taken together results add to mechanistic understanding of LTD and help inform future study design and approaches to treatment. </p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par33">Neuropathic pain can arise either peripherally or centrally as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. Classification of neuropathic pain syndromes, using quantitative sensory testing (QST) has defined patterns of loss or gain of function across sensory modalities (âsomatosensory profilesâ) which may reflect underlying pain generating mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Neuropathic pain arising from peripheral nerve injury is typically associated with positive sensory signs such as dynamic mechanical allodynia or pinprick hyperalgesia, features thought to reflect the sensitization of central pain pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In rodent models of peripheral nerve injury which feature somatosensory profiles similar to those seen in nerve injury patients, abnormal impulses arising from peripheral nociceptors lead to enhanced pain-responsiveness of spinal cord dorsal-horn neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This initiates an amplification of synaptic transmission in nociceptive pathways termed ânociceptive long-term potentiationâ (LTP), which is a pain-related variant of a ubiquitous mechanism of synaptic memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Experimental nociceptive LTP has been successfully established in humans by modelling the injury-related discharge through focal high-frequency electrical stimulation which facilitates long-lasting hypersensitivity specifically for mechanical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">In rodent models, reversal of nerve-injury induced LTP is achieved through low frequency peripheral nerve stimulation which induces the counterbalancing process of âlong term depressionâ (LTD) where central nociceptive synaptic connections become actively weakened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; low frequency stimulation also reverses high-frequency stimulation-induced nociceptive LTP in uninjured animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and healthy man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Induction of LTD via low frequency stimulation should therefore aptly target persistent painful peripheral nerve injury through lowering enhanced gain in nociceptive pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], however data about the operation of LTD and the effect of low frequency stimulation in these patients is lacking.</p>
              <p id="Par35">In clinical trials, surgical forms of peripheral nerve stimulation do not consistently utilise low frequency stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], whilst the design of low frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) electrodes renders them less suitable for the induction of LTD at a tolerable stimulation level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Low frequency stimulation through a transcutaneous-applied, small spherical electrode possible of inducing LTD has been explored in two uncontrolled trials but remains untested within controlled clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">The current work sought to validate whether LTD can be induced within this clinical population employing an LFS technique and explore the potential efficacy of a non-invasive approach only to elicit LTD-related pain suppression. To do this, we conducted two interlinked studies. The research describes a parallel group, double blinded, sham-controlled randomised trial and an open label mechanistic study assessing psychophysical parameters pre and post low frequency stimulation. We hypothesised that for the open label mechanistic study a significant reduction (pâ=ââ&lt;â0.05) in mechanical pain sensitivity and dynamic mechanical allodynia would be observed following low-frequency stimulation, and that within the RCT a significant difference (pâ=ââ&lt;â0.05) in terms pain reduction in favour of the active treatment would be seen.</p>

                <p id="Par41">Patients were excluded if they had absolute numbness in the affected area, had known treatment contraindications, implantable devices for the same condition, unstable pain intensity of pain medications in the 6Â weeks prior to the trial, had diagnosed psychiatric or mental health disorder or other health conditions/pain which in the opinion of the investigators would make the trial unsuitable, or were unable to comply with the study protocol. Additionally, patients were required to stop any medications that numb affected areas prior to the study to enable stimulation of the peripheral nerves. Lidocaine patches 2Â weeks prior, Capsaicin treatments (both low-, and high concentration) 4Â months prior to stimulation to allow nerve endings to grow back. Patients were requested not to commence any new medications/ treatments that may confuse evaluation of treatment efficacy. All prescribed and non-prescribed treatments were recorded throughout.</p>

Secondary objectives were to assess the benefits associated with treatment to other commonly affected areas such as quality of life, function, mood, self-efficacy (confidence to perform abilities in the presence of pain), reduction of allodynia in the areas of pain, and symptom report. The primary objective for the mechanistic open label study was to establish whether LFS was associated in reduction of enhanced pain-responsiveness in a clinical population, as measured by change in measured sensory features of clinically enhanced pain responsiveness. We hypothesised that within the RCT a significant difference (pâ=ââ&lt;â0.05) in terms pain reduction, would be observed between groups in favour of the active treatment. Whilst for the open label mechanistic study a significant reduction (pâ=ââ&lt;â0.05) in mechanical pain sensitivity and dynamic mechanical allodynia would be observed following low-frequency stimulation.</p>

                  <p id="Par47">Low frequency nerve stimulation through a transcutaneous-applied, small spherical electrode that induces high current density is a long-established method to localize peripheral nerves for nerve blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Active treatment was referred to as the âPen deviceâ and utilised a transcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation device with a pen shaped electrode (Xavant stimpod nms410, Pretoria, South Africa) with pre-set parameters of 2Â Hz (Hz) and 1.0Â ms (ms), and an adjustable stimulation strength of â¤â30 milliamps (mA). The sham device was referred to as âthe flat deviceâ and looked identical but used a flat 5 cm<sup>2</sup> square adhesive electrode and parameters of 2Â Hz, 0.1Â ms,ââ¤â6Â mA (although appeared to allow 30Â mA). The electrode and parameter combination created a perceivable, low current density not eliciting LTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Electrodes stimulated affected nerves, proximal to the focal area of pain and just outside of the identified area of allodynia. LTD requires delivery of â¥â1200 pulses, requiring 10Â min of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To avoid unblinding due to felt or observed differences related to current density or LTD effect within training, the amplitude and stimulation time was limited (&lt;â5ma and &lt;â5Â min) for both the active and sham devices. An independent physiotherapist with experience of stimulation began training by determining the point of stimulation and beginning stimulation for all patients but had no further patient contact- this was safeguard accurate nerve identification for stimulation and to maintain blinding of trial nurses.</p>

                  <p id="Par49">At baseline, the area of mechanical hyperalgesia was mapped using a pinprick stimulus of 256 mN along eight equally spaced tracks originating from the epicentre of pain. Then, a circular intervention array of 10 punctate electrodes (each 250Â Âµm diameter), designed to preferentially activate small diameter epidermal nerve fibres (5), was placed over the epicentre of the pain. This electrode delivers electrical pulses using a constant current stimulator (Digitimer DS7A, UK). Baseline QST was then performed on areas directly adjacent the intervention array-electrode to obtain a comprehensive somatosensory profile, using the standardised German Research Network quantitative sensory testing (DFNS) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. As part of this protocol, mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) was assessed as the mean of the pain ratings in response to a geometric series of 8â512 mN calibrated pinpricks at factor 2 progression, and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) as pain to gentle stroking touch (cotton wisp, QT-tip, soft brush); these MPS/DMA series were scheduled at the end of the QST procedure and were spaced by approximately 5Â min between each. Then, electrical detection threshold was determined with single 2Â ms duration electrical pulses of increasing strength through the array electrode using method of limits (felt/not felt). The subsequent LFS intervention consisted of a train of 2000 electrical, 2Â ms duration, stimuli delivered through the array electrode at 1Â Hz. Stimulation strength was initially 10âÃâEDT but, due to poor tolerability was reduced to 5âÃâEDT for the final 6 study patients. Directly after LFS stimulation, the hyperalgesic area was measured again and then MPS and DMA were determined as before.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par90">We performed a combined RCT and mechanistic study to assess the effect of LFS via peripheral nerve stimulation treatment in patients with neuropathic pain after nerve injury. Mechanistic study results demonstrate consistent evidence for the induction of pain-LTD, and a corresponding significant reduction in stimulus-evoked pains in the affected areas, i.e., reduced hyperalgesia, which was further supported by the RCT outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par91">External non-invasive low frequency peripheral nerve stimulation did not significantly reduce patientsâ spontaneous pain, the primary RCT outcome. A trend toward a positive outcome across all outcomes in response to the active treatment rather than a definite effect supported by statistical change was observed. The intervention was well tolerated.</p>
              <p id="Par92">As mechanisms between neuropathic pains differ, we assessed QST profiles for all patients entering the mechanistic study at baseline and the results confirm that we had recruited the targeted group of patients who displayed a mechanical hyperalgesia sensory profile (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); this profile is thought to reflect prominent central sensitisation due to nociceptive LTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The results from the mechanistic study confirm that LFS effected clear reductions of the patientsâ stimulus-evoked pains, indicating the effective operation of pain-LTD. This is supported by exploratory RCT outcomes that showed significant reduction in dynamic mechanical allodynia (pâ=â0.006). Improvement in pinprick analgesia was larger than DMA reduction in the mechanistic study (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), in keeping with current evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par93">The underpinning mechanism for pain-LTD is an intermediate rise of postsynaptic calcium concentration in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons (&gt;â1Â ÂµM/L) inducing long-lasting depotentiation of synaptic transmission via increased phosphatase activity, diminishing postsynaptic LTP maintenance mechanisms. Under conditions of LTD only a small volume of calcium permeates into the post synaptic cell, which reduces the availability of receptors by translocation and consequently weakens synaptic efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The principle, that LFS can induce pain-related LTD to treat established pain-LTP, had earlier been established in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This study is the first to confirm that LTD can be induced via LFS within a neuropathic pain clinical population, supporting the rationale for the therapeutic approach.</p>
              <p id="Par94">Unlike in preliminary open-labelled studies using the same stimulator device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], reduction of stimulus-evoked pain was not paralleled by significantly reduced spontaneous pain within the RCT. Although it is possible that LFS does not reduce spontaneous pain intensity, several lines of evidence suggest that this outcome may reflect both sub-optimal stimulation intensity and frequency. In the mechanistic study, LTD was successfully induced by painful LFS stimulation at 5âÃâEDT, whereas in the RCT patients determined stimulus strength ad libitum. Post-hoc telephone interviews illustrated that only patients who experienced the stimulation in the active arm as painful, but none of the other patients found the treatment beneficial. Painfulness of an electrical stimulus is a function of the stimulus strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and evidence from volunteer studies indicates that a just noticeably painful stimulus strength of 2â10âÃâdetection threshold is effective while weaker or stronger stimuli are either less effective or completely ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is likely, therefore, that for maximal effect, clinically the LFS intensity should be mildly painful and that adherence to initial instructions was not consistently followed by the RCT participants. Furthermore, post-hoc telephone interviews indicated that most patients used the stimulator at a set daytime regardless of their actual pain experiences. This would suggest that patients viewed treatment as something that acted over a 24-h period (like a drug). As the duration of the LTD effect is unlikely to exceed a few hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], patients may therefore have missed out the potential of using the treatment to target either spontaneous- or activity-induced pain increases that would be variable during the day. Patient education in relation to treatment mechanisms, required stimulation strength and timing of treatment may therefore optimize clinical benefit by individually tailoring the stimulation but require further evaluation.</p>
              <p id="Par95">It is, however, also possible that reduction in stimulus-evoked pain in some patients does not fully translate into reduction of their spontaneous pain. Although we were recently able to show in a genotypeâphenotype association study that more punctate hyperalgesia predicted stronger ongoing pain the correlation still remained low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. A disconnect between spontaneous and stimulus evoked neuropathic pain has been illustrated elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Topical lidocaine has been shown to reduce DMA for up to 3Â months in patients with neuropathic pain after knee surgery, without global pain reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; and mechanical allodynia has been demonstrated in the absence of spontaneous pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Any partial disconnect between reductions in stimulus-evoked and spontaneous pains may reflect the multiplicity of mechanisms and the heterogeneous nature of neuropathic pain and treatments even within stratified sensory subgroups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We demonstrated in both studies reduction in enhanced pain sensitivity following low-frequency nerve stimulation. This therefore appears to be a consistent effect associated with low frequency nerve stimulation. A decrease in marked skin sensitivity represents an important change in pain presentation and may still be considered/desired as a meaningful effect for patients in the absence of spontaneous pain reduction.</p>
              <p id="Par96">Pain is a subjective experience and therefore how it is evaluated will depend on contextual factors such as emotional wellbeing, physical functioning, and social occupational factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Due to the context of outcome evaluation in both studies contextual outcomes will have been of greater influence in the clinical trial. This is of relevance when we consider changes in pain evaluation was not significant in the clinical trial whilst significant change was seen for non-contextual QST outcomes in the mechanistic study. It is difficult for studies to measure relevant contextual factors and whilst the exploratory measures within the clinical trial in part attempted to do this, we were unable to find any association between exploratory measures and pain outcomes.</p>
              <p id="Par97">The current work was informed by clear mechanistic objectives and presents a novel approach of combining clinical and mechanistic study designs to evaluate and validate therapeutic potential. The RCT included successful recruitment and retention of a very specific group of patients with neuropathic pain, verified by QST, in consenting patients, which also validates the clinical recruitment criteria used. Patient selection could have been further strengthened by the inclusion of neuropathic pain specific screening questionnaires. The development and use of a true sham intervention with some perceivable but in-efficient stimulation parameters is a further strengthâthe lack of credible sham intervention has previously been noted as a limitation in neuromodulation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The study achieved a high level of patient adherence resulting in high data quality reducing uncertainty, and active and comparator groups were well balanced.</p>
              <p id="Par98">A limitation of the mechanistic study was the exclusion of a measure of spontaneous pain. Spontaneous post-test pain has a strong subjective component whilst other QST measures provide more objective assessments of pain processing. Given the subjective nature of this measure and the lengthy testing protocol (4Â h) within the mechanistic study, we considered this measure would be too confounded to provide useful data. Ways of overcoming this should be considered in future study designs. Reduction in spontaneous pain intensity was not observed in the RCT and therefore LFS may not reduce spontaneous pain. We also recognise that suboptimal stimulation in the RCT may have influenced outcomes. The RCT protocol allowed patients to continue treatment without further advice or corrections after initial training. Post-hoc interviews have highlighted that this approach might have diminished the interventionâs effectiveness. Furthermore, within the RCT patients stimulated just outside the area of pain whilst in the mechanistic study stimulation was performed within the area of pain. Stimulation outside the area of the parent axon would have required deeper depth of penetration to drive axonal transmission along the nerve to the area of pain. Evaluation of stimulator use was limited as devices were not equipped with a system to monitor compliance or settings. Additionally, stimulation parameters were not recorded as part of the study. In normal practice, suboptimal stimulation may be improved with education relating to stimulation electrode positioning and coverage, but due to blinding this was not possible in the RCT.</p>
              <p id="Par99">A further limitation to the RCT is the inclusion of patients who may not have benefited from treatment such as patients on high dose opioids, psychological co-morbidities or potentially unresponsive to single nerve stimulation pain conditions which could have inadvertently underpowered the study. For example, we included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN, nâ=â3 sham), radiotherapy induced nerve pain (nâ=â2, active) and medication induced nerve pain (nâ=â1, sham). PHN is typically associated with multisegmented dorsal horn atrophy which in turn limits the ability to correctly target a singular peripheral nerve with stimulation. Whilst radiotherapy and medication induced nerve pain is rarely confined to the distribution of one nerve. The three patients included with the later indications all experienced hand pain and only reported pain in the radial or ulnar nerve territory following said treatments; of note none of these patients had participated in the mechanistic study.</p>
              <p id="Par100">A further RCT limitation was incomplete availability of QST data for all patients included in the RCT. Broad availability of QST information might aid better understanding of responder and non-responder profiles supporting the stratification of patients in future studies. Patients were asked to indicate if they felt they had been assigned to a more or less effective intervention. Within the active group, most patients correctly identified that they had received the more effective treatment which may reflect that more patients experienced treatment benefit. A formal assessment of blinding however was not included during initial training, i.e., <italic>before</italic> delivery of any effective stimulation and therefore we cannot confidently exclude any unaccounted-for unblinding effect and its impact on outcome.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par101">Neuropathic pain can persist long after the initial cause has resolved and is often severely debilitating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], affecting patientsâ physical, economic, and emotional wellbeing and current treatment options have only modest outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Results from our mechanistic study provide novel evidence for effective induction of long-term depression in a clinical population, an important requisite step to advance research and therapy in this area. Evidence from the RCT for the primary outcome of pain reduction failed to reach significance. Taken together results demonstrate the potential of low frequency stimulation and the need for further application enhancement, which will help inform future study design, and approaches to treatment. Low frequency stimulation is well tolerated, comparing favorably with drug treatments for the same patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p>
