                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>There is a significant treatment gap, with only a few community-based services for people with schizophrenia in low-income and middle-income countries. Poor treatment adherence in schizophrenia is associated with poorer health outcomes, suicide attempts and death. We previously reported the effectiveness of supervised treatment in outpatients for schizophrenia (STOPS) for improving treatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia. However, STOPS was evaluated in a tertiary care setting with no primary care involvement, limiting its generalisability to the wider at-risk population. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of STOPS+ in scaling up the primary care treatment of schizophrenia to a real-world setting.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The effectiveness of the STOPS+ intervention in improving the level of functioning and medication adherence in patients with schizophrenia in Pakistan will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial design. We aim to recruit 526 participants from 24 primary healthcare centres randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio to STOPS+ intervention and enhanced treatment as usual arms. Participants will be followed-up for 12 months postrecruitment. The sample size is estimated for two outcomes (1) the primary clinical outcome is level of functioning, measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning scale and (2) the primary process outcome is adherence to treatment regimen measured using a validated measure. An intention-to-treat approach will be used for the primary analysis.</p>

The results of the STOPS+ trial will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences and disseminated to local stakeholders and policymakers.</p>

                  <p>This study aims to evaluate an approach that can be used for scaling up treatment for schizophrenia in resource poor settings and specifically addresses the gap in schizophrenia treatment.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>To the best of our knowledge, this is first study that uses a directly observed treatment short-course approach translated from an infectious disorder, that is, tuberculosis to a non-communicable disorder for scaling up the treatment for schizophrenia.</p>

                <list-item>
                  <p>The intervention involves primary care in treatment of schizophrenia in community, which is rarely done in low-income and middle-income country.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Schizophrenia is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Existing evidence-based interventions for schizophrenia have been poorly implemented and most LMICs have large treatment gap for schizophrenia.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The treatment gap represents the disparity between the true prevalence of a disorder and the treated proportion of individuals diagnosed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pakistan has one of the largest treatment gaps for schizophrenia, at an estimated 96%, this is contrast to an estimated median of 32.2% globally and 69% in LMICs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> This treatment gap is attributed to a number of factors including poor treatment adherence with average non-treatment adherence rates of about 50% in schizophrenia,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> level of disability, a lack of primary care involvement and little to no access to treatment.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This is a particularly important factor in rural areas, where healthcare resources are often diminished in comparison to urban centres.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> While the cost of antipsychotic medication in Pakistan is relatively low, economic and logistical factors remain significant barriers to medication access<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the purchase of antipsychotic medication is often at the expense of other forms of essential out-of-pocket healthcare or even food.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p>
              <p>Reducing the treatment gap for schizophrenia in LMICs is critical. Medication non-adherence in patients with schizophrenia is associated with 2.8 times increased risk in hospital admission.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The risk of death in patients who receive even minimal treatment is significantly reduced compared with patients receiving no treatment at all.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, untreated psychosis can at least double the costs of managing chronic comorbid physical health conditions, leading to an increased stress on an already overburdened healthcare system.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>We previously reported a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of supervised treatment in outpatients for schizophrenia (STOPS) in Peshawar, Pakistan.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> STOPS was developed using the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and was modelled on the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) intervention to improve treatment adherence for people with tuberculosis (TB). The DOTS approach involves a TB worker or a family member directly supervising the patient taking all medication and recording this.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> DOTS is one of the most successful public health interventions and has been shown to be as highly effective in the community as it is in specialist clinics, which in addition to its accessibility and low cost, which make it a highly appropriate intervention model for LMICs. Using the similar approach, STOPS intervention involved a family member of a person with schizophrenia observing and recording that medication had been taken. The family member is trained for this purpose. A previous evaluation of STOPS in a tertiary care setting showed that the STOPS significantly improved treatment adherence and functioning as well reducing patient symptoms.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
              <p>The original STOPS intervention was evaluated in a tertiary care setting by mental health professionals, with no primary care involvement, limiting its scaling up and generalisability. Through a programme of qualitative work with key stakeholders in Pakistan, including patients, carers, healthcare professionals, researchers and local traditional healers, we adapted the STOPS model to STOPS+ with the aim of scaling up the intervention and involving primary care in the management of schizophrenia.</p>
              <p>Here, we outline the protocol for evaluating the STOPS+ in a real-world setting using a cluster RCT design.</p>

                <p>The intervention will be implemented and evaluated in the Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). KP is one of four provinces in Pakistan located in the North West region with an estimated population of 20.7 million. Health expenditure in Pakistan is about 1% of the gross domestic product with no separate provision for mental health services. The primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in KP are provided by a network of basic health units, civil dispensaries and rural health centres. Typically, each PHC facility consists of a primary care physician, a multipurpose PHC technician (MT) and a female health worker.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Training PHC providers to manage mental health conditions and the incorporation of mental health services into primary care are both envisaged in the current health policy but have not yet been fully realised.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p>

                <title>The control: ETAU</title>
                <p>Typically, in Pakistan, treatment for schizophrenia consists of accessing hospital-based psychiatric services with little to no involvement of PHC and a limited provision of medication from the hospital pharmacy. ETAU provided in the control clusters will include the treatment received by patients’ routine healthcare setting, which includes treatment provided by a psychiatrist in the outpatient clinics of the psychiatry department of the local hospital and brief counselling about the treatment and outcome of the disorder. Patients may be admitted to an inpatient unit at the hospital. This will be enhanced in the control cluster PHCs with training provided to PHC physicians in WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (MhGAP) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/en/t">https://www.who.int/mental_health/mhgap/en/t</ext-link>) in addition to the regular and reliable provision of psychotropic drugs at the PHC. The patients will be informed that the antipsychotic medication is available in the PHC centre and they can access the centre for supply of medication. The PHC physician will have the option to liaise with the treating psychiatrist, as provided in the MhGAP guidelines.</p>

                  <p>A family member who is living with the patient for a minimum of 6 months prior to recruitment to the trial will be nominated by the patient. The family member will dispense medication, observe that is has been taken correctly and record this information on a simple sheet of paper designed and used in the previous STOPS trial.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Family members will be reminded to administer the medication by an automated text message system, which will also request a response once the medication has been taken correctly. The text message reminders will be sent everyday for the first 3 months after starting the treatment. If the family member does not have access to a mobile phone, a handset and training in using it will be provided.</p>
                  <p>A multipurpose technician (MPT) from each PHC centre will provide training to family members for the storage and administration of the medication, recording when the medication has been taken correctly and the importance of maintaining the family dynamic.</p>

SMART will provide two-way communication between mental healthcare professionals. One month’s supply of medication will be made available, via their PHC, to the family member.

                <p>The use of theory to inform the development of behaviour change interventions is strongly advocated by experts in the field. We have designed the process of implementation using theory developed for implementation and tested previously in UK Primary Care Practice.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> We will evaluate the barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention using qualitative methods. We will hold at least four focus groups (with patients and carers, MPTs, traditional and faith healers and primary care clinicians) in which we will explore the barrier and facilitators to supervising the treatment of schizophrenia in the community, modification of the STOPS programme to STOPS+ for use in the community and the present status of schizophrenia care in the community</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>STOPS+ is underpinned by culturally appropriate and context-bespoke patient and public community engagement and involvement at every stage of the project (intervention development, RCT and process evaluation). The STOPS+ intervention will be refined with input from the key stakeholder groups including patients, carers, health professionals, local councillors, community leaders such as religious leaders and community experts and policymakers. Small group meetings using local Jirgas (Jirga is traditional, local participatory and decision-making body which is well established in Pathan culture and brings together local tribal, ethnic and religious leaders) will help in community engagement.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title>
                <p>Randomisation will occur at the PHC level, where PHCs will be allocated at a ratio of 1:1 to either deliver the STOPS+ intervention or ETAU. Twenty-four PHCs will be recruited to the study, 12 will be randomised to deliver ETAU and 12 will be randomised to deliver the STOPS+ programme. PHC randomisation will be stratified by urban/rural setting. Randomisation will be carried out by an independent statistician at the Khyber Medical University (KMU), Peshawar by using a remote computer-generated random sequence. Randomisation and will be based on the list of primary care centres in Peshawar, provided by the health department of KP. The urban/rural classification is determined as per the Peshawar district council. It is not possible to blind study participants from their treatment arm allocation. However, the assessment team that conducts the baseline and follow-up assessments (6 and 12 months) will be masked to the treatment arm of the cluster. The outcome measures will be administered by trained research assessment teams (outcome assessors), who are independent of the intervention team and the team involved in consenting and screening. The outcome assessment will not be carried out at any participating PHC. The assessment teams will be told that they are evaluating two interventions and that there is genuine equipoise about which one is better. Study participants will be instructed to not discuss the PHC they are attending or the treatment details. During all assessments, the primary outcome measures (treatment adherence scale and GAF) will be completed first to minimise the risk of bias in the event of unmasking and, if it occurs, the point of unmasking will be recorded. Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the effect of unmasking on the primary outcomes. The data linking each PHC with treatment allocation status is kept separate from the outcome dataset until the time of the final analysis. The trial statistician will be blind to allocation status.</p>

                <p>After identification of potentially eligible patients, they will first be orally informed about the trial by one of the health workers in the local Pushto language (MT in the community or a health professional in one of the health facilities mentioned above). They will be asked whether they agree that a member of the research team will provide them with further information about the research. If permission is given, a research assistant will meet with the patient and will request informed consent. The informed consent for participation in the study will be taken within 1 week of the first contact. Participants will be free to decline to participate or withdraw at any time without their routine healthcare being affected. Before taking part in any interviews, oral and written information about the study and its purpose will be provided to respondents in the local language.</p>
                <p>After obtaining informed consent, the research assistant will decide whether the patient meets the inclusion criteria and have a family member who is willing to supervise the treatment as specified in the STOPS+ procedures. If the patient is not eligible from the screening assessment, the reason for ineligibility will be explained to the patient and they will be signposted for further advice and to continue to receive treatment at their routine health facility. Eligible patients will be provided with a further participant information sheet about the trial. Additionally, for those in the intervention arm, the nominated relative will receive a participant information sheet about the trial and about the tasks required in supervising the treatment If nominated family member is available with the patient, this information will be provided at the same time. If the family member is not available, patients and the family member will be asked to visit the health facility again within 1 week. The patient and the relative will each be given the opportunity to ask any questions about the trial. The information sheets are provided in Urdu. For illiterate patients, the research assistants will explain the same information in local Pushto language or in Urdu. Following the informed consent, the baseline data will be collected.</p>

Thus, the study is adequately powered to detect significant differences (at the level of two-tailed alpha of 0.05 in each case) across the two distinct primary outcomes: (1) the primary clinical outcome (GAF) and (2) the primary process outcome (medication adherence).</p>

                <p>Statistical analysis will be performed blind to cluster allocation. Primary analysis will be on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, with all participants analysed in their cluster. Between-group differences for both primary outcome measures (GAF and medication adherence) will be analysed using longitudinal mixed models that accommodate clustering at the (upper/hierarchical) practice level as well as repeated outcome measurements across three time points (baseline, 6 and 12 months) per participant, that is, linear/logistic mixed models for numerical and categorical outcomes, respectively, including PHC and participant as random factors. These models will be used to quantify the absolute between group difference in the primary clinical outcome (GAF) and odds ratio (and extracted absolute difference) for the primary process outcome (% adherence)—using linear and logistic models, respectively. For the GAF, the primary endpoint is the ‘average’ GAF over 6 and 12 months using available and modelled data to estimate the combined summary average mean difference in GAF between treatment arms over the 6-month and 12-month timeline; statistical significance in this case being given against two-tailed p=0.05. Though the ‘average’ is the single primary endpoint for the GAF, we will also evaluate the treatment-by-time interaction to give estimates of between-arm mean differences at the individual 6 and 12 months follow-up time points (secondary endpoints).</p>
                <p>For medication adherence, between-group comparison at both 6 and 12 months is primary (derived through treatment-by-time interaction within the generalised mixed model)—hence, the requirement to take into account the multiple testing by assessing significance against a more conservative two-tailed p=0.025. Estimates of between-group mean differences will be given including 95% CIs and p values. The mixed models (detailed above) will be adjusted for age, gender, baseline GAF score and corresponding baseline score of the outcome being measured as individual-patient-level covariates, PHC-level characteristics (PHC size), stratification variable (rural/urban) and a random effect for the PHC. Mixed-model analysis fulfils the ITT principle with missing data being accounted for under the missing at random assumption.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>People suffering from schizophrenia represent one of the most disadvantaged groups in LMICs facing a wide mental health treatment gap. A number of psychosocial interventions have been evaluated in RCTs and there is consensus that the treatment of schizophrenia should combine antipsychotic medication and psychosocial interventions.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, there is limited evidence how these interventions can be implemented in the real-world settings.</p>
              <p>The proposed study adopts an implementation approach addressing systemic barriers to reduce treatment gap for schizophrenia in the community. The STOPS+ intervention aims to address three major implementation barriers (1) improving supply of antipsychotic medication at primary care level, (2) involving primary care workers in the treatment of schizophrenia and (3) improving treatment adherence by involving family members in supervising treatment. The STOPS+ approach therefore goes beyond most psychosocial interventions evaluated in the treatment of schizophrenia in LMICs<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> in addressing the health system, community and service users-related factors to improve access to treatment.</p>
              <p>A unique aspect of the trial is that it is powered for both process and clinical outcomes. These two primary outcomes are (1) a clinical outcome measure—GAF and (2) a process outcome measure—adherence to medication. This combined with a process evaluation carried out after completion of the cluster RCT will provide much needed evidence on the implementation of community-based interventions for schizophrenia in LMICs settings. The WHO Mental Health Action Plan (2013–2020) requires that there is an absolute increase of 20% in service coverage for severe mental disorders.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The results of the trial may help to understand the processes and implementation strategies to achieve that goal and could provide an effective public health intervention for schizophrenia.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p>
              <p>A major strength of the STOPS intervention is that it is based on an infectious disease model that has been successfully used in improving treatment adherence for TB, that is, DOTS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.searo.who.int/tb/topics/what_dots/en/">http://www.searo.who.int/tb/topics/what_dots/en/</ext-link>) as a public health intervention. The DOTS model is currently being used in most LMICs, including the settings of this trial. This can potentially help in integration of the care for a non-communicable chronic disorder like schizophrenia in the public health systems of LMICs.</p>
