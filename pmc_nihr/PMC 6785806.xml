                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi is a major cause of fever in children in low- and
middle-income countries. The recently WHO prequalified typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV)
was shown to be efficacious in a human challenge model but no efficacy trials in endemic
populations have been completed.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="st2">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this phase III participant- and observer-blinded randomized controlled trial in
Lalitpur, Nepal, children aged 9 months to &lt;16 years of age, were randomized 1:1
to receive either TCV or a capsular group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Men A) as
control. The primary endpoint was blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever. Study follow-up
continues for 2 years; here we present the interim analysis after 12 months of
follow-up, for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>10,005 participants received TCV and 10,014 received Men A. Blood culture-confirmed
typhoid fever occurred in 7 participants who received TCV and 38 receiving Men A;
vaccine efficacy: 81.6% (95% CI, 58.8%, 91.8%, P&lt;0.001). 132 SAEs occurred in the
first 6 months with one (pyrexia) identified as vaccine-related. The participant remains
blinded. Seroconversion (≥ four-fold rise in Vi-IgG 28 days after vaccination)
was 99% in the TCV group (N=677/683) and 2% in the control group (N=8/380).</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>A single dose of TCV is safe, immunogenic, and effective, and the deployment of the
vaccine will reduce the burden of typhoid in high-risk populations. This new evidence of
efficacy is especially timely with the recent spread of extensively drug resistant
typhoid fever which threatens child health in affected regions.</p>

              <p>Typhoid fever is a systemic illness caused by the <italic>Salmonella enteric</italic>
serovar Typhi. An estimated 11 to 21 million cases of febrile illness, and 117,000 to
161,000 deaths are attributed to the disease each year<sup><xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Typhoid fever is a major public health problem in Kathmandu, Nepal<sup><xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> where <italic>S.</italic> Typhi accounts for up to 45% of all positive
blood cultures and is the leading cause of blood-stream infections among pediatric patients
<sup><xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Typhoid is seasonal in Kathmandu, with a high season in
July/August and lower incidence in winter. Annual population incidence of typhoid and
paratyphoid combined has been recently estimated as 449 (95% CI, 383, 521) per 100,000
<sup><xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Antibiotic-resistant S. Typhi
is increasingly common in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) variants of S. Typhi
have recently emerged in other nearby South Asian countries such as India and Bangladesh,
and a large outbreak is ongoing in Pakistan, leading to a situation in which the disease in
South Asian populations is becoming increasingly difficult to treat<sup><xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The WHO recommended the use of typhoid vaccines in 2008<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> but, vaccine-based control programs have not been widely
implemented. Oral live attenuated Ty21a vaccine and Vi-polysaccharide vaccine (Vi-PS) were
available but are either not tolerated (Ty21a) or poorly immunogenic in the youngest
children and therefore deemed unsuitable for widespread use. A prototype TCV, Vi-rEPA (Vi
conjugated to recombinant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> exotoxin A) had over 90%
efficacy in children aged 2-5 years in clinical trials in 2001 but is not available.</p>
              <p>More recently, new generation typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCV), containing Vi
polysaccharide conjugated to a tetanus-toxoid protein carrier, have become available. In a
phase III safety and immunogenicity study, TCV was found to be highly immunogenic and safe
in young children<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in a
stringent typhoid controlled infection challenge model among adults in a non-endemic
setting, TCV had a protective efficacy of 54.6% (95% CI, 26.8%, 71.8%)<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>In October 2017, based on these immunogenicity and human challenge study results, the WHO
SAGE recommended the use of TCV over the other available typhoid vaccines in view of its
improved immunological properties, suitability for use in infants and young children, and
expected longer duration of protection<sup><xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, also approved a funding window for 2019-2020
to support the introduction of TCVs in developing countries. To aid Gavi-eligible countries
to accelerate the introduction of TCVs, the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC)
was formed<sup><xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. We conducted the first
individually randomized phase III trial of the efficacy of TCV in an endemic population, to
inform vaccine implementation strategies. Herein, we report the interim results of this
trial after one-year of follow-up.</p>

                <title>Study Design and Participants</title>
                <p>A phase III, participant- and observer-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in
Lalitpur Metropolitan City of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Full methodology has been
previously described <sup><xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Briefly, children aged 9 months to
&lt;16 years living in the study catchment area, who were in good health at the time
of enrolment, and whose parents/ legal guardian were willing and competent to provide
informed consent were eligible to participate in the study. The lower age limit of 9
months was chosen to align with the potential future programmatic use of TCV given with
measles vaccine at 9 months of age.</p>
                <p>The study (ISRCTN43385161, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN43385161">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN43385161</ext-link>) was approved by the Oxford Tropical
Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC 15–17) and the Nepal Health Research Council

                <p>Vi polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (TCV, Typbar-TCV Bharat-Biotech,
Hyderabad, India) containing 25 µg of Vi-polysaccharide per 0·5 mL dose was
used as the trial vaccine for all age groups. Meningococcal capsular Group A conjugate
vaccine (MenA; MenAfriVac, Serum Institute of India PVT Ltd) was the control vaccine (see

                <title>Randomization and Blinding</title>
                <p>Participants received either TCV or the control vaccine using 1:1 stratified block
randomization with block sizes randomly varying from 2-6. Stratification was done by age
(9 months to ≥5 years old or &gt;5 years old to &lt;16 years). Participants
were randomized after consent and general examination using a bespoke randomization
application loaded on an electronic tablet device.</p>
                <p>A sub-set of children were further randomized on a 2:1 basis (1000 TCV: 500 control) to
have blood drawn for immunogenicity.</p>
                <p>Parents, guardians, participants, clinicians, and trial staff were blinded to vaccine
allocation. Only the unblinded vaccinating staff were aware of the vaccine given and were
not subsequently involved in participant follow-up.</p>

                <title>Outcomes: Assessment of Vaccine Efficacy</title>
                <p>Blood cultures were taken from any study participant with ≥2 days of self-reported
fever AND/OR a temperature of ≥ 38°C presenting to Patan hospital or 18
community-based study fever clinics. Trained physicians attended to patients, and consent
was obtained for blood culture. Three-monthly follow-up phone calls were used to capture
additional possible typhoid fever cases in participants who attended non-study facilities.
Where available, medical records were reviewed to capture blood culture-confirmed typhoid
diagnoses made at non-study hospitals and clinics. Self-treated typhoid cases, cases
treated but without a blood culture taken, and cases not reported to the study team will
not be captured in these study data.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome was blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever.</p>

                <title>Assessment of Safety</title>
                <p>Participants were observed at the vaccination site for at least 20 minutes after the
vaccine was administered. All participants were given a diary to capture local and
systemic adverse events. Participants' parents/guardians were then contacted by
telephone at Day 7, to record any vaccine-related adverse events and all serious adverse
events (SAEs). SAEs continue to be captured through ongoing three-monthly follow-up calls
and visits.</p>

                <title>Immunogenicity</title>
                <p>Anti-Vi IgG titres were measured from plasma samples collected at Day 0 and Day 28, at
the Oxford Vaccine Group Laboratory, University of Oxford, using a commercial ELISA kit
(VaccZyme, The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Further blood samples will be collected at 18 months and 2 years of
follow-up.</p>

                <title>Interim Analysis</title>
                <p>The target sample size for the study was 20,000 children (see supplementary files for
further details).</p>
                <p>Over the two-year trial follow-up period 45 cases of typhoid fever were expected if the
assumptions underlying the sample size held true (see supplementary files for further
details). While this was originally designed as a two-year study, given the public health
significance of the results, an interim analysis was planned after at least one year of
follow-up had been completed, if 45 cases were observed by this time. The interim analysis
therefore has full statistical power for the primary outcome. The protocol was amended to
include the interim analysis when it became clear that the 45 cases may be reached before
2 years of follow-up. The interim analysis was agreed by the international data safety and
monitoring board on August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018, approximately 9 months into the study and
received ethical approval. Study participants and staff were not unblinded as part of the
interim analysis and follow-up continues.</p>

              <sec id="sec2.8">
                <title>Statistical Analysis</title>
                <p>The primary analysis of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever included only those cases
that occurred at least 14 days after vaccination. Additionally, secondary outcomes
reported in this interim analysis include adverse events within the first 7 days after
vaccination, SAEs within 6 months of vaccination and immunogenicity in the first 28 days.
Full analysis of all study outcomes will be reported at the end of the study.</p>
                <p>For the interim analysis of the primary outcome, the incidence of typhoid fever was
estimated as the number of cases divided by the total number of person-years of follow-up.
Vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated as (1 – IRR) x 100%, where IRR is the
incidence rate ratio (the ratio of the incidence in the TCV arm compared to the control
arm).</p>
                <p>All p-values were 2-sided; a p value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant in efficacy
assessment. Serious adverse events, local and systemic vaccine reactions, and baseline
characteristics were not compared statistically.</p>
                <p>The cumulative incidence of typhoid fever is presented using the Kaplan-Meier method. A
detailed statistical analysis plan covering all analyses was agreed and signed by
investigators prior to unblinding of study data for analysis and further details are
included in the supplementary files.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>This is the first large-scale field trial to assess the efficacy of a WHO prequalified
typhoid conjugate vaccine in children in an endemic setting and shows that a single dose of
TCV is safe, immunogenic, efficacious, and has the potential to save thousands of lives.
Incidence was 428 per 100,000 in our control group, confirming the high burden of disease in
children in this setting.</p>
              <p>Large-scale vaccination strategies using TCV can potentially reduce the burden of enteric
fever, an important goal given the global increase in antimicrobial resistance. The rise in
extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid severely limits treatment options. Over 5000 cases
of XDR typhoid have been reported in Pakistan since the outbreak began in 2016, with cases
also being reported in travelers returning from Pakistan. Deployment of the vaccine in
Pakistan, as is being done, and beyond, is of paramount importance to curb the spread of the
drug resistant strain regionally and transcontinentally.</p>
              <p>A single dose of TCV resulted in a reduction in typhoid fever by 81.6% in children in our
study. This protective efficacy is higher than that of Vi-PS which was estimated to have 35%
to 65% efficacy in trials in Pakistan and India respectively <sup><xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and higher
than live attenuated oral typhoid vaccines<sup><xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The results are similar to the 91.1% (95% CI, 77.1%, 96.6%) efficacy
seen with two doses of Vi-rEPA in Vietnam in 1997<sup><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The results are also consistent with the seroefficacy estimates (85%,
95% CI 80%, 88%) of TCV extrapolated from serological responses in the phase 3 trial in
India<sup><xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.The vaccine efficacy was
54.6% (95%CI, 26.8%, 71.8%) in a human challenge study conducted in Oxford<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. However, the challenge model used a
composite definition of typhoid fever that included self-resolving asymptomatic bacteraemia
not detected in the field, adults rather than children, and a probable high challenge dose
(following neutralization of gastric acid), which could provide some explanation as to why
vaccine efficacy was lower compared with our results.</p>
              <p>TCV is highly immunogenic, eliciting a strong antibody response one month after
vaccination. This is consistent with previous findings in immunogenicity trials <sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Immunogenicity trials in
children and adults in India reported seroconversion rates of over 90% across different age
strata at day 42 post-vaccination compared to baseline titres and a four-fold rise in anti
Vi- antibody titre occurred 2 to 5 times more often in the TCV group in comparison with the
Vi-PS group<sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The Vi-rEPA study
reported that Vi-IgG increased by a factor of more than 575 (P&lt;0.001) four weeks
after administration of the conjugate Vi-rEPA vaccine, although using a different
assay<sup><xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Conjugate vaccines are
T-cell dependent and are expected to provide long-term protection as demonstrated with the
Vi-rEPA vaccine unlike the protection provided by polysaccharide vaccines which generally
last for only 2-3 years<sup><xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>TCV was safe and clinically acceptable in this study. Our data on reactogenicity to the
vaccine are consistent with those from the phase III trial in India <sup><xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and the human challenge model
study<sup><xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. In our study, one SAE was
deemed to be a vaccine-related fever without any alternative diagnosis, but remains blinded
to group allocation. Reported adverse events were similar for both TCV and the control
vaccine, indicating an acceptable safety profile in comparison with another widely used
conjugate vaccine. These data were part of a package reviewed by the WHO Global Advisory
Committee on Vaccine Safety in December 2018, leading to an endorsement of the safety of
this vaccine<sup><xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>These results provide strong evidence that TCV can play an important role in the control of
typhoid fever in endemic settings. TCV is highly cost-effective in high transmission
settings and should be taken into account in country decision-making <sup><xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. However, further data are still required
to demonstrate vaccine efficacy in the medium- and long-term, the indirect effect and herd
immunity achieved from large-scale vaccination, and the effectiveness in different age
groups and populations. The full analysis of data from this trial, as well as data from
on-going trials in Malawi and Bangladesh, will be available within the next two years to
address these outstanding questions<sup><xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Our findings uphold the WHO's recent recommendations to use TCV to control typhoid
in high burden settings through immunization of children from 9 months to 15 years of
age<sup><xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Inclusion of the conjugate
vaccine in routine immunization schedules in high burden countries could prevent a large
burden of a disease that has been disproportionately affecting children.</p>
