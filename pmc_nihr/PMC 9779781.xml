                  <p>The safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of molnupiravir, an oral antiviral medication for SARS-CoV-2, has not been established in vaccinated patients in the community at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. We aimed to establish whether the addition of molnupiravir to usual care reduced hospital admissions and deaths associated with COVID-19 in this population.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>PANORAMIC was a UK-based, national, multicentre, open-label, multigroup, prospective, platform adaptive randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants were aged 50 years or older—or aged 18 years or older with relevant comorbidities—and had been unwell with confirmed COVID-19 for 5 days or fewer in the community. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 800 mg molnupiravir twice daily for 5 days plus usual care or usual care only. A secure, web-based system (Spinnaker) was used for randomisation, which was stratified by age (&lt;50 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥50 years) and vaccination status (yes <italic>vs</italic> no). COVID-19 outcomes were tracked via a self-completed online daily diary for 28 days after randomisation. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalisation or death within 28 days of randomisation, which was analysed using Bayesian models in all eligible participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 30448031.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Dec 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022, 26 411 participants were randomly assigned, 12 821 to molnupiravir plus usual care, 12 962 to usual care alone, and 628 to other treatment groups (which will be reported separately). 12 529 participants from the molnupiravir plus usual care group, and 12 525 from the usual care group were included in the primary analysis population. The mean age of the population was 56·6 years (SD 12·6), and 24 290 (94%) of 25 708 participants had had at least three doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Hospitalisations or deaths were recorded in 105 (1%) of 12 529 participants in the molnupiravir plus usual care group versus 98 (1%) of 12 525 in the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio 1·06 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·81–1·41]; probability of superiority 0·33). There was no evidence of treatment interaction between subgroups. Serious adverse events were recorded for 50 (0·4%) of 12 774 participants in the molnupiravir plus usual care group and for 45 (0·3%) of 12 934 in the usual care group. None of these events were judged to be related to molnupiravir.</p>

                  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed with the terms (randomised OR trial) AND (molnupiravir) AND (COVID* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV) AND (systematic review) for articles published in any language up to Sept 5, 2022. Our search identified ten results. The two most comprehensive reviews were living reviews synthesising the findings of six trials of molnupiravir compared with either standard of care or placebo. These reviews suggested that molnupiravir reduces the frequency of hospital admissions in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. WHO's living guideline recommends use of molnupiravir in outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at the highest risk of hospital admission. The largest randomised clinical trial identified by the evidence syntheses was the placebo-controlled, phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial. In this trial of 1433 unvaccinated outpatients with COVID-19, molnupiravir was associated with a relative reduction of roughly 30% in the primary outcome—hospitalisations and deaths—up to 29 days after randomisation. Notably, the reduction in hospitalisations and deaths had been closer to 50% in the trial's interim analysis (after 762 participants had been recruited). The reason for this difference is unclear. Several trials of molnupiravir have been done in India, but full peer-reviewed findings have not yet been published. In the AGILE CST-2 trial, which included 180 participants (both vaccinated and unvaccinated), time to a negative PCR test was shorter in the molnupiravir group than in the placebo group (8 days <italic>vs</italic> 11 days), but this difference was not significant.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">Molnupiravir did not reduce hospitalisations or deaths in a community-based vaccinated adult population with COVID-19 who were at increased risk of an adverse outcome, either overall or in any patient subgroups. However, molnupiravir was associated with reduced time to recovery overall and for key individual symptoms, reduced health-care seeking for some primary care services, and reduced viral load. Trials of molnupiravir have previously been done in largely unvaccinated participants before the emergence of the omicron variant. Our trial provides an estimate of the effectiveness of molnupiravir in a multiply vaccinated population when the omicron SARS-CoV-2 strain was dominant.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">The use of molnupiravir to treat confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated adults who are at increased risk of an adverse outcomes when omicron was the dominant circulating variant did not reduce hospital admissions or deaths, both of which are already very infrequent, but did reduce time to recovery (and viral detection and load in a substudy).</p>

                <p id="para140">Potentially eligible people were screened, recruited, and enrolled via 65 PANORAMIC General Practice Hubs encompassing 4509 general practices across the UK. Participants were also recruited online and by telephone by the central trial team. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by medical or research professionals to receive molnupiravir plus usual care or usual care only. A secure, web-based system (Spinnaker) was used for randomisation, which was stratified by age (&lt;50 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥50 years) and vaccination status (yes <italic>vs</italic> no). Participants and members of the trial team responsible for recruitment, follow-up, and monitoring of participants were aware of group assignment. Trial investigators and recruiting clinicians were masked to emerging results; only unmasked statisticians and the independent members of the data and safety monitoring committee were granted access to unmasked results until the decision was made to close recruitment to molnupiravir.</p>

                <p id="para150">Participants in the molnupiravir group were asked to take 800 mg molnupiravir orally twice daily for 5 days. These participants were urgently couriered a participant pack containing molnupiravir (along with dosing and safety information) and a pregnancy test (only for use by participants of childbearing potential). Participants in both groups were emailed or posted a trial information booklet.

                <p id="para170">Participants were followed up through an online daily diary for 28 days after randomisation. Non-responders were telephoned on days 7, 14, and 28. Participants were asked to rate symptoms (eg, fever, cough, breathlessness) on an ordinal scale as “no problem”, “mild problem”, “moderate problem”, or “major problem”, to rate how they were feeling on a scale from zero to ten (in which zero corresponded with the worst one can imagine, and ten with the best one can imagine), and to report whether they had been hospitalised or required contact with health and social services, whether they felt fully recovered, whether they were taking over-the-counter medication for their COVID-19 symptoms, whether the number of people in the household with COVID-19 had changed, and whether they had taken molnupiravir (if applicable). At day 14 and 28, participants were also asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L to assess health-related quality of life. Participants could nominate a trial partner to help to provide follow-up data. We obtained consent from participants to access health-care use data from their general practices and health-care records. Additional questions about long-term symptoms and health-care use were asked 3 months and 6 months after randomisation, but these results are not reported here.</p>

                <p id="para180">Participants enrolled at all sites between March 23 and April 27, 2022, were offered the opportunity to participate in an intensively and non-intensively sampled virology cohort. Those who took part were couriered European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive-approved sampling kits and instructions for nasal and pharyngeal swab and dried blood spot self-sampling. They were asked to post the samples to the virology-processing site (postage and packaging were pre-paid). Participants in the intensive sampling cohort were asked to provide daily nasal or pharyngeal swabs for the first 7 days and on day 14 (or day 13 or 15). In the non-intensive sampling cohort, participants were asked to provide nasal or pharyngeal swabs on days 1, 5 (or day 4 or 6) and 14 (or day 13 or 15). Participants in the molnupiravir plus usual care group were asked to take their first sample before the first dose of molnupiravir, whereas those in the usual care group were asked to provide their first sample the day after randomisation. All participants in the virology substudy were asked to provide three finger-prick dried blood spot samples, one each on days 1, 5 (or day 4 or 6), and 14 (or day 13 or 15).</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para190">The primary outcome was all-cause, non-elective hospital admission or death within 28 days of randomisation. Hospital admission was defined as at least one overnight stay in hospital, or at least one night in a hospital-at-home programme (a service in which patients who are not formally admitted to hospital are cared for and monitored by hospital clinicians at home) after hospital assessment. Spending time during the day in a hospital emergency department was classified as an emergency department attendance. Overnight stays in the emergency department were counted as admissions. Hospitalisation for elective procedures planned before trial entry was not counted in our primary outcome.</p>
                <p id="para200">Secondary outcomes included time to self-reported recovery (which was defined as the first instance that a participant reported feeling fully recovered from COVID-19), time to early sustained recovery (recovery by day 14 sustained until day 28), time to sustained recovery (ie, time to the date the participant first reported recovery that was maintained until 28 days), self-reported wellness, time to initial alleviation of symptoms (ie, time to the first day participants reported no or only minor symptoms), time to sustained alleviation of symptoms (ie, time to first day participants reported no or only minor symptoms that subsequently remained minor or non-existent until 28 days), time to initial reduction of symptom severity, contact with health or social services, hospital assessment without admission, oxygen administration, new household COVID-19 infections, and safety outcomes. The <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 109–10</xref>) contains full details of all secondary outcomes. The primary outcome of the virology substudy was undetectable viral load at day 7.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para210">The sample size calculation and statistical analysis are detailed in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (pp 98, 164</xref>). The sample size was initially calculated on the basis of a 3% event rate with usual care, with an intervention expected to reduce the frequency of hospitalisation or death rate to 2% (ie, a 33% relative reduction). Based on this calculation, we needed to recruit at least 5300 participants to each group to ensure a 5% level of significance and 90% power. However, the aggregate (masked) proportion of participants admitted to hospital was lower than anticipated, so the sample size calculation was revised to 16 578 per group (90% power) or 12 534 per group (80% power), which involved assuming event frequencies of 1% in the control group and 0·67% in the intervention group. This recalculation of sample size was done for the overall proportion of hospitalisations and deaths, and did not affect any decision criteria thresholds or interpretation of the final results.</p>
                <p id="para220">The primary analysis population was defined as all eligible participants who were randomly assigned. Participants who were randomly assigned but subsequently found to be ineligible for inclusion were excluded from the analysis. Participants were analysed according to the group they were allocated to, irrespective of protocol deviations. To analyse the primary outcome, we used a Bayesian logistic regression model with weakly informative Cauchy priors (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 167</xref>) that was regressed on treatment group, comorbidity, and stratification covariates (age and vaccination status). 95% Bayesian credible intervals (95% BCIs) were calculated. The success thresholds at final and interim analysis were prespecified (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 170–71</xref>) and were dependent on the number of interim analyses, which was a function of the speed of enrolment. If no interim analyses were done (eg, in the case of very fast enrolment), the success threshold at the final analysis was 0·975. Only one participant in the analysis population received treatment that differed from their randomised allocation, so the model fit in the sensitivity analysis was nearly identical to the primary analysis model fit. If data for the primary outcome were missing for more than 5% of the study population, a sensitivity analysis, in which missing data would be imputed by multiple imputation, was planned (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 141–42</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para230">The sample size for the virology substudy was based on simulations from a viral dynamic model from early 2020,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> which suggested that inclusion of 30 patients per group would detect a 2·5 times increase in viral clearance (which translates into roughly double the rate of undetectable viral loads at day 7) in patients who started treatment within 5 days of symptom onset (with 90% power and an α of 0·05) compared with those receiving usual care. Clinical improvement could be associated with smaller decreases in viral load, and viral dynamic modelling leveraging time-series viral-load data can detect much smaller drug effect sizes.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Furthermore, 300 participants would provide a 95% probability of seeing at least one example of a SARS-CoV-2 mutation occurring in at least 1% of participants. Viral sequencing analysis will be reported in another paper.</p>
                <p id="para240">For secondary time-to-event outcomes we used a Bayesian piecewise exponential model with weakly informative normal priors and four time segments (based on quartiles for the observed time to response) to estimate the hazard ratio for the treatment versus the control group, adjusting for age, vaccination status, and any comorbidity. We used the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test to analyse binary outcomes with a low event frequency. These results were reported descriptively by treatment group. Early sustained recovery was analysed with a Bayesian logistic regression model, in which group assignment, age, vaccination status, and comorbidity status were covariates.</p>
                <p id="para250">Because PANORAMIC is a pragmatic trial of a licensed, approved drug in its licensed population, we adopted a pharmacovigilance strategy. Thus, standard adverse event data were not routinely captured. Our strategy was to comprehensively capture safety data for serious adverse events and adverse events for which data are scarce. There was, however, a robust mechanism in place for participants to seek advice on the management of troublesome adverse events. All analyses were done in STATA (version 16.1) and R (version 4.2.1).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para350">This analysis of the largest randomised trial involving people vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at increased risk of adverse outcomes in the community and unwell with COVID-19 showed that the early addition of molnupiravir to usual care did not reduce hospital admissions or death (which were low in both treatment groups). However, participants in the molnupiravir plus usual care group recovered faster than those in the usual care group, had a higher rate of early sustained recovery, and had fewer general practitioner consultations. This faster patient-reported recovery was consistent with a reduction in detectable virus and viral load in participants who received molnupiravir compared with those who received usual care only. We did not identify any patient subgroup in which molnupiravir was associated with a reduced chance of hospital admission, and benefits in terms of time to first self-report of recovery were evenly distributed across subgroups. We recorded few serious adverse events in the trial, and none definitely related to molnupiravir.</p>
              <p id="para360">Two living reviews of treatments for COVID-19—a WHO living guideline<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> and a living review and network analysis that informs WHO on drug treatments<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref>—identified six trials of molnupiravir. Of these trials, one was phase 1,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> another was phase 2a,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> and one was the phase 3 MOVe-OUT trial.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Data from the other three trials were made accessible to WHO but have not been shared publicly. Concern has been raised about the lack of public sharing or formal publication of the findings of these three trials, along with those of nine others, all of which were done in India.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The reviews<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> reported that molnupiravir probably reduces hospitalisation (odds ratio 0·54 [95% CI 0·30 to 0·90]; based on five trials) and time to symptom resolution (–3·3 days [–4·8 days to –1·6 days]; based on three trials). WHO therefore advises that molnupiravir might benefit outpatients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at the highest risk of adverse outcomes.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para370">In the placebo-controlled, pivotal MOVe-OUT trial<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> of 1433 outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited in more than 20 countries, molnupiravir was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause hospitalisation or death (risk difference −3·0% [95% CI –5·9% to −0·1%]). The MOVe-OUT participants were unvaccinated, all had at least one risk factor for progression to serious illness, and were most commonly infected with delta, gamma, and mu SARS-CoV-2 variants.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Participants in PANORAMIC were mostly multiply vaccinated, older, and infected with omicron.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> The reported benefit of molnupiravir in MOVe-Out was lower in the final analysis than in the initial interim results, and the post-interim data in isolation did not suggest benefit.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Possible explanations for this seeming reduction in benefit include changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, recruitment from new sites with different hospitalisation policies, and recruitment of participants with less severe illness.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para380">In MOVe-OUT, molnupiravir increased sustained recovery from anosmia and fatigue, but not other symptoms.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In PANORAMIC, molnupiravir was associated with faster alleviation of fever, cough, fatigue, and feeling generally unwell, and shortened time to self-reported recovery. We postulate that molnupiravir might also have shortened the time to resumption of normal activities, which is closely related to the duration of feeling unwell, but we did not measure this outcome directly.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Exploratory analyses from MOVe-OUT showed that, compared with placebo, molnupiravir was associated with a greater reduction from baseline in mean viral load at days 3, 5, and 10.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> In the AGILE CST-2 placebo-controlled trial<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> of 180 participants (both vaccinated and unvaccinated) molnupiravir was associated with reduced time to a negative PCR test (8 days <italic>vs</italic> 11 days). These findings are consistent with findings in PANORAMIC of a reduction in viral detection and viral load with molnupiravir plus usual care compared with usual care from day 4 onwards in a subgroup of the trial cohort. The proportion of participants with undetectable viral loads in the usual care group was 3% by day 7, whereas based on the placebo group in the FLARE trial<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> we would have expected this proportion to be 15–36%. Nonetheless, we noted a significant increase in the proportion of patients with undetectable viral loads in the molnupiravir plus usual care group compared with the placebo group. Viral whole-genome sequencing, pharmacodynamic analyses, and antibody modelling are underway to further investigate this finding.</p>
              <p id="para390">PANORAMIC is the largest randomised trial of novel antiviral agents for COVID-19 so far. Ascertainment for the primary outcome was 97%. Participants were randomised a mean of 2 days and treated a mean of 3 days after symptom onset, and nearly all participants reported full compliance with their assigned treatment.</p>
              <p id="para400">The design of PANORAMIC breaks with the traditional trial paradigm in which the participant comes to the research. The study of molnupiravir in PANORAMIC allowed for remote recruitment of participants from all four UK devolved administrations, irrespective of where people live or receive their health care. PANORAMIC strives to be a democratic trial, with a proactive outreach strategy led by the trial's national pharmacy and inclusion and diversity lead. These efforts are important: research suggests that one reason for the often-low representation of people from diverse and minority ethnic backgrounds in clinical studies is that these populations find it more difficult to access research.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Yet these groups are often at increased risk of more and worse disease, as is the case with COVID-19. The ability of participants to be recruited, enrolled, and followed up without having to leave their homes reduced the burden of trial procedures on participants and might have reduced the spread of infection. Participants from ethnic minorities accounted for nearly 6% of the trial population (whereas ethnic minorities account for 12% of the population of England and Wales in the age groups recruited). However, the mean age of participants in PANORAMIC was 56·6 years, and there are proportionally fewer people of minority ethnic origin in older age groups in the UK.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The proportion of PANORAMIC participants older than 50 years who were from ethnic minorities was 5·1%, which is broadly similar to that in the English and Welsh general population (6·3%).<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para410">The primary analysis estimated a 33% probability of superiority—that is, there is a 33% chance that the addition of molnupiravir to usual care reduces hospitalisation or death by any non-zero amount. The analysis can also be interpreted in terms of inferiority: the estimated probability of molnupiravir use increasing hospitalisation or death by any non-zero amount is 67%. The primary analysis does not provide compelling evidence for either conclusion. The 95% BCI for the primary outcome (0·81–1·41) indicates that plausible effects for molnupiravir could range from a 19% reduction to a 41% increase in the risk of hospitalisation or death. Taken together, these estimates suggest that the effect of molnupiravir is modest (in either direction). Under the best-case assumption of a 19% risk reduction, the number needed to treat in the population is 677.</p>
              <p id="para420">Although it is critical to ensure that patients who are likely to benefit receive treatment with antiviral agents, use of antivirals in patients unlikely to benefit risks driving resistance, wastes resources, and potentially exposes people unnecessarily to harm. There is a theoretical risk that molnupiravir use at scale could lead to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. This risk is being assessed in PANORAMIC trial's virology substudy. However, animal studies<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> suggest that viral mutations induced by molnupiravir are likely to lead to reduced viral viability, with low potential to develop resistant strains. Analysis of mutation frequency and the infectivity of persisting strains after molnupiravir use is underway and will be reported separately.</p>
              <p id="para430">The open-label design of PANORAMIC means that we cannot estimate the proportion of the effect of molnupiravir on symptoms that might result from any placebo effect. However, the primary outcome in PANORAMIC (non-elective hospitalisation or death) is unlikely to be affected by a placebo effect. Furthermore, the virology substudy findings support a mechanism to explain self-reported reduction in illness duration. We can also draw some positive inference from the four reported intervention arms of the open-label community PRINCIPLE trial of repurposed medicines for COVID-19, in which similar patient-reported measures of improvement were used and only one intervention (inhaled budesonide) was associated with a meaningful effect on self-reported symptoms.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Furthermore, in keeping with pragmatic trial design, PANORAMIC is designed to closely mirror possible real-world practice.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Our results are likely to reflect what would happen if molnupiravir were introduced into routine clinical practice<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and facilitate a more realistic cost-effectiveness and cost-utility assessment, given that subsequent health-care utilisation might be influenced by knowledge of receiving a potentially active treatment.</p>
              <p id="para440">Patients with COVID-19 who were extremely clinically vulnerable, although eligible for participation in PANORAMIC, were referred and encouraged to access and be considered for monoclonal antibody or antiviral treatment directly from the NHS. Our findings might therefore be less applicable to patients in this highest-risk category.</p>
              <p id="para450">In conclusion, this trial of vaccinated adults at increased risk of an adverse outcome and unwell with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that early treatment with molnupiravir did not reduce already low hospital admission or deaths. Our findings suggest that, in a highly vaccinated population at high risk (but not the highest risk) of complications from COVID-19, the avoidance of hospitalisation and death is primarily achieved via extensive vaccination. The benefits of molnupiravir in terms of faster time to recovery, reduced contact with general practitioner services, and reduced viral load need to be considered in the context of the prevailing disease, burden on health-care services, drug-acquisition cost, social circumstances, cost-effectiveness, and opportunity costs. Further virological and health economic analyses are underway, and participants are still being followed up to establish the effect of acute COVID-19 treatment with molnupiravir on longer-term symptoms.</p>
