                  <title>OBJECTIVE</title>
                  <p>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) characteristically enhances postprandial levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a mechanism that contributes to its profound glucose-lowering effects. This enhancement is thought to be triggered by bypass of food to the distal small intestine with higher densities of neuroendocrine L-cells. We hypothesized that if this is the predominant mechanism behind the enhanced secretion of GLP-1, a longer intestinal bypass would potentiate the postprandial peak in GLP-1, translating into higher insulin secretion and, thus, additional improvements in glucose tolerance. To investigate this, we conducted a mechanistic study comparing two variants of RYGB that differ in the length of intestinal bypass.</p>

                  <title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title>
                  <p>A total of 53 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity were randomized to either standard limb RYGB (50-cm biliopancreatic limb) or long limb RYGB (150-cm biliopancreatic limb). They underwent measurements of GLP-1 and insulin secretion following a mixed meal and insulin sensitivity using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps at baseline and 2 weeks and at 20% weight loss after surgery.</p>

                  <title>RESULTS</title>
                  <p>Both groups exhibited enhancement in postprandial GLP-1 secretion and improvements in glycemia compared with baseline. There were no significant differences in postprandial peak concentrations of GLP-1, time to peak, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity.</p>

                  <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
                  <p>The findings of this study demonstrate that lengthening of the intestinal bypass in RYGB does not affect GLP-1 secretion. Thus, the characteristic enhancement of GLP-1 response after RYGB might not depend on delivery of nutrients to more distal intestinal segments.</p>

              <p>Mechanistic evidence shows that the glucose-lowering effects of RYGB and other gastrointestinal operations result not just from simple weight loss but directly from changes in gastrointestinal physiology (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms by which RYGB controls T2D remain incompletely understood, research over the last decades has identified several contributors, including changes in gut hormones, bile acids, intestinal glucose transport and metabolism, and nutrient sensing, among others (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). RYGB reduces the size of the stomach and bypasses a segment of the upper small intestine, including the duodenum and the proximal jejunum. The bypassed segment of small intestine, which carries bile and pancreatic secretions but is completely excluded from the transit of nutrients, is referred to as the biliopancreatic limb (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Several studies have shown that the exclusion of the small bowel from nutrient transit has weight-loss independent glucose-lowering effects of its own (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>); however, the physiologic and molecular mechanisms activated by such intestinal bypass are incompletely understood.</p>

              </fig>
              <p>An alternative hypothesis for the efficacy of RYGB holds that the shunt of ingested nutrients to the distal small intestine, where the highest density of neuroendocrine L-cells is found, stimulates them to secrete GLP-1 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This mechanism is supported by several lines of evidence. The enhanced secretion of GLP-1 occurs in parallel with other L-cell products, such as peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) and oxyntomodulin, with synergistic effects leading to reduced food intake, weight loss, enhanced insulin secretion, and lower glycemia (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). GLP-1 concentration curves after RYGB are almost superimposable to insulin concentration curves, and elegant GLP-1 receptor studies demonstrated that this incretin drives, at least in part, the enhanced early postprandial insulin secretion after surgery (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A recent study also showed that both GLP-1 and PYY responses correlate with increased nutrient delivery to the distal intestine in mice (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Clinical studies have suggested that increasing the length of intestinal bypass in RYGB could further improve control of T2D (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), possibly via potentiation of the GLP-1 response resulting in even greater insulin secretion than standard RYGB. Moreover, operations like the one-anastomosis gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion that impose a longer length of intestinal bypass compared with RYGB induce higher rates of T2D remission than RYGB in observational (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and randomized clinical trials (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) respectively.</p>
              <p>Clinical studies including randomized comparison of RYGB outcomes with different limb lengths are scarce in current literature. Previous reports tested variants of the RYGB procedure that also lengthened the alimentary limb and did not control for interference from on-going therapies with glucose-lowering medications or weight loss (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Understanding exactly how surgery produces its effects on GLP-1 provides a unique opportunity to elucidate elusive aspects of gut hormone regulation and disease pathophysiology. This knowledge will enable the optimization of clinical efficacy of metabolic surgery and could also help identify new targets for future therapeutics of T2D and obesity.</p>
              <p>We used a reductionist approach and hypothesized that if the shunt of nutrients into the distal intestine is the predominant mechanism behind the changes in GLP-1 regulation after RYGB, a longer length of intestinal bypass, and, therefore, a shorter transit for nutrients to the distal small intestine, would potentiate the postprandial peak in GLP-1, translating into higher insulin secretion and, thus, additional improvements in glucose tolerance.</p>
              <p>To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted a mechanistic study comparing two variants of RYGB that differ in the length of intestinal bypass (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We compared standard limb RYGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 50 cm versus a long limb RYGB with a substantially longer biliopancreatic limb of 150 cm. In the standard RYGB, even a 50-cm proximal intestinal bypass has been shown to markedly increase postprandial GLP-1 responses. We therefore hypothesized that a tripling of the length of the bypass would enhance GLP-1 responses even further.</p>
              <p>The primary end point of this trial was GLP-1 response to meal stimulation within the first 2 weeks after surgery. This outcome reflected our core hypothesis and was best suited to answer our mechanistic question. We hypothesized that the long limb RYGB would shunt nutrients to more distal parts of the small intestine which have greater L-cell density (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), resulting in a higher or earlier peak GLP-1 concentration. We also hypothesized that this phenomenon would take place early after surgery and be independent of intestinal adaptation, i.e., before any compensatory changes in L-cell number take place (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Peak postprandial GLP-1 concentrations have been shown to be the most reproducible marker of GLP-1 response after RYGB (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The postprandial GLP-1 response also has clinical relevance as it correlates with the rate of T2D remission after RYGB (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Secondary end points included fasting and postprandial glucose excursions, measures of insulin sensitivity, and glycemic control and weight loss within the first year after surgery. To rule out possible confounding effects of weight loss, patients were also studied at baseline and after an equivalent weight loss of 20% in both groups.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p content-type="flushleft">The findings of this mechanistic study show that increasing the length of intestinal bypass in RYGB is not associated with a greater postprandial GLP-1 and insulin secretion in humans. Despite incorporating a threefold longer biliopancreatic limb resulting in delivery of nutrients to more distal segments of the small intestine compared with the standard technique, the long-limb RYGB did not produce any measurable difference in fasting or postprandial peak GLP-1 concentrations, time to peak concentrations, and total GLP-1 AUC. Indeed, the postprandial curves of GLP-1 response in the two groups were superimposable. While GLP-1 was chosen as the primary end point of this study to test a physiologic hypothesis, we also did not observe any other differences in other measures of glucose homeostasis that have clinical relevance, i.e., fasting and postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations.</p>
              <p>These findings challenge the widespread belief that the shunt of nutrient to more distal segments of the small intestine is the dominant mechanism by which RYGB enhances GLP-1 response (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). On the basis of this mechanism, the threefold longer bypass of the long limb RYGB used in this study should have elicited at least differences in time to peak or peak concentrations of GLP-1 compared with the standard procedure. One plausible explanation for our unexpected findings may be that there may be no linear relationship between GLP-1 secretion and the number of L cells exposed to ingested nutrients, as previously suggested (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). As enteroendocrine L cells are also located in the proximal intestine, the delivery of nutrients beyond a critical point in the jejunum may not result in further enhancement of the GLP-1 response. An alternative mechanism is that RYGB may change yet unknown mechanisms involved in the physiologic regulation of GLP-1 that depend on the integrity of the anatomy and physiology of the proximal small intestine. The anti-incretin framework postulates the existence of a homeostatic mechanism in which nutrient-stimulated anti-GLP-1 signals from the proximal small intestine compensate for the action of GLP-1 secreted in the distal small intestine to defend against postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) Consistent with this model, bypass of the proximal small intestine might reduce the stimulation of factors, e.g., ketone bodies arising from the intestine (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), that tonically inhibit L-cell secretion, thus resulting in enhanced GLP-1 and, thus, insulin, response. This mechanism would explain why GLP-1 response is enhanced by a variety of procedures that disrupt the anatomy of the proximal small intestine and, conversely, why increasing the length of the bypass beyond a critical point, as in the long-limb RYGB used in this study, does not produce appreciable differences in GLP-1 secretion. A third explanation of our findings is that RYGB may change yet unknown mechanisms involved in the physiologic regulation of GLP-1 that depend on the integrity of the anatomy and physiology of the stomach (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p>
              <p>A previous retrospective case-control study demonstrated higher postprandial GLP-1 concentrations after long biliopancreatic limb RYGB compared with standard RYGB (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Differences in both study design and study subjects may explain these conflicting observations. The patients in that retrospective study did not have T2D, were studied 4 years after surgery, and underwent a slightly longer intestinal bypass (200 vs. 150 cm in our trial). It is theoretically possible, albeit unlikely, that a longer biliopancreatic limb than the one used in our trial may be associated with differences in intestinal adaptation leading to greater postprandial GLP-1 response in the long term. However, changes in GLP-1 response typically occur immediately after RYGB (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and in this study, we did not observe any difference in GLP-1 response either 2 weeks after the operation or at the 20% weight loss time point (mean of 4.5 months postoperatively), a time interval that should allow for substantial intestinal adaptation to occur (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study demonstrated the substantial variability in the length of the small intestine (320–910 cm). We incorporated this confounder in our measurements by examining correlations between the percentage of the biliopancreatic limb length to the total small intestinal length and GLP-1 responses. There was no correlation between these two measurements both early and late after surgery. This means that GLP-1 secretion was not enhanced even in the subgroup of patients with relatively short small intestines in whom a long limb RYGB would have shunted nutrients relatively distally. Our aim was also to make our study clinically relevant. Thus, we elected to investigate a biliopancreatic length of 150 cm, which is commonly used in routine clinical practice globally without an adverse safety signal. Procedures with longer biliopancreatic diversions (e.g., biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch) could theoretically have resulted in enhanced GLP-1 responses, but these procedures involve resection of gastric tissue (a further confounding of gastrointestinal physiology) and are also less commonly performed due to the risk of severe macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Furthermore, as a mechanistic investigation performed in a prospective randomized manner, our study is more robust than retrospective studies in avoiding confounding from differences in GLP-1 secretion at baseline. These considerations are reassuring about the ability of our study to detect differences, had they existed, in the effects of the two RYGB variants on GLP-1 secretion. In line with the equivalence on GLP-1 secretion, our study found no significant differences between the two groups in terms of clinical outcomes for the first year after surgery. Both patient groups, in fact, exhibited similar reduction in fasting glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, as well as weight loss at 12 months. Our findings are in line with other studies where a longer biliopancreatic limb was used for RYGB but resulted in no additional benefit in terms of reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, T2D remission, or weight loss (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Although other studies reached opposite conclusions, it must be noted that the majority were in fact designed to alter the length of both biliopancreatic and alimentary limbs at the same time. This must be considered when interpreting their findings.</p>
              <p>Several aspects of the study design strengthen the reliability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first mechanistic study that utilized a double-blind randomized controlled design to conduct a head-to-head comparison between two variants of RYGB. The entire length of the small intestine was measured during all operations. Deep metabolic phenotyping of all participants was performed after washout of glucose-lowering medications early postoperatively, allowing mitigation of pharmacologic influence on glucose metabolism. We used several clinical and biological measures of glucose metabolism, including the gold-standard method of measuring insulin sensitivity through euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps with stable isotopes. Moreover, performing mechanistic tests early after surgery and again when the two groups of patients had achieved the same reduction of body weight removes any confounding from weight loss. Most importantly, this is the first study to attempt to isolate the specific contribution of the length of the biliopancreatic limb on glucose metabolism. Previous studies that looked at the role of the bypass of the proximal intestine in RYGB used variants of the procedure that also lengthened other intestinal limbs, were not randomized, or did not control for interference from on-going therapies with glucose-lowering medications or weight loss (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Given the complexity of gastrointestinal physiology, the significant redundancy of mechanisms that influence glucose and weight regulation, and the effects of weight loss and on-going drug therapies on glucose homeostasis, identifying the role of distinct anatomic changes on physiologic and clinical effects of complex procedures, such as RYGB, requires rigorous and controlled designs. We demonstrated that our novel approach is feasible in which, until recently, clinicians have empirically altered the anatomy of operations based on speculation or personal preference, rather than solid and objective mechanistic evidence.</p>
              <p>This study has some limitations. First, the primary end point examined GLP-1 secretion, and we cannot exclude that varying the length of intestinal bypass could influence other gut hormones or other aspects of gastrointestinal physiology involved in glucose metabolism, i.e., changes in bile acid metabolism, gut microbiota, or intestinal glucose absorption in the common limb (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The latter mechanism could have contributed to the slightly lower glucose concentrations in the long limb group only when incremental AUCs were compared. These differences appear to be small and not reflected in any of the other glucose indices measured. Second, this was an experimental medicine study with mechanistic outcomes and not a clinical trial. Thus, it was not powered to detect significant differences in clinical outcomes, and we only extended our follow-up to 1 year after surgery. Hence, we cannot derive definitive conclusions on the relative clinical efficacy of the two variants of RYGB tested in this study. However, the lack of any meaningful difference in fasting and postprandial glucose excursions, insulin sensitivity, or insulin secretion between the two groups of this study suggests that lengthening the intestinal bypass may not be an effective way to further improve efficacy of standard RYGB in the control of T2D or obesity, at least within the first postoperative year. The discrepant findings between human (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and animal studies (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) have created controversy regarding the role of GLP-1 in the glycemic improvements after RYGB. However, the interrogation of its contribution to glucose regulation was beyond the scope of our study. Third, we did not measure gastric emptying as it has been demonstrated that this is rapid after RYGB, and the two procedures we tested did not differ in the anatomy of the gastric pouch or gastrojejunal anastomosis. Fourth, we did not measure orocecal transit time to formally confirm the presence of more rapid nutrient delivery to the distal small intestine and cecum.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, this mechanistic study has demonstrated that the elongation of the biliopancreatic limb of RYGB from 50 to 150 cm is not associated with enhanced GLP-1 response in patients with T2D and obesity within the first year after surgery. Alternative proximal intestinal or gastric mechanisms might be responsible for the enhancement of GLP-1. Shifting the focus to the targeting of those mechanisms will enable the optimization of metabolic surgery and drug development for T2D and obesity.</p>
