                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The KERALINK trial tests the hypothesis that corneal cross-linking (CXL) treatment reduces the progression of keratoconus in comparison to standard care in patients under 17 years old. KERALINK is a randomised controlled, observer-masked, multicentre trial in progressive keratoconus comparing epithelium-off CXL with standard care, including spectacles or contact lenses as necessary for best-corrected acuity.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A total of 30 participants will be randomised per group. Eligible participants aged 10–16 years with progressive keratoconus in one or both eyes will be recruited. Following randomisation, participants will be followed up 3-monthly for 18 months. The effect on progression will be determined by K<sub>2</sub> on corneal topography. The primary outcome measure is between-group difference in K<sub>2</sub> at 18 months adjusted for K<sub>2</sub> at baseline examination. Secondary outcomes are the effect of CXL on (1) keratoconus progression, (2) time to keratoconus progression, (3) visual acuity, (4) refraction, (5) apical corneal thickness and (6) adverse events. Patient-reported effects will be explored by questionnaires.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Keratoconus is characterised by thinning and distortion of the cornea that results in visual loss from complex refractive error and corneal opacification. The prevalence in Europe has been reported as 1:1163<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and 1:375.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The age at initial referral to hospital clinics is the second and third decade (mean age at diagnosis 28 years<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with progression until the early 30s in most affected eyes. In its early stages, keratoconus causes worsening of vision on account of increasing myopia and irregular astigmatism: spectacle correction provides good visual acuity in early disease only, until increasing irregular astigmatism requires correction with rigid contact lenses for best vision. Patients with more advanced keratoconus lose contact lens-corrected visual acuity on account of corneal opacification and corneal transplant surgery is eventually required in &gt;20% of patients.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Keratoconus is often more advanced when first diagnosed in children than in adults, with faster subsequent disease progression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>The most important parameters used in the assessment of keratoconus are the curvature of the cornea (presented as dioptre power (D)), apical corneal thickness in µm, refraction and best-corrected visual acuity. Earliest disease can be detected by corneal topography, which demonstrates thinning and irregularity of corneal curvature. Quantification of steepness of the corneal curvature in horizontal, vertical and multiple oblique meridians identifies the meridian of maximum corneal steepness (K<sub>2</sub>) and the point of maximum steepness (K<sub>max</sub>).</p>
              <p>While the standard care described above involves treatment of the refractive consequences of keratoconus or replacement of the diseased cornea by a transplant, the concept of stabilising keratoconus and arresting its progression at a stage when there is still good unaided or spectacle-corrected vision is relatively recent. Corneal cross-linking (CXL) increases the stiffness of the cornea, which can arrest the progression of early keratoconus.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It is the only current intervention for this purpose. In the epithelium-off CXL procedure corneal epithelium is removed, riboflavin eye drops administered and the cornea exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light for 8 or more minutes. CXL has been reported to be effective in arresting keratoconus progression in the majority of treated adult eyes in a number of non-randomised studies (including Henriquez <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Hersh <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (O’Brart <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In the larger study by Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic>, a significant difference in progression of corneal power in the steepest axis (termed ‘K<sub>max</sub>’ by these authors but in later publications widely designated ‘K<sub>2</sub>’) between CXL and control eyes was reported: an improvement in CXL-treated eyes with flattening of K<sub>max</sub> by −1.03±0.19 D compared with an increase in K<sub>max</sub> for control eyes of +1.75 ± 0.38 D at 36 months. Adverse effects were not uncommon but mostly transient, including corneal oedema, superficial opacification and recurrent corneal erosions. Despite increasing information in relation to the efficacy of CXL a Cochrane Review conducted in 2015 concluded that evidence for the use of CXL in the management of keratoconus is limited due to the lack of properly conducted RCTs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</p>
              <p>In younger subjects, a number of observational studies of CXL in keratoconus patients &lt;19 years have been published, each with limitations but each reporting effectiveness. Caporossi <italic>et al</italic> reported an uncontrolled study of 152 keratoconus patients ranging in age from 10 to 18 years, of whom follow-up post-CXL was available on only 61% of patients.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Inclusion criteria included several parameters which are well recognised to be characterised by intertest variability. In this treated patient group, a statistically significant reduction of K<sub>max</sub> by −0.4 D was found. Vinciguerra <italic>et al</italic> reported 40 CXL-treated eyes in patients with progressive keratoconus aged 9–18 (mean 14.2) years in a non-randomised prospective study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Findings included improved visual acuity, reduced myopic spherical equivalent on refraction testing and flattening on keratometry readings compared with pre-CXL. Goodfrooij <italic>et al</italic> reported progression in 22% within 5 years of CXL.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although the findings from these studies suggested a beneficial effect of CXL, more robust evidence is required to inform practice. Of note, no randomised trial has been undertaken in young patients. The KERALINK trial has been designed to investigate efficacy and safety of the established technique of CXL in progressive keratoconus in the paediatric age group, in which on account of early disease onset there is such potential for keratoconus progression. This paper describes the design of the trial, which compares progression of keratoconus in a population of children and young patients randomised to CXL or standard care, and evaluates safety of the intervention in this patient group.</p>
              <p>Evidence of effectiveness of CXL is of particular interest in young patients and has specifically been requested by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK. KERALINK is a multicentre RCT in this patient group evaluating epithelium-off CXL, the technique of CXL which has been demonstrated to be effective in adults. If the trial demonstrates efficacy of CXL compared with standard care, and in particular if CXL is arrests keratoconus progression, this would have important implications for clinical management. Although we intend to follow-up the trial patients for several years after the proposed trial concludes in order to ascertain the duration of keratoconus stability, it is clear that arrested progression in a paediatric patient is likely (1) to obviate the need for contact lens correction and for later corneal transplant surgery and (2) to have correspondingly greater health and cost benefit than if the CXL were undertaken in adults. Trial findings will inform ophthalmologists, optometrists and inform future research and treatment policy.</p>

                <p>KERALINK is a randomised controlled, observer-masked controlled trial in five centres in the UK. The study adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link> and the European Union clinical trials registry. It was approved by the UK Health Research Authority, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency and ethical approval was granted by the Brent Ethics Committee (reference 16/LO/0913). The trial is supervised by a trial management group (TMG), with independent oversight by a trial steering committee (TSC) and a data monitoring committee. Eligible patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CXL or standard care including spectacles or contact lenses as necessary (standard care of early keratoconus in the UK includes correction of refractive error and not CXL). Following randomisation, participants are followed for 18 months at 3-monthly intervals. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>. All follow-up measurements are performed by masked observers (optometrists) and the treating ophthalmologists are masked as to keratometry values on topography at follow-up. Randomisation commenced on 31 October 2016 and follow-up of the last recruited patient is estimated to complete in mid-2020.</p>

                <p>To differentiate true keratoconus progression from measurement artefact or minimal progression, an increase on topography (Pentacam, Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) in the steepest keratometry (K<sub>max</sub>) or in the steepest corneal meridian (K<sub>2</sub>) of at least 1.5 D was used as threshold for eligibility in one or both eyes.

At completion of the procedure one drop of povidone iodine and a therapeutic contact lens will be applied to the treated eye. Management post-CXL is (1) proxymetacaine drops every 2 hours and naproxen 250 mg two times per day, both as required for analgesia, (2) moxifloxacin 0.5% drops every 6 hours for 1 week as infection prophylaxis, (3) dexamethasone 0.1% drops every 6 hours for 1 week, every 12 hours for 1 week, then fluorometholone 0.1% drops every 12 hours for 1 week. Patients randomised to CXL will attend for an extra examination at 1 week post-CXL for removal of the contact lens and confirmation of corneal re-epithelialisation.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p>The primary outcome is K<sub>2</sub> at 18 months, adjusted for K<sub>2</sub> at baseline, in the study eye recorded by an optometrist masked to the treatment group. A difference between the groups in the change in K<sub>2</sub> of &gt;1.5 D from randomisation to 18 months is considered to be a clinically important difference (based on Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A K<sub>2</sub> increase &gt;1.5 D would discriminate a true change in the steepest corneal meridian from measurement artefact and would be visually significant. A sample size of 46 patients would be required to detect this difference at the 5% significance level with 90% power, assuming a SD of 1.5 D. The total sample size has been increased to 60 patients (30 per group) to allow for up to 24% loss to follow-up. These estimates are based on 12-month and 24-month data reported by Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic> from which we estimated a pooled SD of the changes of 1.476 D. We expect that on average there will be 10% loss to follow-up in both groups. In the study by Wittig-Silva <italic>et al</italic>, 19% of patients withdrew, crossed over to CXL or had a transplant by 18 months. However, 18% of patients in the control group either received CXL or a transplant. If we specifically adjust the sample size to take account of 10% loss to follow-up and up to 20% of the control arm cross-over to CXL or transplant, then our planned total sample size of 60 patients would still provide at least 80% power to detect the clinically important difference. The trial protocol states that participants cannot cross over to CXL before 9 months.</p>

K<sub>2</sub> at randomisation, treatment group, follow-up time, the interaction between treatment and time, and the stratifying variables centre and whether each patient has one or both eyes eligible will be included as fixed effects.

Secondary continuous outcomes such as uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity measured at randomisation and on more than one occasion during follow-up will be analysed using similar linear mixed models. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity will be measured in logMAR using an ETDRS chart at a distance of 4 m. In patients for whom both eyes show progression at the time of randomisation, information from both eyes will be included in a secondary analysis including eye as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect.</p>
                <p>Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the proportion of study eyes with keratoconus progression in each treatment group. Cox regression analysis will be used to estimate time to keratoconus progression in the study eye for each treatment group. The model will adjust for the stratifying variables, centre and whether each patient has one or both eyes eligible. Patients who do not progress during the course of the trial will be censored at their last follow-up visit.</p>
                <p>We will also explore how visual disability and health in children and young patients with keratoconus relate to changes in K<sub>2</sub>. The impact of missing data will be mitigated against by incorporating information from all observed time points using a mixed model approach.</p>
                <p>Planned subgroup analyses will be conducted to investigate whether the effect of CXL differs between patients who had progression at randomisation in one or both eyes. This will be explored by adding an interaction between the number of eyes with progression at randomisation and CXL treatment to the primary efficacy outcome analysis mixed model.</p>
