                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Despite the high prevalence of common mental disorders in adolescents and young adults, and their association with poor health and socio-economic outcomes throughout the lifespan, many young people do not seek or receive help for such disorders. There is growing interest in the community sector in supporting mental health in young people; however, there is little by way of experimental research in this area. During the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we designed an online cultural experience to reduce anxiety and depression and support mental health in people aged 16–24.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">Despite the high prevalence of the common mental disorders, anxiety and depression, early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and their association with poor mental and physical health and socio-economic outcomes throughout the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], many young people do not seek or receive help for such disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that rates of mental disorders are rising in adolescents and young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and even those who have sought help are at high risk of discontinuing their contact with mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, there is increasing interest in the community sector in supporting mental health in young people; however, there is little by way of experimental research in this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty and feelings of isolation brought about by social distancing measures have meant that mental health and wellbeing have become a major public health concern. An epidemiological study compared the proportion of the population of Great Britain with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (June 2020) to previous to the pandemic (July 2019–March 2020). Young adults (aged 16 to 39 years) were more likely than other adults to experience depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Around one in three young adults experienced depressive symptoms (moderate-severe) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with about one in nine previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Intervention research has focused on treatments administered by mental health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the mainstay of which are medications and talking therapies. However, these may not be accessible, acceptable or appropriate for the majority of young people with mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In this context, there is mounting interest in the community sector in delivering interventions for youth mental health, such as museums, libraries and outdoor activities. In this context, we conducted thorough searches for experimental studies of community resources for anxiety or depression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=204471">https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=204471</ext-link>). We were unable to identify any trials investigating museums or online museums to treat, reduce or prevent anxiety and depression in young adults. This is consistent with a systematic review which sort to identify studies of strategies not accompanied by a mental health professional for anxiety and depression in children and young people, in which no studies of museums or online museums, were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">We have designed O-ACE POP (Online Active Community Engagement Proof of Principle Study), a randomised controlled trial, to investigate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of action of an innovative online museum experience to reduce anxiety and depression and support mental health in people aged 16–24, compared with a typical museum website (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

              <title>Preparatory work</title>
              <p id="Par9">During the first lockdown in the UK, many people turned to online content provided by museums and other cultural organisations . We conducted an online survey into the potential mental health benefits of online cultural resources. The self-reported mental health benefits of online culture were more marked in regular users of online culture and differed with age group. People aged 16–24 were less likely to be regular users of online culture, but echoing population studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], higher proportions had clinically significant levels of distress, signifying probable anxiety or depression. We therefore surmised that targeting by age group might maximise the benefits of online culture.</p>
              <p id="Par10">We then utilised qualitative research methodologies to investigate the potential mental health benefits of cultural resources in  young adults. We used this research along with co-production with young adults to design and produce an online cultural experience to reduce distress and support mental health in people aged 16–24. This led to the production of Ways of Being (WoB), a cultural web-experience used as an intervention in this trial. These studies will be presented and reported separately.</p>

              <p id="Par22">Ways of Being (WoB) is an online cultural experience designed to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and support mental health in people aged 16–24. Based on the findings of qualitative research with people of the target age range, human centred narratives and viewpoints are a focus of the experience. WoB was designed and produced via co-production with young people and will be described in full in a separate publication. The experience centres around the objects and artworks of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and partner museums. The experience combines text, audio and aesthetic elements. Each participant will be given a unique ID to log in to WoB.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The Ashmolean Website is a generic museum website owned by the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Oxford. The Ashmolean is the oldest public museum in the UK and has rich and diverse collections from around the globe, ranging from classical civilisation to the Pre-Raphaelites and modern art. Participants will be directed to the Ashmolean from home collections.</p>

                  <title>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</title>
                  <p id="Par25">The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a widely used scale of emotion and comprises 20 items, 10 measuring positive affect (excited, inspired, etc.) and 10 measuring negative affect (upset, afraid, etc.), on a Likert Scale of 1 (very slightly) to 5 (extremely) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This will be asked with reference to the previous seven days at baseline and 6-week follow-up, the previous 3 days at day 5 and at that precise moment twice daily during the 3-day intervention phase. The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of depression and anxiety in young adults. The PANAS was chosen for this study as it is relatively stable but also sensitive to mood fluctuations if used with short-term instructions (e.g. now) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data in the general UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The basic psychometric data for the PANAS was developed from studies in undergraduates, of a similar age range as the participants of this current study, and it is well validated in young adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par26">In previous studies, negative and positive affect have emerged consistently as two dominant and relatively independent dimensions in the structure of affect. The Negative Affect (NA) scale of the PANAS is highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable (Cronbach alpha reliabilities for intercorrelations and internal consistency range from .84 to .87) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NA reflects the degree of subjective distress arising from various negative mood states, such as guilt, anger, fear and nervousness. High NA is related to self-reported stress and difficulty coping with negative events. The 10-item Positive Affect (PA) scale is valid and reliable with high internal consistency. Reliabilities range from .86 to .90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High PA is characterized by energy, concentration and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>

The K10 comprises ten questions inquiring about the frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the previous 4 weeks. The K10 has been used as an epidemiological measure to screen for clinically significant depression and anxiety in community samples worldwide. The K10 strongly discriminates between community cases and non-cases of mental disorders identified by a structured clinical interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, it has been used as an outcome measure in intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

Facial expressions of anger, fear, disgust, sadness, surprise, are presented across different intensity levels (0–100%, in 10% steps) and participants are asked to indicate the facial expression that they can see. Two hundred fifty trials are presented split into separate blocks. Accuracy, reaction time and misclassifications are computed in this task.

                  <p id="Par31">The Probabilistic Instrumental Learning Task (PILT), adapted for use online, is based on the Instrumental Learning task described by Pessiglione et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We chose this task as depression is characterized by deficits in reward-based decision making. In particular, reward sensitivity is thought to relate to anhedonia, a symptom seen in depression which reflects a deficit in the ability to experience pleasure. We hypothesised that the mechanism of action of cultural experiences on depression might involve an improvement in reward processing and therefore changes in the performance of this task may signify changes in the vulnerability to depression relating to a cultural intervention. This could provide vital clues as to the underlying mechanism by which such interventions might work on a neural level.</p>
                  <p id="Par32">The PILT has been described in full elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In brief, the participant gains or loses points by choosing between two paired images. Participants are required on each trial to choose one of two pairs of symbols. One pair is associated with win outcomes (win 20 pence or no change) and the other with loss outcomes (lose 20 pence or no change). Each symbol in the pair corresponds to reciprocal probabilities (0.7 or 0.3) of the associated outcomes occurring. Participants are instructed to pick the symbol they believe is most likely to win (or least likely to lose), with the aim of maximising their monetary pay off. Feedback on the outcome of each trial is given after a choice is made. Participants complete two runs of the task, each with a new set of four symbols. The total amount won, total amount lost, end total, symbol choice and choice consistency are recorded. The explicit aim is to maximise points.</p>

Participants will continue to be invited for assessments whether or not they use the allocated intervention. Missing item responses are not possible by design. Missing data, if any, will happen due to participants discontinuing with outcome assessments. However, their data for timepoints prior to that will still be included in the multilevel model, so no additional methodological steps are required regarding missing data.</p>
                <p id="Par40">For NA and PA we will separately regress the subscale means on baseline score (Day 1 measurement), an indicator for Group (Ashmolean website / WoB), and contrast code age (16-17 / 18-24), sex (Male / Female), ethnicity (White / Other), relationship status (In / Not in relationship or other), and current antidepressant use (Yes / No). We will include random intercepts for participants. As there are multiple timepoints at which the group comparison could be made, we will allow the Group effect to vary as a random effect across the measurement timepoints. We will perform a similar analysis for the K10, however as there are fewer measurement timepoints for the K10 compared to the PANAS (2 vs 8) we treat time points as fixed effects. This is the same for secondary outcomes, flourishing and loneliness. The 6-week measures are primarily included to assess whether early differences in the performance of cognitive tasks predict changes in the primary outcomes at 6 weeks.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par58">O-ACE POP has two main goals. The first is to assess the effectiveness of a web-based cultural experience tailored to support mental health in young people compared with the Ashmolean Museum Website, on measures of mood, as well as loneliness and flourishing. The second is to investigate the impact on objective measures (cognitive tasks) predicting vulnerability to common mental disorders. Young people identified that human based narratives and other people’s viewpoints would have the potential to reduce distress, improve their mental health and enhance feelings of connection with others. This study will allow us to examine whether an intervention based directly on the opinions and experiences of young people and targeted at them has the potential to work over and above what is already available (without these specific features). This study will allow us to explore who, how and if online cultural experiences are effective for the mental health of young people.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Completing this study in this age range has many important advantages. First, given the trajectory of common mental disorders, this is a critical timepoint for minimising their impact in terms of disease burden, lifetime distress, illness and social and economic factors such as lost productivity. Second, this is a peak period for development of common mental disorders and, thus, a critical timepoint for prevention. Third, research in this age range is less likely to be confounded, for example by multiple episodes and medical or psychological interventions.</p>

              <title>Strengths</title>
              <p id="Par60">Many now advocate the engagement of young people, co-production and an increased evidence base for community interventions for CMDs in young people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This trial is the first of its kind, and whilst ambitious in its endeavour, there are no previous trials of online museums for mental health in young people on which to build. We worked closely with young people of the target age-range to co-produce the web experience and with PPI of the target age range to design the experiment. We have kept broad inclusion criteria so as not to exclude people who could potentially benefit and use subgroup analyses to generate hypotheses as to the optimal use of these interventions, for investigation in further studies. We also piloted the study and intervention on eleven volunteers in order to assess smooth running of the procedures and identify any potential unintended or adverse effects. On detailed discussion amongst the study team and trial steering committee, given the feedback from volunteers, the nature of the interventions and length of the intervention phase, the risk of adverse effects were deemed minimal.</p>

            <sec id="Sec28">
              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p id="Par61">Due to technical aspects of the cognitive tasks and the WoB web-experience, for inclusion into this study participants require access to a computer (laptop or desktop) with a recent Web Browser. This may mean that some groups may not access this study or may not fulfil the inclusion criteria. It is difficult to assess how many people this may apply to. However, internet access in general has increased in recent years. In 2020, 96% of households in Great Britain had internet access, an increase from 93% in 2019 and 57% in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Many of the barriers to internet use involve not wanting to use the internet or concerns regarding security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is not clear from the literature how many people in this specific age range would not have access to a computer with a recent browser and how this relates to their mental health need.</p>

              <title>Implications</title>
              <p id="Par62">Studies that attempt to quantify the potential benefits of community resources for mental health may aid policy makers to make informed decisions regarding allocation of limited resources. In addition, the accessibility of technological resources for using, optimising or testing the mental health benefits of community resources is a major consideration for which evidence is scarce. For example, further generations of optimised community webtool interventions and perhaps even the platforms for testing of their mental health benefits may become possible on Smartphones or Tablets, thus increasing the accessibility of such interventions and studies to people from lower income groups who may have reduced access and potentially greater mental health need. In addition, this study develops rigorous testing to methodologies which encompass engagement with young people and co-production of engaging and acceptable interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par63">The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions has been detrimental to the mental health of the population but has provided a unique opportunity to design an innovative approach for mental health in young adults<italic>.</italic> Findings derived from this study will allow us to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and will lay the groundwork for the design of studies to further enhance, refine and test online and in-person cultural resources for mental health in target populations. Moreover, it will allow us to identify whether online experimental studies in the area of community resources for mental health in young people are a fruitful avenue for research.</p>
