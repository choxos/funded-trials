                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Mental health recovery narratives have been defined as first-person lived experience accounts of recovery from mental health problems which refer to events or actions over a period of time and which include elements of adversity or struggle, and also self-defined strengths, successes or survival. They are readily available in invariant recorded form, including text, audio or video. Previous studies have provided evidence that receiving recorded recovery narratives can provide benefits to recipients.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">This protocol describes three pragmatic trials that will be conducted by the Narrative Experiences Online (NEON) study using the NEON Intervention, a web application that delivers recorded recovery narratives to its users. The aim of the NEON Trial is to understand whether receiving online recorded recovery narratives through the NEON Intervention benefits people with experience of psychosis. The aim of the NEON-O and NEON-C trials is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial on the use of the NEON Intervention with people experiencing non-psychosis mental health problems and those who care for others experiencing mental health problems respectively.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The NEON Trial will recruit 683 participants with experience of psychosis. The NEON-O Trial will recruit at least 100 participants with experience of non-psychosis mental health problems. The NEON-C Trial will recruit at least 100 participants with experience of caring for others who have experienced mental health problems. In all three trials, participants will be randomly allocated into one of two arms. Intervention arm participants will receive treatment as usual plus immediate access to the NEON Intervention for 1 year. Control arm participants will receive treatment as usual plus access to the NEON Intervention after 1 year. All participants will complete demographics and outcome measures at baseline, 1 week, 12 weeks and 52 weeks. For the NEON Trial, the primary outcome measure is the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life at 52 weeks, and secondary outcome measures are the CORE-10, Herth Hope Index, Mental Health Confidence Scale and Meaning in Life Questionnaire. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted using data collected through the EQ-5D-5 L and the Client Service Receipt Inventory.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">NEON Trial analyses will establish both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the NEON Intervention for people with experience of psychosis, and hence inform future clinical recommendations for this population.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par48">Mental health <italic>recovery narratives</italic> have been defined as first-person lived experience accounts of recovery from mental health problems which refer to events or actions over a period of time and which include elements of adversity or struggle, and also self-defined strengths, successes or survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. They are referred to as recovery narratives in this protocol whilst recognising that this term is used elsewhere in healthcare research and practice, e.g. in narratives of recovery after a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recovery narratives can be shared <italic>live</italic>, as part of social interactions with others, or they can be presented in <italic>recorded</italic> form, as invariant text, audio or video [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this protocol, the person telling the story, in either form, is referred to as the <italic>narrator</italic>, and the person reading, watching, listening to or otherwise engaging with the story is referred to as the <italic>recipient</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">Sharing of recovery narratives is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Informal peer support, involving interactions between individuals with similar experiences of health problems, is one example of a naturally occurring relationship in which live recovery narratives can be narrated and received. Informal peer support can take place in person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this century a new employment role of peer support worker or peer specialist has emerged in mental health systems internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] which involves employing people in roles for which personal experience of mental health problems and recovery is a requirement. Intentional peer support has an empirical evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and is being implemented globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A US national survey has identified helping others through the narrating of mental health recovery narratives as a feature of the work of peer specialists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Peer support workers can create change through mechanisms such as role modelling of individual recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Davidson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have argued that the disclosure by a peer worker of their own transition to a “hero of their own self-journey” (p. 124) can instil hope in others. The growth of peer support work means that an increasing number of people living with mental health problems have access to live recovery narratives shared as part of a supportive relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">Access to recorded narratives is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Substantial numbers of recorded recovery narratives are publicly available, distributed through mechanisms including books [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], health service booklets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], online collections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and digital media hosting services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Creating narratives can also provide benefits for narrators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], who might be motivated by sending messages of “hope, courage and survival” (p. 68) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], a form of indirect emotional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Campaigns which aim to reduce stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], such as Bell Let’s Talk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], have used recorded recovery narratives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] as a mechanism for creating social contact between people with experience of mental health problems and others, drawing on long-standing evidence for social contact as an anti-stigma mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Health material shared in anti-stigma campaigns can have a beneficial impact on help-seeking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], a finding that is important when systematic review evidence shows that stigma can disrupt help-seeking behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Receiving a recovery narrative can provide personal inspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], increase empathy and understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], validate difficult personal experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or provide alternative forms of companionship at times of social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Receiving recovery narratives can also contribute to recipient distress, e.g. if the recipient feels angry or “out of place” through a perception that he/she has experienced greater hardship than a narrator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par51">The public availability of an increasing number of recorded recovery narratives is an opportunity to provide support to people through a new form of mental health intervention. Organisations such as Here to Help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and the Scottish Recovery Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] have already created online collections of recovery narratives with the explicit intent of supporting recovery in recipients. These might be seen as a specific initiative within a larger effort to incorporate digital healthcare technologies (DHTs) into mental health practice, motivated by known global challenges such as lengthy waiting lists for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], limited access to in-person mental health treatment in rural and remote communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and the distress inherent in accessing in-person treatment for people experiencing social anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Systematic review evidence shows that DHTs can be effective at supporting self-management for long-term conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and because face-to-face contacts account for nearly 90% of healthcare interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], then developing self-management skills might save health service resources as well as supporting better long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par52">A recent qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to investigate the impact of receiving live and recorded mental health recovery narratives for 77 participants identified three benefits specifically attributable to the supportive process of receiving recorded recovery narratives: obtaining access to narrators not available in everyday life; having control over when and how to access a narrative; and a lack of social interaction burden around receiving the narrative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The same study presented a change model in which impact begins with the recipient connecting to events in the narrative or to characteristics of the narrator. Impact was reduced if the recipient was experiencing a crisis, and was positively moderated by the perceived authenticity of the narrative. Receiving recovery narratives created cognitive and affective change in perceptions of connectedness, validation, hope and optimism, empowerment, appreciation, reference shift and reduction in self-stigma. The definition of appreciation encompassed a subset of experiences identified as “meaning in life” in a systematic review on recovery processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Feeling empowered led to helpful behavioural changes emulating those of the narrator, such as increased likelihood of disclosure of mental health experiences to others and greater ability to exert control during interactions with mental health workers. Harmful transdiagnostic forms of cognitive and affective change can also be created by receiving recovery narratives. These include perceptions of inadequacy, disconnection, pessimism and burden. Interventions utilising recovery narratives should consider how to manage and ameliorate harmful change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par53">A recent qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] has refined the mechanism of connection presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It has identified three factors underpinning connection: comparison of self to narrator or narrative; feeling empathy for the narrator; and learning something from the narrative.</p>
              <p id="Par54">A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] provides additional specific items of knowledge that complement these two qualitative studies, which post-date the review. It found that recent traumatic events disrupt connection to a narrator or narrative and hence reduce potential impact. Receiving the recovery narratives of people experiencing eating disorders can cause diagnostically specific harmful behavioural responses in those with prior experience of eating disorders, in the form of emulating harmful behaviours described by a narrator, especially if the matched behaviours had been previously enacted by a recipient. Emulation of narrator behaviours was initiated by the elements of eating disorder recovery narratives that described adversity or struggle. It was potentiated by any specific detail about eating disorder behaviours taking place during these periods, such as narrator estimates of how many calories they were consuming.</p>
              <p id="Par55">The preceding evidence is primarily transdiagnostic, since recovery is a multicomponent process which is not diagnosis-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, there is specific evidence that indicates possible benefits of recorded recovery narratives in relation to people living with psychosis. An Australian study identified benefits from recorded recovery narratives in three domains: being inspired; knowing I’m not alone; and believing recovery is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Recovery narratives can create hope, and messages that create hope are known to be recovery-promoting in psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Feeling more hopeful can also support recovery through re-imagining the self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and hope mediates potential psychosis recovery indicators such as increases in structured activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. People experiencing psychosis regularly use digital technologies such as social networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, a systematic review of interventions for psychosis incorporating online, social media and mobile technologies concluded that these approaches are acceptable, feasible and have the potential to improve outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">No prior randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the use of recorded recovery narratives to provide benefits for people experiencing psychosis has been conducted, and an RCT would inform the development of diagnostically specific clinical guidelines for the use of recovery narratives with this population. We will conduct a definitive pragmatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] RCT, the <italic>Narrative Experiences Online (NEON) Trial</italic>, which incorporates an economic and process evaluation. Recovery narratives and all trial procedures (including randomisation) will be delivered online through the NEON Intervention, a non-medical online interface designed with the intent of supporting people experiencing a wide range of mental health problems. The NEON Intervention provides a variety of mechanisms for accessing the NEON Collection of recovery narratives. These include the use of a hybrid recommender system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which uses both collaborative filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and content-based filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] to generate automated recommendations of recovery narratives, tailored to information collected about participants. The content-based portion of the recommender system uses a model trained using supervised machine learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] to identify content that might provide benefits for a user.</p>
              <p id="Par57">In addition to people living with mental health problems, recovery narratives may be relevant to their informal carers, such as family members, friends, neighbours and other unpaid supporters. Many carers struggle with feeling pessimistic about the possibility of recovery for their loved ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and there is evidence that being more “recovery-aware” gives informal carers more hope and optimism about the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Established recovery frameworks are also relevant to the experiences of informal carers, supporting processes such as maintaining hope, reconnecting, overcoming secondary trauma and (for family members) journeying from carer to family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Although the knowledge base is less developed than for people with mental health problems, current evidence suggests that recovery narratives may also be beneficial to informal carers. As such, we will use the same digital infrastructure to conduct an exploratory study of the use of the NEON Intervention for informal carers (the <italic>NEON-C Trial</italic>), to inform the design of a future definitive RCT. Given the transdiagnostic benefits of recovery narratives previously identified, we will also run a second exploratory study with people with non-psychosis mental health problems (the <italic>NEON-O Trial</italic>).</p>

All other evidential requirements are covered by this trial protocol.</p>

                <title>Study change model for the impact of recorded recovery narratives</title>
                <p id="Par82">A change model has been synthesised from frameworks developed in a systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The most empirically supported elements of these frameworks were integrated, with priority given to those which can be evaluated in a clinical trial with a process evaluation. A specific focus was on the causal chain of intermediate mechanisms between intervention and outcome. The change model contains no diagnostically specific elements and hence is appropriate for use in all three trials described in this protocol. The change model is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

                <p id="Par83">Initiation of help-seeking behaviours is included as a helpful change, due to evidence that this can generally be produced through exposure to mental health material used in anti-stigma campaigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], although no evidence as yet links initiation of help-seeking behaviours to receiving recovery narratives specifically.</p>
                <p id="Par84">The change model includes <italic>emulation of harmful behaviours</italic> as a general form of harmful change caused by receiving recovery narratives. Whilst existing research evidence for this is limited to recipients with prior experience of eating disorders, receiving online material featuring self-harm is known to have the capacity to potentiate self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and inclusion of a more general formulation of harmful behavioural change in the change model enables the selection of mechanisms to manage it. As such, this inclusion is justifiable on the biomedical principle of non-maleficence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="Par85">The NEON Trial is an RCT with an internal pilot and an economic and process evaluation, and with all study procedures other than process evaluation interviews conducted online. The internal pilot sample will comprise participants recruited during the first 3 months of the trial, with trial recruiting continuing thereafter. NEON Trial participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be individually randomised into one of two treatment groups (control group, intervention group) with an allocation ratio of 1:1.</p>
              <p id="Par86">Follow-up is at 1 week, 12 weeks and 52 weeks after randomisation, with the primary endpoint at 52 weeks. The cost-effectiveness of the NEON Intervention will be established by calculating the costs of delivering the NEON Intervention, the impact on services costs of receiving the intervention and the change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to receiving the intervention.</p>
              <p id="Par87">The NEON-C and NEON-O exploratory trials are RCTs with a limited process evaluation. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be individually randomised into one of two treatment groups (control group, intervention group) with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The same outcome data will be collected as for the NEON Trial, at the same timepoints, but only exploratory clinical and economic analyses will be conducted. As for the NEON Trial, all study procedures other than process evaluation interviews are conducted online. Up to 20 semi-structured interviews will be conducted for the process evaluation in each of the NEON-C and NEON-O trials.</p>
              <p id="Par88">Participants will not be blinded to allocation status in any of the three NEON trials. There will be no exclusions based on current treatment.</p>
              <p id="Par89">The schedule of enrolment activities, interventions and assessments is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

              <p id="Par90">Assessments at 1, 12 and 52 weeks are required for clinical and economic analyses. The assessment at 104 weeks is not required, as only early recruits will reach this before the study end date. Participation in interviews for the internal pilot and process evaluation is optional and not included in the figure.</p>

                  <p id="Par129">For all three trials, participants randomised to the intervention group will continue to receive their usual care (if any). Typical offerings are as described for the control group. The intervention group will also receive immediate access to the NEON Intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par130">The NEON Intervention is a password-controlled, online interface which presents mental health recovery narratives either sourced from existing public collections such as books, health service booklets and online collections, or donated specifically to the NEON study by individuals. Narratives are managed in line with a protocol previously approved by the Health Research Authority (HRA) (Integrated Research Application System [IRAS] 247343, Research Ethics Committee [REC] reference 18/LO/0991).</p>
                  <p id="Par131">The NEON Intervention is accessed through a web browser, either on a mobile phone or on a laptop or desktop computer. It provides four routes to accessing recovery narratives, which are described in the following paragraphs, one of which uses an algorithm to match narratives to participants. This is referred to as the <italic>matching algorithm</italic> in the remainder of this protocol. Information about participants used to generate matches is referred to as <italic>matching data</italic> and is stored in a <italic>personal profile</italic> along with other forms of personal information needed by the NEON Intervention. Information stored in the personal profile is detailed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. All items in the personal profile are considered to be research data. Titles or categories used to display personal profile contents to participants may be updated (for example, in response to feedback collected through the internal pilot).</p>
                  <p id="Par132">The NEON study Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP), consisting of 10 members with personal experience of mental health problems, have advised that participants should be able to provide as little or as much information in their personal profile as they wish, and hence we have minimised mandatory items in the personal profile. Although there is some overlap with the demographics form used by the NEON trials, the contents of the personal profile are not auto-populated from the demographics form. This maintains a separation between trial procedures and intervention usage. The exception is contact details provided through the consent form, which are essential for operation of the NEON Intervention. Here, the personal profile will be auto-populated to reduce participant burden.</p>
                  <p id="Par133">After signing in to the NEON Intervention for the first time, the participant is sequentially shown a number of introductory pages intended to facilitate learning how to work with the NEON Intervention, and to collect enough information for the NEON Intervention to function effectively. These pages will not appear on subsequent logins. First interactions with a mental health technology are known to present particular difficulties for users experiencing mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; hence, these pages have been designed to help a new user rapidly acclimatise to the NEON Intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par134">The introductory pages appear in the following sequence:</p>
                  <sec id="FPar1">
                    <title>“Welcome” page</title>
                    <p id="Par135">This page provides a brief overview of how to use the NEON Intervention; seeks to normalise emotional responses to recovery narratives; and provides initial guidance on how to deal with difficult emotional responses.</p>

                  <sec id="FPar2">
                    <title>“Initial information” page</title>
                    <p id="Par136">The Initial information page allows the participant to provide an initial set of entries for all “directly editable” items in their personal profile (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). To support participants in managing their own safety, this includes a list of types of narrative content that they wish to hide, using a typology of content warnings developed by the NEON study.</p>
                    <p id="Par137">Some participants will be experiencing conditions that disrupt processing of particular formats of narrative, e.g. text-based narratives in the case of dyslexia. Some participants may have to use public computers to access the NEON Intervention and hence may wish to avoid formats of narrative that include audio. As such, users can select formats of narrative that they do not wish to receive. The NEON Intervention interface will not allow users to block all formats, as then they would not be able to receive any narratives.</p>
                    <p id="Par138">The Initial information page will include text indicating that personal profile contents can always be updated through the “About Me” button during future usage of the intervention.</p>

                  <sec id="FPar3">
                    <title>“First story” page</title>
                    <p id="Par139">This provides a first experience of receiving a short narrative, so that the user experiences this as early as possible in usage of the intervention. A short narrative will be displayed on this page. Only narratives that do not have content warnings will be considered in scope for selection so as to minimise chances of distress. The selected narrative will not be of a format blocked by the user, and hence some users will receive different “first stories”.</p>
                    <p id="Par140">After receiving this narrative, the participant will be asked to rate it for hope, and optionally four types of connection mechanisms. The following questions and anchor points will be used, with indicated questions, numbers and numerical ranges <italic>not</italic> visible to participants.</p>

                    <p>Q2 and Q3 have been selected to operationalise the connection mechanism referred to as “Self-to-other comparison” in the trial change model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Q4 operationalises the connection mechanism referred to as “learning”. Q5 operationalises the connection mechanism referred to as “empathy”. Responses to these five questions are referred to as <italic>narrative feedback</italic> in the remainder of this protocol, and will be used as matching data. The NEON Intervention will encourage participants to provide narrative feedback after each narrative received through usage of the NEON Intervention, although it is not technically possible to enforce this, since participants can always close their web browser if they do not wish to provide feedback.</p>
                    <p>The pool of narratives considered in scope for usage as the first story will be reviewed approximately every 3 months after trial start. Drawing on all narrative feedback provided by trial participants up to that point, a small number of narratives will be selected which have received hope ratings with a high mean and small standard deviation (SD), as these are most likely to be beneficial.</p>
                    <p>LEAP have advised that participants should be able to <italic>block</italic> any story at any point (e.g. even partway through reading or watching it), for example, if they found it excessively distressing. LEAP have also advised that recipients should be able to bookmark a story, e.g. to allow an influential story to be re-visited or discussed with a support worker. As such, buttons to block and bookmark stories will be provided on the same screen as the first story, and for all other subsequently accessed stories.</p>
                    <p>After viewing the first story and providing narrative feedback, the participant is given access to the intervention home page. This presents four buttons in an ordered list, allowing participants to access recovery narratives in different ways:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par158"><italic>“Match me to a story (recommended)” button</italic>. Requests the automated recommendation of narratives matched to the participant, presented as a list of stories. This will be the recommended approach to narrative selection; hence, it appears first in the list. The participant can choose to receive just one narrative or can examine all in the list. The list will only include narratives not seen before.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par159"><italic>“Get me a random story” button</italic>. Requests a randomly selected narrative that the user has not seen before, using an algorithmic pseudo-random number generator.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par160"><italic>“Browse stories” button</italic>. Shows available narratives grouped by tags, so that the participant can browse them. For example, the database may contain 245 narratives which relate to employment. The participant can narrow the search by selecting multiple tags, and can choose from narratives matching selected tags.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par161"><italic>“My stories” button</italic>. Shows a list of recovery narratives previously received, unless they have been blocked, in which case they will not appear. They are presented in two groups: (1) narratives previously bookmarked by the participant, (2) hopeful stories (those rated highest for hope, either as indicated by the participant or by the cohort as a whole). The participant can select a bookmarked or hopeful narrative to be re-received.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p>The home page also contains a button labelled <italic>“About Me”</italic>. Clicking this button opens a page allowing the participant to update any information in their personal profile marked as “directly editable” in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. It contains a link to a safety event reporting form, in case the participant has experienced a serious adverse event (SAE), and also a function to allow participants to unblock all blocked narratives. Since even the titles of narratives might be distressing in some circumstances, this function will not display a list of all narratives that have been blocked, and will instead just summarise the number of blocked narratives.</p>
                    <p>To enable easy navigation, the footer of the NEON Intervention, which is always available regardless of which page is selected, will contain five buttons: Home, Welcome, About NEON, I’m upset, Get me out of here.</p>
                    <p>Clicking these buttons causes the following actions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par165"><italic>“Home” button</italic>.

Opens a page giving more detailed information about the NEON Intervention, including aims, how narratives were collected, how to make best use of the intervention, information about the funders, information about the study team (including a link to the study website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://researchintorecovery.com/neon">http://researchintorecovery.com/neon</ext-link>), functionality to view the consent form and functionality to initiate a withdrawal from the trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par168"><italic>“I’m upset” button</italic>. Opens a page giving information about dealing with difficult emotional responses. This will remind participants of any self-management strategies they have identified. It will suggest common self-management strategies that might help them. It will provide links to organisations and services that can be accessed by participants, including charities and statutory health services. The design of this page has been refined with LEAP.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par169"><italic>“Get me out of here” button</italic>.

                    <p>To distinguish the NEON Intervention from processes associated with the trial (e.g. information sheets, completion of measures), the NEON Intervention will not be branded with study sponsor or research site logos, and it will be presented with a contrasting colour scheme. This is to support the ecological validity of the evaluation by creating a visual boundary between trial procedures and intervention content.</p>
                    <p>Participants can use the NEON Intervention as little or as frequently as they wish, and there is no expected pattern of usage. Patterns of usage will be monitored algorithmically. If the participant has not used the intervention for 1 month, then a reminder message (which can be opted out of) will be sent through contact mechanisms specified on the “About Me” page. This will encourage the participant to re-visit the intervention and give an option to access online information about dealing with technical problems, such as reminders about the login procedure. Messages may also be sent when new narratives that might be of interest to participants are added, depending on the frequency of narratives being added to the database.</p>

                <p id="Par173">The primary outcome measure used in all three trials is quality of life, assessed with the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] at baseline and all follow-ups. MANSA has been successfully used to assess quality of life in individuals with psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and other forms of mental health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The score for MANSA is calculated from the 12 subjective items in Section 3 of the measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par174">Four clinical secondary outcome measures are used in the three trials. The CORE-10 is a self-rated measure of mental health distress, which includes 10 items relating to depression, anxiety, trauma, functioning and risk to self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The Herth Hope Index is a 12-item self-rated abbreviated version of the Herth Hope Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The Mental Health Confidence Scale is a self-rated measure of self-efficacy amongst persons dealing with mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The Meaning in Life Questionnaire is a 10-item measure incorporating two subscales: presence of meaning in life, anddegree of search for meaning in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. All secondary outcome measures have been used successfully with individuals experiencing psychotic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par175">Two measures are included for use in the health economics analysis for the NEON Trial. The EQ-5D-5 L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] is a five-item self-completed measure of health-related quality of life which is used across a broad range of health conditions. The Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) is a measure of service use that enables service costs to be estimated and which can be tailored to each study’s requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. A version of the CSRI has been produced which collects service use data covering primary care, secondary mental and physical care, social care and time away from usual activity/employment, defined using employment categories presented in the genetic mental health version of the full CSRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. These have been selected as the major cost drivers of provision for the NEON Trial population. Item count has been abridged relative to a typical item count for the CSRI so as to limit the total burden on participants of completing measures. CSRI completion at baseline will have a 6-month retrospective period, and CSRI completion at 52 weeks will have a 12-month retrospective period. The same data is collected in the NEON-O and NEON-C trials. The health economics measures are summarised in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Opportunistically, the same follow-up data will be collected at 104 weeks for intervention group participants who reach this timepoint, to allow for exploratory analysis of the longer-term impact of receiving the intervention. Eligible participants will be those who are randomised to the intervention group before end of April 2020.

                <title>Power calculation</title>
                <p id="Par176">The NEON Trial is powered on mean item score for MANSA. The primary endpoint for the NEON Trial is a minimally clinically important difference in mean item score. This is defined as an improvement of 1 scale point in 3 out of 12 items at 1 year follow-up in the intervention group relative to the control group. A total sample size of 683 (approximately 341 participants per arm) will provide 90% power to detect a minimally clinically important effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) of 0.27, allowing for 20% attrition (SD = 0.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], power = 0.9, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05). This will give an analysable sample of 546 (273 participants per arm).</p>
                <p id="Par177">The sample sizes for the NEON-C and NEON-O trials have been chosen in order to calculate preliminary effect size estimates to inform power calculations for future trials. A total pilot study sample size of at least 70 has been recommended to estimate the standard deviation of a continuous outcome with good precision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This general rule has also been shown to be sufficient in minimising the overall sample size across the pilot and main trial when medium effect sizes are expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Allowing for 20% attrition, the target sample size for both NEON-C and NEON -O will be at least 88 (44 per arm). We have decided to use a conservative rounded-up sample size of at least 100 (50 per arm) to reflect possible uncertainty in the attrition level.</p>

                  <title>Recruitment</title>
                  <p id="Par178">The planned recruitment period for all three trials is 14 months. The mean recruitment rate for the NEON Trial is 49 participants per month.</p>
                  <p id="Par179">Effectiveness studies evaluate treatments in “real-world” conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. An analysis of community survey data from 18 countries found that mean lifetime prevalence of ever having a psychotic episode was 5.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], whilst an epidemiological study conducted on a US community sample estimated lifetime rates of psychosis service usage in a range from 0.2% (narrowly defined criteria) to 0.7% (broadly defined) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Although these studies cover different populations, we have assumed for the purposes of recruitment planning that there is a substantial population of people with experience of psychosis but no engagement with statutory services. Recruitment strategies for the NEON Trial will be designed to target a purposive sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] of the target population, with the sample containing a representative spread of experiences of health service support for psychosis experiences. Informed by the epidemiological evidence, this will include participants who have received no support from health services. The same recruitment methods will be used for all three trials, but recruitment effort will be prioritised to the NEON Trial, which has the largest target sample size.</p>
                  <p id="Par180">The following recruitment methods will be used to make potential participants aware of the three NEON trials: online advertising (disseminated on the study website, by email and through social media networks); advertising in print media; placement of posters and leaflets in health service and community venues and in public places; snowball recruitment; recommendation by general practitioners, mental health workers and social workers to clients (either in person or by other communication mechanisms legitimately used by these practitioners); direct approach by researchers to individuals who might be interested in the study (either in person or by other communication mechanisms legitimately used by researchers to contact potential participants); presentations by the study team; appearances of the study team in national media; and recommendation by public figures with an interest in mental health. Where individuals are to be approached directly, governance of what is considered a legitimate approach will be delegated to research sites. For example, some research sites will have systems in place which allow for the management of “consent to contact” lists. These can be used to approach potential participants in the three NEON trials if they are authorised for use for these trials at the research site.</p>
                  <p id="Par181">Where promotional material is used, it will vary greatly in length and amount of information, e.g. between text used in tweets and text used in posters. We would anticipate sending out at least 100 pieces of promotional material, each tailored to a different audience and to the current state of the trial. Early on, we may send out broadly relevant messages, and later we may send out messages that are more targeted at under-represented groups.</p>
                  <p id="Par182">Principles to inform the text for all advertising are given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. These principles allow for the generation of recruitment material that is coherent and ethically sound, but which can also be updated as our understanding of how to promote the trial develops, for example, in response to the analysis of the NEON Trial internal pilot. All recruitment material generated will conform to these principles. All promotional material will be logged into the Trial Master File (TMF), with date and location of use, to enable the study sponsor to audit it against the advertising principles.</p>
                  <p id="Par183">Sample recruitment posters are included in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>. Their graphic design will be updated if necessary, and new graphic designs will be submitted to the HRA as a non-substantial amendment. Posters will not be localised to research sites.</p>
                  <p id="Par184">All recruitment activity will result in a participant receiving the web address of the <italic>splash page</italic> for the NEON trials. This is a publicly available online interface which can be accessed from a public or private computer or from a mobile device. The splash page incorporates a link to a login screen for participants who have already enrolled and have created an online account (“If you have a login click here”). It will have a link to a <italic>trial information page</italic> introducing the NEON Trial, NEON-O Trial and NEON-C Trial. This will describe the purpose of the trials and explain the process of enrolling, which may not be familiar to some potential participants (“If you are new to NEON click here”). It will link to a page to allow people to report safety issues (see the section on “Safety event monitoring procedures” for details).</p>
                  <p id="Par185">The trial information page will indicate if any trial has closed due to attaining the required participant count. From the trial information page, a potential participant can access an eligibility checking interface. The link to the eligibility checking interface will be removed once all trials have closed for recruitment, and all recruitment relating to that trial will be withdrawn as soon as possible after trial closure.</p>

                  <title>Eligibility checking</title>
                  <p id="Par186">To avoid the burden of an ineligible participant engaging in informed consent procedures, potential participants will be asked to answer a short series of questions presented in an online interface. The primary purpose of this interface is to establish eligibility for any of the three NEON trials. The interface will also capture how the potential participant learned about the NEON trials so as to evaluate the effectiveness of different recruitment methods. It will also capture sufficient information to allocate the potential participant to a research site if he/she is found to be eligible for a trial and then choose to complete consent procedures.</p>
                  <p id="Par187">For all three trials, the benefits of clinician rating of eligibility are outweighed by the significant extra burden on the participant, the likely lower recruitment rate that would result (as some potential participants would not wish their clinical team to be contacted) and the fact that many potential participants will not be in contact with mental health services.</p>
                  <p id="Par188">The interface used to present online questions will be publicly available. No online account is required to access it. No personal data will be stored as a result of interacting with it, as potential participants have not given consent at this point in the study procedures. Anonymous non-personal data will be stored to enable accurate reporting of trial recruitment processes and to inform advertising strategies. Before being presented with questions, potential participants will be shown a message, presented in text, which describes the purpose of the chosen questions and which indicates that potential participants should only fill them out if they are interested in taking part in one of the clinical trials. Carefully crafted instructions can shape online experience and can support compliance with a designer’s intended use for those experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The current text to be used is included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>. If needed to support effective use by participants, the text of all messages referenced in this protocol will be refined over time, for example, based on feedback collected during the internal pilot.</p>

                    <p id="Par190">Questions 3 through 8 in this table have been discussed with LEAP, and the text of these questions has been updated according to their recommendations. Questions that relate to mental health have been designed to be accessible to people who have never received a formal diagnosis of any mental health condition.</p>
                    <p id="Par191">The flow of questions in the eligibility checking interface will change as trials are closed for recruitment; e.g. if the NEON-C trial had recruited all needed participants, then questions 7 and 8 would be removed. In that circumstance, if a potential participant answered no to all items in question 5, they would then be given a message indicating they were ineligible for any trial.</p>
                    <p id="Par192">Ability to engage with the eligibility checking interface will be taken as evidence that the potential participant is capable of using an online intervention, either supported or unsupported. Items used in Q5 were drawn from the Threshold Assessment Grid (TAG), a staff-rated measure of the severity of mental illness, for which validity has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The phrase used in Q6 for verifying psychosis experiences in potential participants has been developed from an earlier NEON study which successfully recruited 28 participants with experience of psychosis but no formal diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].</p>
                    <p id="Par193">If a potential participant has entered the eligibility checking interface by clicking on a link in an online advert displayed on a website, the identity of the website displaying the advert will be logged automatically to support an evaluation of recruitment methods, and Q1 and Q2 will be skipped. The potential participant will be allocated to the Nottinghamshire Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust research site if he/she chose to progress through informed consent procedures, as all participants recruited through non-NHS routes are recruited to this site. To enable this automated process, the web address presented in the online advert will contain a parameter identifying the online system which displayed the advert. As an example, a web address including a parameter of 15 might indicate an advert displayed on the website of the University of Nottingham.</p>
                    <p id="Par194">Primary care recruitment for all trials is being managed by primary care teams in the nationwide network of Local Clinical Research Networks (LCRNs). Q1 will enable a reasonable assessment of primary care recruitment success, which will be considered in the analysis of the internal pilot of the NEON Trial.</p>
                    <p id="Par195">Secondary care recruitment for all trials is being managed by selected mental health trusts in England, who are operating as research sites. Q1 and Q2 together will enable a reasonable allocation of a participant who learned about the study through secondary care recruitment. If “None of these” is selected for Q2, a potential participant is allocated to the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust if the informed consent procedures have been completed.</p>
                    <p id="Par196">If responses to questions indicate that a potential participant is not eligible for any trials, then once the questionnaire has been completed, he/she will be informed of this, through a message designed to reduce the number of people who experiment with responses so as to obtain access to the NEON Intervention.

                  <p id="Par198">To ensure that a potential participant is sufficiently informed to provide online consent for participation, an online Participant Information Sheet (PIS) will be provided to people considered eligible to participate in any of the three trials. UK Health Research Authority (HRA) guidance confirms that the online provision of participant information is acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Items in the PIS will be provided in a vertical list, through which participants will be able to scroll up and down. At the end of the PIS, a link will be provided to an Informed Consent Form (ICF). The text/layout for the online PIS is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>; that for the online ICF is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>. The PIS will begin with an invitation to take part in a named trial.</p>
                  <p id="Par199">For some items, brief text with expandable detail has been provided. This was recommended by LEAP, who reviewed an earlier version of the PIS. It is consistent with emerging evidence that shorter information sheets are more likely to be fully read and more likely to be understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], and it exploits the opportunity offered by digital presentation to allow the potential participant to manage how the relevant information is presented. It also takes into account the intrinsically challenging and potentially distressing nature of the first point of interaction with a healthcare technology for a person experiencing mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], and is an attempt to make this first contact as accessible as possible. Navigation actions, such as scrolling up and down or opening and closing further information, will be logged anonymously to enable a quantitative evaluation of PIS usage, and the use of expandable details will be explored in the process evaluation. Data collected anonymously will not be linked to the account created for a participant who has completed all consent procedures. The exception will be the research site to which they should be allocated, which is inferred from questions 1 and 2.</p>
                  <p id="Par200">The PIS and ICF will contain contact details for the NEON research team. Potential participants will be encouraged to contact the team if they have any questions not answered on the PIS. After reading the PIS, a potential participant will be provided with two buttons, labelled “I <italic>do</italic> wish to take part in the trial” and “I <italic>do not</italic> wish to take part in the trial”. Participant choice will be logged anonymously to allow for accurate reporting of the trial. For participants who do not wish to participate, this message will be displayed:<disp-quote><p id="Par201"><italic>Thank you for considering involvement. If you change your mind you are welcome to return and re-register. You can safely close this window.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
                  <p id="Par202">Participants who select the “I <italic>do</italic> wish to take part in the trial” button will be asked to complete the online consent form. A joint statement of the HRA and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on seeking consent by electronic methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] indicates that online consent is acceptable for all studies other than Clinical Trials of Investigational Medicinal Products (CTIMPs).</p>
                  <p id="Par203">A key advantage of an online intervention is that participants can use a system anonymously if they wish. This feature is particularly relevant to the population for the NEON Trial, since people with psychosis may be particularly vulnerable to concerns about online data usage and may also fear stigmatisation due to mental ill-health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. There is evidence that the option to remain anonymous influences decisions about use of online interventions by people with psychosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. The option to remain anonymous has been successfully used in a number of online interventions with this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Therefore, the person will only be required to check each box on the consent form, rather than providing potentially identifying information such as a signature. This is in keeping with procedures specifically described and allowed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. However, as a minimum, potential participants must provide a valid email address so as to enable the collection of online outcome data. Participants who wish to remain anonymous can use email addresses that do not include their name.</p>
                  <p id="Par204">To consent to take part in the study, potential participants must supply all mandatory information required by the ICF, which includes providing a valid email address. They are then provided with two buttons labelled “I agree to take part in the study” or “I do not wish to take part”. If they click “I agree to take part in the study”, they will be given a message indicating that, to complete the registration process, they need to click on a link in a validation email sent to their account. Since a working email address is required for usage of the NEON Intervention, only potential participants who click this link will be enrolled.</p>
                  <p id="Par205">After clicking the link, the potential participant is now enrolled in the study. Participants will be asked for a password of their choosing, as it will then be easier to remember. No password complexity rules will be enforced. The participants will be reminded to make a note of the login details and given the option of receiving an automated email or text with the web address and their login details. Although sending such a message constitutes a potential security risk, this is a population who may have cognitive processing and strategic planning deficits. Therefore, the risk in this case is outweighed by the benefits of offering the participants the chance to have all information allowing them to use the intervention in one place.</p>
                  <p id="Par206">Participants will not be told of the research site to which they have been allocated. This would be confusing, as once an individual has confirmed participation, all planned participant interactions are either with the NEON Intervention or with the NEON study team.</p>

                  <title>Baseline data collection</title>
                  <p id="Par207">At first login, study participants in both groups will be asked to complete baseline measures using an online interface. They will be shown a message which explains the purpose of completing baseline measures; provides an estimate of how long the task will take; reminds them that they can claim a voucher for completing it; and reminds them that measures will need to be completed again later in the trial. Some items in baseline measures include questions that might be perceived as sensitive; hence, the message recommends that the participant should find a private place. The current text is message 4 in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>. Participants in NEON-O and NEON-C will not be offered any payment for completing measures; hence, for these trials a modified message will be used which excludes information about participant payment.</p>
                  <p id="Par208">Participants will then be asked to complete a demographics form and all measures. Each will be presented on a single form, which will start with a title and a single sentence describing the form, to support participant comprehension of purpose. All critical information to include on forms is summarised in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Demographic items on English national ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] and on educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] have been simplified from those produced by the Government Statistical Service guidance on harmonised questions and concepts for social data sources. An item on recovery status is included for those participants experiencing mental health problems. This incorporates a three-stage model of recovery, which currently has the strongest empirical support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], including through a study which recruited in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par209">To minimise data incompleteness, responses will be validated as entered in the online forms used to collect demographics and measures. For example, a participant will not be able to click “Next” until all items on the page have been rated, and can only provide an eligible data value. If the web browser is closed before all items are completed, then participants will be required to continue completion at next logon. After submitting a form, if a participant uses the “Back” button in the web browser, then the form will be displayed again with all data items entered automatically, and the participant will be able to update the values that have been entered and re-submit.</p>
                  <p id="Par210">After completing the final form, participants will be given a message thanking them for their responses and confirming once again that their data is confidential. The back button will no longer take them back to a previous form. NEON Trial participants will be provided with a link to claim a £20 voucher as a compensation for the time and effort of completing questions. The voucher will be sent via the participant’s registered email address, using an electronic voucher service provider. Receiving a voucher is optional, and will always be initiated by a participant. A request to be sent a voucher will be logged for study reporting purposes.</p>
                  <p id="Par211">In providing payment by voucher, there are two risks to address. One risk is technical error in the implementation of the NEON Intervention, which might result in multiple vouchers being sent to a participant for a single set of completed measures. The second is deliberate fraud, e.g. through a participant registering multiple accounts purely for the reason of claiming multiple vouchers. Thus, the following management strategies have been selected:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par212">The PIS will indicate that vouchers are paid up to 1 week after a claim is submitted, to allow the study to team to investigate and verify unusual patterns of voucher claims.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par213">Each request for a voucher will require the approval of an administrator, who will match the voucher request to an available code. This means that no voucher codes need to be stored in the NEON Intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par214">The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer used to make a voucher claim will be monitored. For each timepoint of the study, no more than 10 vouchers per IP address will be paid. This number has been selected to allow for multiple eligible users in the same residence, who might have different logins to the NEON Intervention but share an Internet connection—since domestic routers typically assign the same IP address to all devices connected to the router. It will also account for several individuals accessing the NEON Intervention from the same public computer (e.g. in a public library).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par215">Unusual patterns such as more than 5 voucher claims in a single day from an IP address will be investigated by the study team. The study team will contact relevant participants, using their registered email address, to gather information about voucher claims, and will reserve the right to suspend trial participation and to withhold voucher payment if suspicious behaviour is identified. Decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator (CI), with reasons reported to the study sponsor and logged in the TMF. If trial participation is suspended, the participant will not be included in study analyses.</p></list-item></list></p>

A request will be sent using current contact information for the participant, e.g. as collected through the online ICF or updated through the “About Me” page.

Intervention group participants can also be prompted through the NEON Intervention if they log into it at a timepoint when outcome data can be collected.</p>
                  <p id="Par220">When entering follow-up data, the same validation procedures will be used as for baseline data collection, and the same payment procedures will be used (i.e. a £20 voucher will be offered on completion of measures at each follow-up timepoint). Follow-up data will be considered valid if provided within 2 weeks of the 1 week follow-up date, and if provided within 1 month of all other follow-ups. Decisions on how to handle data which falls outside of these windows will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Incomplete forms will remain available up until the start of the next follow-up period.

The addition of new narratives would be important if interim analyses of demographic data show that participants have joined the trials from groups who are under-represented in the NEON Collection. It would also be important if some participants used the NEON Intervention so regularly that they were at risk of “running out” of new narratives to access. The addition of a batch of new narratives may incentivise re-engagement with the NEON Intervention, and prompts might be sent to draw attention to the presence of new narratives. If new narratives are added, they will be added in a small number of batches, at intervals of no less than 2 months. The date and contents of each batch will be logged in the SAP.</p>

                  <title>Operation of the matching algorithm</title>
                  <p id="Par263">The NEON Intervention is a hybrid recommender system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which uses both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to match narratives to users. When the user requests a new match, the list of narratives presented to the user will include a small number of items generated through each route. When narratives in the match are accessed, logging will incorporate an item indicating whether accessed narratives were recommended through collaborative filtering or content-based filtering, so that evaluation work can generate knowledge on their relative importance.</p>
                  <p id="Par264">Recommendations based on collaborative filtering will identify narratives with characteristics which have previously received positive narrative feedback scores from users considered similar to the requesting user, using a distance metric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>] calculated from user characteristics listed in the personal profile and from narrative feedback scores. Recommendations based on content-based filtering will identify narratives whose content is predicted to appeal to the requesting user. This prediction will utilise a model developed through supervised machine learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par265">The supervised training process for this model requires a training dataset, and a larger training set typically leads to a more effective model. All three trials will start with a single model trained from data collected during the intervention development phase of the NEON study (Slade, Rennick-Egglestone, Llewellyn-Beardsley et al: Using recorded mental health recovery narratives as a resource for others: Narrative Experiences Online (NEON) intervention development, submitted). This means that each trial will start with an identically parameterised model. This model will then be retrained using narrative feedback data provided by participants in each of the three trials. The models used in each trial will diverge, which is appropriate given the differing study populations. Retraining will take place regularly during the trial to maximise the benefits provided by retraining. Retraining will be conducted at least once during the internal pilot to assess the technical feasibility of retraining the algorithm whilst the NEON Intervention is still in use. At each retraining point, and in line with objective 6, all parameters defining the model will be logged, to allow for an understanding of how it has developed. The retraining protocol used during the trial will be logged in the SAP and included in the trial report.</p>
                  <p id="Par266">The NEON Intervention is intended to support positive psychological change in the user. In order to enable any change to influence the matching process, at key points the user may be prompted to update user characteristics stored in his/her personal profile. This is most likely to lead to changes in the “Recovery status” or “Diagnosis” item. Prompts might occur immediately after filling out follow-up questionnaires at the 1 week and 12 weeksfollow-ups. They would be sent by any communication mechanism in the personal profile after receiving each batch of 25 narratives. Older narrative feedback scores will be reduced in weight and eventually discarded for the purpose of calculating preference similarity with other users in collaborative filtering. This reflects the assumption that psychological change might be manifested in changes in narrative feedback behaviour.</p>
                  <p id="Par267">We anticipate that the effectiveness of the matching algorithm will improve over time. Recommendations made by collaborative filtering are likely to improve as new participants join the trials, since a larger number of participants may mean a more precise identification of others who are similar to the participant requesting a match. Recommendations made by content-based filtering are likely to improve as new content is added, as this provides for a greater pool of content, and as the model used to match participants to content is refined.</p>

This will allow the Programme Steering Committee (PSC) to make any necessary decisions about changes to study procedures following on from the internal pilot. The topic guide for internal pilot interviews will include questions intended to identify safety issues, to ascertain whether the NEON Intervention has been experienced as intended and to identify factors limiting fidelity, such as technical problems experienced by participants, or features of the interface limiting accessibility. Internal pilot interviews will take a maximum of 1 h.</p>
                  <p id="Par275">Interviews with the intervention and low engagement groups will be broader for NEON Trial participants. A draft topic guide is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>. In line with qualitative methodologies, the interview schedule will be refined over time. During the interview, some intervention group participants will be shown visualisations of logging data collected by the NEON Intervention and asked to explain interesting or unusual patterns, such as periods of very heavy or very light usage. This is a standard approach to enabling reflection on computer system usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>], and it provides a mechanism for augmenting system logs with the cause of such phenomena. Interviews with the intervention group for the NEON-O Trial and NEON-C Trial will be shorter, and will focus on the acceptability of the intervention to these participants.</p>

                  <title>Resilience to unplanned system downtime</title>
                  <p id="Par276">Occasional unplanned system downtime is to be expected with online interventions. A 2018 study of 32 web-hosting providers estimated 35 h downtime per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. This makes it likely that some participants or potential participants will experience unexpected downtime whilst using the NEON Intervention.</p>
                  <p id="Par277">Unexpected downtime might occur before consent has been provided by a potential participant. In this scenario, potential participants will need to complete eligibility checking processes again. Since no identifying information about potential participants can be collected until consent has been provided, it will not be possible to inform potential participants of the need to recomplete eligibility checking processes.</p>
                  <p id="Par278">Unexpected downtime might occur after consent has been provided but before randomisation has been completed, e.g. partway through completing demographics and measures forms. In this scenario, a participant can continue completing demographics and measures forms the next time he/she logs in. Data will be retained from any completed forms and will not need to be re-entered. In the event of this scenario, the participant will be sent a reminder of the need to complete demographics and measures, by any contact mechanism they have specified on the consent form. This reminder will be sent at least 1 day after the first form was completed.</p>
                  <p id="Par279">Unexpected downtime might occur after a participant has been randomised. This is inconsequential for trial processes, and hence no specific response is needed.</p>

                    <title>Study principles</title>
                    <p id="Par280">For all three trials, only serious adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored. This study policy has been agreed on with the PSC and study sponsor. It is consistent with HRA guidance, which indicates that only SAEs which are unexpected and related to the study should be reported to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. It has been informed by the online nature of the trials described in this protocol. Since the trials have no planned routine face-to-face contact with clinical or research staff, this would make routine monitoring for non-serious adverse events (AEs) intrusive. No event monitoring or reporting will take place after the trial has closed, even if a reported event pre-dated the end of the trial.</p>
                    <p id="Par281">The HRA defines an SAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>] as an untoward occurrence that:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par282">Results in death</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par283">Is life threatening</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par284">Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par285">Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par286">Consists of a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par287">Is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par288">The following AEs may result in an SAE and can be reasonably expected from this study, having been identified from the trial change model presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. As they are expected, they will not be reported to the REC, in keeping with protocols established for other online studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. All items in this list are specifically identified in the PIS as a possible harm of taking part in the trial so that potential participants can make an informed choice about participation:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par289">Feeling disconnected from others</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par290">Feeling more pessimistic</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par291">Feeling emotionally burdened</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par292">Feeling inadequate</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par293">Experiencing the release of uncomfortable emotions</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par294">Engaging in harmful behaviours encountered in narratives.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par295">In the event of uncertainty about whether an SAE should be categorised as unexpected, the CI can ask for a categorisation recommendation from the PSC chair.</p>
                    <p id="Par296">All SAEs, regardless of categorisation, will also be reported in an anonymous form to the PSC in case a specific response is indicated, such as a change to trial procedures. If a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is formed, then the event will be communicated to the DMC with all participant details intact.</p>

                    <p id="Par297">Since these are online trials with no face-to-face contact, it is likely that the CI will not become aware of all SAEs. The following procedures have been selected to create the maximum opportunity for SAE reporting:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par298">The version of the CSRI used in all three trials includes questions on nights spent in hospital and admissions to other hospital-based services. When used in the 12 months follow-up assessment, the retrospective period for the abridged CSRI is 12 months, which covers the entire duration of participation in the trial. As such, if a number other than 0 is entered for any of these questions, this could indicate that an SAE of type 3 as listed above has occurred, although it is still possible that the hospitalisation was planned, such as an operation for a physical health problem. Follow-up questions will be asked through the online form to collect sufficient details to allow for an event to be identified and categorised. Specific questions are included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par299">The splash page for the NEON Intervention will include a link to an online safety reporting form for use by participants or non-participants, which will allow SAEs of all types to be reported. Questions included in the safety reporting form are included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>. After completing the form, the respondent will be given a message informing them that the report has been received. The respondent cannot be informed of how it will be processed, as this would breach the confidentiality of any participant that they reported on.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par300">The “About Me” page will include a link to an online safety reporting form, which allows participants to report SAEs (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>). After completing the form, the respondent will be given a message thanking them for the report. Since this form is only accessible to the participant, it will exclude type 1 SAEs, as the participant cannot complete this form if he/she has died.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par301">When an SAE is identified through an online form, an email notification of the SAE and all accompanying information will be sent to the CI and study coordinator.</p>
                    <p id="Par302">Members of the study team or research site teams may also become aware of AEs through a direct communication from a participant or third party such as a family member or clinician. Some of these events may be classifiable as SAEs. Team members may become aware of these events:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par303">By email or phone, using contact details provided on the PIS or which are otherwise available publicly</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par304">Through discussions in process evaluation interviews.</p></list-item></list></p>
                    <p id="Par305">Any generic email address or phone number used by the study team will include a message indicating how regularly it will be monitored, and indicating that a response will be generated by the study team within a maximum of 3 days.</p>
                    <p id="Par306">Since the study policy is only to monitor SAEs, the person receiving a communication will first assess the event. All individuals who might receive AEs will undertake Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training in advance of trial start to support them in understanding how to respond and categorise them, and appropriate supervision arrangements will be in place to support their practice and safety.</p>
                    <p id="Par307">If the received communication relates to participant difficulties that do not reach the threshold for an SAE, the person sending the communication will be sign-posted to the support options identified through the “I’m upset” button, which is available to both the intervention group and the control group. If participant difficulties do reach the threshold for an SAE, the communicator will be asked about whether the study contributed to the event and also for further details of the event and its cause. The CI and study coordinator will be immediately informed of the event and the details that have been collected. If the person receiving the communication has any doubt about how to categorise the event, he/she will proceed on the assumption that it is an SAE, and the event will be referred to the CI.</p>
                    <p id="Par308">In all reporting routes, if further information is needed about the event, the CI or a delegate will attempt to contact the respondent for further details. If contact cannot be established with the respondent within 3 days, the CI will log this and will make decisions based on available information.</p>

                    <p id="Par311">Electronic trial data will initially be collected through an application running on a secure web server and placing data into a secure database. The application, web server and database will be controlled by DRT Software, an IT supplier with a contractual arrangement to the study sponsor to control the data processing operations that can be performed, which will be specified in the delegation of duties log. The web server and database will be hosted by a web-hosting provider contracted to DRT Software. The web-hosting provider will be accredited an information security standard agreed on with the study sponsor in advance of trial start (such as Cyber Essentials or ISO 27001). The application will not be opened to trial participation until the study sponsor has agreed in writing that hosting arrangements meet appropriate levels of security for hosting sensitive personal information.</p>
                    <p id="Par312">In the application, information that might identify an individual (e.g. email or phone numbers provided through the consent form) will be stored in a separate database from anonymous research data, linked only by ID. All information will be encrypted at rest using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption or equivalent, or stronger. A backup process will be specified in a data management plan agreed on with the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Unit (PCTU), IT supplier and study sponsor, and all backups will be encrypted at rest. All information will be encrypted in transmission to and from the server using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). At close of trial, all data stored on the web server, database and associated backups will be deleted using a thorough deletion protocol. When logging data from the trials is copied off the server, this will be logged so as to reveal who has accessed unblinded research data. For analysis and storage until end of the NEON study, anonymous research data will be transferred over HTTPS to a research server managed by the University of Nottingham.</p>
                    <p id="Par313">The exception to these arrangements will be qualitative process evaluation interview data. Interviews will be carried out by either telephone or secure video conference. Recordings of interviews will be made on computers with encrypted hard drives and/or to encrypted audio recorders. As soon as possible, data will be copied onto research servers managed by the University of Nottingham and then deleted from the source device.</p>
                    <p id="Par314">All data placed onto University of Nottingham research servers is backed up to two geographically redundant backup systems. Initially, the CI will only delegate access to the research team and study sponsor (the latter for the purposes of audit only). The research team incorporates staff at the University of Nottingham, PCTU, King’s College London, University of Manchester and Queen Mary University of London. If researchers work at sites other than the University of Nottingham, they will be able to download anonymous research for analysis using an individual associate account and a secure file transfer protocol. Alternatively, external researchers will be able to access data and analysis software using a remote desktop application, working over a secure connection. Consent logs will also be transferred to the same research servers, but to a different location and with access initially limited to the CI, and then delegated if necessary using the delegation of duties log.</p>
                    <p id="Par315">All of these procedures will be approved in writing by the study sponsor before the trial opens to participants, and approvals will be deposited in the TMF. The study sponsor will be the Data Controller for personal information, and the IT contractor, web-hosting provider and University of Nottingham will be data processors. Data processing operations will only be entered into when satisfactory contracts are in place to control data processing operations, such as collaboration agreements. All processing of personally identifiable data will be logged, in keeping with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements.</p>
                    <p id="Par316">Where research data is provided directly by participants, e.g. by completing electronic forms presenting items from demographics or outcome measures, the design of these forms will be reviewed by a PCTU-approved statistician before use, and they will not be used to collect data until signed off by the statistician.</p>

                  <p id="Par321">All three trials will be overseen by an independent Programme Steering Committee (PSC), which will function as a Trial Steering Committee (TSC). This committee has previously been convened by the CI. The chair of the PSC is Professor Sonia Johnson (Professor of Social and Community Psychiatry, University College London). Other members are Dr Tom Barker (Oxford NHS Foundation Trust), Dr Stephen Bremner (Senior Lecturer in Medical Statistics, Brighton &amp; Sussex Medical School), Terry Harper (independent Patient and Public Involvement [PPI] representative, current mental health service user) and Paul Stevens (Peer Support Worker, Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust). Any changes in PSC membership will be reported to the funder, study sponsor, PCTU and REC. Minutes of PSC meetings will be placed in the TMF and reported to the funder, study sponsor and PCTU.</p>
                  <p id="Par322">The CI and the PSC will decide whether to form a DMC, whose charter will be to identify ethical or safety issues emerging during the NEON Trial. The CI will inform the funder, study sponsor, PCTU and REC of a decision to form a DMC and its membership, or will provide a justification if a DMC is not formed. The DMC is the only body to have access to unblinded outcome data.</p>
                  <p id="Par323">At 2 months, the study team will review recruitment and retention for all three trials. If needed, and with advice from the PSC, the study team will implement low-burden contingency plans such as extending the recruitment strategy. Examples would include obtaining support from charities in advertising the opportunity to participate.</p>
                  <p id="Par324">Once the analysis of the internal pilot is complete (at 4 months or slightly later), the PSC will be presented with information about the fidelity, safety and recruitment/ engagement performance of the internal pilot. Safety information will include:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par325">Anonymous summaries of all SAEs received, including details of which (if any) were classified as being both related to the study and unexpected</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par326">Anonymous analyses of elements of interview transcripts relating to safety.</p></list-item></list></p>
                  <p id="Par327">The PSC will consider this information and decide whether to recommend changes to study procedures; whether to invoke remedial measures on recruitment and engagement; and whether to take forward data collected through the internal pilot into the full trial. For pragmatic trials, the latter is known to be a subjective judgement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par328">The PSC will also decide whether to invoke specific remedial measures to recruitment and engagement. The criteria for invoking these measures are as follows: recruitment, at or near 147 participants recruited within the first 4 months (i.e. 75% of target); engagement, 90% of intervention group participants view one narrative within 48 h of randomisation.</p>
                  <p id="Par329">Remedial action to take would be decided by the PSC and identified in collaboration with the NEON Trial Management Group (TMG), which is composed of representatives of the NEON study research team, LEAP and PCTU. Examples of possible remedial strategies for recruitment include reducing the follow-up length to allow longer for recruitment or widening recruitment beyond England. Examples of remedial strategies for engagement include the addition of face-to-face facilitation by either researchers or local clinical staff. The analysis plan for the NEON Trial will be updated accordingly, and any changes would be summarised in the NEON Trial report.</p>
                  <p id="Par330">At 6 months the PSC may again formally review recruitment and engagement in order to decide whether the NEON Trial should continue. The stop/go rule for recruitment will be attainment of, or clear trend towards, 206 (70%) of target 294 participants in this period. The stop/go rule for engagement will be attainment of, or clear trend towards, 80% of participants view one narrative within 48 h of randomisation. There are no stop/go rules for the NEON-C or NEON-O trials, but if the NEON Trial is stopped, these two trials will be stopped as well.</p>
                  <p id="Par331">A representative of the study funder will be invited to all PSC meetings. Changes to the study considered minor (in the judgement of the PSC chair) will be considered implementable immediately.

These have identified four publications presenting empirical evidence on the impact of real-world usage of content warnings. These studies show that content warnings can reduce harm by reducing stress in students with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] and by reducing negative emotions produced by engaging material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. They can be useful if provided well in advance of discussions in an educational context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>] and can reduce negative emotions and signal supportive environments, which may promote engagement with otherwise distressing material in the long run [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. They can however also increase avoidance, which may prevent people from learning to cope with distressing content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. Only one RCT has been conducted examining the psychological effects of issuing content warnings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. This trial found that warnings produced a small increase in self-reported anxiety after reading potentially disturbing literary passages amongst people who believed words can cause harm.

Narrators can withdraw consent for inclusion whilst the NEON Collection is in use.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par398">Narratives are incorporated exactly as originally published.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par399">All candidate narratives are assessed by at least one researcher against inclusion and exclusion criteria published at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.researchintorecovery.com/neoncollection">http://researchintorecovery.com/neoncollection</ext-link>.
