                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within the Children and Young People Secure Estate (CYPSE) is much higher than seen in the general population. To make a diagnosis of ADHD, clinicians draw on information from multiple sources, including parents and teachers. However, obtaining these is particularly difficult for young people in the secure estate. There is increasing evidence in the community that QbTest is able to assist in the accurate and earlier diagnosis of ADHD. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of QbTest in the assessment of ADHD within the CYPSE.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A single-centre parallel group feasibility randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Sixty young people within the CYPSE identified as displaying possible symptoms of ADHD will be randomised to the intervention arm (n=30; QbTest plus usual care) or control arm (n=30; usual care). Primary analyses will be descriptive and a process evaluation will be conducted to assess the contexts involved in implementing the intervention. Interviews will be conducted to explore acceptability and thematic analysis will be used to analyse the data.</p>

              <p>In England, children and young people aged 10–17 years old remanded or sentenced into custody are placed in a variety of different secure establishments, known collectively as the Children and Young People Secure Estate (CYPSE). The CYPSE includes: Secure Children’s Homes, Secure Training Centres and Young Offenders Institutions (YOIs). The majority of young people are placed within the YOIs and there are four establishments in England accepting 15–17 years old.</p>
              <p>The prevalence rate of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the CYPSE is approximately 30%–40%, which is significantly greater than the rate of 5%, seen in the general population.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> However, a report raised significant concerns about undetected neurodisability, including ADHD within the CYPSE, due to a lack of appropriate screening and assessment processes and training of staff.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Additionally, many young people have comorbid mental health needs contributing to complexity in the assessment process. ADHD is associated with a range of poor outcomes, including a greater risk of developing other mental and physical health needs, educational and occupational problems and offending.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–13</xref> The social and economic burden of untreated ADHD on society is significant.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–19</xref>
</p>
              <p>The publication of the Healthcare Standards for Children and Young People in Secure Settings<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> attempted to provide a more standardised approach to the assessment and care provided within the CYPSE. One way was to recommend the use of the Comprehensive Health Assessment Tool (CHAT).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The CHAT was introduced into the CYPSE in 2013 and is completed within all CYPSE sites in England, UK. The CHAT is a semistructured assessment of health needs, delivered by a nurse during the first 10 days of admission. If a nurse from talking with the young person and from observing them believes that they may have a need around difficulty concentrating, restlessness, fidgeting, and so on, then the nurse would recommend in the CHAT care plan that the young person be referred for a full ADHD assessment.</p>
              <p>For a formal clinical diagnosis of ADHD, a key aspect is the use of information from informants such as parents, teachers and health professionals.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> However, access to such information can be difficult to obtain and take a long time to receive, resulting in delays to receiving a confirmed diagnosis. The number of days young people spend in the CYPSE is relatively short.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, informant information is very often not received before the young person leaves and returns back to the community. There is also evidence from a recent review within the CYPSE that establishments find it difficult to provide interventions to young people who are sentenced to fewer than 6 months, due to delays in assessment and/or diagnosis.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> All these factors can lead to delays in young people with ADHD receiving a diagnosis and accessing evidence-based treatment.</p>
              <p>The impact of missed opportunities in diagnosis and accessing appropriate treatment can be significant. Young people with untreated ADHD in the CYPSE have been found to have an eightfold increased frequency of aggressive incidents in secure settings.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> Reducing violence and aggression is a key priority for Her Majesty’s Prison &amp; Probation Service and Ministry of Justice, given the increasing rates within prisons.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Treatment of adult offenders with ADHD using medication has demonstrated a reduction in reoffending of up to 41%.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Therefore, there are also likely social and economic benefits to improving the diagnosis and access to treatment for young people with ADHD in the CYPSE.</p>
              <p>QbTest (Qbtech) is a computer task that measures three core aspects of ADHD: attention, impulsivity and motor activity. Performance on the task provides information (via an immediate report) on the three symptom domains of ADHD and a ‘summary score’ based on deviation from a normative data set based on age group and gender. QbTest can be used with individuals with mild learning disabilities as instructions on how to complete the task are visual. Practitioners use the information from the QbTest report in conjunction with the clinical information (patient history, observation and ADHD symptom questionnaire) to inform their decision whether the young person has ADHD or not.</p>
              <p>QbTest demonstrates good psychometric properties<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> and has the additional benefit over other computer tasks of measuring activity level, a core symptom of ADHD.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> There are several studies that demonstrate the clinical utility of QbTest in aiding diagnosis.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> A recent randomised controlled trial found clinicians with access to the QbTest report were more likely to reach a diagnostic decision about ADHD. At 6 months, 76% of those with a QbTest report had received a diagnostic decision, compared with 50% without a QbTest report. QbTest reduced appointment length, increased clinicians’ confidence in their diagnostic decisions and doubled the likelihood of excluding ADHD.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
</p>
              <p>The use of the QbTest in the community looks promising.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, there are a number of unknowns in relation to its use in the CYPSE. Implementing new approaches can require more planning due to the regime; therefore, the potential barriers and facilitators to implementation need to be understood. The young people within the CYPSE are more complex and have greater comorbidity than young people accessing community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. The acceptability of the QbTest needs to be assessed to see if the same positive findings can be replicated. Primary outcomes in previous QbTest trials<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> have been time to diagnosis, but given the comparative short stay in the CYPSE and difficulty obtaining these data once they leave, it is unclear how reliably these data can be collected and/or if other outcomes, such as in aggressive incidents, are more important in this population.</p>
              <p>The longer term aim is to undertake a definitive randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of QbTest in the assessment of ADHD in the CYPSE. An evidence base within the CYPSE needs to be developed in order to change policy and implement the QbTest across the whole system. In line with the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines on developing complex interventions and as randomised controlled trials within the CYPSE are scarce, a feasibility study is required.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>

                <p>The CHAT is a semistructured assessment of health needs. It is delivered by a nurse during the first 10 days of admission and includes assessing ADHD needs (not diagnostic) based on clinical history and observation of the young person. Young people identified with potential ADHD on the CHAT are discussed with the psychiatrist at the multidisciplinary team. ADHD questionnaires (self, teacher and parent) are completed and reviewed. If further ADHD assessment is required, this includes clinical assessment (history and observation) and obtaining informant information including developmental history (completed by nurse and psychiatrist). This typically involves a minimum of three appointments with the young person and liaison with teachers/parents.</p>

Procedures have been developed with our patient and public involvement (PPI) groups and tested for maintaining contact with participants. Recognising that this population can be difficult to follow-up, follow-up data collection points will occur within broad time windows. Having very broad time windows allows for as many follow-ups to be completed within the CYPSE, but also ensuring that no young people are excluded from the study if they miss a follow-up.</p>

                <p>Given the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind participants or those involved in delivering the intervention. It is also not possible to blind the field researcher due to the researcher and staff delivering the intervention working within the confines of a secure environment. It is also not possible to use a second researcher to collect follow-up data (who does not know trial arm allocation) as this is logistically very challenging and ultimately conflicts with the idea of building a strong researcher–participant relationship to enhance follow-up rates. Therefore, to minimise any potential bias, protocolising the collection of outcome measures which will be overseen by the onsite principal investigator and trial manager (CL). None of the outcome measures completed by the young person with the researcher present are particularly susceptible to bias as they are standardised, self-complete questionnaires. The researcher may need to support the young person in completing questionnaires due to literacy levels and protocolising collection ensures that support is consistent and unbiased. The study statistician (L-AC) will be blind to arm allocation.</p>

During this meeting, the researcher will confirm the contact information provided at baseline and make any amendments to the information (eg, change of phone number).

                  <p>The follow-up may take place in prison or in the community, depending on if the young person has been discharged. In the community, the researcher will arrange to meet the young person at a convenient location. Where possible, interviews will be conducted in the premises of services that the young person is engaged with in order to minimise risk to the researcher. Where this is not possible, the researcher will arrange to conduct the interviews in a suitable location in the community and adhere to the Local Lone Working Policy.</p>

                <p>QbTest opinion questionnaire: all young people who receive QbTest will be asked to complete the QbTest opinion questionnaire at 3 months. The questionnaire contains 11 questions, for example, ‘the QbTest results were difficult to understand’ and the young person is asked to rate each item on a 5-point scale. At month 15, clinicians involved in the QbTest will be asked to complete the clinician version, which contains 13 questions rated on a 5-point scale and two free-text response questions.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p>
                <p>Interviews with young people: randomisation: a subsample of young people in both trial arms will be interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule to further explore acceptability of the randomisation process. Young person’s age and time of randomisation (beginning or end of study) will be used to purposively select the sample. Outcomes: a subsample of young people in both trial arms will be interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule to further explore acceptability of completion of the outcome measures. Young person’s age and time of randomisation (beginning or end of study) will be used to purposively select the sample. QbTest: a subsample of young people who receive QbTest will be interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule to further explore acceptability of the QbTest and its administration as well as study processes and procedures. Scores/responses in the QbTest opinion questionnaire, young person’s age and whether or not the QbTest was completed will be used to purposively select the sample. Up to 20 young people will be interviewed.</p>
                <p>Interviews with healthcare professionals and CYPSE staff: healthcare professionals and CYPSE staff will be invited to participate in qualitative interviews to further explore acceptability and feasibility of administering and implementing the QbTest within usual assessment practices and procedures, including the barriers to its use and reasons for non-completion. Scores/responses in the QbTest Opinion Questionnaire will be used to purposively select healthcare professionals. Up to 10 professionals will be interviewed.</p>

                <p>Obtaining informed consent or assent will be in accordance with ethical guidance and good clinical practice. The researcher will be trained to assess for capacity to consent in young people. This will include assessing if the young person has the ability to understand the information relevant to the decision, retain the information, use or weigh the information as part of the process for decision-making and communicate the decision to the researcher.</p>
                <p>The researcher will explain what participation in the study involves and how much time will be involved. They will also explain that participation is voluntary, that they can withdraw at any time and at any point and that their decision to participate, or not, will have no adverse effect on the care that they receive or their other legal rights. The researcher will also discuss the arrangements in place to ensure confidentiality (and limits of this) and data protection. Throughout this process, the potential participant will be given an opportunity to ask questions. Potential participants will be made aware of circumstances in which confidentiality would be broken (if they or someone else identified may be at potential risk of harm; for example, self-harm, breaches of security and violence, including acts of terrorism/radicalisation).</p>
