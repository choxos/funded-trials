                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>STAMPEDE has previously reported that radiotherapy (RT) to the prostate improved overall survival (OS) for patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer with low metastatic burden, but not those with high-burden disease. In this final analysis, we report long-term findings on the primary outcome measure of OS and on the secondary outcome measures of symptomatic local events, RT toxicity events, and quality of life (QoL).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods and findings</title>
                  <p>Patients were randomised at secondary care sites in the United Kingdom and Switzerland between January 2013 and September 2016, with 1:1 stratified allocation: 1,029 to standard of care (SOC) and 1,032 to SOC+RT. No masking of the treatment allocation was employed. A total of 1,939 had metastatic burden classifiable, with 42% low burden and 58% high burden, balanced by treatment allocation. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses used Cox regression and flexible parametric models (FPMs), adjusted for stratification factors age, nodal involvement, the World Health Organization (WHO) performance status, regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and planned docetaxel use. QoL in the first 2 years on trial was assessed using prospectively collected patient responses to QLQ-30 questionnaire.</p>
                  <p>Patients were followed for a median of 61.3 months. Prostate RT improved OS in patients with low, but not high, metastatic burden (respectively: 202 deaths in SOC versus 156 in SOC+RT, hazard ratio (HR) = 0·64, 95% CI 0.52, 0.79, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 375 SOC versus 386 SOC+RT, HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.96, 1.28, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0·164; interaction <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). No evidence of difference in time to symptomatic local events was found. There was no evidence of difference in Global QoL or QLQ-30 Summary Score. Long-term urinary toxicity of grade 3 or worse was reported for 10 SOC and 10 SOC+RT; long-term bowel toxicity of grade 3 or worse was reported for 15 and 11, respectively.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Prostate RT improves OS, without detriment in QoL, in men with low-burden, newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer, indicating that it should be recommended as a SOC.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Prostate radiotherapy (RT) is recommended for men with newly diagnosed, low-burden, metastatic prostate cancer, but not for men with high-burden disease [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This recommendation is based largely on the initial results of the STAMPEDE trial, reported in 2018 [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this randomised controlled trial of 2,061 men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, prostate RT improved overall survival (OS) for men with low metastatic burden (hazard ratio [HR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.90; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.007), with no evidence of a meaningful effect on survival in men with high metastatic burden (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.28; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.420). That initial analysis, triggered by a preplanned number of events, was done after a median follow-up of 37 months and was based on 761 events. Here, we report the final analysis of OS, with an additional 2 years follow-up.</p>
              <p>We hypothesised that prostate RT would reduce the complications of local disease progression, such as urinary or bowel obstruction. If so, this could benefit men with metastatic disease, regardless of disease burden. Here, we report data on freedom from local interventions (e.g., urinary catheter, ureteric stents, nephrostomies, and colostomy).</p>
              <p>Any benefits of prostate RT need to be weighed against the risk of treatment-related adverse events (AEs). We report, for the first time, data from the trial on quality of life (QoL).</p>
              <p>The trial was stratified according to the choice of 1 of 2 RT dose-fractionation schedules, nominated prior to randomisation; 36 Gy in 6 fractions over 6 weeks, or 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. The 2 schedules were chosen in the expectation that they would be similarly effective. With the benefit of additional follow-up, and more events in the final analysis, we have tested for any differential impact on OS by choice of RT schedule.</p>

                <title>Study participants</title>
                <p>Eligible patients had prostate cancer that was newly diagnosed, with no previous radical treatment, had metastatic disease confirmed on a bone scintigraphic scan and soft tissue imaging, and were within 12 weeks after starting androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were required to have no contraindications to RT and no clinically significant cardiovascular history. Participants were recruited at secondary care sites in the UK and Switzerland.</p>
                <p>The trial was registered as NCT00268476 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/" ext-link-type="uri">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>) and ISRCTN78818544 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ISRCTN.com" ext-link-type="uri">ISRCTN.com</ext-link>). The trial was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki and had relevant ethics (West Midlands–Edgbaston Research Ethics Committee) and regulatory approvals. All patients gave written informed consent. The rationale and design, including sample size calculations, have been described previously [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Full details are in the protocol at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.stampedetrial.org/" ext-link-type="uri">www.stampedetrial.org</ext-link>.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p>All patients received lifelong hormone therapy as gonadotrophin-releasing hormones (GnRHs) agonists or antagonists or orchidectomy. In addition, docetaxel was permitted after it became available for this setting in the UK. Docetaxel, when used, was given as six 3 weekly cycles of 75mg/m<sup>2</sup> with or without prednisolone 10 mg daily.</p>
                <p>External beam RT to the prostate was given as 1 of 2 schedules nominated prior to randomisation: 36 Gy in 6 consecutive weekly fractions of 6 Gy or 55 Gy in 20 daily fractions of 2.75 Gy over 4 weeks. Treatment was given with the patient supine, with a full bladder and an empty rectum. The planning target volume consisted of the prostate only with an 8-mm margin posteriorly and a 10-mm margin elsewhere. RT was to commence as soon as practicable after randomisation, and, if the patient was having docetaxel as part of standard of care (SOC), within 3 to 4 weeks after the last docetaxel dose.</p>
                <p>Patients were followed up 6 weekly until 6 months after randomisation, 12 weekly to 2 years, 6 monthly to 5 years, and then annually. Toxicities and symptoms were reported at regular follow-up visits or when an AE was categorised as “serious.” These were graded with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4·0. Separately, bowel and bladder adverse effects during RT and long-term possible RT effects were recorded using the RTOG scale [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Participants were asked to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 at each scheduled follow-up appointment.</p>
                <p>Metastatic burden at randomisation was evaluated retrospectively through central imaging review of whole body scintigraphy and computerized tomography (CT) or MRI staging scans. Metastatic burden was classified according to the definition used in the CHAARTED trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as either high (polymetastatic; ≥4 bone metastases with ≥1 outside the vertebral bodies or pelvis and/or visceral metastases) or low (oligometastatic). Patients with only lymph node metastases, in the absence of bone or visceral disease, were therefore classified as low metastatic burden regardless of the number of nodal metastases.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p>Patients were randomised centrally using a computerised algorithm, developed and maintained by the trials unit. Minimisation with a random element of 20% was used (80% probably of allocation to a minimising treatment), stratifying for hospital, age at randomisation (&lt;70 versus ≥70 years), nodal involvement (negative versus positive versus indeterminate), the World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (0 versus 1 or 2), planned form of ADT (orchidectomy versus LHRH (leuteinising hormone-releasing hormone) agonist versus LHRH antagonist versus dual androgen blockade), and regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (yes or no). Planned docetaxel use was added as a stratification factor after use was permitted as part of SOC. Allocation was 1:1 to SOC only or SOC+RT. There was no blinding to treatment allocation.</p>

                <title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title>
                <p>The primary efficacy outcome measure was OS, defined as time from randomisation to death from any cause. Secondary outcomes for this long-term efficacy analysis included local intervention–free survival (LIFS)—consisting of time from randomisation to the first report on case report forms of TURP, ureteric stent, surgery for bowel obstruction, urinary catheter, nephrostomy, colostomy, death from prostate cancer—and symptomatic local event-free survival (SLEFS), comprising any of these LIFS events or acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. Cause of death was determined by the site investigator, with some cases reclassified as prostate cancer death according to predefined criteria which suggested this to be the likely cause. Patients without the event of interest were censored at the time last known to be event free. QoL analyses focused on Global QoL % and QLQ-30 Summary Score %, as derived from patient reports at scheduled assessment time points in the first 2 years after randomisation (see <bold><xref rid="pmed.1003998.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Text</xref></bold>).</p>

              <sec id="sec014">
                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p>The primary outcome measure, OS, was assessed across all patients and separately within patient subgroups characterised by baseline metastatic burden (low versus high) and nominated RT schedule (daily versus weekly).</p>
                <p>Standard survival analysis methods were used to analyse time-to-event data in Stata v16.1 (College Station, Texas, United States of America). A nonparametric stratified log-rank test was used to assess any difference in survival between treatment groups; this was stratified across the minimisation factors used at randomisation (except hospital and planned form of hormone therapy) plus protocol-specific time periods defined by other arms recruiting to STAMPEDE or changes to SOC which could affect the population being randomised. Cox proportional hazards (PHs) regression models adjusting for the same stratification factors and stratified by time period were used to estimate relative treatment effect; a HR less than 1·00 favoured the research arm. Unadjusted estimates of treatment effect are also presented. Flexible parametric models (FPMs) were fitted with degrees of freedom (5.5) and adjusted for stratification factors and time periods [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Medians and 5-year survival estimates are presented from the FPM fitted to the data. Kaplan–Meier curves, using the KMunicate format [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], show estimated survival over time. Following the fitting of Cox models, the PHs assumption was tested using a global Grambsch–Therneau test with log-transformed time; restricted mean event-free (“survival”) time (RMST) was emphasised in the presence of nonproportionality, using a t-star of 91 months as determined by the Royston and Parmar method [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cox and Fine and Gray regression models [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] were used for cause-specific and competing risk analyses, respectively; competing risks were non-prostate cancer–related death for prostate cancer–specific survival and death from any cause for SLEFS and LIFS. Evidence for different treatment effect across subgroups was assessed using the likelihood ratio <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value for an interaction term added to the relevant adjusted Cox/FPM model, or Wald test <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value from Fine and Gray model. Sensitivity analyses of local event outcomes examined the impact of excluding death from prostate cancer and a competing risks approach with death from any cause specified as a competing event. All tests are presented as 2 sided, with 95% CIs and the relevant <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value.</p>
                <p>Median follow-up was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method with reverse censoring on death. All patients were included in the efficacy and QoL analyses according to allocated treatment on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis; sensitivity analyses exclude patients who did not explicitly fulfill all of the eligibility criteria. AE data are shown for the safety population, in patients with at least 1 follow-up assessment and analysed according to whether RT was received within 1 year of randomisation (SOC+RT) or not (SOC).</p>
                <p>Analyses of the QoL outcomes included partly conditional and composite approaches, building on the approaches previously used in the trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For the former, missing values were multiply imputed using observed data using chained equations. Imputed values for assessments dating after a patient had died were restored to missing. Generalised estimating equations with an independence correlation matrix were used to estimate the expected value of the outcome for each treatment arm at each assessment time point. For the composite approach, observations following the death of a patient were set to 0% (corresponding to the lowest possible QoL state). Mixed linear regression with random intercept and slope (with unstructured correlation specification) was used to model the outcome. Additional cross-sectional analyses estimated the difference in average QoL associated with treatment allocation in patients alive and with data available at a given assessment time point, controlling for baseline state.</p>
                <p>This trial is reported per the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT; see <bold><xref rid="pmed.1003998.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Text</xref></bold>).</p>

              <p>This final analysis has confirmed that prostate RT improves OS in men with newly diagnosed, low-burden metastatic prostate cancer, but not in men with high-burden disease. The magnitude of the survival benefit is substantial and clinically relevant, particularly given that prostate RT is a relatively cheap, widely accessible, and well-tolerated treatment.</p>
              <p>These results of the final analysis confirm the findings from the initial analysis. The additional 2 years of follow-up, and the subsequent increase in the number of events for analysis, has reduced the CIs around the point estimate of the HR of the OS benefit for prostate RT. However, the point estimate itself has changed very little, improving from 0.68 to 0.64 for men in the low metastatic disease risk group. This result is consistent with that from the smaller HORRAD trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our new data strongly support those guidelines already recommending the use of prostate RT in men with low-burden metastatic disease. We have not found any benefit for prostate RT in men with high-burden disease, either in OS or in preventing interventions for local disease progression.</p>
              <p>We found no compelling evidence of a difference in efficacy or toxicity between the 2 RT dose-schedules tested. The weekly schedule of 36 Gy in 6 fractions over 6 weeks has an obvious practical advantage in terms of convenience and may be preferred for that reason. A daily schedule might be preferred if pelvic nodal RT were to be used in addition or if RT dose escalation was thought to be appropriate. Prostate RT did not have any long-term impact on QoL either in this trial, or in the HORRAD trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The risk of toxicity from prostate RT, although low, could be further reduced by the use of more contemporary intensity modulated techniques [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>The criteria used in the trial to classify cases as low or high burden were taken from those used in the CHAARTED trial [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These criteria are based on the presence or absence of visceral disease on CT scan, together with the number and the location of bone metastases on bone scan. Patients with only lymph node metastases have low-burden disease, regardless of the extent of nodal disease. There is no good reason to think that these criteria are optimal for identifying those patients with metastatic disease who stand to benefit from prostate RT. The initial analysis of STAMPEDE suggested that the survival benefit from prostate RT gradually decreased in magnitude as the number of bone metastases visible on a baseline bone scan increased [<xref rid="pmed.1003998.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. One could decide to identify patients suitable for prostate RT based solely on the number of bone metastases visible on baseline bone scan, regardless of location. A count-of-metastases approach would be simpler to use in the clinic than the CHAARTED definition and would likely increase the number of men considered suitable for prostate RT.</p>
              <p>The trial has several strengths, including the randomised design, the large number of events for analysis, and recruitment from over 100 centres, which adds to the generalisability of the results. The main limitations of the study are the changes in clinical practice since the trial started, particularly with regard to imaging techniques and systemic treatment. The trial recruited between 2013 and 2016 and, while this has the benefit of long follow-up, it also means that newer imaging techniques, such as PSMA (Prostate-specific membrane antigen) PET and whole body MRI, were unavailable. It is important to note that low-burden disease in the trial was defined according to bone scan and CT scan. There is no agreed definition of metastatic disease burden based solely on PSMA PET or on whole body MRI. In patients without visceral disease but who have more than 4 bone metastases on PET or MRI, a bone scan may be required in addition, in order to determine suitability for prostate RT. If this is not practicable, and there remains uncertainty as to whether a patient has high- or low-burden disease, there is a strong argument for using prostate RT.</p>
              <p>The systemic treatment of metastatic prostate cancer has changed since the trial recruited. Standard treatment for men with low-burden metastatic disease now includes one of the newer hormone agents (abiraterone or apalutamide or enzalutamide) in addition to ADT. The effect of these agents on the survival benefit of prostate RT is unknown. Similarly, the effect of prostate RT on the survival benefit of the newer hormonal agents is also unknown. Based on current evidence, it is reasonable to assume that both prostate RT and one of the newer hormonal agents should be considered SOC for low-burden metastatic disease, in addition to ADT. The PEACE-1 Trial is testing the use of prostate RT in men receiving ADT + abiraterone.</p>
              <p>In summary, this final analysis confirms that prostate RT improves OS in men with low-burden, newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer, indicating that it should be recommended as a SOC.</p>

              <p>Comments from the reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Parker et al present the updated results of the STAMPEDE trial, arm H. This trial randomized &gt;2000 men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer in the UK and Switzerland to standard of care (lifelong androgen deprivation therapy) +/- radiation therapy (RT) to the prostate. After the start of enrollment, it was determined that results would be analyzed by the volume of metastatic disease. The authors had previously reported in 2018 that prostate RT improves survival in men with low-volume disease but not high-volume disease, with a significant interaction (Parker et al, Lancet 2018). In this updated analysis, they demonstrate that the survival benefit differences found previously persist with additional follow-up. Furthermore, they present data on local events in the forms of Local Intervention Free Survival and Symptomatic Local Event-Free Survival. </p>
              <p>This is an important update of the STAMPEDE trial, arm H, which helped change the treatment paradigm for men with low-volume de novo metastatic prostate cancer. While the updated survival findings, which demonstrated the continued benefit of prostate RT in low-volume disease, are not surprising, the authors do provide additional results in terms of local event analyses, toxicity including from RT, and quality of life (QOL) metrics. The findings of this study are important for the general medical public given the prevalence of prostate cancer. The manuscript is generally well-written and presents appropriate analyses.</p>
              <p>Major comments</p>
              <p>- Local Intervention Free Survival (LIFS) was defined as "consisting of time from randomisation to the first report on case report forms of TURP, ureteric stent, surgery for bowel obstruction, urinary catheter, nephrostomy, colostomy, death from prostate cancer" (lines 120-122). I am not confident that death from prostate cancer should be considered in the definition of LIFS, since death from prostate cancer is uncommonly a consequence of local progression but rather typically due to an increase in metastatic disease burden. Did the authors consider an analysis of LIFS using a definition which excludes death from prostate cancer, using death from any cause as a competing risk event? Similarly, did the authors consider an analysis of Symptomatic Local Event-Free Survival (SLEFS) using a definition that excludes death from prostate cancer, again using competing risks survival analysis? Understandably, the sample sizes for these analyses are likely to be small since it appears that the majority of patients did not have events besides death from prostate cancer be reported. </p>
              <p>- The authors found that when stratified by RT schedule, the hazard ratio (HR) for weekly RT was 1.00 and for daily RT was 0.83 (interaction p=0.088). They then looked at specifically at patients with low-volume status and found a HR of 0.67 for weekly RT and 0.62 for daily RT (interaction p=0.732), demonstrating that RT schedule does not appear to influence outcomes for low-volume patients. As additional exploratory analysis, it may be informative to see a similar analysis of HRs by fractionation schedule for high-volume patients. </p>
              <p>- One possible confounder in this study is the receipt of additional therapies not reported here, namely novel androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI). It is possible that patients in one group were more likely to have received ARSIs which can influence multiple outcomes, including survival, local events, toxicities, and quality of life metrics. Are the authors able to provide data on use of these novel therapies and if not, they should discuss this as a limitation of the study.</p>
              <p>Minor comments</p>
              <p>- Line 155: There is an extra period after "criteria."</p>
              <p>- In Figure 1, it is unclear to me how the n's in the Long-term analysis row were derived from the Follow-up row, e.g. for the first column, 333+74+609=1016, yet the diagram states that n=1029 were analyzed for efficacy. Can the authors clarify this?</p>
              <p>- It might be helpful to relabel metastatic disease burden as "low" and "high" in Table 1 to be uniform in the terminology.</p>
              <p>- The legend descriptions for Figures 2A and 2B appear flipped (lines 210-218). There is no legend for Figure 2C.</p>
              <p>- The authors state that they performed "cause-specific and competing-risk analyses." They should clarify whether this was done using Cox proportional hazard regression vs Fine-Gray regression and define what the competing risks were. Additionally, for prostate cancer-specific mortality, SLEFS, and LIFS, it would be helpful to see interaction p-values as well.</p>
              <p>- The authors should clarify the percentage of patients who received 3D conformal RT (3D RT) vs intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). My sense is that the majority of patients likely received 3D RT which, in combination with the generous margins used (8mm posterior and 10mm elsewhere), is expected to increase the level of toxicity from RT compared to more modern, albeit expensive, techniques (i.e. image-guided IMRT with tighter margins, usually around 5mm if not less) used in many other parts of the world. This complicates the interpretation of toxicity and quality of life data presented here and hence should be discussed as a limitation.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This paper reports on the long term overall survival, quality of life and local events in patients with primary metastatic prostate cancer, randomised between with radiotherapy to the prostate or standard of care in the SRAMPEDE trial. This is an essential trial since it altered the guidelines into advising radiotherapy to the prostate in patients with low volume metastatic disease. The presented update on the survival data that confirms previous findings is very important. Also reporting on local problems and quality of life is useful, as local radiotherapy of the prostate is known to have a substantial impact on patients' health-related-quality-of-life potentially. The manuscript is well written and has a clear message. </p>
              <p>There are a few issues in this report that should be addressed.</p>
              <p>1) In the introduction, the authors write that they report on data on freedom from local interventions and mention urinary catheter, ureteric stents, nephrostomies, colostomy. Why did the authors eventually include death in their analysis on symptomatic local event? This is already addressed in their survival analysis. It there a difference in time to local event or proportion of local events when death is not included in this analysis? </p>
              <p>2) Table 3 misses in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>3) In the introduction, the authors write that the first report on quality of life of this trial. The HORRAD group also published results on the effect on HrQoL of radiotherapy in patients with metastastic prostate cancer. It would be helpful to compare the results of both similar trials in the discussion.</p>
              <p>4) In analysing QoL questionnaires, only the global QoL scores were presented. Were there any differences in the different domains of the questionnaires between the two groups? </p>
              <p>5) For time-to-event variables, report the number of events but not the proportion. Avoid reporting the percentage of deaths in reporting on survival. Although it is important to report the number of events, patients entered the study at different times and were followed for different periods; hence, the reported proportion is meaningless.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: This is a useful and well-conducted RCT on the long-term results of radiotherapy on the prostate for men with metastatic prostate cancer. The study design, statistical methods and analyses, and presentation (tables and figures) and interpretation of the results are mostly adequate and of a good standard. However, there are still a few issues needing attention.</p>
              <p>1) For the subgroup analyses on low and high burden groups, there are 6% missing data (without disease burden classification). But I haven't seen any sensitivity analysis on the missing data. What is the impact of missing data on the analysis results? Any potential bias? At least we'd like to see the patterns and characteristics of the patients without burden classification as compared to those with burden classification. May need to address the issue as a limitation in the discussion if missing is not at random.</p>
              <p>2) In the analysis of the high-burden metastatic disease group (figue 2B), significant interaction was found. However, it is not clear whether the interaction term was dealt with in the analysis, and if yes, how it was dealt with. This question also applies to a few other analyses involving significant interations terms.</p>
              <p>3) Sample size calculation was never mentioned in the paper. I am aware this is a follow-up on the previous published paper but at least authors can mention the sample size and direct readers to previous papers or protocol.</p>
              <p>4) In statistical analysis section on page 11, it says "The proportional hazards assumption was tested", but with what method?</p>

              <p>Dear Dr. Sydes,</p>
              <p>Thank you very much for re-submitting your manuscript "Radiotherapy to the prostate for men with metastatic prostate cancer: long-term results from the STAMPEDE randomised controlled trial (NCT00268476)" (PMEDICINE-D-22-00022R2) for review by PLOS Medicine.</p>
              <p>I have discussed the paper with my colleagues and it was also seen again by three reviewers. I am pleased to say that provided the remaining editorial and production issues are dealt with we are planning to accept the paper for publication in the journal.</p>
              <p>The remaining issues that need to be addressed are listed at the end of this email. Any accompanying reviewer attachments can be seen via the link below. Please take these into account before resubmitting your manuscript:</p>
              <p>[LINK]</p>
              <p>***Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.***</p>
              <p>In revising the manuscript for further consideration here, please ensure you address the specific points made by each reviewer and the editors. In your rebuttal letter you should indicate your response to the reviewers' and editors' comments and the changes you have made in the manuscript. Please submit a clean version of the paper as the main article file. A version with changes marked must also be uploaded as a marked up manuscript file.</p>
              <p>Please also check the guidelines for revised papers at <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript</ext-link> for any that apply to your paper. If you haven't already, we ask that you provide a short, non-technical Author Summary of your research to make findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists. The Author Summary should immediately follow the Abstract in your revised manuscript. This text is subject to editorial change and should be distinct from the scientific abstract.</p>
              <p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 1 week. Please email us (<email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
              <p>We ask every co-author listed on the manuscript to fill in a contributing author statement. If any of the co-authors have not filled in the statement, we will remind them to do so when the paper is revised. If all statements are not completed in a timely fashion this could hold up the re-review process. Should there be a problem getting one of your co-authors to fill in a statement we will be in contact. YOU MUST NOT ADD OR REMOVE AUTHORS UNLESS YOU HAVE ALERTED THE EDITOR HANDLING THE MANUSCRIPT TO THE CHANGE AND THEY SPECIFICALLY HAVE AGREED TO IT.</p>
              <p>Please ensure that the paper adheres to the PLOS Data Availability Policy (see <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability</ext-link>), which requires that all data underlying the study's findings be provided in a repository or as Supporting Information. For data residing with a third party, authors are required to provide instructions with contact information for obtaining the data. PLOS journals do not allow statements supported by "data not shown" or "unpublished results." For such statements, authors must provide supporting data or cite public sources that include it.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p>
              <p>Please note, when your manuscript is accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you've already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.</p>
              <p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact me or the journal staff on <email>plosmedicine@plos.org</email>.  </p>
              <p>We look forward to receiving the revised manuscript by Apr 08 2022 11:59PM.   </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Requests from Editors:</p>
              <p>Please update your title to include the setting (‘Radiotherapy to the prostate for men with metastatic prostate cancer in the UK and Switzerland: long-term results from the STAMPEDE randomised controlled trial’).</p>
              <p>As your author list runs to &gt;30 authors, please consider grouping authors under a collaborative group such that the named author list is ≤30 authors. </p>
              <p>Data Availability Statement: Thank you for providing a contact email address (<email>mrcctu.datareleaserequest@ucl.ac.uk</email>). Please ensure this is included in your Data Availability Statement (via the submission form), as the current version recommends contacting the trial team (PLOS does not permit listing study authors as the point of contact for data requests).</p>
              <p>In your abstract ‘Methods and Findings’ please make the following changes:</p>
              <p>* Please include the setting.</p>
              <p>* Please include the length of follow up</p>
              <p>* Per our in-house style, please include a single sentence summary of the study’s main limitations at the end of the section (beginning ‘The main limitations of the study were…’, or similar). See previous PLOS Medicine papers for examples.</p>
              <p>Please ensure the Abstract and Title are both updated in the submission form as well as the main paper (currently the two versions differ). </p>
              <p>Please report p values to 3 decimal places throughout the document (P&lt;0.001 should be the minimum value reported). Example at line 27 and in Figure 2A, but please check throughout. </p>
              <p>There is no need to include the original p values as footnotes.</p>
              <p>Line 35: Please update to ‘indicating that it should be recommended as a standard of care’ (applies also to concluding paragraph).</p>
              <p>Citations throughout should precede punctuation throughout.</p>
              <p>Your Author Summary should follow the format here: <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/revising-your-manuscript#loc-author-summary</ext-link>
</p>
              <p>Please update your CONSORT checklist to use section names and paragraph numbers rather than page numbers (which change during the revision process). </p>
              <p>The name of the CONSORT checklist file also seems like it does not match the manuscript (‘The Impact of a Community-Oriented Problem-Based Learning Curriculum Reform on the Quality of Primary Care Delivered by Graduates’). Please check.</p>
              <p>Thank you for presenting your unadjusted comparisons in Table 2. A line can be added to the Methods section noting that these comparisons were presented in response to a request from the handling editor and thus represents a change from the SAP. </p>
              <p>The Financial Disclosure can be removed from the main text, the relevant information should instead be captured in the submission form (answers will then be published as metadata).</p>
              <p>Please remove the abbreviations list from the main text and instead define abbreviations on first use/in table and figure legends. </p>
              <p>Line 88: Please update the citations here to [2, 3]. </p>
              <p>When presenting hazard ratios in the Results, please consistently indicate whether these are adjusted or unadjusted ratios (e.g., Section 3.3, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2, HRs are reported differently despite both representing adjusted HRs). </p>
              <p>Apologies if I missed it but I couldn’t find an in-text reference for Figure S5?</p>
              <p>Comments from Reviewers:</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: I would like to thank the authors for appropriately addressing the comments which I previously raised. I do not have any additional major comments. The authors should be congratulated on this important contribution. </p>
              <p>Of note, Table S5 appears to be currently formatted in such a way that the right portion of the table is cut off and not visible in either the PDF or the Word document. I would recommend that the orientation of this page be changed to landscape to allow for the entire table to be viewed. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: The authors made several improvements to the document based on the reviewers comments, I have no further issues to raise.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: Thanks authors for their effort to improve the manuscript. I am satisfied with the response and revision. No further issues needing attention.</p>

Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Once you have received these formatting requests, please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes.</p>
              <p>Prior to final acceptance, please make the following changes:</p>
              <p>Early in the "Methods and findings" subsection of the abstract, please add a sentence, say, to quote the demographic characteristics of study participants. </p>
              <p>There appears to have been a small misunderstanding on one editorial point: Please add a new final sentence to the "Methods and findings" subsection of the abstract, which should begin "Study limitations include ..." or similar and should quote 2-3 of the study's main limitations. </p>
              <p>Please adapt the "Author Summary" so that each of the three subsections consists of no more than 3-4 points. To achieve this, some points can be removed (e.g., "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer ..." and "The dataset was frozen in 2021 ...") and in some cases shorter points could be combined. </p>
              <p>We suggest adapting "CONSORT diagram" to "Participant flowchart" throughout. </p>
              <p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.editorialmanager.com/pmedicine/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production process. </p>
              <p>PRESS</p>
              <p>We frequently collaborate with press offices. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming paper at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. If the press office is planning to promote your findings, we would be grateful if they could coordinate with <email>medicinepress@plos.org</email>. If you have not yet opted out of the early version process, we ask that you notify us immediately of any press plans so that we may do so on your behalf.</p>
              <p>We also ask that you take this opportunity to read our Embargo Policy regarding the discussion, promotion and media coverage of work that is yet to be published by PLOS. As your manuscript is not yet published, it is bound by the conditions of our Embargo Policy. Please be aware that this policy is in place both to ensure that any press coverage of your article is fully substantiated and to provide a direct link between such coverage and the published work. For full details of our Embargo Policy, please visit <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plos.org/about/media-inquiries/embargo-policy/</ext-link>.</p>
              <p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&amp;utm_source=authorletters&amp;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p>
              <p>Thank you again for submitting to PLOS Medicine. We look forward to publishing your paper. </p>
