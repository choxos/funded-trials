                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injury (OASI) Care Bundle comprises four primary and secondary prevention practices that target the rising rates of severe perineal tearing during childbirth, which can have severe debilitating consequences for women. The OASI Care Bundle was implemented in 16 maternity units in Britain in the OASI1 project (2017-2018), which demonstrated the care bundle’s effectiveness in reducing OASI rates. In OASI2, the care bundle will be scaled up to 20 additional National Health Service (NHS) maternity units in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study that will examine the effectiveness of strategies used to introduce, implement and sustain the care bundle.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">OASI2 is a two-arm cluster-randomised control trial (C-RCT) of maternity units in England, Scotland and Wales, with an additional non-randomised study arm. C-RCT arm 1 (peer support, <italic>n</italic> = 10 units) will be supported by ‘buddy’ units to implement the OASI Care Bundle. C-RCT arm 2 (lean implementation, <italic>n</italic> = 10 units) will implement without external support. The additional study arm (sustainability, <italic>n</italic> = 10 units) will include some original OASI1 units to evaluate the care bundle’s sustainability and OASI rates over time, from before OASI1 and through the end of OASI2. Units in all three study arms will receive an Implementation Toolkit with training resources and implementation support. The C-RCT arms will be compared in terms of OASI rate reduction (primary effectiveness outcome) and clinicians’ adoption of the care bundle (primary implementation outcome). Clinical data will be collated from maternity information systems; implementation data will be collected through validated surveys with women and clinicians, supplemented by qualitative methods. Descriptive statistics and regression modelling will be used for analysis. Emergent themes from the qualitative data will be assessed using framework analysis.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">OASI2 will study the impact of various implementation strategies used to introduce and sustain the OASI Care Bundle, and how these strategies affect the bundle’s clinical effectiveness. The study will generate insights into how to effectively scale-up and sustain uptake and coverage of similar interventions in maternity units. A locally adaptable ‘implementation blueprint’ will be produced to inform development of future guidelines to prevent perineal trauma.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par25">Care bundles have become a popular approach to improving quality of care in the last decade. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) first defined care bundles in 2001 as ‘a small set of evidence-based practices that, when implemented together, will result in significantly better outcomes than when implemented individually’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The OASI Care Bundle (OASI-CB) was developed in response to a tripling in rates of reported obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) in England over a 10-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. OASI is the collective term for a third- or fourth-degree perineal tears, a severe complication of vaginal childbirth that may have long-term consequences including chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, and urinary and/or anal incontinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Approximately one in 13 primiparous women with assisted vaginal births and one in 20 primiparous women with unassisted (spontaneous) vaginal births in Great Britain (GB) are reported to experience an OASI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Over half of the women who sustain an OASI have continued morbidities and close to half report an impact on their future birth choices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, OASI has significant resource implications for healthcare providers due to ongoing follow-up and litigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par26">A multidisciplinary working group of experts from the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), Royal College of Obstetricians and Obstetricians (RCOG) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) developed the OASI-CB—a set of four routine practices in maternity care that support the prevention and early detection of severe perineal tearing (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

              <p id="Par27">The OASI-CB was implemented and evaluated in a multicentre quality improvement (QI) project (OASI1) with a stepped-wedge design from 2016 to 2018 across 16 NHS maternity units in England, Scotland and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The OASI1 study’s analysis included 55,060 singleton live vaginal births and demonstrated the bundle’s clinical effectiveness: there was a reduction of 20% in the case-mix-adjusted risk of severe perineal injury after the introduction of the OASI Care Bundle (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03), with no effect on caesarean birth or episiotomy rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, a process evaluation within OASI1 found that the OASI-CB was acceptable, appropriate and feasible for clinicians and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par28">A variety of other care bundles have been introduced within maternity care, including ones targeting perinatal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], stillbirth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], surgical site infection after caesarean birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and postpartum haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Despite the rising interest in and use of care bundles, few studies have examined the mechanisms for successful and sustainable implementation at scale. A review published in 2019 confirms that the few studies that report on care bundle implementation processes lack the detail and standardisation necessary to enable replication of findings to support the adoption of other care bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par29">Implementation of the OASI-CB in OASI1 relied on continuous, centralised support from an externally funded Project Team, an approach that is not always feasible for scale-up, especially at national scale. This study—OASI2—will compare how different levels of implementation support impact on maternity units’ uptake and utilisation of the care bundle to better understand how to accomplish sustainable, large-scale implementation of the OASI-CB in maternity units across GB. Specifically, OASI2 is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial that focuses on how peer-supported facilitation of care bundle implementation compares with unsupported facilitation. The two primary objectives of OASI2 are:

                <title>Design overview</title>
                <p id="Par34">OASI2 is a two-arm cluster randomised control trial (C-RCT) with an additional, parallel study arm of purposively invited units. The additional study arm is referred to as the ‘sustainability’ arm as it constitutes units that participated in the original OASI1 study and their efforts are now focused on sustaining the care bundle over time. The units in the sustainability arm will continue to be centrally supported by the Project Team under the ‘expert outreach’ facilitation model.</p>
                <p id="Par35">In all three arms, each unit’s senior leadership will designate one obstetrician and one midwife to take on the role of OASI QI Lead. The role of the OASI QI Leads is to carry out and adapt the recommended implementation strategies for the local context. The Project Team will provide all unit leads with an Implementation Toolkit. The toolkit includes:

                <p id="Par40">These resources were selected and developed based on experiences and lessons learned from the OASI1 study.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The units that make up the C-RCT will be randomised to one of two arms and will implement the OASI-CB under different facilitation models:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par42">Units randomised to C-RCT arm 1 will implement the OASI-CB with ‘peer support’ from a nearby maternity unit of the study’s sustainability arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par43">Units randomised to C-RCT arm 2 will implement the OASI-CB without peer support. The resources provided to this group of units are limited to the contents of the Implementation Toolkit. This facilitation model is referred to as ‘lean’ implementation.</p></list-item></list></p>

                <p id="Par45">Thirty NHS maternity units across GB will make up the three study arms (the sustainability arm, and the two C-RCT arms, peer support and lean implementation) with ten units in each (see power calculations in the evaluation section).</p>
                <p id="Par46">Inclusion criteria for units in the sustainability arm are:

                <p id="Par51">Selection of the units for the C-RCT arms began with a call for expressions of interest from the clinical directors and heads of midwifery of all NHS maternity units across England, Scotland and Wales. Seventy units from fifty-six NHS Trusts (England) or Boards (Scotland and Wales) expressed interest to participate. Units from the same trust/board as a sustainability unit and units that participated in the pilot study prior to OASI1 were excluded.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The remaining sixty-four units were divided into six groups based on their geographical proximity to at least one sustainability arm unit. Senior staff from sustainability arm units were contacted to longlist three units from their regional groupings that they are able to work with. From each group of three units, the Project Team shortlisted two units that are most similar to each other in terms of unit type (obstetric unit (OU), alongside midwifery unit (AMU) or freestanding midwifery unit (FMU)) and average number of births per year. Blocking of the candidate units based on the extraneous factor of sustainability unit preference circumvents the potential of pairing up two units that are unable to work together, which would compromise the peer support model evaluated in the trial.</p>
                <p id="Par53">Once the research and development (R&amp;D) departments from all 20 units have confirmed participation and completed local set-up processes, within each of the ten “pairs” of units, units will be randomised into either peer support or lean implementation arms using a random number generator by an independent academic researcher (not associated with institutions linked to the Project Team). Allocation will be concealed from all participating units until the launch of the study to prevent premature contact between paired sustainability arm units and peer support units. The selection and randomisation process is summarised in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

                <p id="Par54">Within each participating maternity unit, there are three groups of participants: the two OASI QI Leads facilitating implementation in each unit, the unit clinicians (midwives and obstetricians), and women who are eligible to receive the care bundle.</p>

                  <p id="Par57">The logic model takes into account the determinants of implementation success as defined by the PARIHS framework, which defines four core ‘determinants’ of implementation success: innovation, context, recipients, and facilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. ‘Facilitation’ refers to the OASI QI Leads leading implementation and acting as facilitators. ‘Recipients’ are the clinicians ‘receiving’ the implementation and adopting the care bundle into their routine practice. Facilitation and recipients are therefore internal determinants of implementation success. Conversely, ‘innovation’ and ‘context’ are external determinants that may impact the OASI QI Leads and clinicians. Innovation refers to the acceptability and evidence base supporting the four components and the OASI-CB as a whole; depending on the strength of this evidence, this can have a positive or negative impact on OASI QI Leads, clinicians, and ultimately, the implementation. The favourability of the context will further impact implementation. At the national level, this depends on the opinion of professional clinical leadership and support of women’s advocacy groups; a favourable local context includes existing capacity for quality improvement and senior buy-in early in the implementation period. Context also takes into account the approval and support of the care bundle’s target population; women who are eligible to receive the care bundle and women who have received it.</p>
                  <p id="Par58">The PARIHS framework considers facilitation to be the “active ingredient” of implementation, acknowledging that facilitator(s) of change in clinical practice may be internal or external and focus on enabling others to make changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Each of the three study arms are defined by a set of implementation strategies that are influenced by the facilitators involved in the implementation:

As buddy facilitators, they are expected to contact leads from their buddy units at least once per month and draw on their own experiences to support and advise on effective operationalisation of implementation strategies. They will receive the OASI-CB Implementation Toolkit and continue to receive centralised support from the Project Team as in OASI1.

                  <p id="Par83">Individual woman-level data will be extracted from local electronic Maternity Information Systems (MIS) for all participating units in England, Scotland and Wales. The MIS data extract will include demographic and clinical information related to primary and secondary clinical outcomes, as well as a small set of variables required for cohort derivation and risk adjustment. Data will not be patient identifiable. The full data specification can be found in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
                  <p id="Par84">Baseline data extracts will be requested from the 20 randomised units covering 1 year prior to the start of the OASI2 implementation period. For the ten units in the sustainability arm, baseline data extracts will cover the time period between end of the OASI1 study and start of OASI2. All subsequent data extracts during the implementation period will be requested quarterly to enable the Project Team to monitor the quality of the data extracts and to resolve any data-related queries early on. During the implementation period, clinicians will be asked to record their use of (or compliance with) the OASI-CB for every vaginal birth they attend. At minimum, this will be a single yes/no question: ‘were all four components of the OASI-CB applied to this birth?’ Where possible, a field will be added to the local MIS to facilitate collection of these data.</p>
                  <p id="Par85">Data from each unit will be cleaned and re-coded to ensure consistent definitions for all variables. Data quality will be assessed by checking data completeness, plausible distributions and internal consistency. Multiple imputation methods (e.g. statistical coefficients obtained from ten imputed data sets pooled using Rubin’s rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) will be used to deal with missing data, if possible, following an assessment of the extent and patterns of missing data. Plausible distribution checks include assessing whether the distributions calculated from non-missing data is within a clinically possible and acceptable range (e.g. OASI rates less than 15%). Internal consistency checks include assessing agreement of data that might be present in more than one data field (i.e. repair of a tear would only be recorded in women who had an OASI). Any implausible distributions or high levels of internal inconsistency would suggest data extraction errors or systematic errors in coding, which would need to be discussed with the unit’s MIS team, and a new revised extract will be requested if required.</p>

Because units in the sustainability arm have already implemented the OASI-CB as part of OASI1, effectiveness outcomes in these units will be analysed differently than in the two C-RCT arms.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">For the C-RCT arms, multilevel logistic regression and estimation of adjusted odds ratios (aOR) will be used to assess the impact of the OASI-CB and the relative differences in the odds of OASI in the two C-RCT arms. The regression model will include a random effect to account for clustering at unit level, secular trends and individual case-mix factors (e.g. maternal age, ethnicity, BMI, parity, mode of birth and birthweight).</p>
                  <p id="Par88">For the sustainability arm, OASI rates will be analysed longitudinally from the baseline period of OASI1 to end of OASI2, to ascertain the trends and the rate of change by various implementation strategies. The four specific time periods will include baseline (pre-OASI1), OASI1 implementation, post-OASI1 with no external support and OASI2. We will use multilevel logistic regression with random effects and case-mix adjustment as in the C-RCT arms, to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for each time period and to test the significance of the relative impact of OASI1 implementation as compared with OASI2 implementation to assess the effectiveness of additional “sustainability” strategies.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">For all study arms, subgroup analyses of the effect of the care bundle on OASI rates will be carried out according to mode of birth (spontaneous or assisted) and parity. The Wald test will be used to test for significance of interaction terms.</p>
                  <p id="Par90">The analysis will be done following intention-to-treat principle, with births analysed according to whether they took place during the baseline or implementation periods, irrespective of whether or not all aspects of the care bundle could be implemented.</p>

Over a 4-month period, all women who had a live vaginal birth will be invited to participate in the survey by way of a census method. An attending clinician will approach eligible women at an appropriate time after birth and before discharge from the hospital to explain the survey and provide a participant information sheet and consent form.

Twenty logs (one from each unit) will be received by the Project Team at the two time points. As a quality and completeness assurance measure, a member of the Project Team will schedule a telephone call with each unit (with both unit leads, if possible) to follow up on the submitted logs and to fill in any missing information.</p>
                  <p id="Par107">The Project Team will have monthly contact with OASI QI Leads from the sustainability arm, which will be guided by the activity logs; leads will therefore be asked to share activity logs on a monthly basis.</p>

              <p id="Par116">OASI2 is a pragmatic, theory-driven hybrid effectiveness-implementation study that will evaluate the implementation of a care bundle in UK NHS maternity units by identifying and elucidating the role of specific stakeholders and other factors that act as determinants of implementation success in addition to using standardised taxonomy in the reporting and study of implementation strategies. A pragmatic approach is taken in the study design as well as the development of implementation materials and the monitoring and evaluation plan. The two implementation support methods to be compared were selected as feasible options for national scale-up. The Implementation Toolkit was developed by experienced clinicians and aims to assist implementation by passing on lessons learned in a way that can be both operationalised and localised. Study findings will be shared widely through peer-reviewed publications, evidence briefs, and media/social media channels. Beyond OASI2, through triangulation of data and theory, this study aspires to create a more thorough understanding of barriers and enablers to the sustainable, large-scale implementation of care bundles in maternity care.</p>
