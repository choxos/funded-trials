                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>122 patients older than 18 years with severe arthritis of the hip joint, suitable
for resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip. Patients were excluded if they were
considered to be unable to adhere to trial procedures or complete
questionnaires.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Total hip arthroplasty (replacement of entire femoral head and neck); hip
resurfacing arthroplasty (replacement of the articular surface of femoral head
only, femoral neck remains intact). Both procedures replaced the articular surface

                <sec>
                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The outcome measures were hip function assessed using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS)
and health-related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol (EQ-5D). Patients
were followed up annually for a minimum of 5 years. Outcome data were modelled
using the generalised estimating equation methodology to explore temporal
variations during follow-up.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>60 patients were randomly assigned to hip resurfacing arthroplasty and 62 to total
hip arthroplasty. 95 (78%) of the 122 original study participants provided data at
5 years. There was a small decrease in both hip functions and quality of life in
both groups of patients each year during the 5-year follow-up period. However,
there was no evidence of a significant difference between treatments group in the
OHS (P=0.333) or the EQ-5D (P=0.501).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We previously reported no difference in outcome in the first year after surgery.
The current medium-term results also show no evidence of a difference in hip
function or health-related quality of life in the 5 years following a total hip
arthroplasty versus resurfacing arthroplasty.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>For older patients with severe arthritis of the hip, several designs of total hip
arthroplasty (THR) have shown excellent long-term results in terms of both function and
value for money.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, in younger
and more active patients, there is an approximate 50% failure rate at 25 years
for traditional implants.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Modern THR designs may
improve on these results,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> but the search for new,
more durable forms of arthroplasty continues. One option is resurfacing arthroplasty of
the hip (RSA).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Resurfacing implants are more expensive than traditional (metal and plastic) THR designs
and there are potential complications associated with RSA compared with THR—most
importantly the risk of fracture of the neck of the femur.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the first clinical results showed that in selected patients, 98%
of RSA implants were still functioning at 5 years<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; which is as good as any of the existing THR designs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Furthermore, by preserving the patient’s own proximal
femoral anatomy, it was suggested that RSA may provide more physiological hip movement.
Early clinical outcomes indicated that RSA provides improved hip function when compared
with THR.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> Other studies<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 9</xref> reported that patients having RSA had higher activity levels

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>In this pragmatic trial, participants were eligible if they were over 18 years of
age, medically fit for an operation and suitable for a RSA—patients suitable
for RSA are also suitable for THR. Patients were only excluded from the study if
there was evidence that the patient would be unable to adhere to trial procedures or
complete questionnaires. To maintain independence between observed outcomes, if a
recruited patient required a contralateral hip arthroplasty during the trial period
the second hip was not included in the study.</p>

                <title>Recruitment and randomisation of participants</title>
                <p>The Warwick Arthroplasty Trial (WAT) opened in May 2007 and 126 patients were
recruited between August 2007 and February 2010 from hip arthroplasty clinics in a
single UK hip arthroplasty centre. Eligible patients gave written informed consent.
They were randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either a THR or an RSA. Treatment
allocation was determined using a computer-generated, randomised number sequence and
stratified by the supervising orthopaedic surgeon to balance any potential surgeon
effects. After patients consented to participate in the trial, an independently
administered, secure randomisation service was alerted by telephone of a new
enrolment. The randomisation officer provided the surgeon’s secretary with the
patient’s treatment allocation, thereby keeping the research associates, who
consented patients and collected outcome data, blinded to the allocated
treatment.</p>

              <sec id="s2c">
                <title>Interventions</title>
                <p>Each patient had the allocated surgery according to the preferred technique and
implants of the operating surgeon. Other perioperative interventions, such as
prophylactic antibiotics and thromboprophylaxis, were the same for all patients.
After the operation, all patients underwent the same standardised rehabilitation
plan, including range-of-movement exercises followed by muscle strengthening
exercises. Unless the operating surgeon specifically advised otherwise, all patients
were fully weight bearing immediately.</p>
                <p>In a THR, the femoral head was removed along with most of the femoral neck. The
femoral shaft was exposed to open up the femoral canal. The femoral component was
then inserted into the canal and the articulating femoral head was placed onto the
neck of the femoral component. The choice of components and bearing surfaces was left
to the discretion of the operating surgeon, as per their usual clinical practice.</p>
                <p>In a resurfacing arthroplasty, the articular surfaces of the femoral head was removed
but the neck was left in situ. The femoral component (cap) was then impacted onto the
patient’s own femoral neck. All resurfacing arthroplasties of the hip used
metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, but the choice of surgical approach, implant size
and positioning was left to the discretion of the operating surgeon.</p>
                <p>In both forms of arthroplasty, the acetabulum is prepared and the acetabular
component inserted into the socket.</p>

outcome was the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) health-related quality of life utility score

remove the additional outcomes collected during main phase (Harris Hip Score,
Disability Rating Index, physical activity level and resource use) to reduce the
burden on the participants and to optimise retention rates.</p>

working correlation model was adopted to account for within-subject temporal
correlations of untransformed OHS and EQ-5D outcomes, which were assumed to be
approximately normally distributed and related to the linear predictor using the
identity link function. Statistical significance was assessed at the 5% level and CIs
of estimated temporal trends in OHS and EQ-5D were constructed by non-parametric
bootstrapping. Models with smaller a quasilikelihood information criteria (QIC) were
considered to be better descriptors of the data.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Differences in complication rates between groups were assessed using

                <p>OHS scores at each year postoperation (from year 1 to 5) were strongly positively
autocorrelated; that is, a high OHS at year 1 was predictive of a high OHS in
subsequent years. The OHS scores decreased over time from year 1 to year 5 (GEE
z-test of regression coefficients; P=0.003, with the regression coefficient
−0.70). However, this decline was unlikely to be clinically relevant in the
medium term, occurring at only approximately 0.70 OHS units per year. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the temporal trends in OHS for

              <p>Our previously reported randomised clinical trial found no evidence of a difference in
hip function between patients having THR versus RSA for severe arthritis of the hip
joint during the first year following surgery.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
This medium-term follow-up study continues to show no difference in hip function at
5 years. Similarly, there was no difference in HRQoL. The number of further
complications after the first year was low in both groups, but one patient in the RSA
group and three in the THR group required revision arthroplasty surgery.</p>
              <p>Only a few randomised trials have been performed comparing THR with the resurfacing
technique. The first studies focused on the technical aspects of the procedure, such as
the position of the implants or the amount of bone removed during the resurfacing
procedures.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Three trials investigated
clinical outcomes for resurfacing arthroplasty compared with a specific type of THR,
namely metal-on-metal THR.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19–21</xref>
All of these trials showed little difference in functional outcome between the groups in
the first 1 to 2 years after surgery. Each of the trials included plans to
perform longer term follow-up of the participants. However, subsequent,
widely reported concerns regarding the adverse effects of metal debris from
metal-on-metal bearing surfaces have made it difficult to interpret any later results
from these trials<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref>; particularly
because the functional deficits associated with adverse reactions to metal debris seemed
to be greater in one group (THR) than the other (RSA).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p>
              <p>A further randomised trial<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> looked at early
muscle strength in 43 patients and found greater muscle strength deficits in the RSA
group. In contrast, a trial of 80 patients with dysplastic acetabula found improved
early range of movement in the RSA group although with no difference in functional hip
scores.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p>The only longer term follow-up study of resurfacing versus conventional
bearing-surface THR showed no difference between groups with regard to OHS or quality
life.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> More patients in the resurfacing group
were involved in impact activities. However, this study contained only 24 randomised
patients.</p>
              <p>The main strength of this trial is that it is entirely pragmatic, with a relatively
large number of surgeons using a variety of different hip arthroplasty implants and
their own preferred surgical technique. Although the patients were recruited from only
one centre, the large number of surgeons involved and the variety of implants is likely
to reflect practice in the wider surgical community. Other strengths include the use of
validated patient-reported outcome tools, a relatively large number of participants and
the high levels of complete follow-up data.</p>
              <p>The key limitation of this trial was that the patients themselves were not blind to
their type of hip arthroplasty. Patients undergoing RSA in the UK have generally been
given a different preoperative information sheet and surgical consent from than those
having a THR; this reflects the existing evidence regarding the different risk/benefit
profile of the two procedures.</p>
              <p>How do the results of this trial inform the debate about resurfacing arthroplasty of the
hip? This trial failed to show any evidence that resurfacing arthroplasty provides
improved hip function or greater quality of life when compared with THR over
5 years. Given the new requirements for surveillance of metal-on-metal hip
arthroplasties,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the higher rate of revision
surgery for RSA recorded on the UK national joint registry<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and increased costs associated with RSA,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> it seems increasingly difficult to justify the use of this
technology. We will, however, continue to review the patients in this trial with a
further report planned at a minimum of 10 years.</p>
