                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>The primary outcome was the feasibility of the trial design, including recruitment, adherence and retention at follow-up (3 and 12 months). Secondary outcomes were the feasibility and effect sizes of specific trial measures including asthma-specific quality of life and asthma control.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Primary outcomes: 88 patients were recruited (target 80). At 3-month follow-up, two patients withdrew and six did not complete outcome measures. At 12 months, two withdrew and four did not complete outcome measures. 36/44 patients in the intervention group engaged with MBM (median of 4 logins, range 0–25, IQR 8). Consistent trends were observed to improvements in asthma-related patient-reported outcome measures.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Asthma prevalence in the UK is among the highest in the world at nearly 6% of the UK adult population, comprising 5.4 million people, with the most managed in primary care. Although hospital admission and mortality rates for asthma improved from 1970 to 2000, these improvements have since stalled.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Surveys of asthma symptoms and health status impairment show that suboptimal control is common and that the majority of people with asthma in the UK frequently experience potentially avoidable symptoms and quality of life (QOL) impairment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p>
              <p>Proactive self-management of asthma has been convincingly shown to improve clinical outcomes and have been advocated in guidelines for 25 year.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Guidelines are not always well implemented<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and consequently some people with asthma do not receive evidence-based interventions that are known to impact positively on outcomes. Recent large-scale systematic reviews demonstrated that supported asthma self-management can reduce healthcare utilisation and increase asthma control, without increasing healthcare costs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> For example, people with asthma without a management plan are four times more likely to have an asthma attack needing emergency care in hospital, yet only 44% of people with asthma in the UK report having a self-management plan.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Self-management recommendations for asthma have also encompassed non-pharmacological strategies to improve control. These include lifestyle interventions, such as smoking cessation, allergen avoidance, weight reduction in those with obesity and breathing retraining interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

              <p>Digital interventions (DIs) are increasingly recognised as a possible approach to achieve the aims of supporting chronic diseases, such as asthma. DIs can be convenient, easily accessed and may provide cost-effective tools by automating routine aspects of patient education, monitoring and support.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There is accumulating evidence that DIs are feasible and may be effective in the context of asthma. The Self-Management of Asthma Supported by Hospitals, Information and communication technology, Nurses and General practitioners (SMASHING) trial compared usual care with web-based educational resources, self-monitoring and automated feedback on medication titration, plus some group and email nurse support for patients with asthma. After 12 months, the intervention group had a better QOL and lung function and more symptom-free days, at no extra cost.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The Randomised trial of an Asthma Internet Self-management Intervention (RAISIN) pilot trial indicated that self-management interventions that included non-pharmacological (behavioural and psychological) components could be effective at improving QOL and asthma control, with improvements to ‘reach’ and response rate, by catering to patients with mild asthma but impaired QOL.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A recent systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that self-management DIs may be able to improve asthma control and reduce asthma-related QOL impairment<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; however, there is limited evidence of benefit for other outcomes and larger confirmatory trials are required.</p>
              <p>In the current randomised controlled feasibility trial, we developed and evaluated a digital self-management intervention, that incorporated pharmacological and non-pharmacological self-management support for adults in primary care with impaired asthma-specific QOL (‘My Breathing Matters’; MBM), using evidence, theory and person-based approaches<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and in line with Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

                  <title>Intervention group: usual care with MBM and asthma UK booklet</title>
                  <p>Patients in the intervention group continued to receive usual care but were also given a code that allowed free unlimited access to MBM. MBM is a digital asthma self-management intervention that supports asthma self-management using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, developed using the LifeGuide Software<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and described below according to the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A demonstration version of the intervention is available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mybreathingmatters.co.uk">http://www.mybreathingmatters.co.uk</ext-link>. After signing up and completing quality-of-life-related self-monitoring questions, patients were offered tailored advice that directed them towards specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological sections of the online intervention. The pharmacological section provided information on different medication classes and inhalers, the use of personalised asthma action plans (PAAPs), encouraged medication adherence and gave information to facilitate and inform an effective asthma review with their GP. Pharmacological content was initially based on ‘Living Well with Asthma’, an asthma self-management intervention that previously demonstrated feasibility for self-management<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 19</xref> and was developed in collaboration with people with asthma and with input from Asthma UK (a national asthma charity). This section was designed to answer common concerns about medication, incorporating a strategy described as ‘the 4-week medication challenge’ that encouraged participants to realise the benefits of adherence to regular medication, by self-monitoring their symptoms during 4 weeks of continuous inhaler use. The non-pharmacological support included sections on a number of strategies to improve asthma control, such as breathing retraining, stress reduction and additional healthy lifestyle resources (physical activity, weight reduction, hand hygiene and smoking cessation). Optional nurse support was available by Asthma UK who provide a dedicated nurse helpline that was advertised through the intervention.</p>
                  <p>The intervention was developed using the person-based approach,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> which places patients at the heart of the development process. Evidence from the primary mixed-methods research (such as Morrison <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and qualitative and quantitative reviews was used to develop guiding principles. A prototype intervention was piloted using ‘think aloud’ interview studies, in which patients with asthma used prototype versions of the MBM website and provided feedback on intervention acceptability and feasibility as they used it. In 46 interviews with 30 patients (purposively selected across a range of age and gender), the intervention was iteratively modified and updated to address patient feedback until participants indicated no further modification was required, confirming the intervention was as acceptable and engaging as possible for (see Yardley <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> for more details).</p>
                  <p>Due to the digital nature of the intervention, participants could engage with components of the intervention as much or as little as they wished. Tailored advice was offered according to participants’ preference to find out more about pharmacological or non-pharmacological self-management techniques (patients selected a check box option of ‘I’d like to find out more about how my asthma could be helped by (1) making the most of my asthma medicine or (2) ‘non-medicine’ ways to help my breathing.’), with automated reminders whenever patients had not accessed the intervention for several weeks, or when content was made available that they had not previously seen. The intervention was not modified during the study.</p>
                  <p>Intervention usage was monitored through digital usage metrics (reported below). Non-engagement with the website was not addressed, in line with the pragmatic nature of the feasibility study. Participants were sent one email and received one phone call, in which they were offered technical support if they had not logged onto the intervention at all for 1 month following their baseline appointment.</p>

Across the seven practices, 68 478 patients were assessed for eligibility with 3199 meeting initial eligibility criteria (asthma diagnosis, &gt;1 asthma medicine prescription in last 12 months, screened by practice). 266 patients completed postal screening measures before the recruitment period finished, of whom 125 were eligible to take part (impaired asthma-related QOL, AQLQ score less than 5.5). Ninety patients responded to further contact. Two patients did not attend their baseline appointment leaving a final sample of 88 patients (intervention n=44, usual care n=44) who were recruited into the study (13.5 per practice) and were randomised over a 5-month period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> presents the study Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram.</p>

Four (5%) patients did not complete 12-month follow-up measures but did not withdraw (three in intervention group, one in usual care). None of these intervention participants had used the intervention. None of these patients responded to efforts to contact them by the study team.</p>

                <title>Intervention usage and engagement</title>
                <p>At 12-month follow-up, 36 (82%) patients in the intervention arm had engaged with the intervention (at least 1 log in). Patients logged in between 0 and 25 times to the intervention (median=4; IQR=8.25). Several patients also engaged with additional lifestyle modification interventions including improving hand hygiene (n=2), weight loss (n=3), improving physical activity (n=3) and getting support from friends and family (n=5).</p>
                <p>After the study, participants in the intervention group were asked ‘Do you think there were any benefits to using MBM?’. 12 of 36 (33%) reported ‘quite a bit/a large amount of benefit’, 19/36 (53%) reported ‘some benefit’ and 5/36 (14%) reported ‘very little benefit’. 22 participants completed a free text box describing the advantages—benefits varied but included information provision (such as ‘weight loss’, ‘dietary/exercise regimes’), medication adherence (such as asthma action plans, improved medication adherence), provision of non-pharmacological treatments (such as breathing exercises and relaxation) and accessibility (such as ‘access to information quickly’). This is reported in more detail in a separately published process analysis.</p>
                <p>Participants were also asked ‘Do you think there were any disadvantages to using MBM?’. 25 of 36 (69%) reported no disadvantages at all, 3 (8%) reported very few disadvantages, 8 (22%) reported some disadvantages and none reported quite a bit or a large amount of disadvantages. Thirteen participants completed a free-text box describing disadvantages, which included technical difficulties (such as not always accessible across different devices, difficulty logging in) and information specificity (such as not enough information, too many reminders, too few reminders). A final question asked how likely participants were to recommend MBM to friends or family. Sixteen participants (44%) were extremely likely to recommend it, 12 participants (33%) were likely, 7 (19%) were neither likely nor unlikely and 1 was extremely unlikely (3%).</p>

                <p>Both the intervention group and control group improved from baseline to 3 and 12-month follow-up, with numerically larger improvements in the asthma-related patient-reported outcomes measuring QOL and symptom control (AQLQ and AQC) at both time points; one or both these measures are anticipated to be the primary outcome of a subsequent fully powered study.</p>
                <p>At the 3-month evaluation, patients in the intervention group who completed 3-month follow-up measures (n=36) had mean improvement in asthma-related QOL (AQLQ score) of 0.53 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.75), and in the control group of 0.52 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), with the between-group difference (controlling for baseline differences) the AQLQ being 0.06 higher (95% CI −0.22 to 0.35) in the intervention group, indicating better QOL. By 12 months, these figures were 0.35 (0.10 to 0.60) and 0.21 (−0.09 to 0.51), respectively, and the between-group difference had risen to 0.18 (95% CI −0.21 to 0.56) higher in the intervention group. In the ACQ analysis, at the 3-month analysis, the between-groups ACQ score was 0.14 lower (95% CI −0.41 to 0.13) in the intervention group, indicating better control, and at 12 months, it was 0.14 lower (95% CI −0.40 to 0.11). These findings indicate consistent trends to improvement in both asthma QOL and asthma control in the intervention group compared with the control.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In line with our main research objectives, findings from our randomised controlled feasibility trial demonstrate that a full-size confirmatory trial to confirm effectiveness of MBM, a digital self-management intervention for adults in primary care with asthma is likely to be feasible and acceptable. Our trial procedures, intervention usage and data management were all feasible. There were also trends to improved asthma control and QOL in our underpowered sample, so supporting the need for a definitive fully powered study. Our recruitment procedures recruited a specific patient sample (those impaired asthma-specific QOL) to target from a range of urban and rural practices.</p>
              <p>Our sample varied in age with a relatively high mean (56 years) indicating that our DI can provide benefit to older adults. Both male and female adults were well represented in our trial. A notable proportion of our sample was obese (41%), in line with previous findings.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Given that obesity is a risk factor for asthma, a larger trial could further improve effectiveness by providing more specific behavioural content for obese adults with asthma (such as tailored content to increase motivation to use weight loss-related lifestyle components in obese patients). Our sample was also predominantly white. Under-representation of minority ethnic groups in medical research in the UK is an ongoing issue<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and should be addressed in recruitment procedures in the full trial.</p>
              <p>The feasibility of a full trial is supported by the effective completion of trial procedures. All patients who completed baseline measures were randomised. Completion of measures was good at both follow-up points (3 months via post and 12 months at participants’ practice). Where participants were not able to attend a follow-up appointment at practices, they were satisfactorily followed up via post or telephone for main trial measures. Eight patients were lost to follow-up (four withdrew and four no longer responded to attempts to contact them). Notably, all eight patients lost to follow-up were in the intervention group. It is possible that patients in the control group were more likely to maintain contact as they were only able to access the intervention on completion of 12-month follow-up measures. Although lost to follow-up is low, it is important to consider whether that loss is differential. Those lost to follow-up were more likely to be more socioeconomically deprived, female, have a higher BMI, a longer time since diagnosis and a higher HADS-A and HADS-D score. It is possible that these patients would benefit from using MBM more than most, and therefore, we have proposed several ways to further increase trial efficacy. Automatic email intervention registration at baseline (patients cannot attend baseline appointment without enrolling on the intervention) would increase initial engagement and engagement with trial procedures throughout duration of study. Online questionnaire completion during screening process would (1) screen patients who are unable to interact with online trial/intervention and therefore unable to benefit from the intervention (feasibility trial estimate=2%), and (2) streamline baseline/follow-up procedures.</p>
              <p>Both health economic outcomes had high completion rates but did not suggest substantive change, similar to EQ-5D measures in previous non-pharmacological self-management trials (such as Bruton <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It is possible that an alternative measure such as the Short Form 12-item Survey<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> in which participants consider the previous 2 weeks (whereas in the EQ-5D they consider the immediate present) may be better suited to measure small yet valuable changes in well-being over a full trial. Our detailed mixed-methods process analysis explored issues of trial acceptability in more detail, and will be reported in a subsequent paper. A full trial of this non-pharmacological intervention should accurately capture ‘non-medical’ costs (such as gym membership) that are likely to impact disease-specific QOL, as well as medical costs that would be affected by changes in healthcare utilisation.</p>
              <p>Healthcare utilisation data were collected by practice nurses whose main role was to provide usual clinical care at the practices, using a manual to guide data collection, rather than by trained research nurses, and our quality check demonstrated that the data collection process used was unreliable some centres. We conclude that in a full subsequent study, these data should be collected from the medical record by a trained member of the study team (such as a trained research nurse), as has been successfully used in previous studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</p>
              <p>Engagement with the intervention was slightly increased compared with a previous similar digital asthma self-management intervention<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> at initial sign up (82% vs 76%) as well as maintaining a higher number of ongoing engagement throughout the follow-up period (median 3 additional log ins vs 1), although our study used a broad primary care population while the RAISIN protocol primarily recruited from areas of high deprivation. This finding demonstrates that the use of the person-based approach to develop the intervention resulted in an intervention that was acceptable and engaging to patients, even using a pragmatic methodology in which patients self-registered at home instead of being registered by a GP during their baseline appointment. Participants accessed both pharmacological and non-pharmacological self-management content. We further explored the acceptability of the intervention to people with asthma in a mixed-methods process analysis which will be published separately.</p>
              <p>Estimates of effect size demonstrated that participants who received the intervention and completed follow-up measures showed improved and clinically relevant QOL and asthma control. The order of magnitude of the mean between-group improvements in the patient reported measures of control (ACQ) and asthma-related QOL (AQLQ), although not statistically significant with the sample size of this feasibility study, was comparable to that reported in controlled studies of pharmacological<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and non-pharmacological<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> interventions in asthma, and so justify a confirmatory study with a fully powered sample.</p>
              <p>There was no suggestion of an effect on physiological measures of lung function. These results are in line with previous studies of behavioural self-management interventions in primary care adults with asthma (such as BREATHE, RAISIN), and demonstrate the importance of interventions targeting outcomes that incorporate elements of functional well-being (disease-specific QOL, subjective symptoms), rather than solely focusing on objective, physiological measures that are not correlated with quality of life.</p>
              <p>The effectiveness of our intervention could be further increased according to findings from our process evaluation. This analysis, which will be reported separately, broadly agrees with previous research<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in finding that many patients consider their asthma to be ‘well controlled’ despite having important levels of symptoms and QOL impairment on validated questionnaire. This implies that many people had become accustomed to their ongoing symptoms and had altered their life to try to reduce their impact, using denial as a coping mechanism. As a consequence, the means of appropriately targeting and framing self-management interventions should be carefully considered in future work, focusing on maintaining good health rather than improving poor health. Some of our findings (such as the association between QOL improvement and ongoing intervention engagement) demonstrate that framing content as positive and not focusing on illness—for example ‘How to keep your breathing healthy’ rather than ‘How to reduce asthma symptoms’ may lead to an acceptable, engaging intervention that benefits this patient group.</p>
              <p>There were some limitations to this small feasibility study. Although our researchers and statisticians were blind to group allocation, patients would have known that they were allocated to the intervention rather than the usual care control. This is common in complex behavioural interventions. Furthermore, although we endeavoured to recruit participants across a broad demographic range, the reach of our intervention could be improved. While the reach of DIs improves as digital literacy increases nationally, care must be taken to ensure that ‘digital transformation’ of NHS services does not entrench healthcare inequality, by facilitating a ‘digital divide’ that fails to provide adequate health and social care to those who do not have the digital skills to benefit.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of a new digital self-management intervention for asthma (MBM). Using the person-based approach to intervention development means that MBM is both acceptable and engaging for adults with asthma in primary care. MBM reflects the varied experiences of people with asthma, by including both non-pharmacological and pharmacological components. Our data support the feasibility of moving towards a fully powered RCT, with only minor modifications to some trial procedures required.</p>
