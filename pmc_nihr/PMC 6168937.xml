                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide. Previous analyses have only reported follow-up after flexible sigmoidoscopy for a maximum of 12 years. We aimed to examine colorectal cancer incidence and mortality after a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screening and 17 years of follow-up.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this multicentre randomised trial (UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial), done between Nov 14, 1994, and March 30, 1999, 170 432 eligible men and women, who had indicated on a previous questionnaire that they would probably attend screening if invited, were randomly assigned (1:2) to an intervention group (offered flexible sigmoidoscopy screening) or a control group (not contacted). Randomisation was done centrally in blocks of 12, and stratified by trial centre, general practice, and household type. The nature of the intervention did not allow the staff to be masked to arm of the trial; however, randomisation was done in batches so that the control group and participants not yet randomised were unaware of their allocation status. The primary outcomes were incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were estimated for intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 28352761.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Our cohort analysis included 170 034 people: 112 936 in the control group and 57 098 in the intervention group, 40 621 (71%) of whom were screened and 16 477 (29%) were not screened. During screening and a median of 17·1 years' follow-up, colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 1230 individuals in the intervention group and 3253 in the control group, and 353 individuals in the intervention group versus 996 individuals in the control group died from colorectal cancer. In intention-to-treat analyses, colorectal cancer incidence was reduced by 26% (HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·70–0·80]; p&lt;0·0001) in the intervention group versus the control group and colorectal cancer mortality was reduced by 30% (0·70 [0·62–0·79]; p&lt;0·0001) in the intervention group versus the control group. In per-protocol analyses, adjusted for non-compliance, colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were 35% (HR 0·65 [95% CI 0·59–0·71]) and 41% (0·59 [0·49–0·70]) lower in the screened group.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">The UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial (UKFSST) is examining the magnitude and duration of effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, between ages 55 years and 64 years, on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. We previously reported results from the trial, which showed that as well as being safe and well accepted, flexible sigmoidoscopy produces a substantial and sustained reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality that lasts for at least 11 years.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among those individuals attending screening in the UKFSST, colorectal cancer incidence was reduced by 33%, distal colorectal cancer incidence by 50%, and colorectal cancer mortality by 43%. Similar findings have since been reported by two further trials examining the effectiveness of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy at 55 years to 64 years, in Italy and Norway, with 11 years of follow-up.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p id="para20">On the basis of an independent economic analysis using the UKFSST results, the UK National Screening Committee approved the addition of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen at age 55 years to the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in 2011.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The BCSP already included two-yearly guaiac faecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) offered from ages 60 years to 74 years. Roll out of the flexible sigmoidoscopy programme started in 2013. The aim is for full population coverage to be achieved in 2021; at the time of writing, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening was being offered by 62 (97%) of the 64 BCSP screening centres (National Health Service Bowel Cancer Screening programme, personal communication). However, flexible sigmoidoscopy screening is resource intensive and needs to have long-term efficacy in preventing colorectal cancer diagnoses and deaths to be cost-effective. Furthermore, in view of longer life expectancies, higher incidence of colorectal cancer with increasing age, and worse outcomes in older individuals,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> it is desirable that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy retains its efficacy into old age.</p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">To date, three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested our hypothesis, published in <italic>The Lancet</italic> in 1993, that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination at around age 60 years is an effective strategy to prevent colorectal cancer; these are the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Screening Trial (UKFSST), the Italian SCORE (Screening for COlon REctum) trial, and the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention Trial (NORCCAP). Following recruitment and screening of people aged between 55 years and 64 years, all three trials reported that the test was safe and well accepted and did not cause any increase in anxiety. In 2010, we published the major outcomes of the UKFSST study after a median follow-up of 11 years. We reported that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination reduced colorectal cancer incidence by 33% and colorectal cancer mortality by 43%. Subsequently, SCORE and NORCCAP published similar results, confirming the efficacy of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy after a median follow-up of 11 years. As yet, there is no published evidence on how long the protective effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy lasts beyond 11 years of follow-up.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">In this study we present the outcomes of the UKFSST after a median follow-up of 17 years. The UKFSST is the largest trial examining the effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates (n=170 432) and has a sufficient sample size to examine the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening in men and women separately. Long-term follow-up is crucial to our understanding of whether the efficacy of once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy screening is sustained into older, higher colorectal cancer incidence age groups, and for determining cost-effectiveness.</p>
                  <p id="para80">Data from this large trial, where the cohort is now aged between 72 years and 81 years, shows that once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy screening continues to provide substantial protection from colorectal cancer diagnosis and death, in both men and women, with little attenuation of effect during prolonged follow-up. As a result of the continuing effectiveness of the test into older age, estimates of the number of people who need to be screened to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis have halved, from almost 200 (after 11 years of follow-up), to less than 100 (after 17 years of follow-up).</p>
                  <p id="para90">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para100">The three RCTs have shown that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy is a safe, well accepted, and effective screening strategy for the prevention of colorectal cancer. Together, the trials provide important data to inform national colorectal cancer screening policy in high incidence countries. In 2010, following publication of the results of the UKFSST, the UK National Screening Committee approved the addition of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 55 years to the existing NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP). The BCSP already offered two yearly guaiac faecal occult blood testing between ages 60 years and 74 years.</p>
                  <p id="para110">New screening tests are always under consideration and it is essential to generate high-quality data to compare cost-effectiveness. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an expensive and invasive test, but it has three distinct advantages over blood and stool tests. First, it is highly sensitive for small lesions and so neoplasia is detectable at a very early stage. Second, most lesions can be removed at the time of screening, so the screening in most cases is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Last, results from this study suggest that the test might not need to be repeated.</p>
                  <p id="para120">This new evidence, showing the longevity of effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy and the profound reduction over the past 6 years of follow-up in the number of people who need to be screened to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis, provides crucial data to help to inform health economic models commissioned by the UK National Screening Committee on the continued use of flexible sigmoidoscopy as part of the national BCSP in England.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para130">We aimed to examine the efficacy of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy in reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates after a median of 17 years' follow-up overall as well as by sex and age group. We also examine the potential contaminating effect of exposure to gFOBT in the BCSP on outcomes.</p>

                <p id="para160">Those individuals who expressed interest in having a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen were randomly assigned to the control group or intervention group (2:1), unless they had reported meeting any of the exclusion criteria in the questionnaire, or if the required number of participants for the trial had been reached. Sequentially numbered randomisation was done centrally in blocks of 12, with stratification by trial centre, general practice, and household type. Due to the nature of the procedure masking of care staff and the intervention group was not possible. However, randomisation was done in batches so that the control group and participants not yet randomised were unaware of their allocation status. To avoid confusion within households if eligible members of the same household were allocated to different arms of the trial, potentially resulting in the wrong person attending screening, randomisation was at the household level rather than individual level.</p>

                <p id="para170">The intervention group was offered flexible sigmoidoscopy screening followed by colonoscopy if high-risk polyps were found (defined as ≥1 cm; ≥3 adenomas; tubulovillous or villous histology; severe dysplasia or malignant disease; or ≥20 hyperplastic polyps above the distal rectum). The control group was not contacted.</p>
                <p id="para180">Data for cancer registrations, date of death, cause of death, and emigrations were provided by national sources (English, Welsh and Scottish cancer registries, National Health Service [NHS] Digital, NHS National Services Scotland [NSS], the NHS Central Register [NHSCR] and the Office for National Statistics [ONS]). The cohort was matched with the NHS BCSP database and data for involvement with the programme was collected; data for invitations and completion of gFOBT kits was used for this analysis. Previous events that had not been accounted for at the time of randomisation were identified from the cancer, death, and emigration data received from national sources during follow-up, and analysis of the recent data showed changes that affected the eligibility of some participants. Where necessary, further exclusions were applied in the current analytical cohort (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 1</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para190">Colorectal cancer sites were defined by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), and included codes C18–C20. Distal cancer was defined as C18.7, C19, and C20 (rectum and sigmoid colon) and proximal cancer as C18.0–C18.6 (descending colon to the caecum). Morphology of colorectal cancer was coded with ICD-02 codes. We included all codes relating to invasive adenocarcinomas (8140/3 8144/3, 8210/3, 8213/3, 8260/3, 8261/3, 8262/3, 8263/3, 8480/3, 8481/3, 8490/3, 8574/3), and carcinoma not otherwise specified (8000/3, 8010/3, 8020/3) for colorectal cancers that were diagnosed on clinical grounds only.</p>

                <p id="para210">This analysis included follow-up through to Dec 31, 2014. The primary outcomes were colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and secondary outcomes were distal colorectal cancer (rectum and sigmoid) and proximal colon cancer incidence and mortality, all-cause and non-colorectal cancer mortality, and the number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis or death. In the estimation of incidence outcomes, only one colorectal cancer per patient was counted: the earliest colorectal cancer diagnosed for the incidence of all-site colorectal cancer and the earliest colorectal cancer in that site category for site-specific incidence. All time-to-event data were censored at emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Time to colorectal cancer and death was shown using one minus the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function.</p>

                <p id="para220">Assuming an attendance rate at screening of 55%, two-sided significance level of α=0·05, and a Poisson distribution for the number of events, the original sample size of the trial was calculated to give 79% or more power in those aged 55–59 years and 90% or more power in those aged 60–64 years to detect a 20% difference between the intervention group and control group in colorectal cancer incidence at 10 years and mortality at 15 years since randomisation. Because screening attendance rates were greater than predicted, revised estimates indicated sufficient mortality endpoints would be acquired at 11 years.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para230">Intention-to-treat analyses, which examined the effectiveness of an invitation for screening, were undertaken using univariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.

Annual incidence rate ratios (IRR) by years of follow-up since randomisation for all-site and distal colorectal cancer comparing intervention and control groups were estimated with exact 95% CIs for the first 16 years of follow-up, after which we had incomplete data. Per-protocol annual IRRs were estimated with adjustment for non-compliance.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The NNS to prevent one colorectal cancer or one death due to colorectal cancer, with 95% CIs, were calculated using the method by Tabar and colleagues,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> which estimates the NNS by dividing the number attending screening by the total events prevented in the invited to screening group. Subgroup analyses were done by sex and age group (55–59 years and 60–64 years) and differences were examined using tests for interaction.</p>
                <p id="para240">In sensitivity analyses that were not prespecified as part of the trial protocol, we examined the potential effect of contamination by gFOBT screening within the English BCSP. We identified all members of the UKFSST cohort who were screened with gFOBT as part of the BCSP and examined the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy with and without gFOBT screening by including an indicator for gFOBT screening participation as a time varying covariate in the Cox model and performing tests of interaction. People could contribute to both not-participated and participated follow-up time, but after participation, a person was considered to remain exposed.</p>
                <p id="para250">We also did sensitivity analyses for the outcome of distal colorectal cancer incidence where the descending colon (ICD-10 code C18.6) was included as distal. Due to the violation of the proportionality assumption for the outcomes of all-site and distal colorectal cancer incidence, we did sensitivity analyses in which we fitted exponential regression models incorporating a time threshold at 2 years, approximately where the hazard rate in the intervention group changed, and estimated the average relative rate adjusted for this. In addition, we did sensitivity analyses where the block randomisation structure was accounted for in the Cox regression models. A stratum was created for each combination of trial centre, general practice, and household type and models were fitted allowing for separate baseline hazards for each stratum as well as with standard errors adjusted for within strata correlation. Our main analyses assumed that persons within a household were independent; however, as the unit of randomisation was household and not individual, we did sensitivity analyses that accounted for the clustering by household and allowed for potentially complete dependence within households. Cox regression analyses were performed and the follow-up time of any other members of a household were censored at the date of first event within a household. No allowance for multiplicity was made in the analyses. All data were analysed with Stata 13.1.</p>

              <p id="para360">During the first 4 years after screening, cumulative incidence rates for all-site and distal colorectal cancers were higher in the intervention group than in the control group because of the detection of prevalent cancers at flexible sigmoidoscopy screening.

A median of 11·3 years (IQR 10·2–12·8) had elapsed between randomisation and first screen by gFOBT, and 1577 (1·4%) people in the control group and 688 (1·2%) in the intervention group tested positive at least once.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para520">Results of three randomised trials, including our UK study, have reported that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination between 55 years and 64 years of age confers a substantial reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality that lasts at least 11 years.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We now present the first randomised trial evidence that protection from a single flexible sigmoidoscopy remains substantial with even longer follow-up.</p>
              <p id="para530">The median follow-up time in this analysis was 17 years during which incidence of colorectal cancer at all sites in screened patients was reduced by 35%, and distal cancer incidence was reduced by 56%. This compares with reductions of 33% and 50%, respectively, after a median of 11 years we reported in 2010.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Consistent with this finding, the NNS to prevent one colorectal cancer diagnosis had almost halved since the last report, from 191 after 11 years of follow-up to 98 after 17 years. These results suggest that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen continues to provide long-lasting protection against colorectal cancer diagnosis.</p>
              <p id="para540">The estimated reductions in incidence in the screened group include prevalent screen-detected cancers, which clearly could not be prevented by screening, and the protective effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on cumulative incidence rates became apparent only after 5 years. When distal colorectal cancer incidence was analysed from five years, incidence was estimated to be reduced by 68% over the remainder of follow-up among the screened group. Evidence of the long-term efficacy of flexible sigmoidoscopy in reducing distal colorectal cancer incidence after screening is apparent from the annual IRRs which estimated an average reduction of 74% between years 6 and 10, and 69% between years 11 and 16.</p>
              <p id="para550">Proximal colon cancer incidence and mortality was reduced by a non-significant 5% and 12%, respectively. This small effect was expected since referral for a colonoscopy following flexible sigmoidoscopy screening was restricted to those with high-risk polyps, and as a result only 5% of the screened group had a colonoscopy. Other trials had looser criteria for colonoscopy after flexible sigmoidoscopy resulting in higher rates of colonoscopy and a greater impact on proximal colon cancer.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p>
              <p id="para560">For all-site colorectal cancers, the average incidence reduction after flexible sigmoidoscopy screening decreased from 52% over 6–10 years of follow-up, to 39% over 11–16 years. As a corresponding weakening in effect was not noted for distal colorectal cancer incidence, the attenuation seen for all-site colorectal cancer was probably due to the increasing proportion of cancers being proximally located as participants aged. Analysis of English colorectal cancer incidence statistics for 2014 showed that from age 55 years, the proportion of cancers located proximally increased from 29% at age 55–59 years to 48% at age 80–84 years.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> As our cohort was screened by flexible sigmoidoscopy at ages 55–64 years and the age of the participants after 17 years' follow-up ranged from 72–81 years, the proportion of proximal cancers would be expected to have increased over the years of follow-up.</p>
              <p id="para570">We found that the reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence after a single flexible sigmoidoscopy was the same in men and women at 56%. Since flexible sigmoidoscopy acts mainly on the distal colon this is reassuring and indicates that women are likely to benefit to the same extent as men in terms of preventing cancer of the rectum and sigmoid colon. However, we observed that the effect on all-site colorectal cancer incidence was weaker in women as have the US and the Norwegian trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This is not surprising because rates of proximal colon cancer as a proportion of all colorectal cancers is higher in women than men particularly at older ages. For example, in England in 2014, proximal colon cancers constituted 27·5% of colon cancers in men compared with 34% in women at age 55 years, whereas at age 80 years the proportions rose to 39% and 52%, respectively.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para580">The increase in proximal cancers with age emphasises the importance of screening measures to target cancers in the proximal colon, such as colonoscopy. In a large observational study of 88 902 individuals over 22 years, colonoscopy was associated with a 27% reduction in proximal cancer incidence (multivariate HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·57–0·92).<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Additionally, proximal cancer incidence rates in the US decreased by 2·3–2·6% per year between 2000 and 2008, coinciding with the increased colonoscopy use since 2000 (distal colorectal cancer incidence also decreased by 2·9–3·5% per year).<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, in the UK and many European countries, population screening by colonoscopy is not feasible because of competing demands on the use of colonoscopy for investigation of symptomatic patients and for surveillance of higher-risk groups. Other approved screening tests for colorectal cancer include stool occult blood tests, a stool-based multitarget DNA test, and methylated Septin9, a blood-based test.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although these tests detect cancers and some precursor lesions in the proximal colon,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> there is very little data for the effect of these tests on proximal colon cancer incidence.</p>
              <p id="para590">Examining our data by age at randomisation showed consistent, and significant reductions for all-site and distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in both the younger and older age categories when men and women were combined and within each sex. By contrast, a recent publication of a pooled analysis of three other trials reported that flexible sigmoidoscopy was not effective in women older than 60 years.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In addition to the heterogeneity between studies, the findings in this recent publication were restricted to a median follow-up time between 10·5 years and 12·1 years and slightly fewer incident colorectal cancers (n=4157) than our trial (n=4483). Despite the differences in findings between the recent pooled analysis and our trial, the clinical relevance of the effect of giving a single flexible sigmoidoscopy procedure to an individual older than 60 years is restricted because it is unlikely that any screening programme would advocate the use of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy as late as aged 60 years when it is clearly effective when done at a younger age.</p>
              <p id="para600">Incidence of colorectal cancer increases with age with 60% of colorectal cancers diagnosed after 70 years. Without cancer a person older than 70 years old is likely to live at least another decade.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Older people with colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed as an emergency and are less likely to be offered curative treatment than are younger people. Even if offered surgery older people are more likely to die both in the short and longer term.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Our findings that an early, once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy screen reduces the chance of a colorectal cancer diagnosis in the UKFSST cohort, now aged between 72 years and 81 years, suggests that this is a promising strategy to reduce colorectal cancer and the associated health-care burden in older people.</p>
              <p id="para610">Importantly, we have shown that flexible sigmoidoscopy is safe, with rare adverse events, which mostly occur as a result of polyp removal.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Additionally, we reported in 2010 that all-cause mortality was slightly but not significantly reduced in the screened arm of the trial (HR 0·97 [95% CI 0·94–1·00]; p=0·0519), with no increase in non-colorectal cancer mortality.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para620">Our trial has several strengths. We have estimated the effect of a single flexible sigmoidoscopy screen over a long follow-up period of an average of 17 years and are the first to publish findings over such a long period. Our large sample size and the fact that 75% of the cohort was still living after a median of 17 years of follow-up since screening, provided an opportunity to look at efficacy of the test into participants' old age. We used national datasets for ascertainment of cancers, mortality, and participation in the BCSP and, as a result, have very little loss to follow-up as we could continue to follow participants even if they migrated within the UK. The BCSP provided data, which allowed us to investigate contamination with gFOBT screening and to examine the effect of participation in the programme on outcomes in the trial. In 2006, the BCSP began rollout of a programme of biennial gFOBT, with rollout complete by 2010. The programme ultimately aimed to offer screening to all men and women aged between 60 years and 74 years registered with a general practitioner. Because the BCSP roll-out was staggered by geographical area and age, a proportion of the UKFSST cohort was over age by the time they came under coverage. As a result, less than a third of the UKFSST cohort had gFOBT screening, with a similar rate of participation in the control group and the intervention group and less than 1·5% ever testing positive. Moreover, we found very little difference in the effect of flexible sigmoidoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence or mortality with and without gFOBT screening (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>).</p>
              <p id="para630">One limitation of the trial is that the cohort was selected based on their interest in attending screening. The uptake rate was therefore higher than would be expected in a population-based programme. However, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the English participants in our control group in the first 10 years of follow-up (ie, before roll-out of the BCSP) was no different to that expected in the general population (standardised incidence ratio of 1·02 [95% CI 0·97–1·09])<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> suggesting that our trial cohort is representative in terms of risk of colorectal cancer. Finally, improvements have been made in endoscopy standards over the past decade, so the benefit of flexible sigmoidoscopy in the future could be even greater than we estimate from our data.</p>
              <p id="para640">We will continue to follow-up the trial cohort enabling us to monitor the long-term effects of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, and to further examine the longevity of effect. In conclusion, our results show that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy examination in people aged between 55 years and 64 years confers a substantial protection from colorectal cancer diagnosis and death lasting at least 17 years.</p>
