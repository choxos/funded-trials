                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>The success of pharmacological randomised controlled trials (RCTs) depends on the recruitment of the required number of participants. Recruitment to RCTs for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices raises specific additional challenges. The objectives of the study were 1) to explore patient perspectives on factors that influence RCT recruitment, 2) to understand factors that influence the success of recruitment from a staff perspective, and 3) to identify opportunities for tailored interventions to improve trial recruitment in this context.</p>

                <sec id="sec002">
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>The qualitative study was embedded in a multi-centre blinded RCT (BOPPP trial) and was conducted alongside site opening. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients who enrolled to participate in the trial (n = 13), patients who declined to take part (n = 5), and staff who were responsible for recruiting participants to the trial (n = 18). An open approach to data collection and analysis was adopted and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to provide a theoretical lens through which to view influences on behaviour. Data was analysed using thematic analysis.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The findings consist of 5 overarching themes that outline trial recruitment influences at the patient, staff, team, organisational and trial levels: i) <italic toggle="yes">patient risks and benefits</italic> ii) <italic toggle="yes">staff attitudes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">knowledge and capacity</italic>, iii) <italic toggle="yes">team-based approach</italic>, iv) <italic toggle="yes">organisational context</italic> and v) <italic toggle="yes">Trial collective</italic>. Patient-generated themes map onto thirteen of the fourteen TDF domains and staff-generated themes map onto all TDF domains. The overarching themes are not mutually exclusive; with evidence of direct interactions between patient and staff-level themes that influence recruitment behaviours.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>This study uses a theory-informed approach to gain new insights into improving clinical trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices. Although people with cirrhosis often display decreased healthcare-seeking behaviours, we found that patients used research to empower themselves to improve their health. Pragmatic trials involving unpredictable populations require staff expertise in building trust, and a deep knowledge of the patient group and their vulnerabilities. RCT recruitment is also more successful when research visits align with what staff identified as the natural rhythm of care.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>Liver disease is the fifth commonest cause of death in the developed world and is rising in incidence [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Liver cirrhosis causes portal hypertension and this in turn leads to the common complication of varices in the oesophagus, which are prone to haemorrhage [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], a very difficult experience for patients and clinicians. It is important that patients with oesophageal varices (OV) are monitored given their increased risk of variceal haemorrhage [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Monitoring is by endoscopic assessment of the size and appearance of the varices as both directly affect the risk of VH or death. Despite the advances of medical, endoscopic and radiological therapy the mortality rate from acute VH is 10%-20% [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prevention of VH is therefore vital in those who have varices. The current evidence base and international recommendations identify a clear benefit in the reduction of VH with non-selective beta blockade (NSBB) in patients with moderate-large varices (&gt;5mm in diameter), or those with advanced liver disease [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is however currently no clear evidence to guide the use of NSBB in patients with small varices. The Beta-blockers Or Placebo for Primary Prophylaxis of oesophageal varices (BOPPP) trial is a phase IV, multi-centre Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that aims to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of using Carvedilol and placebo in the prevention of variceal bleeding for small OV in patients with cirrhosis. Patients are assessed for trial eligibility following detection of small OV at gastroscopy and those found to be eligible (all patients with small (grade 1) OVs due to cirrhosis of any cause) are invited to take part.</p>
              <p>Recruiting patients with cirrhosis and small varices raises specific challenges. The patient group are clinically vulnerable because they are living with a chance of VH or death, and for those whose condition relates to alcohol use, there are additional vulnerabilities and risks. Clinical staff acknowledge the extent of the risks of living with cirrhosis and build relationships with patients and their families to support them. However, the influence of various factors such as stigma and lifestyle can, for some people with liver disease, contribute to difficulties engaging with health care, creating an additional complication of being hard-to-reach and limiting their involvement in research [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given the condition of the target population, their possible history of traumatic oesophageal bleeding, and recruitment in the context of endoscopy and gastroscopy, the BOPPP trial faces a number of potential challenges to recruitment. Understanding the context of the trial and the views of those with key perspectives on the experiences involved, will offer insights into potentially difficult and sensitive recruitment encounters. This is important as successful conduct of all RCTs depends on recruiting the required number of participants [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The challenge of trial recruitment is a long-established concern that is widely acknowledged, with factors that influence recruitment being well documented (i.e., additional demands of the trial, lack of staff and training, concerns about the impact on the clinical relationship, uncertainty about information and consent and lack of rewards and recognition) [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>While studies on recruitment form a large part of qualitative research in trials, research that gathers the views of both staff and patients is important, because staff and patients offer different expertise and perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Conducting a qualitative study within the BOPPP trial (a trial that is aligned to standard of care visits and without obvious risks or demands on staff and patients) provides valuable learning and allows us to broaden the focus of recruitment barriers and facilitators across different system actors and system-levels. The broad aim of this qualitative study was to gain an understanding of the particular recruitment circumstances and conditions of the BOPPP trial, by gathering the views of staff and patients. The specific objectives of the qualitative study were to 1) to explore patient perspectives on factors that influence RCT recruitment, 2) to understand factors that influence the success of recruitment from the staff perspective, and 3) to identify opportunities for tailored interventions to improve trial recruitment.</p>

                <title>Study design</title>
                <p>BOPPP is a UK-wide RCT that aims to recruit 1200 participants to evaluate if NSBB reduces variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients with small oesophageal varices (Trial registration: ISRCTN10324656). This study used qualitative methods to provide important insights into the complexities of trial recruitment, to identify barriers and facilitators to recruitment, and to inform the development of interventions to support recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To meet objective 1, semi-structured face-to-face or telephone individual interviews were conducted with patients who were identified as eligible to take part in the BOPPP trial, and who had been approached for trial participation. To meet objective 2, semi-structured telephone individual interviews were conducted with staff responsible for recruiting to the BOPPP trial to explore their recruitment experiences. To meet objective 3, interviews were used to generate detailed data which could be used to identify theory-informed interventions.</p>
                <p>The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was used to provide a theoretical lens through which to view influences on behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The TDF outlines 14 theoretical constructs, developed from a synthesis of psychological theories to understand the determinants of behaviour. Although the TDF was developed to understand the behaviour of health professionals, it has recently been extended to include other areas relevant to behaviour change such as patient behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0263288.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> outlines the TDF domains and provides an illustration of how each construct might be used to explore factors that influence recruitment practices.</p>

                <p>Staff and patients were recruited from 14 NHS Trusts across the United Kingdom, chosen to provide a mix of different regions and perceived levels of success in recruiting to the BOPPP trial. Participants were selected purposively (those who were eligible to take part in the BOPPP trial or those recruiting to the BOPPP trial) on the basis that they could offer a particular perspective on trial recruitment and are the target adopters of behaviours that influence the success of trial recruitment. However, heterogeneity was sought in the sample (for example, those who declined participation as well as those who enrolled on to the trial, and those who were successful and less successful in recruiting participants to the trial) so that convergence and divergence could be examined within the sample. Incentive payments, which were not considered unduly influential, were offered to those who declined to enter the trial to advance the goals of the study [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Participants were over 18, and proficient in English.</p>
                <p>Eligible patients were first approached by the local research team (for example, local principal investigator, research nurse), and subsequently recruited to a telephone or face-to-face interview (depending on preference) by the lead author <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the telephone or face-to-face. Potential staff participants were approached and recruited to a telephone interview by the lead author <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> the telephone or email. Written or verbal informed consent was obtained from each participant after a full explanation and information leaflet was given and time allowed for consideration. The right of each participant to refuse to participate without giving reasons was respected. All participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time without giving reasons and without prejudicing further treatment or employment. Written consent was not practical or appropriate for those participating in the research by telephone, so in these cases, verbal consent was taken by telephone with the conversation being audio-recorded. A witness [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] then verified consent after listening to the audio-recording. The consent procedures were granted ethical approval and recruitment continued until thematic saturation was reached [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The stages of recruitment are illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0263288.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p>

                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p>Interviews used flexible open-ended questions for early data collection to gather a rich and detailed understanding of participants’ perspectives. Patient interviews explored their views on trial recruitment including the acceptability of randomisation and other possible barriers and enablers associated with the proposed intervention and trial. Patients who declined to enter the trial were also asked for their reasons for declining participation. Staff were asked about their recruitment experiences including barriers and facilitators to recruiting patients with small oesophageal varices and cirrhosis. Prompts based on the TDF were used to consider factors related to the cognitive, affective, social and environmental influences on behaviour should they have relevance to the participants’ narrative [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the TDF was used flexibly to allow a natural narrative flow to the interview and to enable participants to share information that was important to them [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A narrow approach to applying the TDF could have meant that contextual information around how wider determinants of behaviour interact would be lost. The patient and staff interview schedules were revised iteratively in response to the priorities and concerns of participants and are included in <xref rid="pone.0263288.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>.</p>
                <p>Interviews were conducted by telephone or face-to-face by the lead author (a post-doctoral qualitative research fellow in applied health and population research, with a clinical background in Occupational Therapy), lasted around 45 minutes, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Researcher reflexive notes were kept after each interview to consider the interaction with the participant, and to detail initial thoughts. Interviews were conducted by the lead author between September 2019 and September 2020.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p>Initial inductive thematic analysis was used for data analysis, where analytical concepts and perspectives are derived from the data in a deliberate and systematic way [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This approach allows unexpected themes to be identified and does not restrict the investigation to predetermined concepts or prejudge the significance of concepts. In this way, the inductive approach ensured that non-TDF related factors were also identified [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
                <p>Patient and staff data were initially analysed as separate groups. Data analysis began with individual-level case-by-case repeated re-reading of interview transcripts and re-listening of sound files for data immersion (CL). This was followed by line-by-line open coding, where individual extracts were coded under one or several themes to fully capture their meaning. Each theme was refined, and where data allowed, further sub-themes were developed. Thematic maps, visual representations of the themes, were used to organise the themes by clustering all codes according to connections in the data and by considering the patterns and relationships between themes. An initial coding frame for patients and for staff was developed and interpretive analysis was then undertaken to group the themes and sub-themes into overarching themes. Additional codes, refinements to the specifics of themes, and thematic patterns continued until theoretical saturation was achieved [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thematic saturation occurred when the emergent themes had been fully explored and new data was easily accommodated within them. Comparisons between participant groups were explored and the two coding frames were integrated to provide the final coding framework. The themes were then mapped to the TDF domains to provide a theoretical understanding of factors that influence recruitment practices.</p>
                <p>Data analysis occurred concurrently with data collection using NVivo QSR International qualitative analysis software (version 12). The lead author directed the analysis. Coding by a second rater [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was undertaken to allow the opportunity to compare interpretations of data, to provide an opportunity to reflect on the coding approach, and to enhance rigour.</p>

                <p>Patients were recruited from nine of the fourteen Trust sites involved in the qualitative study, and staff participants were recruited from 13 of the NHS Trusts. All staff participants identified research as integral to their professional role. Of the patients contacted by the researcher (CL), 72% agreed to take part in an interview (seven people declined) and 82% of staff participants agreed to take part (4 people declined participation). Reasons for non-participation included deteriorating health for patients, and lack of time.</p>

                <title>Overarching themes</title>
                <p>The overarching themes to emerge from the data were: <italic toggle="yes">patient risks and benefits</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">staff attitudes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">knowledge and capacity</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">team-based approach</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">organisational context</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">trial collective</italic>. Participants’ accounts described recruitment barriers and facilitators across system-levels so each of the themes can be mapped as i) patient, ii) staff, iii) team, iv) organisational or v) trial level (across organisations) influences. Because of space limitations, a summary of each overarching theme is provided, and the sub-themes are not elaborated in this article; the full coding framework is included in <xref rid="pone.0263288.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 File</xref>. <xref rid="pone.0263288.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> maps the themes to the TDF domains and offers an illustration of where staff and patient perspectives align and/or overlap, and where they are different. Patient and staff perspectives furthers our understanding because the staff-level themes overlap, are not mutually exclusive, and have a direct influence on the patient-identified themes. For example, staff <italic toggle="yes">knowledge</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">skills</italic> will influence what/how information about the trial is provided to patients before they can make the decision whether to take part. Alongside, <italic toggle="yes">social influences</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">beliefs about patient capabilities</italic> (i.e., patients who are invested in their health and actively involved in their care) are prioritised and staff judgement (<italic toggle="yes">decision-making</italic>) dictates who will be informed about the research.</p>

                <title>Theme 1: Patient risks and benefits</title>
                <p>Patient and staff participants spoke about the trial processes and procedures as both a barrier and a facilitator. For some patients, a three-year commitment influenced their choice of whether to enrol. One patient who declined to enter the trial stated: <italic toggle="yes">‘It’s just a lot to take on isn’t it</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">agreeing to do it for three years’</italic> (QR1001). However, another patient conceptualised the length of the trial as an enabler to research participation, and an opportunity to receive ongoing support: <italic toggle="yes">It’s three years</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that three years you’re being monitored’</italic> (QR1102). Staff responsible for recruiting to the trial agreed that this was a positive consequence of participating in research and spoke about the reinforcement of additional monitoring, and that the opportunity to be involved in clinical trials adds to care.</p>
                <p>Some patients spoke about the timing, and the influence of the point at which they found out about the trial. One patient commented that the research was <italic toggle="yes">‘sprung on me’</italic> as it was mentioned at the same time as undergoing an endoscopy procedure:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘I didn’t know anything about the trial until my second endoscopy</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and at the time</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">there was a woman [research nurse] saying to me all about the trial</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">another guy [endoscopist] saying</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">‘stick your arm out here’</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">another one going</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">‘lay back’</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">And it all happened so quickly</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I just came away with the information’</italic>,</p>
                  <p>(QR1002)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Another patient explained that the timing of the invitation to participate came too soon after their diagnosis, and they needed to give themselves priority to ‘<italic toggle="yes">get everything back on track… I don’t really want to rock the boat’</italic> (QR0701). For some, all effort was on managing existing health needs, and the trial was another thing to worry about. However, other patients explained how involvement in the research would support their goal to be invested in their own health, for example, to give up alcohol, and offered them a chance to receive treatment:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘You don’t know if you’re on the placebo or the beta blocker… I understand perfectly well why you have you do that</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">You’re not going to establish the efficacy of the treatment without doing it so that’s fair enough</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">But if beta blockers help with the varices</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">then presumably</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and I’m on the beta blockers</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Then I’m going to get the benefit out of it</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR1202)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Patients also described how the beliefs about consequences (i.e., a chance to be on treatment) and the behavioural regulation (i.e., giving up alcohol) of taking part was also a reassurance for family. Others felt that by taking part in the research, and being seen to be helping themselves, they would receive better healthcare in the future if they ever needed it. Both staff and patients identified research participation as an opportunity for more regular appointments:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘Whereas there is obviously a slippage on normal appointments</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">simply because so many people are being diagnosed</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and instead of sticking to a 12 month or a six-month appointment</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">those slip a month or two</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Whereas if you’re in the research study</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they stick quite religiously to the time period simply because the research study needs to have its results when it needs to have its results</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">He said you’ll get more timely treatment</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and you won’t have any slippage on your appointments</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR1202)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>However, both patients and staff identified additional appointments as a barrier to research participation. Staff explained how they attempt to limit the number of extra hospital visits by coinciding initial appointments with standard of care visits. One member of staff reported a difficulty engaging people ‘<italic toggle="yes">if it’s not within the natural rhythm of their treatment’</italic> (QR0500). Other staff members explained that the ability to coordinate appointments also depends on environmental resources such as space and doctor availability. Staff also identified the length of time it requires to undertake the research appointment as a potential barrier to participation:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘I think baseline screening [is] quite intense</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">It’s quite a lot of information to collect from the patient… we noticed that it did take quite a lot of time</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">especially when the patient has a lot of medications and perhaps other</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">like a history of certain illness or conditions and things to note down</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">It did take quite a while</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR1200)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Some patients reported that they had understood the trial and what was expected of them and explained that the trial information had been presented in a clear and accessible way that had enabled them to make an informed decision about taking part. Other patients had a different understanding of the trial information or were worried about the possible consequences of side effects or the chance of placebo. One explained that it helped to have time to talk through the information with family, and that they agreed to take part after discussing the information with their son. Staff and patients felt that the information would be better understood if it could be communicated in simpler language and delivered in a face-to-face interaction with reassurance that ongoing support is available. This is particularly important given the vulnerabilities that could exist in the trial population of patients with cirrhosis, a condition associated for some of the participants with alcohol consumption. One patient made precisely this point:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘If it’s explained in a better way</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that it’s not going to interfere with what’s going on</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and there are some benefits for people next down the line… I think people need to see a face to have that reassurance that we are going to mind you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">we’re looking after you</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you’ll still be under our wing… The key point is if you can get the information in a simpler language because</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I’m not belittling anyone</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but when you’ve drank as much as we drink</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">your brain cells aren’t the best at retaining information</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">where a one-to-one conversation</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it goes in</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you remember… but somebody just giving you a pamphlet</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it doesn’t register</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR1402)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Staff explained that, because of environmental context and resources, it is not always possible to meet patients face-to-face at the point of them being found to be eligible for the trial, and identified strategies to maximise success for research recruitment when ‘cold calling’:</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘It’ll be beneficial if the consultant can mention the trial to the [patient] … so that I don’t just call out of the blue</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">So</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">what I do now</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I send them a letter</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and then follow up with a call</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">so that it doesn’t come as a shock to them</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>This also adds to the idea of creating rather than just adding on to <italic toggle="yes">“a natural rhythm”</italic> (QR0500). Some patients went on to explain that their view of the acceptability of the trial was influenced by the fact that they had an existing relationship with, and confidence in, the team providing the information about the trial:</p>

                <p>This social influence was echoed by staff, who stated <italic toggle="yes">‘a lot of it is human interaction and familiarity</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and these kinds of relationships’ (QR0500)</italic>. The experience of taking part in the research was described as a <italic toggle="yes">‘two-way street’</italic> whereby it’s about <italic toggle="yes">‘giving a little bit back’</italic> as well as receiving personal gains (QR1402). Many of the patients who agreed to participate in the trial explained their decision was influenced by a desire to contribute, and to show appreciation for the clinical team by giving something back:</p>

                <p>This was echoed in staff recollections of patient’s reasons for participation:</p>

                <title>Theme 2: Staff attitudes, knowledge &amp; capacity</title>
                <p>The theme ‘staff attitudes, knowledge and capacity’ describes factors identified by staff that complement and sit alongside the patient data. Staff attitudes and their perceived value of research, as well as views on specific features of a clinical trial like the treatment being offered or trial design and conduct, influence the level of staff engagement with research. A consultant hepatologist explained the benefit of providing evidence for treatment and stated that the BOPPP trial has identified ‘<italic toggle="yes">an important question for patients</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and an important question for physicians’</italic> (QR0500). Some staff argued that all patients should have access to research, while others reflected on the importance of the research, beliefs about consequences, and the opportunity that the trial provides for treatment:</p>

                <p>Some staff went on to explain the value of the treatment; a research nurse with clinical experience in hepatology stated:</p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>One research nurse explained that the phase of the clinical trial often influences the level of commitment from clinicians to support research because phase IV trials (like BOPPP) are <italic toggle="yes">‘not new</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">big and exciting’</italic>:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘Yesterday I spoke to a consultant who will be working on a trial with us</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and he said</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">‘well I just work on commercial trials’</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">And I said</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">‘we’ve all done that</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">honey</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">But this</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">is aimed at changing practice</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and it’s looking at patients who normally fly under the radar and don’t get looked at because they’re not interesting’</italic>,</p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>However, for others the intervention being offered in the trial was perceived as easy <italic toggle="yes">‘because it’s actually already a tried and regular medication that you use for Grade 2 varices</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">So</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it’s not like a completely new drug that we don’t know the side effects of or anything’</italic> (QR0300).

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘I quite like BOPPP in the sense that you get a bit more time to spend with the patients… you get a bit more of a chance to screen patients properly</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">spend time with them</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">arrange appointments and pursue their needs</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Staff views on patient eligibility and predicting patient suitability also influenced who they recruited: <italic toggle="yes">‘It’s one thing</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">a patient being eligible</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but you need to take into consideration whether they’re suitable as well’</italic> (QR0900). One staff member explained the priority to have ‘good database’ with fewer research participants who were likely to engage with the research for the duration of the trial:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>‘I <italic toggle="yes">know we need the numbers for research</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but we rather have good patients… but keep them for all the three years and have a good database</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Another staff member explained:</p>

                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘Whenever you aim to recruit a fairly high number of patients</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">this is more like real life data… some of the patients do not turn up to their follow up appointment</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">do not turn up to their ultrasound scan appointment</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and this is basically a real-life problem</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Some staff explained that in their view it was important to recruit selectively, where patients who are active in their own care are prioritised for research and factors such as compliance with medication and appointment attendance are considered before approaching other eligible patients for participation:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘Because</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">although someone might be eligible</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it’s whether they’re suitable…</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">There’s no point in recruiting somebody to a trial in which they need to take a medication for which</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">in the past or currently</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">that they don’t take it</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">or they take it sporadically</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">when they want</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">When it’s a trial</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you have to know that they’re compliant with it… [and] we don’t want to recruit patients who will drop on us after one week</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they don’t come for one week appointment’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Staff across sites described research as <italic toggle="yes">an extra hassle</italic>, especially for patients who have other demands like caring responsibilities and work commitments (QR0600) and another stated, <italic toggle="yes">‘also people are quite reluctant</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">the chaotic lifestyle doesn’t help</italic> (QR1200). However, some staff spoke about the need to engage ‘the other’ demographic:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘We’ve had other patients who we’ve spoken to about it with</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and haven’t responded to follow-up calls</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">or haven’t made the one-week appointment from that demographic</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I think we need to</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">as a site</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">think about strategies about how we engage a bit better with that group’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>One staff member explained how a relationship of trust is necessary for patients to engage with research:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘There’s one patient I scoped last week who had grade one varices but was dependent on alcohol and was quite a sort of chaotic individual</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">was trying to cut down but was struggling</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and struggled with clinic appointments</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and was very anxious and I haven’t ruled out inviting her completely</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">but even getting her on to the endoscopy was such a big deal… The trust is so fragile any way that you need to do one thing at a time</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Some staff held the view that a commitment to trial participation meant asking more of patients. This was particularly challenging for those who felt there were risks to providing extra clinical input in stable disease, and where there is also chance of beta-blocker side effects on quality of life:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘There are challenges in prescribing non-selective beta blockers because they can make people feel a bit rubbish</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and so you need to know that you’re doing it for good reason</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">You’re often treating patients</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">particularly with this stage of disease</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">who are working</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they’re often young patients with family commitments</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">And you’re prescribing a medication that can potentially affect energy levels</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sleep</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">erectile function</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">things that matter to our patient cohort</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR0500)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Staff explained how knowledge, experience and skills, and the beliefs they have about their capabilities influence trial recruitment. In particular, staff knowledge of the eligibility criteria, the speciality, the proposed intervention, research processes influence the ability of staff to recruit to the trial. Alongside knowledge, confidence and ability to screen and identify patients and to communicate effectively and to be able to answer questions and provide accurate information was also highlighted as an influence. For example, screening was identified as ‘relatively labour intensive’, complicated when staff are not familiar with the speciality:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘The screening has been quite tricky for our research coordinators because they’re not specialist liver research coordinators</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">they’re general research coordinators</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">They haven’t done any liver work before</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">So</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">I’m doing a lot of the screening and going through the initial exclusion-inclusion criteria</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">just because they haven’t learnt it… so it’s mostly me because the research team don’t currently feel confident enough to discuss the pros and cons of the medication</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">whereas obviously it’s something I do at clinic all the time</italic></p>
                  <p>(QR0200)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Staff capacity, fitting BOPPP into existing workloads, and prioritising tasks when working on between one and fifteen studies were identified as recruitment influences. Some staff stated that they do not have protected time for different research studies they are working on:</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p><italic toggle="yes">‘We just balance it around our other work</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Like</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">you know</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">screening and things like approaching patients</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">We don’t have a specified time for it</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">no</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">’</italic></p>

                </disp-quote>
                <p>Other staff work over multiple specialties and do not have the specific experience like dedicated liver research staff:</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The findings consist of five overarching themes: i) <italic toggle="yes">patient risks and benefits</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ii) staff attitudes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">knowledge</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and capacity</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">iii) team-based approach</italic>, iv) <italic toggle="yes">organisational context</italic> and v) <italic toggle="yes">trial collective</italic>. Each of the themes can be largely mapped onto dealing with i) patient, ii) staff, iii) team, iv) organisational or v) trial level influences pointing to the need to develop a whole-systems approach to recruitment. Individual staff, local teams (i.e., shared views and goals, team communication and co-ordination of tasks), and the support of the organisation (i.e., workflows, resources, culture, and leadership) influence the success of RCT recruitment. Identified patient-level barriers and facilitators (i.e., finding out about the trial, timing) outline the attention and support required for patients, and <italic toggle="yes">trial collective</italic> (i.e., feeling a part of the team across sites) acknowledges the attention and support required for staff to enable successful recruitment. Although support that optimises patient participation in trials is well documented [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], this identification of higher-level staff attention and support (across organisations) is new.</p>
              <p>While the findings can be mapped to the TDF domains, and compliment and align with existing literature on factors that influence RCT recruitment, knowledge is also extended by identifying the importance of the overall trial context, that is the specific population, condition and/or treatment being offered [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To optimise recruitment, trial teams must consider their context, and understand and respond to their patient population and condition, accounting for specific vulnerabilities that the patient group may have. In the case of the BOPPP trial, the patient group is dominated by alcohol-related cirrhosis with a risk of variceal bleeding, sometimes leading to fatal consequences for patients. Our findings identify trust as a non-TDF domain and demonstrate that the context of a caring, existing clinical relationship supports successful recruitment; staff are invested, responsive and aware of the specific risks and want to find solutions for patients. This finding challenges previous concerns about the impact of research participation on the clinical relationship. Pragmatic trials, that is trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in real-life practice, especially those involving unpredictable populations require staff expertise in building trust, and a deep knowledge of the patient group and their vulnerabilities. A collegiate approach to trial recruitment is essential to support staff in their endeavour [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>RCT recruitment is also more successful when research visits align with what a staff member identified as the natural rhythm of care. If a trial is introduced when the patient doesn’t have capacity to think about it (i.e., too soon after diagnosis) or asks the patient for extra action when it is burdensome (i.e., managing health needs), there is disruption to the natural rhythm. Therefore, the rightness of timing in terms of environmental context and resources as well as when people are receptive to information, to engagement and to action (beliefs about consequences/capabilities/emotion) impacts the success of recruitment [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For the BOPPP trial, some patients were eager for information and action, and it fitted with their need to do something for themselves and/or for others. Stigma is common among patients with cirrhosis, often resulting in decreased healthcare-seeking behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, our findings challenge this notion, and suggest that in some situations, where people might perceive that blame and shame are attached to their condition, a feeling of helping oneself, as well as being seen to help oneself provides an impetus for being involved in research. Where this is possible, patients who take part in research feel valued and staff value having more time to spend with patients. Alongside this, ongoing feedback and communication enables patients to remain involved (also supporting trial retention). Previous research also identifies a willingness to help others and to contribute towards furthering medical knowledge as reasons to be involved in participating in trials [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite this, not all patients are informed about research opportunities. Staff <italic toggle="yes">goals</italic> and views on the value of research, that is, a patient’s right to be informed of research opportunities, influence their priority of informing patients about research opportunities. Staff <italic toggle="yes">knowledge</italic> and understanding (to provide a correct explanation of trial processes and rationale), the <italic toggle="yes">environmental context and resources</italic> (such as having time to be available at clinic appointments and being mindful of at what point in the system the information is given), and <italic toggle="yes">social influences</italic> (such as having existing relationships with patients) influence the ability and <italic toggle="yes">skill</italic> of staff to support patients to understand the trial information (thereby supporting patient <italic toggle="yes">memory</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">attention</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">decision processes</italic>) before patients can make a decision whether or not to take part. Staff <italic toggle="yes">beliefs of consequences</italic> for patients (for example, impact on quality of life (positive or negative) and <italic toggle="yes">of patient capabilities</italic> (for example, their views of the ability of patients to engage with research when managing existing health needs) will determine whether they inform patients about the research and give them the opportunity to participate. Alongside eligibility, patient suitability is determined by staff. This is an important insight, because on the one hand, being involved in research is a right of care, and benefits all patients by involving them more directly in their own care, yet on the other hand those patients who are already well-engaged and active in their own care are prioritised and approached for recruitment. The opportunity to benefit from research should be open to all which will mean challenging implicit biases, taking time with recruitment, and possibly accepting a lower retention rate. Pragmatic results are needed to capture the impact for all patients, and not just those who are considered suitable, to reflect the real-world unbiased patient population we are trying to evaluate and serve. The focus on suitability in terms of selection strategy to improve study adherence e.g., <italic toggle="yes">a good database</italic> also places emphasis on patients in terms of the failure of potential retention and not on trial design or the imbalance of power in making the decision of whether or not to take part.</p>
              <p>While the use of the TDF is established in healthcare implementation projects, its use in research environments is novel, the implications for using the TDF to inform behaviour change interventions in trial recruitment is new, and could have wider implications in other RCTs [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The findings informed the development of a recruitment strategy to support improvements in existing recruitment practices and addressed the need for additional behaviour change interventions to optimise recruitment to the BOPPP trial [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interventions were proposed at individual staff (training, newsletter, video updates e.g., to address concerns of staff re: challenges of asking more of patients who are living asymptomatically or of prescribing NSBBs in this patient group), team (central team call-in (fortnightly contact between the lead trial team and each local site to forge links and support the development of individual-site BOPPP team meetings)), organisational (NIHR PI Associate Scheme to support leadership and develop and up-skill sub-investigators) and across sites (regional BOPPP meetings (linking with CRN network regions)) and BOPPP-wide study days (to create a learning collaborative, share best practices and tips, to network, and provide an opportunity for reflection across sites).</p>
              <sec id="sec022">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>While the paper extends previous research by exploring patient and recruiting staff perspectives and experiences, it is important to note that the findings are specific to the BOPPP trial and are not empirically generalisable. It is possible, however, to enhance transferability by describing the research context and assumptions, and by making connections between the analysis of participants accounts and claims in the extant literature. It is also important to note, that despite focused efforts to purposively recruit patient participants from minority ethnic backgrounds, experiences of those from these groups are underrepresented. This recruitment difficulty is echoed in literature where it is reported that those from ethnic minorities are less likely to participate in research [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While we were unable to specifically explore ethnic variations and barriers to trial recruitment, we found that researcher bias and judgement of patient suitability dictated those who are prioritised for recruitment. Another possible reason for non-participation is the risk that asking patients to take part in an additional qualitative study may inadvertently alienate them from their enrolment/retention in the clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Staff also reported that the quality of relationships with patients is sometimes impacted by language barriers. Future strategies such as availability of interpreters, linguistic and ethnic matching, and an awareness of cultural practices and norms provide possible options for addressing these barriers [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
                <p>Telephone interviews have received criticism for compromising interviewer/participant rapport and interaction, and for limiting contextual data due to the absence of face-to-face contact and visual cues [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this method of data collection is convenient, in that it is flexible (in terms of time, location), and allows for a wide reach (e.g., accessing BOPPP sites across the UK). This method was also invaluable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where telephone interviews were conducted during lockdown with patients classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. The anonymity of telephone use can also allow participants to disclose sensitive information and there is no evidence to suggest that they produce lower quality data [<xref rid="pone.0263288.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A strength of the study is the thorough and systematic application of qualitative methods, including triangulation with staff and patient perspectives, and the use of the TDF to inform data collection, analysis, and theoretically driven recruitment strategies. This qualitative study provides support for the comprehensiveness and inclusivity of the TDF, demonstrating its value in use with patient/public populations in research environments exploring influences and determinants of behaviour.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>The study used a theory-informed approach to gain new insights into improving clinical trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices by mapping the findings to the TDF domains. The TDF provides a useful, flexible framework for identifying influences on patient and staff recruitment behaviours. A whole-systems approach to recruitment is required with a focus on the overarching trial context to ensure patient and staff support needs are met and recruitment is optimised.</p>

If the need for consent was waived by the ethics committee, please include this information.</p>
              <p>4. Thank you for stating the following in the Acknowledgments Section of your manuscript:</p>
              <p>“We would like to thank all patients and staff who participated in this study and who generously gave their time and honest thoughts. We are very grateful to the local BOPPP research teams that helped to recruit participants and supported the qualitative study. This article presents independent research funded by NIHR Health Technology Assessment (17/32/04). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.”</p>
              <p>We note that you have provided funding information that is not currently declared in your Funding Statement. However, funding information should not appear in the Acknowledgments section or other areas of your manuscript. We will only publish funding information present in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form.</p>
              <p>Please remove any funding-related text from the manuscript and let us know how you would like to update your Funding Statement. Currently, your Funding Statement reads as follows:</p>
              <p>“This article presents independent research funded by NIHR Health Technology Assessment (17/32/04). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.”</p>
              <p>Please include your amended statements within your cover letter; we will change the online submission form on your behalf.</p>
              <p>5. We note that you have stated that you will provide repository information for your data at acceptance.

              <p>6. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please delete it from any other section.</p>
              <p>7. Please upload a copy of Figure 1, to which you refer in your text on page 7. If the figure is no longer to be included as part of the submission please remove all reference to it within the text.</p>
              <p>8. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly.

If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>
              <p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
              <p>Boutillier et al. performed a study, “Using a theory-informed approach to explore patient and staff perspectives on factors that influence clinical trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small oesophageal varices” in which they assess the patients and staffs perspectives on factors that influence the recruitment of patients in the clinical trial, and they show that theory informed approach provides a useful, flexible framework for identifying influences on patient and staff recruitment behaviors. In my opinion, this study can be further improved by incorporating the following point:</p>
              <p>1. More points regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial will enhance the study.</p>
              <p>2. It can be beneficial in mentioning what kind of questions were asked in interview along with mentioning the results of the participants.</p>
              <p>3. Mentioning more personal comments from the patients or staff or team members regarding individual subthemes can enhance the study further.</p>

              </p>
              <p>We have removed the reference to Figure 1 from the manuscript for clarity. The stages of recruitment are illustrated in Supplementary information 1 (S1) (attached as a separate file).</p>
              <p>We have checked the permissions regarding data sharing, and have amended our data availability statement: </p>
              <p>This study uses data (containing potentially identifying and/or sensitive information) collected from a small group of staff participants and a vulnerable patient population, and involves indirect identifiers (such as sex, ethnicity, location, etc.) that may risk the identification of study participants. Sharing data outside of the anonymised excerpts and quotations included in the paper will violate the agreement to which the participants consented. </p>
              <p>Thank you very much for reviewing this manuscript. Please find responses to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s) below. All changes to the manuscript are highlighted with track changes. </p>
              <p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p>
              <p>We have checked PLOS ONE’s style requirements and have changed the supplementary information file names to meet the requirements. </p>
              <p>2. When reporting the results of qualitative research, we suggest consulting the COREQ guidelines. In this case, please consider including more information on the number of interviewers, their training and characteristics; and please provide the interview guide used.</p>
              <p>We have used the COREQ guidelines to report the study – and re-attach the checklist. We have included information on the number of interviewers and the two interview schedules are included in supplementary information 2. We have highlighted where this information is available in the text using bold. We have extended the information to include the training and characteristics of the interviewer (page 7).</p>
              <p>3. Please provide additional details regarding participant consent. In the ethics statement in the Methods and online submission information, please ensure that you have specified whether consent was written or verbal/oral. If consent was verbal/oral, please specify: 1) whether the ethics committee approved the verbal/oral consent procedure, 2) why written consent could not be obtained, and 3) how verbal/oral consent was recorded. </p>
              <p>We have included additional information regarding participant consent – and clarified that patients were offered face-to-face or telephone interviews. We have confirmed that ethical approval was obtained to allow for written and verbal consent and have outlined the procedures (page 7).</p>
              <p>4. Thank you for stating the following in the Acknowledgments Section of your manuscript:</p>
              <p>“We would like to thank all patients and staff who participated in this study and who generously gave their time and honest thoughts.

              <p>We have removed all funding information from the manuscript and ensured the funding information in the Funding Statement section of the online submission form is correct.</p>
              <p>“This article presents independent research funded by NIHR Health Technology Assessment (17/32/04). The views expressed are those of the author(s) and not necessarily those of the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.”</p>

If you wish to make changes to your Data Availability statement, please describe these changes in your cover letter and we will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide.</p>
              <p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We would like the data availability statement to read: </p>
              <p>The data that supports the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author [CL] upon reasonable request.</p>
              <p>6. Your ethics statement should only appear in the Methods section of your manuscript. If your ethics statement is written in any section besides the Methods, please delete it from any other section.</p>
              <p>We have checked the manuscript and the ethics information is only included in the methods section. </p>
              <p>7. Please upload a copy of Figure 1, to which you refer in your text on page 7. If the figure is no longer to be included as part of the submission please remove all reference to it within the text.</p>
              <p>Figure 1 has now been uploaded as supplementary information file 1.</p>
              <p>8. Please include captions for your Supporting Information files at the end of your manuscript, and update any in-text citations to match accordingly. Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript. If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article’s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p>
              <p>We have included captions for the supplementary files (S1-S3) at the end of the manuscript. We have reviewed the reference list to ensure it is complete and correct. We have not made any changes to the reference list. </p>
              <p>9. More points regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial will enhance the study.</p>
              <p>This information has now been included (page 3).</p>
              <p>10. It can be beneficial in mentioning what kind of questions were asked in interview along with mentioning the results of the participants.</p>
              <p>We have outlined patient questions in the text and have highlighted where this information is available in the text using bold. We have added information about the kind of questions asked in staff interviews (p.7). The interview schedules are included in Supplementary information file 2. </p>
              <p>11. Mentioning more personal comments from the patients or staff or team members regarding individual subthemes can enhance the study further.</p>
              <p>Because of space limitations, the sub-theme findings have been reported within the overarching theme. For example, one sub-theme of patient risks and benefits is acceptability of the trial. This is illustrated by data that explains how a three-year commitment influenced patients’ choice of whether to enrol in the trial (p.17). Another example is the perceived value of BOPPP and views to research as a sub-theme of staff attitude (page 20-21).</p>
              <p>We hope that these responses and changes make the paper suitable for publication in PLOS ONE.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: Providing the best possible approach for improving RCT recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small esophageal varices is of great importance. This is an excellent question, where theory-informed approach will provide new insights into improving trial recruitment for patients with cirrhosis and small esophageal varices. Analysis is well done and manuscript reads well.</p>
              <p>I have several suggestions to the current version of manuscript</p>
              <p>1. The authors should address issue of cultural factors and recruitment of ethnically diverse participants. This is critical issue; cultural and ethnic barriers might need more considerations. If data is not available on diverse participants, authors can use articles from literature to discuss more about this issue in the discussion section.</p>
              <p>2. Similarly, authors should also discuss the issue of relationship between recruiter and study participants, which could be impacted by lingual, cultural and ethnic barriers in more culturally and ethnically diversified trials</p>
              <p>3. Word “Registrar” in Table 3 may need more clarity for international readers.</p>
              <p>4. Education levels in Table 2 are categorized as “Full-time education”, “Further education”, “Higher education”. “Post-graduate education”. These names of classification read vague, examples within bracket in fact provide more helpful information. Renaming each of levels of literacy may help bringing more clarity.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Thank you very much for reviewing this manuscript. Please find responses to each point raised by the reviewer(s) below. All changes to the manuscript are highlighted with track changes. </p>
              <p>1. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>We have conducted a qualitative study and have therefore not performed any statistical analysis. </p>
              <p>2. The authors should address issue of cultural factors and recruitment of ethnically diverse participants. This is critical issue; cultural and ethnic barriers might need more considerations. If data is not available on diverse participants, authors can use articles from literature to discuss more about this issue in the discussion section.</p>
              <p>We have included this information in the Limitations section of the Discussion – and below for your reference (page 33). </p>
              <p>It is also important to note, that despite focused efforts to purposively recruit patient participants from minority ethnic backgrounds, experiences of those from these groups are underrepresented. This recruitment difficulty is echoed in literature where it is reported that those from ethnic minorities are less likely to participate in research (Smart &amp; Harrison, 2016). While we were unable to specifically explore ethnic variations and barriers to trial recruitment, we found that researcher bias and judgement of patient suitability dictated those who are prioritised for recruitment. Another possible reason for non-participation is the risk that asking patients to take part in an additional qualitative study may inadvertently alienate them from their enrolment/retention in the clinical trial (Liu et al, 2011). Staff also reported that the quality of relationships with patients is sometimes impacted by language barriers. Future strategies such as availability of interpreters, linguistic and ethnic matching, and an awareness of cultural practices and norms provide possible options for addressing these barriers (Masood et al, 2019).</p>
              <p>3. Similarly, authors should also discuss the issue of relationship between recruiter and study participants, which could be impacted by lingual, cultural and ethnic barriers in more culturally and ethnically diversified trials. </p>
              <p>Thank you for this important point. We have added the need to the impact of the recruiter-study participant relationship (text above) in the discussion (page 33).</p>
              <p>4. The word “Registrar” in Table 3 may need more clarity for international readers.</p>
              <p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. A speciality registrar is a doctor who is working as part of a training programme in the UK. We have added this definition in brackets for clarification (page 11).</p>
              <p>5. Education levels in Table 2 are categorized as “Full-time education”, “Further education”, “Higher education”. “Post-graduate education”. These names of classification read vague, examples within bracket in fact provide more helpful information. Renaming each of levels of literacy may help bringing more clarity. </p>
              <p>We have added examples within brackets next to each category label (Page 10). </p>
              <p>6. When reporting the results of qualitative research, we suggest consulting the COREQ guidelines. In this case, please consider including more information on the number of interviewers, their training and characteristics; and please provide the interview guide used.</p>
              <p>We have used the COREQ guidelines to report the study – and re-attach the checklist. We have included information on the number of interviewers and the two interview schedules are included in supplementary information 2. We have highlighted where this information is available in the text using bold. We have extended the information to include the training and characteristics of the interviewer (page 8).</p>
