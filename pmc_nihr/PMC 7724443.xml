                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Return to work (RTW) is achieved by less than 50% of stroke survivors. The rising incidence of stroke among younger people, the UK economic forecast, and clinical drivers highlight the need for stroke survivors to receive support with RTW. However, evidence for this type of support is lacking. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) will investigate whether Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) plus usual care (UC) (i.e. usual NHS rehabilitation) is more clinically and cost-effective for supporting post-stroke RTW, than UC alone.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Seven hundred sixty stroke survivors and their carers will be recruited from approximately 20 NHS stroke services. A 5:4 allocation ratio will be employed to randomise participants to receive ESSVR plus UC, or UC alone. The individually tailored ESSVR intervention will commence within 12 weeks of stroke onset and be delivered for up to 12 months as necessary by trained RETAKE occupational therapists in the community, participants’ homes or workplaces, and outpatient/inpatient therapy settings, via telephone, email, or SMS text message. Outcome data will be collected via self-report questionnaires administered by post or online at 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome will be self-reported RTW and job retention at 12 months (minimum 2 h/week). Secondary outcomes will include mood, function, participation, health-related quality of life, confidence, intervention compliance, health and social care resource use, and mortality. An embedded economic evaluation will estimate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspectives. An embedded process evaluation will employ a mixed methods approach to explore ESSVR implementation, contextual factors linked to outcome variation, and factors affecting NHS roll-out.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">This article describes the protocol for a multi-centre RCT evaluating the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of an early vocational rehabilitation intervention aimed at supporting adults to return to work following a stroke. Evidence favouring the ESSVR intervention would support its roll-out in NHS settings.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par36">The UK incidence of stroke has increased among younger people, with an estimated 41% occurring among those aged under 69 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nearly two thirds of stroke survivors are discharged with a residual disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], resulting from physical, cognitive, and/or language impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Return to work (RTW) is a major goal for many stroke survivors, but less than 50% of those working at stroke onset return [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], often due to the limitations posed by residual disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], their beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], employer attitudes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and access to timely rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Vocational rehabilitation (VR) is a process that supports those disadvantaged by illness or disability to access, return to, and maintain employment or another useful occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Work is essential for supporting health, wellbeing, and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and protects against social exclusion by providing an income, social interaction, a core role, identity, and purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Conversely, long-term worklessness has been linked to increased risk of depression, suicide, reduced quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and health-harming behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The societal cost of stroke has been estimated at £26 billion per year, including £8.6 billion for health and social care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These costs will likely increase due to strokes occurring at earlier ages, improvements in survival rates, and changes in retirement age provisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The effects on the UK economy may be further compounded by rises in unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The need for support for stroke survivors with RTW is already recognised in policy and clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and is considered a UK government priority and National Health Service (NHS) outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Despite this, there has been little evidence reported for the effectiveness of post-stroke VR interventions. A systematic review (2011) of VR post-stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] identified only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) in the United States (US) (<italic>N</italic> = 22, 7 people with stroke) that used a case-coordination approach, leading to 64% employment compared to 36% in usual care (UC) at 6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In a subsequent RCT in South Africa (<italic>N</italic> = 94), a 6-week workplace intervention delivered by an occupational therapist (OT) and physiotherapist led to 60% employment at 6 months compared with 20% in UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, both RCTs were conducted in non-UK settings with small sample sizes; an adequately powered RCT is needed to replicate the results in UK NHS settings.</p>
                <p id="Par38">Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation (ESSVR) was developed from VR practice recommendations in acquired brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and guidance from stroke specialists, VR experts, and stroke survivors. ESSVR combines conventional OT with case coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and is intended for delivery in the community as often as required by individuals, as determined by a stroke specialist OT with additional VR training. ESSVR includes the following: (a) assessing stroke impact on the person and their job; (b) educating individuals, employers, and families about stroke impact on work, and strategies to lessen impact (e.g. memory aids, fatigue management); (c) work preparation, including opportunities to practice work skills; and (d) liaison with employers and employment advisors to plan and monitor a phased return to work (RTW).</p>
                <p id="Par39">In a single-centre feasibility RCT, ESSVR was compared to usual NHS rehabilitation (UC) in previously employed stroke survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In total, 46 out of 92 eligible participants agreed to participate (36 men, mean = 56 years, SD = 12.7). Among these, 34 (74%) had mild-to-moderate strokes, and 32 (70%) were followed up at 12 months follow-up. The study showed it is possible to recruit from an acute stroke unit, randomise to the trial, deliver ESSVR, and measure its effects and costs at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke. In the ESSVR group, twice as many people were in work at 12 months post-stroke than with UC, and those in work were less depressed, suggesting potential health benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, this was a small single-centre feasibility RCT, so it is unknown whether observed differences were related to ESSVR or due to chance.</p>
                <p id="Par40">The rising incidence of stroke among younger adults, the UK economic forecast, and clinical drivers highlight the need for stroke survivors to receive support with RTW. However, lack of evidence for the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of stroke-specialist VR has hindered the development and commissioning of VR services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In 2015, only 27% of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in the UK commissioned VR services within acute stroke service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. An adequately powered multi-centre study is needed to inform the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of ESSVR and UC, alongside a process evaluation (methods to be reported elsewhere) exploring contextual factors affecting clinical implementation and RTW outcomes. Evidence in favour of the ESSVR intervention would support its roll-out within the NHS.</p>
                <p id="Par41">The aim of the RETAKE trial is to evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of ESSVR (plus UC) versus UC alone for helping people return to work after stroke. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between ESSVR (plus UC) versus UC alone.</p>

                <p id="Par42">The primary objective of this study is to establish whether ESSVR (plus UC) is more effective than UC alone for improving participants’ self-reported RTW (≥ 2 h per week) at 12 months post-randomisation.</p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par49">This trial protocol has been reported in line with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. RETAKE is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups, and a partially nested trial design with embedded internal pilot and economic and process evaluations. The internal pilot will include 8 sites and will assess whether progression criteria thresholds are met for recruitment rates after 6 months of recruitment and for follow-up rates after 12 months of recruitment (see the ‘<xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">Recruitment {15}</xref>’ section for further details).</p>
                <p id="Par50">The intervention arm will receive ESSVR in addition to UC, and the intervention will be delivered by ESSVR-trained OTs. This approach has been taken to demonstrate it is feasible to provide the ESSVR intervention as part of routine care across the wider NHS, if benefit is demonstrated. Participants in the UC only arm will receive UC provided by primary care, secondary care, community, and social services.</p>

The 2-day face-to-face training package includes provision of an ESSVR manual, clinical scenarios, and case studies to support learning for the delivery of ESSVR. The RETAKE OTs will be briefed via group discussion and case studies on the trial’s design, paperwork to be completed, and issues relating to delivery of the intervention within the trial context. Throughout the study duration, RETAKE OTs will receive a 1-day refresher training day, monthly group mentoring sessions, and ad hoc individualised support via email or telephone.</p>

In this study, the primary outcome will be self-reported return to work of ≥ 2 h per week at 12 months post-randomisation, including pre-stroke or new work roles. It will be measured via a positive response to the question, ‘Are you currently in work (paid or unpaid) for at least 2 h per week?’</p>
                <p id="Par95">Return to education was removed as part of the primary outcome following inspection of data from the feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], where only two participants were full-time students at stroke onset, and following consultation with the Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group. To reflect this change, the RETAKE trial’s inclusion criteria were amended to increase the age of eligibility from 16 to 18 years, excluding those in full-time education (and not employed) prior to their stroke.</p>
                <p id="Par96">The secondary outcomes will be self-reported at 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomisation, and will include return to with the same employer (yes/no, including self-employed work), mean number of hours worked (to be recorded as a proportion of the pre-stroke working hours), total number of days in work, mood, functional ability, social participation, health-related quality of life, health and social care resource use, work self-efficacy, and confidence.</p>

Following admission into a stroke service, screening, informed consent, and baseline assessments will be completed within 12 weeks of stroke onset, prior to randomisation and allocation. The ESSVR intervention will commence within 2 weeks post-randomisation, and last as long as needed up to 12 months post-randomisation. The start and end dates within the UC control group will likely vary, dependent on the usual NHS rehabilitation provided by each stroke service. Self-reported follow-up questionnaires will be completed by all participants and nominated carers at 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomisation.

It accounts for 20% loss to follow-up and clustering in the intervention arm to account for therapist effects (11 recruited per RETAKE OT, 2 RETAKE OTs per site, 20 sites, intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.03, inflation factor 1.234). Clustering will only exist in the intervention arm to account for between-therapist effects. An ICC of 0.03 has been assumed, given that standardised training and manuals for delivering the intervention will minimise the ICC. A review of similar trials supports an assumption of an ICC no greater than 0.03 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p>

Analyses will be completed by the CTRU statisticians using SAS software. Descriptive data (e.g. total numbers of screened patients, patients eligible for participation, those providing consent, reasons for non-entry) will be reported. Baseline characteristics for each study arm will be summarised.</p>
                <p id="Par130">The primary analysis will compare the proportions of participants in work at 12 months post-randomisation between arms, using a partially nested logistic regression mixed-effects model accounting for clustering in the intervention arm only, The model will adjust for stratification factors (site, age, EQ5D mobility score, OCS picture naming score, OCS executive task score) as fixed effects. Therapist (for those in intervention arm) and treatment group will be fitted as random effects. If a participant is unable to report their working status, e.g. if they are dead, this will be taken as a negative response to the question. Other missing data will be assumed missing at random for the primary analysis; multiple imputation for handling such missing data will be explored as a sensitivity analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par136">The intervention resource use (comprising training, mentoring, and delivery) will be captured and recorded by the intervention OTs. This will be used to estimate the cost of the training and mentoring components to be used in the main economic evaluation. Levels of wider health, PSS, and societal resource use at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months will be captured using a bespoke resource use questionnaire designed for self-completion (or with help where required). Although intervention delivery costs will be estimated using data captured by the OTs delivering the interventions, these will not be included in the economic evaluation as it was felt by the research team, which includes PPI members, that participants would not be able to distinguish between intervention OT visits and non-intervention OT visits such that participants are going to be asked explicitly to include all visits in their responses to the resource use questions. To avoid the potential for double counting, we will therefore base resource use and costs on patient reported data only with the exception of training and mentoring costs. We will attach published national unit costs using the common recent price year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] to individual-level quantities of resource use and estimate the mean cost per participant incorporating the cost of the intervention and wider healthcare and PSS resource use (primary care, secondary care, emergency care, medications, and social services).

Neither costs nor QALYs will be discounted reflecting the time frame of the trial. Missing data will be handled in line with the approach reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par150">The importance of supporting stroke survivors with RTW is recognised in national policy and clinical guidelines and is a UK government priority and NHS outcome. However, a lack of evidence for the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of stroke-specialist VR has impeded development and commissioning of VR services for this population.</p>
              <p id="Par151">ESSVR is a complex intervention designed to support stroke survivors to access, return to, and maintain working roles in the 12 months following a stroke. A feasibility RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] demonstrated that ESSVR (plus UC) was more effective than UC alone for supporting RTW among stroke survivors, and showed that the intervention could be researched in NHS settings alongside routine care. However, this was a single-centre trial and results were not powered to determine effectiveness. This protocol describes a multi-centre RCT to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of ESSVR plus UC compared with UC alone.</p>
              <p id="Par152">RTW after stroke is considered a key rehabilitation goal and an indicator of recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The National Stroke Programme was developed to achieve the aims of the NHS Long Term Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and highlights that improving access to VR will increase the number of stroke survivors returning to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Despite this, health services do not always routinely provide VR, consider VR to be within their remit, or address stroke-specific deficits that can impede successful RTW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The need for provision of stroke-specialist VR is becoming increasingly important, as there continue to be rises in the incidence of stroke among younger people, retirement age thresholds, and the societal costs of stroke. This need is further compounded by the impending recession and predicted twofold increase in UK unemployment rates resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par153">The National Stroke Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] both recommend that VR be offered to stroke survivors in a timely manner to enable reasonable and necessary adjustments to be made to support their RTW. NICE recommends identifying the demands of the working role and the person’s impairments on work performance, tailoring the VR intervention, educating employers about the Equality Act 2010 and support available, conducting workplace visits, and liaising with employers to establish reasonable accommodations such as phased return or equipment provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The ESSVR intervention incorporates all of the above recommendations, but also includes consideration of adjustments that can be made to work roles/responsibilities, levels of supervision and support, work preparation activities, and education for stroke survivors, employers/co-workers, and families about stroke-specific disabilities.</p>
              <p id="Par154">The lack of an approved VR pathway within local areas has previously resulted in miscommunication, inadequate training and knowledge of stroke and VR, poor cross-service collaboration, and mild stroke patients receiving little or no support to RTW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The ESSVR intervention is innovative because it encourages collaboration across the workplace and acute and community health services, an approach highly recommended in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Occupational therapists delivering the intervention are specially trained to meet the needs of stroke survivors wishing to RTW and encouraged to provide a flexible and responsive service for as long as necessary up to 12 months post-stroke. Individually tailored cross-service interventions of this kind can be more costly in the short-term. However, a pilot study for a similar intervention among people with traumatic brain injuries reported that the mean health costs per person were only £75 greater per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In addition, the long-term cost benefits for this intervention could be high. The 6-year follow-up (19 out of 43 participants) for the feasibility RCT demonstrated that most stroke survivors working at 12 months were still working 6 years later (74%; <italic>n</italic> = 14) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. People who return to and stay in work contribute more to the economy and are less likely to experience and require expensive treatment for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par155">The ESSVR intervention has been designed in accordance with the Medical Research Council’s framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This multi-centre RCT includes an embedded economic evaluation to estimate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from NHS and PSS perspectives. A mixed methods approach will be taken in the process evaluation (reported elsewhere) to identify contextual factors influencing ESSVR implementation, RTW outcomes, and roll-out within NHS stroke rehabilitation services. If the ESSVR intervention was found to be clinically and cost-effective and could be included as part of routine NHS care, it would ensure stroke survivors of working age have a meaningful rehabilitation endpoint (i.e. RTW). RTW will also enable them to develop a sense of purpose, establish routine, improve their self-worth, have greater financial security, increase social contact, and contribute to the economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par156">There are various practical and operational issues to consider in this study. For example, certain trial processes may require adaptation to suit participants’ individual needs, because stroke survivors can experience problems with fatigue, concentration, attention, communication, vision, and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This study includes participants with strokes of varying severities; therefore, research staff will need to be consistently attentive to each participant’s mental capacity and their consent to take part in the study. SMS text reminders and telephone calls will be conducted to support timely completion of self-report follow-up questionnaires, with involvement of carers and/or telephone support where necessary. Potential barriers to intervention delivery and RTW may include lack of participant and/or employer engagement, participants having limited insight into their disabilities, and/or participants’ inability to return to previous working roles. Such issues will be managed on a case-by-case basis through regular discussions between RETAKE OTs and mentors.</p>
              <p id="Par157">Therapists should receive training to equip them for supporting stroke survivors to RTW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In this study, RETAKE OTs will receive a comprehensive 2-day training package including an ESSVR manual, interactive workshops, and refresher days once recruitment has commenced. Tele-mentoring sessions will be provided monthly with additional mentoring support as needed, to support the OTs with clinical reasoning and help to ensure implementation fidelity. Competency assessments at 6 and 12 months into the intervention period will highlight any further training and/or mentoring support needs.</p>
              <p id="Par158">The ESSVR intervention is a bespoke, manualised, early vocational rehabilitation intervention and is not routinely provided within pre-existing VR pathways. To minimise the risk of contamination, a list of recruited participants will be maintained to ensure RETAKE OTs do not treat UC participants referred to their service during the intervention period. Any potential contamination issues will be discussed between RETAKE OTs and mentors and escalated to the Chief Investigator where necessary. Similarly, the RETAKE OTs will be able to receive support from the mentors and central RETAKE team if they experience difficulty—or are unable to deliver the intervention due to personal or practical matters, such as caseload pressures, sickness, and maternity leave. By offering this support, mentors and/or the central RETAKE team will be able to protect the health and wellbeing of the RETAKE OTs and ensure the participant has ongoing ESSVR throughout the intervention period.</p>
              <p id="Par159">The shift from a single-centre to a multi-centre design also means that extra care will be needed to ensure recruitment staff can recruit eligible participants within 12 weeks of their stroke. Prior to set-up, site initiation visits and telephone meetings will be conducted with therapy managers and other relevant staff to ensure the site is able to deliver the intervention. Staffing levels, recruitment targets, and securing of backfill funding for local RETAKE staff time will be included as topics of discussion during such meetings.</p>
              <p id="Par160">The rising incidence of stroke among younger people, the UK’s economic forecast, and clinical drivers highlight the need for stroke survivors to receive support to RTW. This RCT is a component of a programme of work aimed at investigating the implementation of ESSVR among stroke survivors of working age. Evidence for the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of ESSVR would align with political and clinical guidelines and support its roll-out within NHS settings.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par161">Protocol version 5.0, 18 February 2020. Recruitment for the study commenced in May 2018 and was planned for 26 months. Challenges in trial delivery and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that recruitment was halted. The recruitment completion date is currently under review, but it is estimated that this will take place in December 2020.</p>
