                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Globally, around 13% of children experience dental anxiety (DA). This group of patients frequently miss dental appointments, have greater reliance on treatment under general anaesthesia (GA) and have poorer oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) than their non-dentally anxious peers. Recently, a low-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based, self-help approach has been recommended for management of childhood anxiety disorders. A feasibility study conducted in secondary care found this guided self-help CBT resource reduced DA and a randomised controlled trial was recommended. The present study aims to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a guided self-help CBT intervention to reduce DA in children attending primary dental care sites compared to usual care.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This 4-year randomised controlled trial will involve 600 children (aged 9–16 years) and their parent/carers in 30 UK primary dental care sites. At least two dental professionals will participate in each site. They will be assigned, using random allocation, to receive the CBT training and deliver the intervention or to deliver usual care. Children with DA attending these sites, in need of treatment, will be randomly allocated to be treated either by the intervention (CBT) or control (usual care) dental professional. Children will complete questionnaires relating to DA, OHRQoL and HRQoL before treatment, immediately after treatment completion and 12 months post-randomisation. Attendance, need for sedation/GA and costs of the two different approaches will be compared. The primary outcome, DA, will be measured using the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale. Scores will be compared between groups using a linear mixed model.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Treating dentally anxious patients can be challenging and costly. Consequently, these children are frequently referred to specialist services for pharmacological interventions. Longer waiting times and greater travel distances may then compound existing healthcare inequalities. This research will investigate whether the intervention has the potential to reduce DA and improve oral health outcomes in children over their life-course, as well as upskilling primary dental healthcare professionals to better manage this patient group.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par35">Dental anxiety (DA) is common with a prevalence of 13% in adolescents globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Children with DA are more likely to miss or delay dental appointments until they experience pain or infection. Consequently, children with DA have worse oral health and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) than their non-dentally anxious counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dental anxiety often continues into adulthood and anxious children are more likely to become symptomatic users of dental services when adults, if their DA is not addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par36">Treating dentally anxious patients can be challenging and costly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Basic techniques such as ‘tell-show-do’ may be insufficient to manage children’s DA with the need for some to be referred by their primary dental practitioner to specialist paediatric services for treatment with pharmacological interventions (sedation, general anaesthesia [GA]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Referrals for pharmacological interventions can result in children with DA having to wait longer, prolonging symptoms and needing to travel further for dental treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, this creates additional potential barriers to dental care and can contribute to further increasing healthcare inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Children who receive dental treatment under GA also continue to be at high risk of poor oral health and DA in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Dental extractions remain the most common reason for a hospital admission for children in England. In 2018/19, there were 59,011 admissions to hospital for dental extractions in children (0–19 years) costing around £50 million, with DA being one of the most common reasons why the dental treatment could not be performed in primary dental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par37">Greater effort should therefore be directed towards interventions that can reduce a patient’s DA in the long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Psychological interventions, such as psychologist-led cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), have shown promising results in reducing DA in adults in terms of effectiveness, acceptability and long-term benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the costs and availability of expert psychologists prohibit its widespread use and it is not feasible for primary care dentists to deliver complex psychological interventions within the UK National Health Service (NHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To improve access to CBT in primary care a ‘stepped care’ approach can be used. This involves offering children the least intensive form of CBT in the first instance and ‘stepping up’ CBT interventions/support for children whose anxiety does not respond to these low-intensity treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The stepped care approach has been found to be effective in the management of childhood anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2011) recommends CBT-based self-help as part of a stepped care approach for the management of a range of anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, there is very limited evidence about the use of low-intensity CBT self-help interventions delivered by primary care dentists and whether they are effective at reducing children’s DA, thereby reducing the need for referral to specialist services for more complex and costly pharmacological interventions including GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par38">Recently, a self-help CBT intervention ‘Your teeth, you are in control’ has been developed which can be delivered by dental professionals (funded by NIHR Research for Patient Benefit PB-PG-1111-26029). This intervention uses a range of evidence-based psychological techniques for the reduction of DA in children with guidance provided by dental professionals. There is a self-help guide for children aged 9–16 years with accompanying resources for parents/carers and the dental team. It was developed using a ‘person-based’ approach involving dentally anxious children, parents/carers and dental health professionals to ensure the perspectives and needs of children were taken into account. A feasibility study was conducted in which 48 children with self-reported DA were given the intervention by paediatric dentists in hospital and community care settings. Children reported a mean Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDAS) score at baseline of 25.0 (SD 6.5) and 17.4 (SD 6.1) at follow-up, demonstrating a significant reduction in DA (mean difference 7.7, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI 5.7 to 9.6, Cohen’s d ES 1.2) and an increase in health-related quality of life (using the Child Health Utility 9D instrument) (mean difference −0.03, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 95% CI −0.06 to −0.00, Cohen’s d ES 0.3). Overall, there was a 66% response rate and an 86% completion rate, with high levels of acceptability for children, parents/carers and dental professionals. There was also an excellent attendance rate with 90% of dental appointments kept. This compared favourably with the 74% attendance rate of children who met the study inclusion criteria but who were not recruited. Although 80% of participants were specifically referred for a GA, only 15% of these went on to require one so the intervention may reduce the need for treatment under GA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When a sample of these participants were reviewed 1 year later, 91% reported feeling less worried about dental visits than they previously did, and described changes in cognition, behaviours and feelings that allowed them to manage their anxiety better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par39">Bux et al., in a single-centre service evaluation, found it was feasible to deliver this guided CBT approach in a general dental setting and reported a significant decrease in children’s DA scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These positive findings support the need for further evaluation in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial in primary dental care.</p>

                <p id="Par50">Participants will be recruited from 30 primary dental care sites, comprising general dental practices and primary dental care community clinics. These sites will be located across the UK, mainly based in the East Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, North East and Wales. These five regions have been chosen as they encompass some of the most deprived areas of the UK, where the prevalence of dental caries is above average. This will ensure that a socio-economically diverse and multi-ethnic mix of participants are recruited and will allow testing of the intervention in different devolved nations to increase generalisability. Local research teams, comprising a clinical lead and research dental nurse in each of the five regions, will oversee site and participant recruitment.</p>

                <p id="Par66">The comparator for this trial is defined as non-pharmacological ‘usual care’ and is perceived as the routine way in which children with DA are managed in primary dental settings. This usual care typically relies on a number of basic behavioural approaches. These simple techniques are described in national [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par67">‘Tell-show-do’ where children are first told about an anxiety-inducing aspect of dental treatment, then this is demonstrated before the procedure is performed;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par68">‘Reinforcement’ (usually positive) of behaviour using praise and non-verbal signals</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">‘Modelling’ where the child observes another person having dental treatment undertaken</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par70">‘Distraction’ which can take many forms;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par71">‘Voice control’ where members of the dental team alter their tone and volume of speaking to produce desired effects, and</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par72">‘Enhanced control’ where a specific signal from the child allows them to communicate with the dentist</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par73">Participating dental professionals and children assigned to the comparator arm will therefore undertake a course of dental treatment as per usual care.</p>

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par74">The intervention for the trial is described as a guided self-help CBT intervention called ‘Your teeth, you are in control’ (which will be made available as paper-based and online [via a website] formats; a Welsh language version is available for Welsh-speaking participants). This is accompanied by a parental resource and will be delivered by the primary care dental professional allocated to receive the intervention training. The intervention aims to normalise the experience of DA to help reduce negative emotions (e.g. embarrassment, shame) and has the following attributes:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par75">Helps children, parents/carers and dental team members understand the factors that may be maintaining the child's DA</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">Includes information on the dental team and basic procedures</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">Describes a variety of cognitive and behavioural tools/strategies that children can use to help them feel less anxious (e.g. challenging unhelpful thinking, goal setting/graded treatment planning, relaxation exercises)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par78">Suggests activities to increase children’s feelings of control and self-efficacy in their ability to undertake dental treatment (including a ‘message to dentist’ and signed stop signal agreement)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">Prompts children to reflect on what went well about each visit to build a memory bank of positive experiences</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">Provides users with structure and guidance on how to incorporate the use of individualised positive reinforcement techniques into dental treatment/visits</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par81">Promotes effective communication and shared decision-making between children, parent/carer and dental team members</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p id="Par82">The intervention includes a 2-h online training package for dental professionals assigned to this arm alongside a step-by-step delivery guide. The training aims to increase clinicians’ knowledge, understanding, confidence and skills in the effective management of children’s DA through highlighting how the approach and techniques included in the intervention are theoretically informed and evidence based. Children (and parents/carers) assigned to receive the intervention will be given access to ‘Your teeth you are in control’ resources prior to starting their course of dental treatment. They will be informed on how and when to use the intervention and the treating dental professional will refer to and apply the various activities outlined in the intervention at each subsequent dental visit.</p>

              <title>Outcomes {12}</title>
              <p id="Par88">The primary outcome measure is child self-reported DA. This will be measured using the Modified Child DA Scale (MCDAS) at baseline (B), end of the course of treatment (Follow-up [FU]1) and 12 months post-randomisation (FU2; this is the primary time point). The MCDAS is an eight-item measure, with each item having a score ranging from 1 (relaxed/ not worried) to 5 (very worried), which are summed to give a total score of between 8 and 40. It is one of the most widely used measures of child DA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been validated for use with children aged over 8 years and has demonstrated its responsiveness to detect changes in dental anxiety over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par89">Secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, end of the course of treatment (FU1) and 12 months post-randomisation (FU2) (unless otherwise stated) and include:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(i).</label><p id="Par90">Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par91">Child HRQoL will be assessed using the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It consists of nine dimensions (worried, sad, pain, tired, annoyed, schoolwork/homework, sleep, daily routine and activities), each represented by a single question with five response options. The responses to each of the nine questions can be taken together as a description of the HRQoL of the child and is termed a ‘health state’. There are many different health states defined by the CHU9D descriptive system (due to different combinations of response options on each of the nine dimensions), and each unique health state has a preference weight associated with it. These preference weights give a utility value (on a 0–1 scale where 1 is perfect health and 0 is a state equivalent to being dead) and can be used in economic analysis to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(ii).</label><p id="Par92">Oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL)</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par93">Child Oral HRQoL will be assessed using CARIES-QC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], a measure of the impact of caries validated in children aged 5–16 years. CARIES-QC contains 12 items and one global question. The items are scored on a 3-point Likert scale from 0 to 2, with a higher score indicating increased impact (possible total score range 0–24). As the measure is unidimensional, a conversion scale is available to convert the raw ordinal score to an interval score to allow accurate calculation of change scores and effect sizes.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(iii).</label><p id="Par94">Parent dental anxiety</p></list-item></list></p>

              <p id="Par103">An anchor-based approach will be used to determine the change in MCDAS that represents the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The anchors will include the following: the single-item Global Rating of Change (GRC) outcome measure used to gain the participant’s perspective on how meaningful the change to their anxiety has been. The GRC item asks participants to rate their condition (DA) following the intervention (‘I feel much worse’; ‘I feel a little worse’; ‘nothing has changed’; ‘I feel a little better’; or ‘I feel much better’) compared with baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Participants can then be further categorised based on whether they report that their DA has improved/not changed/deteriorated using this anchor.</p>
              <p id="Par104">The Clinical Global Impressions: Improvement (CGI-I) item will be used as an anchor to capture ‘meaningful’ change in children’s DA levels from the perspective of the dental professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The dental professional will be asked to rate the participant’s DA after the intervention compared to baseline using a 7-point response scale (1=very much improved since the initiation of intervention; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of the intervention). These data will be recorded on a CRF by the dental professional at every visit of the course of treatment, at FU1 and FU2.</p>

                <p id="Par106">From the feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], the MCID for the MCDAS was calculated as 5 points using the anchor-based method, and the standard deviation was 6.5. Given the small sample size of the feasibility study, this trial will be powered to detect a more conservative difference of 2.5. The clustering of patients within dental professionals’ lists within sites, using an average cluster size of 20 (patients per dental site), and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 is used in the sample size calculation. To detect a 2.5 point difference, assuming 90% power, 5% alpha, SD of 6.5, average cluster size of 20, ICC of 0.03 and 20% attrition, the study would need to recruit 600 children (involving 30 dental sites and 60 dental professionals). Based on the literature, it is estimated that 80% of parents/carers who are approached for the study will agree to take part; hence, it is envisaged that 750 children will need to be approached to take part [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par108">It should also be noted that the main trial will only progress following satisfactory outcomes from an initial internal pilot trial. This will be based on the number of dental sites open to participant recruitment, the child (and parent/carer) recruitment rate in total and by site and month, and the number and percentage of participants randomised to receive the intervention who are engaging in the intervention (based on completion of the ‘message to dentist’ component of the self-help CBT resources).</p>
                <p id="Par109">In addition to monitoring overall participant recruitment rates, we will also monitor recruitment of participants living in deprived areas, based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles derived from participants’ postcodes, to ensure those living in the most deprived areas of England and Wales are included. This will be reported along with the progression criteria and changes will be made to the recruitment strategy to improve recruitment of those living in the most deprived areas if required.</p>

                <p id="Par133">Specifically, questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at the end of the course of treatment and at 12 months. Unit costs, sourced from established databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], will be applied to each resource item to estimate a total cost per participant. Cost estimates of the intervention will incorporate the time spent delivering the intervention and undertaking the associated training, with the costs of sedation/GA referrals also included. Further costs incurred by parents/carers of participants will be collected for the secondary analysis (e.g. time off work, travel costs for appointments). Time missed from school in relation to appointments/DA will be listed as a ‘consequence’ and compared between groups, but not formally valued in monetary terms.</p>
                <p id="Par134">QALYs will be estimated for each participant using the area under the curve approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Costs will be presented in UK GBP for the appropriate year. Mean within-trial estimates of costs and health benefits will be calculated using regression methods, and multiple imputation methods will be used to deal with missing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], with sensitivity analysis exploring a complete case analysis. The results will be presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net health benefit at 12 months. Uncertainty will be described using confidence intervals and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of underlying assumptions and key parameters of the analysis in terms of the cost-effectiveness results. A pre-specified health economics analysis plan will be agreed with the trial’s independent groups.</p>
                <p id="Par135">Depending on the trial’s findings, the economic results will be modelled beyond the time horizon of the trial, making assumptions of a longer-term impact. Prior to undertaking the within-trial economic analysis, a modelling plan will be developed. The model will use data collected from the trial (outcomes, resource use, attendance patterns, referrals), supplemented by published data. Future costs and health benefits will be discounted in line with NICE recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses will explore uncertainty around model parameters, with the robustness of results tested using different scenarios.</p>

Based on findings from the literature on guided self-help CBT, the feasibility study and discussions with the sponsor and PPIE representatives, it has been agreed that any adverse events from the study intervention and procedures are extremely unlikely so it can be justified not to include adverse event reporting.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par153">This study brings together a team with expertise in the areas of child oral health, psychology, trials methods, medical statistics, health economics, primary dental care, process evaluation and PPIE. However, from the outset, the research team has worked closely with children, parent/carers and PPIE members to develop the protocol, and this aspect warrants further discussion. The PPIE work with children, which been ongoing since the outset of this programme of work, has included group discussions and one-to-one meetings with 20 children with different experiences of DA attending primary dental care settings. Children described how worried they felt about going to the dentist, the sights, smells, sounds and thoughts about what treatment they would need and how painful it might be. They described wanting to let the dental professional know how anxious they felt but also feeling embarrassed to admit this and feeling there was nothing the dentist could do to help them. They welcomed the idea of a resource given to them by the dentist, the opportunity to complete a ‘message to dentist’ proforma and being given more choice and control about what happened during the appointment. Some children said they preferred not to have a lot of reading to do so would like both paper-based and multimedia study information available. To thank participants for their time taking part in the trial, children would welcome a thank you voucher and branded small gifts.</p>
              <p id="Par154">Discussions were held with ten parent/carers of children with DA. Parent/carers also welcomed this study and the opportunity to test an intervention of this kind. They described frustration at not feeling able to support their own child before, during and after visits. Most parent/carers described how they themselves were dentally anxious; some parent/carers described trying to hide their DA from their child but others described talking openly about it in front of their child. Parent/carers felt that the inclusion of a measure of their own DA was useful and this may influence how well the child intervention worked. PPIE representatives endorsed the parent/carer’s view that including a measure of adult dental anxiety would be beneficial. As a consequence, the design of the study was changed to include recruiting parent/carers to complete measures of their DA. Furthermore, PPIE representatives suggested a multimedia information resource may help parent/carers with limited ability to read English to understand the trial so multimedia information will be provided. The views of children, parent/carers and PPIE representatives were obtained to choose the trial acronym.</p>
              <p id="Par155">Children, parent/carers and PPIE co-applicants will be actively involved throughout the trial. The trial team includes a young person co-applicant who has experience of DA anxiety and has previously been a member of a youth PPIE panel advising on other dental projects. An experienced PPIE representative will share the workload with the young person co-applicant.</p>
              <p id="Par156">In addition, a youth forum involving four children and young people has been convened. A parent panel of four parent/carers has also been set up to include parent/carers of children with DA. The forum and panel will meet on average three times per year. To date, the forum and panel have chosen the design of the trial logo, had input into the format of questionnaires and participant information resources (including the multimedia resources) and thank you gifts. As the trial progresses, the group will advise on participant recruitment (of participants with a range of socio-demographic characteristics), ways to promote questionnaire completion and drafting of lay summaries. The youth forum and parent panel will also be involved in the design of the dissemination strategy.</p>
              <p id="Par157">PPIE activities are co-ordinated by ZM and JP as the joint PPIE leads for the trial. They will provide ongoing tailored training and support throughout the trial for the PPIE co-applicants, youth forum and parent panel. ZM and JP will feed the findings of the PPIE activities into the Trial Management Group meetings and report them to the Trial Steering Committee. Guidance from the University of the West of England on evaluating PPIE in research will be followed and the Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The GRIPP2 reporting checklist will be used to improve the reporting of the PPIE.</p>
              <p id="Par158">In summary, this trial has been driven by an acknowledged area of need, to reduce DA in children using a simple CBT-based intervention. Importantly, the substantial engagement of patients themselves will help to ensure the success and relevance of the planned research.</p>
              <p id="Par159">Undertaking research in primary dental care is not without its challenges, with financial concerns, staff workload and loss of clinical control being cited as reasons to prevent general dental practitioners (GDPs) taking part in research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Previous large-scale trials have encountered issues with patient recruitment with participating practices taking longer than anticipated to recruit eligible patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Training in research has been highlighted as an area needed to help recruitment, thus a trial-specific training package was developed in conjunction with GDPs giving an overview of research methodology, good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines and trial-specific information. This can be accessed easily by all members of the dental team without having to undertake full GCP training through the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) learn website which is not easily accessible to primary dental care teams who do not all have an allocated NHS email address. Having continued support from the trial team was noted by Keightley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] to help improve patient recruitment therefore practices are given a large amount of backing through practice visits, congratulatory emails upon patient recruitment and the trial team being easily contactable. Joint working between the trial team and GDPs included reviewing relevant trial paperwork by GDPs to check it was not too onerous and that it correlated with practice protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Additional resources and support are even more paramount to support participating clinicians as they face a post-pandemic recovery period and an uncertain climate of contract reform in general practice.</p>
              <p id="Par160">There may be a perceived deficiency in the adoption of standardised procedures in dental practice, risking variation in intervention delivery, and also possible contamination of arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. This is, however, the real picture in dental practice and understanding this can help implementation. The trial has ensured that dentists in the ‘usual care’ arm were not allowed access to CBT resources and the CBT trained staff at the practice were told not to discuss the intervention with their colleagues. The trial team also collected feedback from early adopting practices. This feedback can aid the trial team in providing guidance to new oncoming sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>
