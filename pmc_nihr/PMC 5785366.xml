                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia account for almost 85% of global maternal deaths from post-partum haemorrhage. Early administration of tranexamic acid, within 3 h of giving birth, was shown to reduce the risk of death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of early administration of tranexamic acid for treatment of post-partum haemorrhage.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>For this economic evaluation we developed a decision model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the addition of tranexamic acid to usual care for treatment of women with post-partum haemorrhage in Nigeria and Pakistan. We used data from the WOMAN trial to inform model parameters, supplemented by estimates from the literature. We estimated costs (calculated in 2016 US$), life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with and without tranexamic acid, calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and compared these to threshold values in each country. Costs were assessed from the health-care provider perspective and discounted at 3% per year in the base case analysis. We did a series of one-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the results to parameter uncertainty.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Early treatment of post-partum haemorrhage with tranexamic acid generated an average gain of 0·18 QALYs at an additional cost of $37·12 per patient in Nigeria and an average gain of 0·08 QALYs at an additional cost of $6·55 per patient in Pakistan. The base case ICER results were $208 per QALY in Nigeria and $83 per QALY in Pakistan. These ICERs were below the lower bound of the cost-effectiveness threshold range in both countries. The ICERs were most sensitive to uncertainty in parameter inputs for the relative risk of death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid, the discount rate, the cost of the drug, and the baseline probability of death due to bleeding.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Early treatment of post-partum haemorrhage with tranexamic acid is highly cost-effective in Nigeria and Pakistan, and is likely to be cost-effective in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia with a similar baseline risk of death due to bleeding.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para10">Between 1990 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio declined from 385 deaths per 100 000 births to 216 deaths per 100 000 births but fell short of the 75% reduction called for in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) framework.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In 2015, the continued commitment to reducing maternal mortality was outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which established a target of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100 000 births by 2030.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Post-partum haemorrhage, commonly defined as a blood loss of more than 500 mL within 24 h of giving birth, is a leading cause of maternal death, accounting for approximately 20% of maternal deaths globally.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Interventions aimed at preventing or treating post-partum haemorrhage can have an important role in working towards the SDG target.</p>
              <p id="para20">Tranexamic acid is a drug that reduces bleeding by inhibiting the breakdown of fibrin blood clots.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> The effect of tranexamic acid in reducing the risk of death from post-partum haemorrhage was shown in the World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled more than 20 000 women in 21 countries between March, 2010, and April, 2016.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The burden of maternal deaths falls disproportionately on low-income and middle-income countries; sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia account for almost 85% of global maternal deaths from post-partum haemorrhage.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> In resource-constrained settings, the decision to adopt a medicine for routine use in clinical practice should be informed not only by information about the clinical effectiveness of an intervention but also by information about its cost-effectiveness.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of post-partum haemorrhage in Nigeria and Pakistan. Cost-effectiveness analyses at the country level are needed to reflect differences in both costs and the baseline risk of maternal death. We focus on Nigeria and Pakistan because they are among the countries with the highest number of maternal deaths annually<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> and more than 50% of patients in the WOMAN trial were enrolled from these two countries.</p>

                  <p id="para50">We searched the PubMed database to identify cost-effectiveness analyses of tranexamic acid published before June, 2017. Two searches were done, with the following search terms: cost effectiveness AND tranexamic acid (filter: humans); and cost effectiveness AND post-partum haemorrhage (filter: humans). Eligible studies had to include a comparative analysis of both costs and effectiveness and to report results in terms of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We identified three studies that had evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid, two in bleeding trauma patients and one in patients who had elective surgery. We did not identify any previous studies that had assessed the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of women with post-partum haemorrhage.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">The international, multicentre, randomised World Maternal Antifibrinolytic (WOMAN) trial, which enrolled over 20 000 patients between March, 2010, and April, 2016, showed that early administration of tranexamic acid reduces the risk of death due to bleeding in women with post-partum haemorrhage. This economic evaluation draws on data from the WOMAN trial to inform an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of women with post-partum haemorrhage in Nigeria and Pakistan, taking into account country-specific differences in both costs and baseline risk of mortality.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Consistent with the results of previous cost-effectiveness analyses in other patient groups and settings, the findings presented in this study suggest that early administration of tranexamic acid in women with post-partum haemorrhage is cost-effective. This finding is important given the resource constraints faced by countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, two regions with a disproportionate burden of global maternal deaths due to post-partum haemorrhage.</p>

                <p id="para100">For this economic evaluation we developed a decision tree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating post-partum haemorrhage with and without tranexamic acid using data from the WOMAN trial, supplemented by literature-based sources where necessary. In the model, following diagnosis of post-partum haemorrhage, there are three possible outcomes: death due to bleeding, death from other causes, or alive at discharge (or 42 days after randomisation if not yet discharged).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Because of its mechanism of action, tranexamic acid is not expected to have any effect on deaths that are not related to bleeding<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and therefore these events are estimated separately in the model. For patients who were alive at discharge, the model assumes that their long-term survival is equivalent to the age-adjusted life expectancy of the general female population in each country.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Decision tree</p><p>Structure of the decision tree used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating post-partum haemorrhage with and without tranexamic acid and showing where the effect of tranexamic acid in reducing the relative risk of death due to bleeding is applied in the model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>
                <p id="para110">In the WOMAN trial, tranexamic acid was administered by intravenous injection. Results of prespecified subgroup analyses showed that the effect of tranexamic acid in reducing the risk of death due to bleeding varied with time to initiation of treatment. Early treatment, defined as administration of tranexamic acid within 3 h of giving birth, substantially reduced the risk of death due to bleeding compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·52–0·91) whereas no reduction was observed when tranexamic acid was given after 3 h.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This cost-effectiveness model therefore evaluated the effect of early treatment with tranexamic acid by focusing on the subgroup of patients who received treatment within 3 h of giving birth in the WOMAN trial.</p>
                <p id="para120">The cost-effectiveness model was constructed with the software package TreeAge Pro 2017. Analyses of data from the WOMAN trial to inform the cost-effectiveness model were done in Stata, version 14.</p>

                <p id="para140">The model reports outcomes in terms of both survival (in years) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Survival estimates were informed by data from the WOMAN trial. The baseline probability of death due to bleeding in each country was estimated from the placebo group (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), to which the relative risk of death for patients who received tranexamic acid was applied. To estimate the probability of death from other causes, we first used a χ<sup>2</sup> test to assess the equality of proportions between the placebo and tranexamic acid groups and found no difference. Therefore, we calculated a single estimate of the probability of death from other causes that we applied to both groups in the cost-effectiveness model. We estimated time to death due to bleeding, time to death from other causes, and time to discharge by pooling data from both groups of the WOMAN trial after <italic>t</italic> tests confirmed that there were no differences between patients who received tranexamic acid and patients who received placebo.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Data inputs to estimate survival in the cost-effectiveness model</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th align="left"><bold>Base case value</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Range (one-way sensitivity analysis)</bold><xref rid="tbl1fn1" ref-type="table-fn">*</xref></th><th align="left"><bold>Distribution (probabilistic sensitivity analysis)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Baseline probability of death due to bleeding</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Nigeria</td><td align="left">2·79%</td><td align="left">2·08–3·65</td><td align="left">Beta: <italic>r</italic>=51; n=1831</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Pakistan</td><td align="left">1·12%</td><td align="left">0·72–1·66</td><td align="left">Beta: <italic>r</italic>=24; n=2141</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Relative risk (RR) of death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid given within 3 h</td><td align="left">0·69</td><td align="left">0·52–0·91</td><td align="left">Lognormal: ln(RR) −0·370; SE[ln(RR)] 0·137</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Baseline probability of death from other causes</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Nigeria</td><td align="left">0·76%</td><td align="left">0·50–1·09</td><td align="left">Beta: <italic>r</italic>=28; n=3694</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Pakistan</td><td align="left">0·67%</td><td align="left">0·45–0·97</td><td align="left">Beta: <italic>r</italic>=29; n=4308</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Time to death due to bleeding, years</td><td align="left">0·0015</td><td align="left">0·0007–0·0023</td><td align="left">Gamma: mean 0·0015; SE 0·0004</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Time to death due to other causes, years</td><td align="left">0·0078</td><td align="left">0·0051–0·0104</td><td align="left">Gamma: mean 0·0078; SE 0·0013</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left">Time to discharge, years</td><td align="left">0·0093</td><td align="left">0·0092–0·0095</td><td align="left">Gamma: mean 0·0093; SE 0·0001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5" align="left">Post-discharge age-adjusted female life expectancy, years<xref rid="tbl1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Nigeria</td><td align="left">40·9</td><td align="left">36·8–45·7</td><td align="left">Normal: mean 40·9; SE 1·28</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="left">Pakistan</td><td align="left">49·2</td><td align="left">45·9–52·2</td><td align="left">Normal: mean 49·2; SE 1·02</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>All data are from the WOMAN trial,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> unless otherwise stated.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fn1"><label>*</label><p id="cenpara10">For inputs derived from the WOMAN trial, the range reflects the 95% CI.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tbl1fn2"><label>†</label><p id="cenpara20">Sources: WHO Global Health Observatory,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Lopez et al (2000).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p>

The resulting ICER can be compared to a country-specific cost-effectiveness threshold value; an ICER that falls below the threshold value would generally be considered cost-effective. We adopted a range of cost-effectiveness threshold values in each country ($446–$2880 per QALY in Nigeria and $314–$2416 per QALY in Pakistan), which were obtained from an analysis by Woods and colleagues.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Their calculation of cost-effectiveness thresholds is based on the premise that health-care budgets are constrained; if an intervention offers health gains but also incurs additional costs, then the decision to fund the intervention should be informed by the value of the other interventions that must be foregone. The cost-effectiveness threshold ranges estimated by Woods and colleagues are based on an understanding of the association between changes in health-care expenditure and health outcomes in the National Health Service (NHS) in England, which was then applied to other countries with different income levels by use of estimates of the income elasticity of the value of health.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref></p>

              <p id="para250">We did a series of one-way sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of varying different parameters across a plausible range of values on the ICER. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows those parameters that led to a change in the ICER of greater than $20 per QALY when inputs were varied from the lowest to the highest values over the specified ranges. In both countries, the ICER was shown to be most sensitive to variations in the relative risk of death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid, the discount rate, the cost of tranexamic acid, and the baseline probability of death due to bleeding. In Pakistan, when the relative risk of death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid was increased to 0·91, the ICER remained below the lower bound of the cost-effectiveness threshold of $314 per QALY. In Nigeria, increasing the relative risk of death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid to the upper bound of 0·91 resulted in an ICER of $692 per QALY, while increasing the discount rate to 10% resulted in an ICER of $507 per QALY. These ICERs are still within the cost-effectiveness threshold range for Nigeria ($446–$2880 per QALY). This analysis suggests that the cost-effectiveness results are robust to the uncertainty surrounding the value of the inputs for the key parameters in the model.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Tornado diagram showing the effect of varying each parameter on its own on the ICER in Nigeria and Pakistan</p><p>Only parameters that resulted in a difference of more than $20 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) when varied between the lower and upper bounds of the plausible ranges are shown.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para270">Administration of tranexamic acid to women with post-partum haemorrhage has been shown to save lives when the drug is given within 3 h of giving birth,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> but this intervention incurs additional costs. We sought to evaluate whether the additional costs associated with routine use of tranexamic acid in women with post-partum haemorrhage represent an efficient use of scarce resources. We did this analysis in two countries with a high burden of maternal mortality, Nigeria and Pakistan, and found that tranexamic acid is likely to be highly cost-effective in both countries. Although this is the first analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of post-partum haemorrhage, our findings are broadly consistent with those of previous economic evaluations that have shown the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid for treatment of excessive blood loss in other patient groups, including treatment of patients with bleeding trauma and those who have had elective surgery.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p>
              <p id="para280">As an inexpensive and potentially life-saving intervention, it is perhaps not surprising that tranexamic acid has been shown to be cost-effective in different settings, although uncertainty surrounding the price of the drug has been shown to have a substantial effect on ICER estimates in sensitivity analyses in our study and in previous studies.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Another important source of uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness analysis was the baseline probability of death due to bleeding in each country. We chose to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid in countries with high maternal mortality as this is the setting where we expect to see the largest benefit in terms of a reduction in the number of deaths due to bleeding. Caution should be exercised in generalisation of the cost-effectiveness results reported here to countries with much lower baseline rates of maternal mortality due to post-partum haemorrhage. It is also important to consider the generalisability of the results of this analysis across different settings within Nigeria and Pakistan, given the realities of health-care provision in both countries. We have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid when given within 3 h of birth, which requires timely access to skilled health personnel. According to estimates from 2012, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel was 56% in Pakistan.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In Nigeria, where there are substantial within-country socioeconomic inequalities in access to maternal health care, the proportion was 40%.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p>
              <p id="para290">Our cost-effectiveness analysis has a number of potential limitations. The maximum period of follow-up in the WOMAN trial was 42 days and therefore in the cost-effectiveness model it was necessary to make a general assumption about long-term survival beyond the trial period. We based our assumption on country-specific average estimates of age-adjusted female life expectancy from the literature.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> This assumption meant that the time horizon of the model for patients who were alive at discharge was quite long, making the results sensitive to variations in the discount rate. For this reason, we tested the effect of increasing the discount rate up to 10% and found that tranexamic acid remained cost-effective in one-way sensitivity analysis. Another limitation of the short follow-up period is that we were unable to collect any data on wider health benefits beyond the immediate survival of the mother. For example, we did not attempt to measure or quantify the effects of maternal survival on the survival or quality of life of the newborn child or the family, thereby potentially underestimating the benefits of tranexamic acid.</p>
              <p id="para300">To use the results of any cost-effectiveness analysis to inform decision making, it is necessary to compare the ICER generated by the model to a threshold value. Various different approaches have been used to estimate cost-effectiveness thresholds.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Historically, the ICERs for health interventions in low-income and middle-income countries have been compared to a threshold value of one to three times the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This approach for estimation of the threshold is conceptually linked to how individuals value health and their willingness to pay for additional health benefits, but it has been criticised because this measure is not directly linked to an assessment of the value of a new intervention in relation to what other health-generating interventions would need to be displaced.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In this study, we chose to compare the ICER results to cost-effectiveness threshold ranges that were estimated on the basis of the opportunity costs of health-care spending that better reflect the constrained nature of health-care budgets. The thresholds we used are lower and therefore more stringent than thresholds based on GDP per capita. This approach gives us further confidence in our conclusion that early administration of tranexamic acid is cost-effective for the treatment of post-partum haemorrhage in Nigeria and Pakistan.</p>

                <p>The run-in phase of the WOMAN trial for recruitment of 2000 patients was funded by London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (London, UK). The funds to support the drug and placebo costs through an investigator-initiated research grant for the run-in phase were provided by Pfizer. The main phase was funded by the Department of Health (UK), grant number HICF-T2-0510-007, and the Wellcome Trust, grant number WT094947. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (grant number OPP1095618) supported dissemination activities and recruitment of the final 5000 patients. We thank Bukola Fawole (Nigeria) and Rizwana Chaudhri (Pakistan) for their assistance in providing data to inform cost estimates.</p>
