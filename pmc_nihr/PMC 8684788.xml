                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Young adult offenders represent a third of the UK prison population and are at risk of poor health outcomes including drug and alcohol misuse, self-harm and suicide. Court diversion interventions aim to reduce the negative consequences of formal criminal justice sanctions and focus resources on addressing the root causes of offending. Although diversions are widely used, evidence of their effectiveness has not yet been established.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">Hampshire Constabulary, working together with local charities, have developed the Gateway programme, an out-of-court intervention aimed at improving the life chances of young adults. Issued as a conditional caution, participants undertake a health and social care needs assessment, attend workshops encouraging analysis of own behaviour and its consequences and agree not to re-offend during the 16-week caution.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is a pragmatic, multi-site, parallel-group, superiority randomised controlled trial with a target sample size of 334. Participants are aged 18–24, reside in Hampshire and Isle of Wight and are being questioned for an eligible low-level offence. Police investigators offer potential participants a chance to receive the Gateway caution, and those interested are also invited to take part in the study. Police officers obtain Stage 1 consent and carry out an eligibility check, after which participants are randomised on a 1:1 basis either to receive Gateway or follow the usual process, such as court appearance or a different conditional caution. Researchers subsequently obtain Stage 2 consent and collect data at weeks 4 and 16, and 1 year post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes include health status, alcohol and drug use, recidivism and resource use. The primary analysis will compare the WEMWBS score between the two groups at 12 months.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">This pioneering trial aims to address the evidence gap surrounding diversion in 18–24-year-olds. The findings will inform law enforcement agencies, third sector organisations, policymakers and commissioners, as well as researchers working in related fields and with vulnerable target populations.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par42">Young adult offenders commonly have a range of health and social needs, making them vulnerable to mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Those aged between 18 and 24, who have been investigated for a suspected low-level offence, may need to attend court and, if convicted, face penalties such as prison. However, many believe that more should be done to prevent young adults from entering the criminal justice system to begin with. Diversion is a process whereby an accused offender is formally moved into a programme in the community, such as an out-of-court community-based intervention (OCBI), instead of entering the criminal justice system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Despite the use of diversion programmes in the UK, particularly amongst a younger population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the evidence base around the effectiveness of diversion is still unclear.</p>
                <p id="Par43">The Gateway programme, an OCBI, has been developed by Hampshire Constabulary (HC), in partnership with local third sector organisations with the aim of improving the life chances of young adult offenders. In the programme, a mentor (Navigator) assesses the needs of each young adult and develops a pathway with referrals to healthcare and other local support services (e.g., housing). Young adults then take part in two workshops (LINX team) about empathy, and the causes and consequences of their behaviour. The components of the Gateway intervention are underpinned by theory and have been evaluated in isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; there has been no previous attempt to evaluate the combination of elements as used in the Gateway programme. This study therefore aims to assess the effectiveness of Gateway to improve the health and well-being of young adult offenders and reduce future criminal behaviour.</p>

                  <title>Diversion and recidivism amongst young populations</title>
                  <p id="Par44">Literature searches were conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Europe PMC, MEDLINE, NIHR Library and Web of Science databases using the search terms: diversion, out of court disposals and court diversion. Studies on diversion have largely been undertaken outside the UK; the majority being conducted in the United States (US), with a few studies in Australia, New Zealand and the rest of Europe. Of the studies found, the majority focussed on younger populations and on family treatment as a therapeutic intervention. For example, multi-systemic therapy is a resource-intensive programme, which focuses on factors within the offender’s social network that contribute to their offending behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Treatment usually takes place within the community, such as at home or at school. A meta-analysis of diversion programmes for juvenile offenders was undertaken in 2012 and identified 28 studies involving 19,301 youths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The most common outcome reported amongst the studies was recidivism, the tendency of the offender to reoffend. Of the five types of programmes included, a statistically significant reduction in recidivism was only observed for family treatment (OR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.40 to 0.82). Overall, there was high heterogeneity amongst the studies in terms of the research and programme design, as well as the quality of programme monitoring and implementation. The mean age of the population in studies identified by the meta-analysis ranged from 12.6 to 15.9 years of age. An evaluation of Checkpoint, a court diversion programme which does not respond to the needs of a particular age group but is aimed at adults, found a lower reoffending rate in comparison to the control cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite the lack of robust evidence, the case for diversion amongst young adults is increasing, due to a growing recognition of their varying levels of maturity and complex needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par45">According to Hampshire Constabulary statistics for 2018/20, the five main offence categories for this age group where formal action was taken by the police are possession of drugs, violence, shoplifting, criminal damage and public order offences. These young adults often represent a vulnerable population with a range of complex needs, such as mental health issues and substance misuse. They are more likely to come into contact with the police both as suspects and victims of crime and are significantly over-represented in the formal justice process, accounting for approximately one third of police, probation and prison caseloads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
                  <p id="Par46">In the UK, a number of Police Forces are exploring the use of out-of-court disposals amongst 18–24-year-olds involved in less serious offending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Out-of-court disposals are usually given where the offence is perceived to be a low-level crime. The aim is to divert the young adult away from their offending behaviour. However, evidence of the effectiveness of diversion interventions amongst this population remains limited.</p>

                <sec id="Sec6">
                  <title>Rationale for intervention and current study</title>
                  <p id="Par47">The Gateway intervention model was conceived by HC as a ‘culture changing initiative’ that sought to address the complex needs of young adult offenders aged 18–24. Central to this is the belief that transitions into adulthood are not linear and that more work is necessary to support desistance amongst this vulnerable population. By combining components shown to have an impact, at least in the short term, the Gateway programme aims to provide a more comprehensive approach with longer-term impacts. HC understood the need to undertake a robust assessment of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementing the Gateway programme. Given the aims, the evaluation includes a wide set of outcomes in addition to reducing recidivism, with a particular focus on health and well-being of offenders and gives victim satisfaction.</p>

                <p id="Par48">The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Gateway programme issued as a conditional caution (intervention) compared to a court appearance or a different conditional caution (usual process).</p>
                <p id="Par49">The study objectives are to:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par50">Examine the effectiveness of the Gateway intervention on (i) health and well-being including alcohol and substance use, (ii) access to and use of health and social services and (iii) quality of life, amongst young adult offenders</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Explore the views and experiences of victims</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">Assess the quantity and quality of the Gateway intervention as delivered in the study and the generalisability of the findings</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Identify and measure all relevant consequences, both cost and benefits, of the Gateway intervention compared with usual process</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par54">Examine the effectiveness of the Gateway intervention on reoffending</p></list-item></list></p>

                <title>Trial design {8}</title>
                <p id="Par56">We are undertaking a pragmatic, superiority RCT with participants aged 18–24 who have committed low-level offences and reside within Hampshire and Isle of Wight, with an internal pilot phase. Participants will be randomised using a 1:1 allocation ratio to either the Gateway programme or disposal to a court summons or a different conditional caution to Gateway (usual process).</p>
                <p id="Par57">Economic and qualitative process evaluations will be undertaken in parallel with the RCT. This mixed methods approach will ensure the study evaluates the impact of the intervention on participants, the views of victims, assesses the intervention itself and examines the cost consequences of the Gateway programme.</p>

                <p id="Par59">The study population is 18–24-year-old offenders residing within Hampshire and Isle of Wight. According to police statistics, the five main offence categories for this age group are violence, possession or trafficking of drugs, theft, criminal damage and public order offences. These young adults represent a vulnerable population with a range of complex needs, such as mental health issues and drug and substance misuse.

                <title>Who will take informed consent? {26a}</title>
                <p id="Par82">There are legal and practical issues precluding researchers from attending a Police station and custody areas to make direct contact with potential participants, before or after a disposal decision has been made. Often for those in custody, a disposal decision, including consent and randomisation, must be completed before they are released from custody. For logistical and safety reasons, a <italic>two-stage</italic> consent process is used in this study. Police investigators obtain Stage 1 consent, which includes (a) agreement to potential inclusion to the Gateway programme and (b) the optional sharing of their contact details for the University researchers to make direct contact. Potential participants are fully informed about the study prior to Stage 2 consent being obtained by the researchers at the first data collection time point, usually week 4 post-randomisation.</p>
                <sec id="Sec13">
                  <title>Stage 1 consent:</title>
                  <p id="Par83">Police investigators dealing with potential participants receive training about the study, the consent process and use of the web-based eligibility and randomisation tool (Alchemer, formerly SurveyGizmo), to ensure standardised recruitment and recording of eligibility criteria.</p>
                  <p id="Par84">During processing in custody (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), investigators identify potentially eligible participants. For legal reasons, the investigator tells the individual about the potential option of a Gateway Conditional Caution as an alternative to prosecution or a different conditional caution. If the offender is interested in a possible Gateway caution, they are then informed about the ‘Questionnaire Study’ as it is referred to in participant facing materials. A Gateway Caution information leaflet (produced by HC independently of the study) and a <italic>Questionnaire Study leaflet</italic> may be offered or emailed later. Potential participants are made aware that further details about the study will be provided by a University researcher and that they may withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. If the offender agrees to take part in Gateway and the study, the investigator obtains their signatures on the combined Stage 1 Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and consent form.

                  <p id="Par85">Stage 1 consent includes permission for the Police to pass the individual’s contact details, such as <italic>telephone number(s), email</italic> and <italic>postal addresses</italic>, to the University researchers, and for the researchers to contact participants.</p>
                  <p id="Par86">A small number of participants recruited through the out-of-custody process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) will be contacted by the Police, to have the Gateway caution option and study participation explained. If contacted by telephone, they will be asked to give verbal Stage 1 consent to participate. If given, this is recorded in the individual’s RMS incident record and their details entered in the eligibility tool and randomisation undertaken. Written consent is subsequently sought prior to any trial-related activities for the participant. Anyone later declining consent in writing is withdrawn from the trial. This approach ensures all potentially eligible participants have the chance to join the study and is in keeping with the pragmatic nature of this trial.

                  <p id="Par87">If the offender agrees to sharing their details with a researcher, the investigator obtains the offender’s written signature on the study consent page. The investigator will then enter the offender’s details in the web-based eligibility tool (Alchemer), and if eligibility is confirmed, randomisation will occur. The participant will be told their allocation at this point as part of their disposal.</p>

                  <title>Stage 2 consent</title>
                  <p id="Par88">In advance of week 4 data collection, which is undertaken over the telephone, potential participants are first contacted by a researcher by telephone, and/or text, then by email and/or post if necessary. Once contact has been made, the Stage 2 PIS is emailed to the participant, or sent by post, if they have not already received a copy, and an interview date and time arranged. At the interview, or occasionally at the time of first contact, the researcher goes through the PIS providing explanations as required. Participants are provided with any other information they may need, and any queries answered. After time to consider their involvement, and if they decide to proceed, the researcher reads out the statements in the consent form. If the participant agrees to a statement, then the researcher puts the participant’s initials in the corresponding box. When complete, the researcher then adds their own name, the participant’s name and the date of verbal consent. The completed consent form is saved as a pdf and a copy is sent to the participant. Once consent has been given, data collection may occur at the same interview or on a subsequent day.</p>
                  <p id="Par89">Participants are informed that they have the right to withhold consent or to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason. To maximise data collection, if a participant takes part in the week 16 interview having not taken part at week 4, verbal consent is obtained at that point.</p>

                <p id="Par91">The comparator for this RCT is a <italic>usual process</italic>. Under current guidance, for young adults aged 18–24, where there is enough evidence for a prosecution (known as full code test), it is considered in the public interest and where the individual admits responsibility for the offence, there are various possible outcomes. These include being given a conditional caution (but not a Gateway Caution), or referral for prosecution at court.</p>

Conditional cautions may have a mixture of conditions and the victim is consulted before the disposal decision is finalised. All conditions must be achievable and agreed by the offender. Examples of standard conditions include apology letters, victim awareness courses, drug diversion courses, alcohol diversion courses and fines or compensation. Drug, alcohol and victim awareness courses are provided through various organisations and the cost is charged to the offender. Conditions must be capable of being completed within 16 weeks, and in the event of non-compliance, the option of prosecuting the original offence is considered.</p>

If the evidence reaches the full code test and the offender is not suitable for a conditional caution, due to the nature of the offence or their previous convictions, the offender will be charged with the offence and given a court date before release from custody.</p>

The offender can be interviewed under caution without arrest which means that they are free to leave at any time. When the investigating officer reaches the full code test, the file is submitted to the supervisor for a disposal decision. A summons is sent by post to the offender with a date to attend court.</p>

The Gateway Navigators are trained support/case workers, provided by third sector organisation No Limits, and Southampton City Council. Assessments are held face to face whenever possible, but where necessary they are carried out via phone or video calls. Subsequent contacts are predominantly via telephone, text or video calling.

LINX workshops for Gateway use carefully constructed experiential group work tools alongside a strong visual framework, ‘Making the LINX to rebuild my life’ wall, which represents the nine pathways to offending. LINX workshops should enable the young adult to explore and share personal feelings on a variety of issues, particularly around their life experience. The various exercises and activities throughout LINX workshops are designed to take the young adult on a journey; enabling them to see how an experience can create a feeling, which can be translated into a set of behaviours that, for these young adults, can create risk, and risk of offending.</p>

The first LINX workshop is delivered by the workshop leaders and is aimed at addressing: journey of offending; sentences and out of court disposals; empathy, rights, respect, and responsibility; impact of offending behaviour on victims/self and collateral damage to wider society; positive communication and relationship; restorative justice options and personal risk.</p>

                    <p id="Par99">Second workshop/telephone intervention is again broken down into sections and topics. The ‘Making the LINX to rebuild my life’ wall play a central part to the workshop. It assists in consolidating the learning and builds further on the young adults’ strengths. The young adults are helped to understand resilience and the part it plays in spinning life’s plates. Day 2 includes further examinations into personal risk and protective factors; the role self-esteem plays in keeping us and others safe; and identifying how positive communication can support our goals and make amends. The second day also assists the workshop leaders and Navigators in understanding if there are any gaps in support, whether new goals need to be set, and what they need to ‘keep their wall in order.’</p>
                    <p id="Par100">The workshops ideally involve a group of individuals and take place face to face in a neutral venue. However, this is a pragmatic RCT and is being undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has necessitated changes to delivery of the intervention via telephone or video conferencing. This flexible approach reflects routine delivery of the intervention: where the number of attendees is insufficient to run a workshop, telephone/video conferencing may be used in order to fit delivery within the caution timeframe. The mode of delivery of all aspects of the intervention are recorded for the study and as far as possible will be accounted for in the analysis. Full details of the differences between the LINX workshops and the LINX telephone intervention have been documented and are available in the full protocol. As far as possible, it is only the mechanism of delivery that changes, the principle aims of the intervention and the content remain constant.</p>

It has been suggested that a change of three or more points is likely to be important to individuals but different statistical approaches provide different estimates ranging from three to eight points (WEMWBS user guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). There is also variation in the standard deviation of the WEMWBS with estimates ranging from 6 to 10.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] with the pooled estimate of 10 across all studies. Assuming 90% power, 5% 2-sided statistical significance, mean difference of 4 points on WEMWBS and a standard deviation of 10, 266 participants are required. Preliminary figures from The Hampton Trust’s skills/attitudes workshops for domestic abuse (RADAR intervention) suggests a drop-out rate of approximately 15%.

Our process for recruitment acknowledges that engaging with this target population is likely to be challenging.</p>
                <p id="Par132">The first 6 months of recruitment was run as an internal pilot to assess whether continued progression into the full trial was appropriate. According to police estimates at the start of recruitment, an average of 23 individuals would be eligible to receive the Gateway intervention each month once all the sites are recruiting.</p>
                <p id="Par133">Participants who consent at Stage 1 are now contacted by a member of the Police Gateway Team based at Southampton Central Police Station within a week of recruitment or as near to that time as practicable. The Police Gateway Team may attempt contacting the participants on more than one occasion and will also check if HC has received any updates on participants’ contact details should initial attempts be unsuccessful.</p>
                <p id="Par134">Participants are emailed a copy of the Questionnaire Study leaflet and a link to the Questionnaire Study video. The email also contains a study phone number and email address, to enable participants to contact the researchers directly.</p>

                <p id="Par136">The Police Gateway Team monitor recruitment on a daily basis, contact investigators where they see a case may be eligible to remind them about the Gateway caution and study, and discuss with investigators where a potential participant has been missed. All the Gateway and study documentation and information are readily available on the HC computer system. A variety of methods are used to raise and maintain awareness of the Gateway study within HC, such as computer screen savers, notices in police station offices and newsletter articles from the Deputy Chief Constable.

Personal data will only be used when specific consent for its use for research purposes has been given to the investigator by the participants. Details will then be stored securely in the police research Case Management System (Huddle) for selective sharing with the research team only.</p>
                <p id="Par157">Electronic copies of Stage 1 and Stage 2 consent forms will be held securely in Huddle with limited and password-protected access. Personal information will not be released, except as necessary for the study and monitoring purposes.</p>
                <p id="Par158">All information provided for the purposes of this study will be kept strictly confidential. However, if a participant discloses information that may mean the future harm of another individual or relate to an offence for which they have not been charged, then the researchers are required to break that confidence by law. Examples of such disclosures are outlined in the Stage 2 PIS to make this risk clear to potential participants.</p>

                <p id="Par161">A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be agreed with the TMG and SSC/DMEC before all of the data have been collected. Amendments to the SAP will be agreed and clearly stated and justified. Analyses will be carried out using Stata v17 or later and follow the principles of intention-to-treat with outcomes analysed according to randomised group unless otherwise specified. Parameter estimates will be presented with associated 95% confidence intervals and <italic>p</italic> values, and significance testing will be two-sided at the 5% level unless otherwise stated.</p>
                <p id="Par162">The primary analysis will compare WEMWBS between treatment groups at 12 months and will be analysed using a covariance-pattern mixed-effect linear regression model, including assessments at 4 weeks, 16 weeks and 12 months post-randomisation, and treating participants as a random effect in order to account for repeated measurements amongst participants. Treatment group, time, group by time interaction, the total of the number of Record Management System (RMS) incidents and the number of Police National Computer (PNC) convictions 1 year pre-randomisation, age at randomisation, Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile at randomisation, pandemic time period and standard of usual process available will be adjusted for as fixed effects. If feasible, recruiting site will be included as a random effect. Pandemic time period refers to whether the follow-up took place before, during or after the COVID-19 pandemic, while standard of usual process available refers to the variation in the types of caution available during the pandemic. The inclusion of these two covariates reflects the guidance provided by Cro and colleagues for handling missing outcome data in randomised trials affected by the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The treatment effect estimate at 12 months will be presented in the form of an adjusted mean difference, alongside the associated 95% confidence interval and <italic>p</italic> value. The treatment effect estimates at 4 weeks and 16 weeks will be presented in a similar manner as secondary outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par163">The continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed in a similar manner to the primary outcome. Binary secondary outcomes will be analysed using a covariance-pattern mixed-effect logistic regression model and secondary outcomes classed as count data will be analysed using Poisson or negative binomial regression models. The models will adjust for the same fixed and random effects as the primary analysis.</p>

These include discussions about their mental health, drug and substance use, and adverse childhood experiences. Offenders, who are allocated to receive the intervention, will also be encouraged to examine their own behaviour and its impact, which may be challenging and distressing for them. All assessments will be supported by the Navigators who are trained care workers experienced in dealing with this age group and discussing difficult issues.</p>
                <p id="Par175">The researchers and the care workers work closely and share experiences and concerns which can be raised at any of the relevant inter-disciplinary meetings.</p>

                <p id="Par179">The study has the potential to create a wide impact by influencing and improving health and welfare, public policy and public services, and culture and society. To maximise impact of the study, we have developed a strategy that engages with our project partners and the wider public, in particular our PPI representatives and PPP. Use will be made of existing networks and social media to share lay summaries of the findings. In addition, presentations will be given to the College of Policing and other relevant organisations, agencies and events.</p>
                <p id="Par180">The primary academic output from the study will be the report to the NIHR PHR Programme. In addition, peer review publications and conference presentations will include academic public health, criminology and policing audiences.</p>
                <p id="Par181">Development of an impact strategy and project plan for engagement with policy makers is being undertaken by the Public Policy Research Facility at the UoS. The findings of the study will directly inform police decision makers at operational and strategic level across Hampshire and in other police forces. The study also has the potential to inform decisions at the level of the Crown Prosecution Service, Government legislators, where community outcomes like Gateway are part of the suite of mandated outcomes for offences.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par182">The design of this novel study has evolved in response to real-world challenges requiring pragmatic adaptions. These have included revision of recruitment eligibility and increasing site participation; tailoring consent processes to accommodate the legal basis of police processes in line with UK GDPR regulations and changing the mode of contacting and engaging with our hard-to-reach study population.</p>
              <p id="Par183">In addition to living through the current pandemic, the changes in restrictions also impacted police practice. We have responded positively to each of these as appropriate, often with exploratory mitigating strategies. Barriers to participation will continue to be addressed, particularly for those participants in education, who work and/or with childcare commitments, are unemployed or are experiencing mental health difficulties. The above scenarios have been encountered in the pilot. Our PPI representatives have provided valuable advice in addressing many issues already and we will continue to seek their advice on mitigating barriers.</p>
              <p id="Par184">Lockdown measures prompted a change from initial face to face meetings with participants to engagement by telephone. Responses so far suggest a preference for over-the-phone interviews. Gathering of data with consent across both groups has not been done before using this methodology in this age group, with a non-recidivism primary endpoint.</p>
              <p id="Par185">The research processes have been successfully integrated with police usual processes. Challenges still arise; however, the increased level of communication and commitment by our co-production approach already demonstrates potential for future collaborations.</p>
              <p id="Par186">The pandemic has been a major driver for the current design of this pragmatic trial and the recruitment and retention strategies adopted. These have enabled recruitment and data collection during lockdowns and social distancing, future proofing for the duration of the remaining recruitment period during continued uncertain times.</p>
              <p id="Par187">Multi-agency collaboration remains at the heart of the Gateway programme and delivery of this RCT. This unique study is expected to contribute robust evidence to allow local and national Police Commissioners to evaluate the possible benefits not just in the primary outcome of mental health, but on recidivism. The results will be used to inform policy decisions and best practice for similar interventions across the UK.</p>

              <title>Trial status</title>
              <p id="Par188">The current UoS REC-approved version of the protocol is version 2.9, 20 May 2021. This manuscript is a restructured and edited version of the current protocol to comply with the SPIRIT guidelines. Recruitment into the Gateway trial commenced in 1 October 2019 and the internal pilot phase was successfully completed. National restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of recruitment from 22 March 2020 to 4 September 2020. Recruitment is ongoing at the time of manuscript submission, and to date, 163/334 participants have been randomised (2021). As a result of delays in study setup and lower than anticipated recruitment rates, a request for a funded extension has been submitted to NIHR PHR with an anticipated recruitment completion date of September 2023.</p>
