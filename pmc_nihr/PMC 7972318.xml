                  <p>Azithromycin, an antibiotic with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has been used to treat COVID-19, but evidence from community randomised trials is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone. The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. 402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days. We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI −0·56 to 2·43). The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23. 16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI −1·7 to 2·2). There were no deaths in either study group. Safety outcomes were similar in both groups. Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.</p>

                  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed on Jan 24, 2021, using the following search terms [(randomised OR trial) AND (azithromycin OR macrolide) AND (COVID* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV)], with no language restrictions, and identified 243 results. Adding a filter for clinical trials limited the number of results to 16. Of these, we identified two randomised clinical trials with over 100 participants that provided some data on the effectiveness of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with control treatment or usual care. Additional searches of medRxiv and Google Scholar on Jan 24, 2021, using similar search terms with no language restrictions, identified a further randomised clinical trial of azithromycin. All identified trials were in hospitalised patients. A large randomised trial among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK found no difference in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay or treatment in hospital, or intensive care unit admissions among 2582 participants randomly assigned to receive azithromycin versus 5181 participants randomly assigned to receive usual care alone. A randomised trial in Brazil among 675 patients admitted to hospital with mild to moderate COVID-19 found no difference in clinical status by 15 days among patients randomly assigned to receive usual care plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine versus usual care plus hydroxychloroquine, versus usual care alone. A trial by the same group, among 447 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19, found that patients randomly assigned to azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, versus hydroxychloroquine alone, had poorer clinical status at 15 days, although outcomes were more similar between the two groups by 29 days. We identified no randomised clinical trials of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 in the community.</p>

                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para60">All three randomised clinical trials that we identified were in hospital settings, and only one assessed azithromycin as a standalone therapy for COVID-19. To our knowledge, PRINCIPLE is the first randomised trial to assess the effectiveness and safety of azithromycin as a standalone treatment for patients with COVID-19 in the community. We found that azithromycin did not substantially improve time to recovery and found little evidence of an effect on admissions to hospital, when used in the community to treat COVID-19.</p>

                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Taken together, our findings plus the evidence to date suggest that azithromycin is not a sufficiently effective treatment to justify routine use for treatment of COVID-19, neither in the community nor in hospitals.</p>

              </p>
              <p id="para90">Randomised trials have found that azithromycin is not an effective treatment for patients who are admitted to hospital with COVID-19, either alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of azithromycin for treatment of suspected COVID-19 in the community, where earlier treatment might speed recovery and prevent hospital admissions.

                <p id="para100">PRINCIPLE is the UK National Urgent Public Health Priority open-label, multi-group, prospective, adaptive platform, randomised clinical trial in community care. A platform trial is an adaptive clinical trial in which multiple treatments for the same disease can be tested simultaneously. Participants are randomly assigned to either usual care or an intervention, where an intervention consists of the intervention active agent plus usual care. A master protocol defines prospective decision criteria to allow for stopping an intervention for futility, declaring an intervention superior, or adding a new intervention to be evaluated.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Interventions currently or previously evaluated in PRINCIPLE include hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, doxycycline, and inhaled budesonide. Here, we report outcomes for azithromycin, which was the second intervention included in the trial.</p>
                <p id="para110">People in the community were eligible if they were aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with comorbidities, and with ongoing symptoms from PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (in accordance with the UK National Health Service [NHS] syndromic case definition of high temperature, a new, continuous cough, or a change in sense of smell or taste).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Symptoms must have started within the past 14 days. Comorbidities required for eligibility in those aged 50–65 years were as follows: known weakened immune system due to a serious illness or medication (eg, chemotherapy); known heart disease or a diagnosis of high blood pressure; known asthma or lung disease; known diabetes; known mild hepatic impairment; or known stroke or neurological problems. People were ineligible to be randomly assigned between azithromycin and usual care if they were already receiving acute antibiotics, or had a contraindication to azithromycin as identified in the summary of product characteristics and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bnf.nice.org.uk/" id="interrefs10">British National Formulary</ext-link>.</p>
                <p id="para120">Initially, eligible individuals were recruited, screened, and enrolled through participating general practices. From May 17, 2020, people across the UK were able to enrol online or by telephone with study team support. After patients completed a baseline and screening questionnaire, a clinician or trained research nurse confirmed eligibility using the patient's primary care medical record, accessed remotely where necessary, before randomisation. Given the increased risk from COVID-19 among Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> we actively reached out to a range of religious and community organisations at national and regional levels to increase participation from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                <p id="para130">The trial was approved by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the South Central—Berkshire Research Ethics Committee under the authority of the United Kingdom Ethics Committee Authority under the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (ethics reference 20/SC/0158). Online informed consent was obtained from all participants, with the opportunity to discuss queries with the trial team by telephone. The trial is coordinated by the Oxford Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford (Oxford, UK), and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization—Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para140">Participants were randomly assigned using an in-house, secure, fully validated and compliant web-based randomisation system called Sortition (version 2.3). Initially, randomisation was fixed at 1:1 allocation between usual care plus azithromycin and usual care alone, with stratification by age (&lt;65 years <italic>vs</italic> ≥65 years) and presence of comorbidities (yes <italic>vs</italic> no). After doxycycline was added to the trial on July 24, 2020, subsequent randomisation ratios were determined via response adaptive randomisation through regularly scheduled interim analyses. Details for implementing response adaptive randomisation were prespecified in the adaptive design report; the general idea is to allocate more participants to the intervention groups that have the best observed time to first recovery outcomes (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 77</xref>). The trial team was masked to the randomisation ratios.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">The intervention presented in this manuscript is oral azithromycin 500 mg once daily for three days plus usual care, compared with usual care alone. Usual care in the NHS for suspected COVID-19 in the community is largely supportive and focused on managing symptoms.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Antibiotics are only recommended for use if bacterial pneumonia is suspected, in which case guidelines recommend doxycycline.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Azithromycin was either prescribed or issued directly by the participant's general practitioner (GP), or issued centrally by the trial team and delivered to the participant. Azithromycin 500 mg is commonly used in primary care for bacterial respiratory infections and is similar to the dose used in early studies for COVID-19.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para160">The PRINCIPLE trial initially had two groups, with 1:1 allocation between usual care and hydroxychloroquine. The first participant was recruited on April 2, 2020, and the hydroxychloroquine group of the trial was closed by the UK MHRA on May 22, 2020, at which point azithromycin was introduced. Participants were followed up by responding to questions about their symptoms, antibiotic use, and use of health-care services in a daily, online diary for 28 days after random assignment, supplemented with telephone calls on days 2, 14, and 28. Participants were encouraged to nominate a friend, relative, or carer to be a study partner, who could help them provide follow-up data, and be contacted for information if the participant was unable to complete the daily diary themselves. We obtained consent to ascertain relevant outcome data from GP and hospital records about hospital assessments, admissions, intensive care treatment, and mechanical ventilation. We aimed to give all participants the opportunity to provide a self-swab test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, analysed by the Public Health England virology reference laboratory but, because of supply issues during the early stages of the pandemic, swabs were not available for all participants.</p>

                <p id="para170">The trial commenced with a single primary outcome: hospitalisation or death within 28 days. However, the proportions of people in the community requiring hospitalisation were much lower in the UK than seen in initial data from China, meaning a different outcome would be required to allow rapid evaluation of various interventions within reasonable sample sizes.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The trial management and steering committees therefore recommended that the primary outcome be amended to include a measure of illness duration.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This change was approved by the research ethics committee and the MHRA on September 16, 2020, and implemented before any interim analyses were done. Thus, the trial has coprimary endpoints, as follows: time to first self-reported recovery within 28 days from random assignment, with time to recovery defined as the first instance that a participant reported feeling recovered (ascertained by answering the question, “Do you feel recovered today? ie, symptoms associated with illness are no longer a problem. Yes/No”); and hospital admission or death within 28 days of random assignment. Data for the time to recovery outcome were collected from the daily diary filled in by participants. Hospital admission and death data were collected from the daily diary, medical notes obtained either directly from GPs or via the Oxford Royal College of General Practice Research and Surveillance Centre,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and also the Secondary Uses Service provided by the UK NHS Digital.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> These data were centrally processed by the trial data management team.</p>
                <p id="para180">Secondary outcomes were a rating of how well participants felt (“How well are you feeling today? Please rate how you are feeling now using a scale of 1–10, where 1 is the worst you can imagine, and 10 is the best you can imagine”); time to sustained recovery (date participant first reported feeling recovered and subsequently remained well until 28 days after random assignment); time to initial alleviation of symptoms; time to sustained alleviation of symptoms (date participant first reported all symptoms as minor or none, with no subsequent increase in symptoms until 28 days after random assignment); time to initial reduction of severity of symptoms; contacts with health services; hospital assessment without admission; oxygen administration; intensive care unit admission; mechanical ventilation (components of the WHO ordinal scale); prescription of antibiotics other than the trial antibiotics; effects in those with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection; and the WHO-5 Well-Being Index.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The WHO-5 Well-Being Index includes five items relating to wellbeing measured on a five-point scale (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 210</xref>). A total score is computed by summing the scores to the five individual questions to give a raw score ranging from 0 to 25, which is then multiplied by 4 to give the final score, with 0 representing the worst imaginable wellbeing and 100 representing the best imaginable wellbeing. We measured sustained recovery and sustained alleviation of symptoms because of the recurrent nature of COVID-19 illness.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para200">For the primary outcome analyses, assuming a median time to first recovery of 9 days in the usual care alone group, around 400 participants per group (800 participants in total if only a single intervention <italic>vs</italic> usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a difference of 2 days in median time to first recovery (approximate hazard ratio [HR] 1·3). Additionally, around 1500 participants per group (3000 participants in total if only a single intervention <italic>v</italic>s usual care alone) would be required to provide 90% power for detecting a 50% reduction in the relative risk of hospitalisation or death, assuming a hospitalisation rate of 5% in the control group and 2·5% in the intervention group. These calculations are approximations that do not explicitly account for adaptations of the platform design. In the adaptive design report (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 68–80</xref>), we provide a more complete justification of sample size by simulating the operating characteristics of the adaptive design in multiple scenarios, which explicitly account for response adaptive randomisation, early stopping for futility or success, and multiple interventions.</p>
                <p id="para210">The primary analysis population is defined as all eligible randomly assigned participants for whom data were available, with participants analysed according to the groups they were randomly allocated to, regardless of deviation from the protocol and irrespective of their COVID-19 status.</p>
                <p id="para220">The first coprimary outcome, time to first recovery, was analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential model regressed on treatment and stratification covariates (age and comorbidity), and included parameters for time interval (0–7 days, 8–14 days, 15–21 days, and &gt;21 days from random allocation). The second coprimary outcome, hospitalisation or death, was analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model regressed on treatment and stratification covariates (age and comorbidity). We included these stratification covariates in the primary analysis as response adaptive randomisation increases the risk of imbalance on these variables. The coprimary outcomes were evaluated using a so-called gate-keeping strategy. For a given treatment, the hypothesis for the time to first recovery endpoint was evaluated first and, if the recovery null hypothesis was rejected, the hypothesis for the second coprimary endpoint of hospitalisation or death was evaluated. This gate-keeping strategy preserves the overall type I error of the primary endpoints without additional adjustments for multiple hypotheses. In the context of multiple interim analyses, the master protocol specified each null hypothesis to be rejected if the Bayesian posterior probability of superiority exceeded 0·99 for the time to recovery endpoint and 0·975 (via gate-keeping) for the hospitalisation or death endpoint. Based on trials of antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infection,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> a minimum of 1·5 days difference in median time to first self-reported recovery and 2% point difference in hospitalisation or mortality were considered to be clinically meaningful and were prespecified in the adaptive design report.</p>
                <p id="para230">Per the prespecified protocol, the primary analysis model included all participants randomly allocated to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, and other trial interventions, from the start of random assignment in the platform to the time of the last random allocation to azithromycin (Nov 30, 2020). Data were extracted from the database after all randomly allocated participants had the opportunity to complete 28 days follow-up. Because this population included participants randomly assigned to usual care alone before the azithromycin group was opened, the time to recovery model also includes parameters to adjust for temporal drift in the study population. This adjustment can capture temporal drift due to changes in SARS-CoV-2, usual care, or the pandemic situation, as well as changes in the inclusion or exclusion criteria over time, when including participants receiving non-concurrent usual care in the analyses.</p>
                <p id="para240">We did sensitivity analyses of the primary outcomes on the concurrent randomisation analysis population, defined as all participants who were randomly assigned to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, or other interventions only during the time interval when azithromycin was open to random allocation. Analyses of the coprimary outcomes for the concurrent randomisation analysis population were done using the same methods as described for the primary analysis population. Analysis of the secondary outcomes was done in the concurrent randomisation analysis population, but restricted to those in the azithromycin plus usual care and usual care alone groups only. Secondary time-to-event outcomes were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models, and binary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression, adjusting for comorbidity status, age, duration of illness, and eligibility for azithromycin at baseline. We did not adjust for baseline covariates for outcomes with low event rates. We did prespecified subgroup analyses of time to recovery for baseline severity score and duration of illness before random assignment, age, comorbidity, and SARS-CoV-2, using the concurrent randomisation analysis population to assess whether treatment effects varied across subgroups.</p>
                <p id="para250">We also did secondary analyses restricted to participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, for the primary outcomes among the primary analysis population, and for the secondary outcomes in the concurrent randomisation analysis population. We compared serious adverse events in the as treated population (ie, the treatment that the participants received).</p>

An addendum to the plan was later added for further clarification of the analyses (pp 208–209). The adaptive design report details the analysis of the coprimary outcomes, including prespecified decisions at the interim analysis (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 68</xref>). Because of concerns over trial integrity and confidentiality, we only present results corresponding to the primary analysis result and corresponding secondary outcomes and sensitivity for azithromycin, as randomisation and follow-up have been completed. Results from other trial groups will be presented in separate manuscripts when randomisation and follow-up is complete for each group. We did not explore the potential impact of missing data because of the high proportion of participants contributing to the analysis of primary outcomes (94%).</p>

              <p id="para290">On Nov 30, 2020, after review of planned interim analyses by the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee, the PRINCIPLE Trial Steering Committee advised the Trial Management Group to stop random assignment of patients to the azithromycin group of the trial because the prespecified futility criterion was met. By this date, 2265 participants from 1460 GP practices were enrolled into PRINCIPLE across the UK (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 210</xref>). 679 (30%) of 2265 participants were enrolled directly through 231 GP practices and 1586 (70%) participants via online or telephone contact with the study team. 540 participants were randomly allocated to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. After exclusion of those who were ineligible, those who withdrew consent, and those without medical notes review and with no diary information available, 526 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin plus usual care, 862 to usual care alone, and 823 to other interventions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. The concurrent randomisation analysis population included data from all participants randomly assigned to azithromycin plus usual care (n=500), and those concurrently assigned to usual care alone (n=629) for analysis of secondary outcomes, plus participants assigned to other interventions (n=607) for sensitivity analyses of coprimary outcomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial profile</p><p>GP=general practitioner. *Participants provided no diary information.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p>

Only around three-quarters of participants reported feeling recovered within 28 days, reflecting emerging evidence concerning the long-term nature of COVID-19 symptoms.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Furthermore, recovery is not always sustained and COVID-19 symptoms can recur or relapse,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> which we measured using the secondary outcomes of sustained recovery and symptom alleviation. We did not assess the potential effects of azithromycin on long-term outcomes beyond 28 days.</p>
              <p id="para420">We included patients with no SARS-CoV-2 PCR results because this reflects many primary care settings, where timely testing might not be available. At the beginning of the trial, shortages of swabs and restricted community testing resulted in a high proportion of participants with no timely SARS-CoV-2 test result available. We do not know how many participants who did not have a test, or who tested negative with a self-swab, might have tested positive if the swab had been taken by a health-care professional or earlier in their illness. Increased test availability has meant that the prevalence of known SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants enrolling into PRINCIPLE is now much higher. However, in the present analysis, only 434 (31%) of 1388 participants with suspected COVID-19 had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In analyses of the primary outcomes restricted to this group, the estimated benefits of azithromycin remained below the predefined thresholds of clinically meaningful benefit. The low proportion of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections reflects the management of COVID-19 in UK primary care at the time of the study, when testing was not always available to many patients, and might reflect current practice in other community settings or low-income hospital settings, where access to timely SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing remains restricted and early empirical treatment might be used in symptomatic patients. This approach is supported by primary care data, which suggest that during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, mortality was similar among people with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and people with COVID-19 diagnosed clinically by GPs.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para430">Our trial was open label, as the study question concerned whether the addition of azithromycin to usual care was effective, rather than a comparison between azithromycin and placebo. In the context of a rapidly adapting platform trial, it would be logistically difficult to produce a placebo for the multiple drug treatments that are being added to PRINCIPLE as new evidence emerges. As participants were not masked to the intervention, self-reported outcomes might have been influenced by a placebo effect, although the effect of masking on estimates of effect has not been clearly shown.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In our study, any potential placebo effect will have probably biased results towards a positive effect of azithromycin, meaning our finding of no effect on self-reported time to first recovery is robust to potential type II error. Our findings were similar for the hospitalisation or death outcome, which is less susceptible to ascertainment bias.</p>
              <p id="para440">In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.</p>
