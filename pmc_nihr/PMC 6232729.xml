            <p>Lowering blood glucose (BG) to a safe but effective range is important in the treatment
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but age and functional status should be taken into
account when setting treatment goals.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> National and international
guidelines now recommend individualized glycemic targets aligned with functional status
for people with T2DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr5-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The American
Geriatric Society and the American Diabetes Association recommend an A1C target of 7.5%
to 8.0% for most older adults, and of 8.0% to 9.0% in older adults with multiple
comorbidities, poor health, and limited life expectancy.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Older individuals are at higher risk of developing hypoglycemia which is often
under-recognized in this population and may be associated with severe consequences such
as falls, cognitive impairment, and hospitalization.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia can have significant physical and cognitive
effects, and lead ultimately to frailty, disability and increased mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Several treatments that exert glucose-dependent action but do not increase hypoglycemia
risk<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (eg,
dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor agonists [GLP-1 RA] and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitors) are
available. However, older patients are commonly treated with medications that exert a
non-glucose-dependent action, such as sulfonylureas and insulin, which may confer a
higher risk of hypoglycaemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="bibr12-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr13-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Hypoglycemia can be difficult to diagnose in older adults and can easily be missed by
intermittent BG monitoring.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Emerging data suggest that all hypoglycemic events may be clinically relevant.
For example, both severe hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia are associated with an
increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Unrecognized hypoglycemic episodes
and nocturnal hypoglycemia are of particular concern in older patients with T2DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the magnitude of this potential problem is not well characterized
in these individuals.</p>
            <p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices record interstitial glucose values frequently
and are therefore particularly useful for identification of asymptomatic and nocturnal
hypoglycemic episodes.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In addition, CGM is a useful tool for investigating glycemic variability (GV),
which has been associated with the development of microvascular complications in T2DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p>

antihyperglycemic treatment strategies in vulnerable (moderately ill and/or frail) older
(≥65 years) individuals with suboptimally controlled T2DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Strategy A used oral and injectable therapies that do not stimulate insulin
secretion when BG reaches normal/low values (a glucose-dependent mode of action). GLP-1
RA was a preferred first-line injectable. Sulfonylureas and insulin were excluded.
Strategy B used treatments that exert their glucose-lowering effect irrespective of
prevailing glycemia; sulfonylureas were the preferred oral antihyperglycemic medication
(OAM) and insulin the preferred first-line injectable therapy (non-glucose-dependent
agents). The study results showed similar proportions of older, vulnerable patients with
T2DM achieved/maintained glycemic treatment goals without clinically significant
hypoglycemia with Strategy A or Strategy B. However, glucose-dependent therapies as
expected, resulted in lower risk of total, documented symptomatic and asymptomatic
hypoglycemia.</p>
            <p>This CGM substudy of IMPERIUM was conducted to better characterize the duration and
percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia for the 2 treatment strategies evaluated in the
main study.</p>

                <p>A detailed description of the main study design and results has been reported.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In brief, this randomized, multinational, open-label, in-label,
active-controlled, parallel group study involved moderately ill and/or frail
older patients. This study compared the efficacy of 2 treatment strategies in
achieving/maintaining glycemic control without “clinically significant
hypoglycemia,” defined as severe hypoglycemia or repeated hypoglycemia causing
interruption of patients’ activities or BG &lt;54 mg/dL.</p>
                <p>The primary objective of this CGM substudy was to compare the impact of the 2
treatment strategies (A and B) studied in the IMPERIUM trial on duration of time
(in minutes) and percentage of time spent with a BG ≤70 mg/dL during the 24-hour
period. The secondary objectives were to compare the impact of the 2 treatment
strategies on the following outcome measures: (1) duration and percentage of
time spent during a 24-hour period for hypoglycemia (BG ≤70 mg/dL or ≤54 mg/dL),
euglycemia (BG ≥71 to ≤180 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt;180 mg/dL); (2)
duration and percentage of time spent with hypoglycemia (BG ≤70 mg/dL and ≤54
mg/dL) during the nocturnal period (midnight to 0600 hours); (3) mean glucose
level during a 24-hour period; (4) BG level variability during a 24-hour
period.</p>
                <p>The study was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Science
International Ethical Guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization
Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                <p>CGM was offered to a subgroup of patients in the IMPERIUM study at multiple study
sites. All patients participating in the CGM substudy had to meet the inclusion
criteria for the main IMPERIUM study listed below. In addition, patients were
required to be willing to wear a CGM device without interruption for ≥72 hours
and have a normal wake/sleep pattern. Patients participating in the CGM substudy
signed a CGM substudy-specific informed consent form at visit 1.</p>
                <p>Patients (male or female) eligible for the IMPERIUM study were ≥65 years with
T2DM, HbA1c &gt;7.3% and &lt;10.9% and ≥0.4% higher than the upper limit of the
individualized target range set at screening. Patients were assessed according
to established frailty scales (Clinical Frailty Scale [CFS])<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and comorbidities (Total Illness Burden Index [TIBI])<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and were required to have a CFS score ≥4 and/or a TIBI score ≥5. Patients
could enroll if before study entry they were treated with diet and exercise
(only if metformin contraindicated) or for ≥3 months received OAMs, as
monotherapy/dual combination: sulfonylurea (any dose); maximally
tolerated/effective doses of metformin (≥1500 mg/day), DPP-4 inhibitor (any
marketed dose), thiazolidinedione (≥30 mg/day of pioglitazone/≥4 mg/day of
rosiglitazone), or acarbose (≥75 mg/day).</p>
                <p>Individualized treatment targets (HbA1c 7.5% to 7.9%, 7.0% to 7.4%, or &lt;7%)
were chosen before randomization (at screening) and based primarily on life
expectancy, hypoglycemic burden/risk, comorbidities, and cognitive/functional
status. These guidelines are described in more detail in the IMPERIUM study manuscript.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Marketed OAMs and injectable glucose-lowering treatments were used across
different lines of treatment in each strategy, beginning with a single OAM and
progressing to 3 OAMs, and/or first-line injectable therapy. Patients randomized
to Strategy A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1932296818776993">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>) were excluded from sulfonylurea and
insulin therapy. If OAMs were not effective and injectable treatment was
indicated, Strategy A patients commenced available GLP-1 RA therapy (exenatide
twice-daily, exenatide once-weekly, or liraglutide at the discretion of the
investigator). Patients randomized to Strategy B (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1932296818776993">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>) were treated with glimepiride as part of
any OAM treatment (monotherapy, dual, or triple combination) and insulin
glargine (Lantus®) as first-line injectable treatment. Treatments were titrated
throughout the study until the maximally tolerated and/or approved doses or
preset, individualized HbA1c target were reached. If maximally tolerated and/or
approved doses were reached but individualized HbA1c targets were not met,
next-line therapy was initiated by adding another treatment. The treatment
strategies are described in more detail in the IMPERIUM study manuscript.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Enrollment in the IMPERIUM study began in February 2014, and the last patient
completed/data cutoff in October 2015. The CGM substudy was conducted during the
first 24 weeks of the IMPERIUM study. Patients were asked to perform CGM on 2
occasions, for 72 hours per occasion, within 10 days prior to randomization
(Visit 2) and 24 weeks of treatment (Visit 6) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1932296818776993">Supplementary Figure 1</ext-link>). A Medtronic iPro 2 CGM system
(Northridge, CA) was used. Trained investigative staff inserted the CGM device
according to the product directions for use. Patients were trained on the use of
the CGM device and the requirements for CGM, including the need to maintain a
diary and collect self-monitoring blood glucose readings. Patients were blinded
to the CGM results during the study. All patients who were enrolled in this
addendum and received at least 1 dose of study drug and had CGM results from at
least 1 collection time point were included in these analyses.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analyses</title>
                <p>All endpoints were prespecified. A total of 40 patients (54 randomized) with
valid CGM measurements were required to provide 80% power to detect a difference
between treatment groups of 130 minutes of hypoglycemia ≤70 mg/dL, assuming a
standard deviation of 140 minutes and a two-sided type I error of .05. Analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were applied to
treatment-arm comparisons of duration (in minutes) and percentage of time spent
in prespecified glycemic ranges before randomization (baseline) and week 24.
Covariates included treatment strategy, treatment target, country, prestudy OAM,
and prestudy sulfonylurea use. BG variability was assessed using within-day
standard deviation, and within-day and between-day coefficient of variance.
ANOVA and ANCOVA were applied to treatment-arm comparisons of mean BG and BG
variability at baseline and week 24.</p>

              <p>We describe the first report on glucose variability utilizing CGM in a specific
population of vulnerable (moderately ill and/or frail) older (≥65 years) individuals
with suboptimally controlled T2DM. This IMPERIUM substudy showed similar duration
and percentage of time spent with hypoglycemia at ≤70 mg/dL for newer
glucose-dependent versus traditional non-glucose-dependent treatment strategies.
Glycemic control improved similarly in both arms, and duration and percentage time
spent with euglycemia and hyperglycemia were also similar in both arms. However, the
glucose-dependent strategy was associated with lower within- and between-day BG
variability.</p>
              <p>The use of CGM, including real-time CGM, has been reported to reduce episodes of
severe hypoglycemia and improve quality of life in older patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, most studies to date have evaluated use of CGM in older patients
with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). There have been very few studies on CGM use in
older patients with T2DM who do not use injectable therapy. In addition, a
significant barrier for many patients, especially older patients who may be on a
fixed income, is lack of insurance coverage for CGM in patients with T2DM. A recent
CGM study showed that HbA1c levels are not associated with hypoglycemia risk in
older patients with T2DM on insulin therapy, and that higher HbA1c goals do not
protect against hypoglycemia.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with a post hoc analysis of the Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial which showed an increased
risk of hypoglycemia in patients with poorer glycemic control.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In the current study, at baseline, there were large differences between
patients in daily glucose control and in time spent in hypoglycemia. These
differences could not have been appreciated without the use of CGM.</p>
              <p>One of the benefits of CGM is the ability to characterize GV. GV increases with age<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and is thought to be a predictor of complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> A recent systematic literature review suggests that in patients with T2DM, GV
is associated with increased risk of microvascular complications (eg, retinopathy)
and with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications (eg, coronary artery disease).<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Severe hypoglycemia is associated with higher GV, but not lower HbA1c or mean
glucose levels, in older patients with T1DM.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In older patients with T2DM, impairment of cognitive performance is
associated with higher GV independent of HbA1c and glucose levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> A recent subanalysis of the Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin
Degludec vs Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of
Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE), showed that higher day-to-day fasting GV is
associated with increased risks of severe hypoglycemia and all-cause mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> It has been suggested that minimizing GV may be equally as important as
preventing hypoglycemia in older patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Some have suggested that GV may be as important as traditional measures of
glycemic control, such as HbA1c and BG, for optimal glycemic control.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Recent recommendations suggest that variables other than HbA1c such as GV, be
used to adequately describe glucose control and to tailor individualized approaches
for patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> The findings of reduced GV (within-day and between-day types)
with Strategy A compared with Strategy B in the current study are of interest
because of the aforementioned associations of GV with complications. In the main
IMPERIUM study,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> the low overall risk of severe hypoglycemia, driven by conservative use of
therapies and also because patients were less prone to developing hypoglycemia than
originally assumed, may explain why the reduced GV findings were not reflected in
the severe hypoglycemia findings. A treatment strategy which reduces GV may be
particularly beneficial in older patients with T2DM, who are often vulnerable
because of comorbid conditions and/or frailty.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, the clinical
significance of these findings needs to be assessed in future studies which should
include more thorough CGM evaluations in larger patient groups.</p>
              <p>While our study is the first of its kind in this population of older adults, we
acknowledge several limitations which include the small sample size that contributed
to the large numerical variations within arms and the large numerical differences
between arms, especially for baseline hypoglycemia duration. An additional
limitation, which was also acknowledged in the main IMPERIUM study,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1932296818776993" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> is that enrolled patients were generally younger and less frail than
anticipated for Strategies-A and B (mean CFS, 4.0 and 4.1; mean TIBI, 4.0 and 3.8,
respectively), and findings may not be reflective of those in very frail and/or very
old patients. In addition, two-thirds of patients were taking sulfonylureas at
baseline which meant that we presumably selected for patients who did not develop
severe/symptomatic hypoglycemia on sulfonylureas. Finally, our study demonstrates
that in a randomized controlled trial setting, and in the hands of experienced
investigators, despite treatment intensification for 24 weeks (HbA1c reduction of
−1.2% and −1.4% for Strategy A and Strategy B, respectively) time spent in
hypoglycemia remained low (6 minutes and 20 minutes/24 hours, BG ≤70 mg/dl for
Strategy A and Strategy B, respectively) irrespective of the treatment strategy.</p>
