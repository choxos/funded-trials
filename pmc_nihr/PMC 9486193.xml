                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, life-threatening disease caused by excessive activation of part of the immune system called complement. Eculizumab is an effective treatment, controlling aHUS in 90% of patients. Due to the risk of relapse, lifelong treatment is currently recommended. Eculizumab treatment is not without problems, foremost being the risk of severe meningococcal infection, the burden of biweekly intravenous injections and the high cost.</p>
                  <p>This paper describes the design of the Stopping Eculizumab Treatment Safely in aHUS trial that aims to establish whether a safety monitoring protocol, including the reintroduction of eculizumab for those who relapse, could be a safe, alternative treatment strategy for patients with aHUS.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a multicentre, non-randomised, open-label study of eculizumab withdrawal with continuous monitoring of thrombotic microangiopathy-related serious adverse events using the Bayes factor single-arm design. 30 patients will be recruited to withdraw from eculizumab and have regular blood and urine tests for 24 months, to monitor for disease activity. If relapse occurs, treatment will be restarted within 24 hours of presentation. 20 patients will remain on treatment and complete health economic questionnaires only. An embedded qualitative study will explore the views of participants.</p>

                  <p>A favourable ethical opinion and approval was obtained from the North East-Tyne &amp; Wear South Research Ethics Committee. Outcomes will be disseminated via peer-reviewed articles and conference presentations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) is a severe, life-threatening disease characterised by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and acute kidney injury (AKI), and other organ involvement. Historically, it is associated with a poor prognosis, with 50% of patients developing end-stage kidney disease or dying in the first year after presentation<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and a high risk of disease recurrence after kidney transplantation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Prior to 2011, treatment options were limited and relied on plasma infusion or exchange, but in many cases this treatment failed to influence the course of disease<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and was itself associated with significant morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the UK, the incidence of aHUS is 0.4â€“0.5 cases per million per year.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>The complement system is part of the innate immune system and in healthy individuals is tightly regulated to prevent excessive activation. In 60%â€“70% of patients with aHUS, a genetic variant or autoantibody-increasing complement activation can be identified.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In these patients, excessive activation of complement leads to endothelial injury and thrombus formation. The underlying genetic variant that predisposes to disease has an influence on the severity of disease and the likelihood of recurrent disease developing after transplantation.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits the function of C5, an important protein involved in complement activation. Two uncontrolled, open-label trials involving 36 adult and adolescent patients demonstrated the efficacy of eculizumab treatment for aHUS over a 26-week period.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Additional prospective studies in children<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and adults<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> confirmed efficacy. Follow-up of the original cohort suggests that treatment for 2 years is associated with good, longer-term clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> On the basis of the initial trial results, eculizumab was approved for the treatment of aHUS by the European Medicines Agency<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and US Food and Drug Administration<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> in 2011. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published its evaluation in 2015, recommending that eculizumab should be used for the treatment of aHUS.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A recommendation in the NICE evaluation was that funding was on the condition that there was a â€˜research programme with robust methods to evaluate when stopping treatment or dose adjustment might occurâ€™.</p>
              <p>Complement is part of the immune system, therefore, treatment with eculizumab is immunosuppressive, in particular, increasing the risk of <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria meningitidis</italic> infection (1â€“2000-fold).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14</xref> All patients are vaccinated against meningococcal infection before starting eculizumab and in the UK continuous prophylactic antibiotics are recommended. Despite these recommendations, there have been six cases of meningococcal infection in the UK in patients on eculizumab treatment for aHUS. We are also aware of uncommon infections occurring in this group (enteroviral pneumonitis and herpes simplex meningitis), but whether these are attributable to eculizumab treatment is unclear.</p>
              <p>Although there have been reports of patients relapsing after the withdrawal of treatment,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> there is increasing evidence that continuous treatment is not required for all patients. From experience prior to the introduction of eculizumab, the risk of relapse is greatest in the period immediately after first presentation with 82% of relapses in adults, and 57% of relapses in children occurring within the first year after disease onset. Beyond the first year, only a further 20% of patients will relapse in the subsequent 5â€“10 years.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Therefore, a proportion of patients will not relapse after their initial presentation and will be on eculizumab unnecessarily. In addition, with monitoring for relapse and early reintroduction of treatment, complications from relapse can be avoided.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16â€“18</xref></p>
              <p>In this trial, we will test the safety of eculizumab withdrawal using a Bayesian trial design. The efficacy of self-monitoring will also be tested, and we will explore patientsâ€™ and parents/legal guardiansâ€™ views on how treatment and monitoring of disease can be delivered most effectively.</p>

The specifics of this sample size are intrinsically linked to the Bayes factor single-arm binary design employed to analyse the primary outcome measure.

Based on historical data, the event rate (treatment-related SAEs in 100 patients over a 2-year period) for the standard of care is 0.06, and we expect that withdrawal of the treatment would give a rate of 0.12. This choice of rate has been informed in discussion with patients. Using this Bayesian hypothesis test-based design, we assume the rate is 0.06 under the null, and 0.12 under the alternative hypothesis.</p>

              <p>This study will determine whether it is safe to withdraw eculizumab using a trial methodology designed to detect an excess of adverse outcomes following withdrawal (primary endpoint). The study will also estimate the proportion of patients with aHUS that can be maintained off eculizumab and test a system for surveillance to identify relapse early (secondary endpoints). This will allow a costâ€“utility analysis to be conducted, exploring the impact of treatment withdrawal.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This carefully monitored patient group will allow us to determine how early subclinical relapse can be detected using standard biochemical and haematological measurements and novel biomarkers of complement activation or tissue injury. An embedded qualitative study of patients, both those who withdraw and decide not to withdraw, will explore attitudes towards treatment and its withdrawal.</p>
