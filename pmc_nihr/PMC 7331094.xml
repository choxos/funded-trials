                  <p>participating wards were randomly assigned to either the POD programme or usual care, determined by existing local policies and practices. The POD programme is a manualised multicomponent delirium prevention intervention that targets 10 risk factors for delirium. The intervention wards underwent a 6-month implementation period before trial recruitment commenced. Main outcome measure incidence of new-onset delirium measured using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) measured daily for up to 10 days post consent.</p>

Adherence to the intervention was classified as at least medium for seven wards. Rates of new-onset delirium were lower than expected and did not differ between groups (24 (7.0%) of participants in the intervention group versus 33 (8.9%) in the control group; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.68 (0.37–1.26); <italic>P</italic> = 0.2225).</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Delirium is a common and serious condition in older people associated with distress for individuals, families and health care staff [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], increased mortality, protracted lengths of hospital stay, lasting functional and cognitive decline and increased requirement for long-term care placement [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Prevention of delirium (POD) is therefore highly desirable and multicomponent prevention interventions that aim to attenuate modifiable delirium risk factors have consistently been shown to reduce incident delirium in hospitalised patients by about one third in various inpatient specialties [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref>]. As a consequence of this evidence base, several national guidance documents have recommended that multicomponent delirium prevention interventions should be incorporated into routine care [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>]. A major issue faced by the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales, and acknowledged by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], is the lack of a delirium prevention system of care suitable for widespread national implementation. To address this, we developed [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and preliminary tested [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] the POD programme based on the Hospital Elder Life Program [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and NICE guideline [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Previous multicomponent delirium prevention trials have been predominantly single centre, explanatory (‘proof of concept’) studies. Ideally, future studies should be designed and conducted as multicentre, pragmatic evaluations in which the intervention is implemented and delivered by existing ward teams rather than by research staff [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The design of such trials requires critical information, such as prior estimates of effectiveness and recruitment rates. We therefore report here a multicentre, pragmatic, cluster randomised, controlled feasibility trial to obtain preliminary estimates of effectiveness of the modified version of the POD programme (Version 2), to assess recruitment and follow-up rates and to assess adherence to the intervention (reported in a companion paper [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]).</p>

Trial methods have been fully described previously [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are summarised here. The study was approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service (reference 13/YH/0400).

                  <p>We aimed to recruit 16 care of older people and orthopaedic trauma wards in 8 NHS hospitals in England and Wales. Wards needed to be ‘site-ready’ defined as having the following: (i) involvement from a senior nurse, ward manager and voluntary services manager (if volunteers were to be part of the programme); (ii) a named person responsible for implementation of the POD programme (e.g. the senior nurse); (iii) dedicated time (equivalent to 1 day a week) of an experienced senior nurse to lead the implementation; and (iv) adequate ward staffing levels (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary A1</xref>). Wards that had participated in previous studies within the research programme or were intending to implement delirium prevention initiatives during the duration of the study were not eligible.</p>

Patients were excluded if delirium was present on admission to the ward, discharge was planned within 48 h of admission, delirium assessment had not been performed by an RA within 24 h of admission (older people’s care patients) or preoperatively (orthopaedic trauma patients), consent had not been obtained with 48 h of admission to the ward, end of life care was being provided or the patient was under the care of another ward.</p>

                  <p>Most new-onset delirium occurs in the first few days after admission [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We therefore assessed for differences in new-onset delirium within 10 days of providing consent between patients in the intervention group (POD programme) and control group (usual care) as this is the expected primary outcome for a definitive trial. Delirium was assessed using the four-item CAM [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A CAM training and monitoring process was developed that followed recommended practices [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
                  <p>We also investigated between-group differences in the number, severity [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and duration of delirium episodes; length of stay in hospital; mortality; and discharge destination. Physical and social independence were measured by the RAs at baseline and at 3 months (postal questionnaire) using the Nottingham extended activities of daily living scale [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Anxiety and depression were measured using the clinical anxiety scale [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the geriatric depression scale short form [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], respectively, at 30 days at an RA visit.</p>

                    <p>The RAs administering and collecting the outcome measures had no role in the intervention development or delivery. As RAs were visiting the wards daily to conduct delirium assessments it was unrealistic for them to remain blind to treatment allocation.

                  <p>The POD programme is a ward-based intervention that aims to affect staff skills, knowledge and clinical practice. Cluster randomisation was therefore chosen to reduce between-group contamination. Randomisation was stratified by ward type/speciality (older people’s care versus orthopaedic trauma) in a two-stage process. Hospitals were first randomised to either hospital or ward level delivery, following this, the wards in those hospitals randomised to ward-level implementation were then randomised (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary A2</xref>). Wards randomised to deliver the intervention were given 6 months to implement the POD programme followed by 6 months of intervention delivery during which patient recruitment took place.</p>

We used multilevel logistic regression that adjusted for age, gender, risk factors for delirium (medications associated with delirium, hearing impairment, visual impairment and early warning score category), cognitive impairment and/or dementia, Charlson comorbidity index, ward type. The intracluster correlation coefficient was calculated using the incidence of new-onset delirium expressed as a proportion of the recruited study population.</p>

                <p>Twenty hospitals expressed interest of which 12 returned site survey forms and eight hospitals were recruited. Of the four hospitals not recruited, two withdrew, one did not respond to the request for a site visit and one was unable to supply timely regulatory approvals. Of the 16 recruited wards, nine were older people’s care medicine (five in the intervention group and four in the control group) and seven were orthopaedic trauma (three in the intervention group and four in the control group).</p>
                <p>In 16 wards, 4449 patients were admitted and screened for eligibility of whom 3274 (73.6%) were considered initially eligible (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The principal reasons for study exclusion were prevalent delirium (12.1%) and expected duration of stay less than 48 h (7.9%). Delirium assessment was performed by the RAs on 1537 (46.9%) of initially eligible patients; the main reasons for non-assessment of delirium included the research staff missing the patient (21.1% of initially eligible) and ward staff advised not to approach (11.4%). A further 113 of these patients had delirium and were excluded. Consent to participate in the study was obtained for 714 (50.4% of 1418 patients) with 343 and 370 (10.5% and 11.3% of those eligible) participants registered to the intervention and control groups, respectively (one person was discharged before registration). Only 33 (4.6%) of participants withdrew from the study (19 (57.6%) withdrawals occurred within 10 days of providing consent).</p>

                <p>There were more patients admitted with a medical condition in the intervention group compared to the control group (211 (61.5%) versus 169 (45.7%), respectively) due to an imbalance in ward type randomisation (<xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participant demographic characteristics were similar between the arms. The intervention group had more participants with cognitive impairment/dementia than the control group (83 (24.2%) versus 67 (18.1%), respectively), and more participants who were severely ill (66 (19.2%) versus 47 (12.7%), respectively) as measured using the early warning score [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>

                  <p>Taking into account length of patient stay, deaths and withdrawals and discharges, there were a possible 5645 in-hospital CAM assessments of which 5065 (89.7%) were conducted by the RAs. The CAM scoring was informed by the AMT and the MOTYB test with completion rates of 100% and 99.5%, respectively. Out of 713, 57 (8.0%) participants developed new-onset delirium within 10 days of providing consent: 24 (7.0%) of 343 participants in the intervention group and 33 (8.9%) of 370 participants in the control group (<xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). New-onset delirium was higher in the orthopaedic trauma wards compared to the older people’s care wards (10.0% versus 6.4%, respectively) (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary A5</xref>). Delirium incidence in sites ranged between 4.6 and 12.9% (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary A5</xref>). Delirium incidence rates in those sites randomised at the hospital level were similar between the arms (2.5% intervention versus 2.3% control); for those randomised at a ward level rates were 1.6% intervention versus 1.9% control.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The multicomponent (non-pharmacological) delirium literature is dominated by small to medium sized, single site, predominantly non-randomised evaluation studies [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>] that are prone to several biases [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is the first successfully completed multicentre multicomponent delirium prevention randomised controlled trial, albeit a preliminary feasibility study. We were able to recruit a vulnerable group of patients and achieved high outcome assessment and follow-up rates. The other similar multicentre trial involved only two hospitals but was unable to recruit sufficient patients and had large amounts of missing data [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We were able to consent 714 patients from eight hospitals/16 wards over 6 months against our target of 720. Our target was based on several assumptions. We assumed that approximately 50% of patients would be at risk of developing delirium. In fact nearly three quarters of the patients on these older people’s care and orthopaedic trauma wards were at risk based on the criteria published by NICE [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We further assumed that 30% of patients eligible for the study would be recruited; in this study it was 21.8%. In practice, we found that the major barrier to recruitment was inability to conduct a baseline CAM assessment to exclude prevalent delirium, largely because some patients were judged too sick by the ward staff or because some patients were not identified for assessment within 24 h of admission (older people’s care patients) or preoperatively (orthopaedic patients). The baseline CAM assessment was not achieved for 1737/3274 (53.1%) of the apparently eligible patients. The consent rate for eligible patients for whom delirium was not present was higher than anticipated at 50.4%. The overall recruitment rate was 16% of screened patients, which was consistent with our prior assumption of 15% but the recruitment rate might be readily enhanced if there was a greater focus on RA engagement with patients during the first 24 h of admission. Losses to follow-up were low: only 4.6% of patients withdrew from study follow-up and 16.0% of patients died within the study. We did not detect high levels of contamination in those sites that included both intervention and control wards suggesting that it is possible to randomise wards within a hospital to receive different interventions. These are important findings which can be used to plan future similar studies involving this mixed population of older people’s care and orthogeriatric patients.</p>
              <p>The population recruited to this trial were older people (mean age 82.7 years, SD = 7.8); 21.0% had dementia/cognitive impairment; 67.3% had co-morbidities; 23.8% had been admitted with a hip fracture and 44.5% were taking an opiate. It might be reasonably expected, therefore, that this patient population would be at high risk for delirium [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, at least 14.6% of the 4449 patients screened (not all patients assessed due to time constraints) had prevalent delirium (delirium on admission). However, the rate of incident (new) delirium was lower than anticipated: 8% compared to 17.7% for a combined medical and orthogeriatric population reported in the randomised studies included in the Cochrane Review (<italic>N</italic> = 39 studies; <italic>n</italic> = 16,082 patients) [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The explanation for the low delirium incidence in the trial population is unclear. It is possible that greater awareness of delirium has resulted in improvements in NHS ward care and a subsequent reduction in delirium incidence. However, successive rounds of the National Audit of Dementia Care in General Hospitals have demonstrated continuing dementia and delirium care deficiencies in NHS hospitals in England and Wales [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite this, it is possible that staff and wards with a pre-existing interest in delirium prevention were more likely to participate with our study resulting in a study site selection bias and lower than anticipated rates of delirium.</p>
              <p>The low rate of delirium was not related to missing delirium assessments as the RAs completed 89.7% of expected CAM assessments during the 10 days after patient randomisation. The delirium incidence rates showed some variation between sites (4.6–12.9%). This suggests some variation in either individual RA delirium assessment performance, or differences in local care environments that influenced the development of delirium. However, the between-site variation in delirium incidence was well within, and in no case exceeded, the pooled estimate value reported in the Cochrane review.</p>
              <p>The adjusted odds ratio of 0.68 for delirium incidence for the patients randomised to the POD programme compared to usual care is entirely consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3–6</xref>]. However, the 95% CIs were wide: 0.37–1.26. This finding is not surprising as the study was not powered to provide a definitive evaluation of the POD programme. Successful implementation and delivery are critical for multicomponent interventions. Intervention adherence was classified as high in two wards, medium in five wards and low in one ward. Obviously, greater levels of intervention adherence might have influenced the effectiveness estimate of POD. However, the trial was purposefully designed as a pragmatic study, that is, ward changes were led by existing ward staff rather than research staff. The findings are therefore likely to be generalisable to delirium prevention in routine care and form a more reliable basis to plan future studies. Based on the delirium incidence rates we observed, a definitive cluster randomised study would need to be far larger than any previous multicomponent delirium prevention study. Assuming a significance level of 5%, a study power of 90%, a delirium incidence reduction of 30% (consistent with previous studies and our own), incorporating the observed control group incidence rate of 8.9%, allowing for 15% loss to follow-up, and using the unadjusted intracluster correlation coefficient value obtained here (0.0002), the trial would need to recruit 5220 patients in 26 two-ward hospital clusters (200 patients per cluster). This clearly represents a substantial trial but is the only way to obtain robust evidence of effectiveness to support or refute a national roll-out of the POD programme, or a similar intervention. The findings from our feasibility trial suggest a larger study would be achievable and provides valuable underpinning methodological information to design the study.</p>
