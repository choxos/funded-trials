              <abstract>
                <p><bold>Background:</bold> Poor response to questionnaires collecting outcome data in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can affect the validity of trial results. The aim of this study within a trial (SWAT) was to evaluate the effectiveness of including a pen with a follow-up postal questionnaire on response rate.</p>
                <p><bold>Methods:</bold> A two-armed RCT was embedded within SSHeW (Stopping Slips among Healthcare Workers), a trial of slip-resistant footwear to reduce slips in NHS staff.  Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive a pen or no pen with their follow-up questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who returned the questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were: time to response, completeness of response, and whether a postal reminder notice was required. Data were analysed using logistic regression, linear regression and Cox proportional hazards regression.</p>
                <p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 1466 SSHEW trial participants were randomised into the SWAT. In total, 13 withdrew from the host trial before they were due to be sent their follow-up questionnaire, 728 participants received a pen with their questionnaire, and 725 did not receive a pen.  A questionnaire was returned from 67.7% of the pen group and 64.7% of the group who did not receive a pen. There was no significant difference in return rates between the two groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.43, p=0.22), nor level of completeness of the questionnaires (AMD -0.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.05, p=0.77).  There was weak evidence of a reduction in the proportion of participants requiring a reminder and in time to response in the pen group.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusion: </bold>Inclusion of a pen with the follow-up postal questionnaire sent to participants in the SSHeW trial did not statistically significantly increase the response rate. These results add to the body of evidence around improving response rates in trials.</p>

              <p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are key to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and often use postal questionnaires to collect outcome data. However, low response rates can limit the validity of the trial findings by reducing the power of the study and introducing bias

                <p>A 3% difference in questionnaire response rate and an absolute difference in the percentage of participants who required a reminder of 1.1% were found. Considering these to be true effects, in order to receive one additional questionnaire, 33 participants would have to be sent a pen, at a cost of approximately 33x32p=£10.56. Approximately 91 participants would need to be sent a pen to prevent one reminder mailing and therefore to save £2.42. Hence, roughly one reminder is required per three retained participants, and the cost per retained participant is approximately £10.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Whilst the results of all outcomes in this SWAT favoured the pen group, we found that the addition of a pen did not statistically significantly increase the response rate to, or completeness of, a follow-up questionnaire sent at 14 weeks post-randomisation among participants of the SSHeW trial. There was some evidence of a reduction in time to response and the number of reminders required.</p>
              <p>It may be that, in this group of participants, the pen failed to act as a facilitator or was not a sufficient incentive to return the questionnaire, given the fact that participants in the trial already received a free pair of shoes (although offer of shoes was not conditional on returning the questionnaire).</p>
              <p>However, the trial ultimately only had about 40% power to detect a difference of 3% in response rates (from 64.7 to 67.7%) and is therefore at risk of a type II error. Another potential weakness is that, due to the select population of healthcare workers, the results may not be generalisable to other populations or contexts.</p>
              <p>The strength of this study is that it was a randomised trial.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This SWAT suggests that enclosing a pen in a questionnaire mail out may be an effective method to increase response rates but was likely underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference of the 3% observed. Since pens are inexpensive, even a small difference is likely to be cost-effective. The results contribute to the body of evidence regarding this intervention and may be included in future meta-analyses to improve power.</p>

            <body>
              <p>This paper describes the result of a SWAT embedded within the SSHeW trial. The SWAT aimed to evaluate whether including a pen with a follow-up postal questionnaire would impact questionnaire response rate. The authors indicate that previous studies have yielded mixed results. The results of this SWAT add to the body of existing evidence.</p>
              <p> The paper is clear and concise and addresses a common problem faced by trials; low response rates to questionnaires. The paper provides adequate detail for other trialists to replicate the intervention within their own trial. The inclusion of cost analyses is particularly useful.</p>
              <p> I was interested to see that the cost of including the pen was very low and would have liked an explanation of the components of the cost (cost of pen, additional cost of postage and posting materials).</p>
              <p> Like many SWATs, this SWAT was unavoidably constrained in sample size by the host trial, making conclusions difficult due to lack of power. It is unclear from the paper whether the authors expected that the sample size of 1466 was sufficient to detect an operationally important difference between groups. If not, then I suggest the conclusion be updated to make this clear, rather than stating that a statistically significant increase was not found. Would the authors suggest that further SWATs are needed in this area based on the Trial Forge guidance? (https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-019-3980-5
<sup><xref rid="rep-ref-80788-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>)</p>
              <p> Also, I suggest removing the observed power calculation from the discussion (https://lesslikely.com/statistics/observed-power-magic/ provides an explanation as to why observed power calculations should be avoided).</p>
              <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
              <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
              <p>Partly</p>
              <p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>

              <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>

              <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>

            <body>
              <p>The current study is a SWAT – a Study Within A Trial. A SWAT is a methodological study aiming to add to the evidence base for randomised controlled rial design and conduct. In a SWAT an intervention to improve the conduct of trials is tested in an ongoing ‘host’ trial.</p>
              <p> The current host trial was Stopping Slips among Healthcare Workers (SSHeW), a trial testing slip-resistant footwear with NHS Staff to reduce slips at work. The SWAT intervention was to include a pen with the follow-up questionnaire to test whether participants who received a pen were more likely to return their questionnaire than those participants who did not receive a pen. The authors also looked at whether inclusion of a pen with the questionnaire affected the time taken to send back the questionnaire; how complete they questionnaire was answered and; whether a reminder had to be sent for return of the questionnaire. The SWAT was run on the 14 week post randomisation follow-up questionnaire. All SSHEW participants were randomised into the SWAT (n=1466). There were no significant difference in return rates between the two groups but weak evidence that including a pen might make participants return the questionnaire sooner and less will need a reminder.</p>
              <p> This study reports findings contributing to the evidence base for how trial teams can increase questionnaire response rates in their trials, using the gold standard randomised comparison. This is a hugely important area as low response rates affect the conclusions that can be drawn from trial findings. Unfortunately, low questionnaire response rates are something which continues to affect a lot of trials.</p>
              <p> We have a few comments which should be addressed:</p>
              <p> ABSTRACT</p>
              <p> No comments.</p>
              <p> INTRODUCTION</p>
              <p> It would be interesting to know if the authors expected there to be an issue with the questionnaire return rate in the host trial and what was the basis of this expectation (e.g. low response rate to previous questionnaires)? Please consider adding what the expected response rate for the host trial was. This could be added in the introduction or methods according to the authors preference. Commonly, SWATs are reactive so some background information to the approach in this SWAT would provide a helpful context.  </p>
              <p> The authors mention that the pen would act as facilitator and incentive, it would be helpful to have any reference to this use as a behavioural motivator or barrier. </p>
              <p> METHODS</p>
              <p> It would be interesting to know if the investigators found any issues with posting a pack including a pen, eg additional bulk causing any issues with standard franking machines. Did any changes have to be made to the process of posting out to include the pen?</p>
              <p> RESULTS</p>
              <p> No comments.</p>
              <p> DISCUSSION</p>
              <p> Please include some consideration as to whether the timing of the incentive to return questionnaires might have affected the findings. In many trials participants are followed-up for two years or longer and that is the point when it gets really tough to keep the response rate high (reviewers’ personal experiences). It would be really valuable to have the authors thoughts on this for trial teams looking for help.</p>
              <p> Paragraph 3 -The authors list a lack of power as a limitation. We’d suggest highlighting that many SWATs will be underpowered because they are generally unable to change the size of the host trial; they are made for meta-analysis really.</p>
              <p>   </p>
              <p> CONCLUSION</p>
              <p> This is a very well conducted and clearly written article on a SWAT that investigated including a pen  to improve response rates to a questionnaire, and importantly addressed the cost effectiveness of the intervention as one of the outcomes.</p>
              <p> The results of the SWAT did not provide strong evidence in itself of the effectiveness of including a pen to improve response rates but the results add to the body of evidence and  will be important to include in meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of a pen as an incentive/facilitator in retention rates.</p>
              <p> While the pen itself is inexpensive, when it is multiplied up over the issue of thousands of questionnaires is an additional cost any trials unit would have to justify to funder. The cost for a 3% gain is £10 per retained participant according to statement in Results (Costings) so not an insubstantial amount for weak evidence of an effect. Replication of this SWAT is needed to include other settings, different timepoints etc before concluding that including a pen may be effective and cost-effective way of improving response rates. The authors should expand on this in the concluding paragraph and consider revising sentence 2 of the concluding paragraph.</p>
              <p>Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
              <p>If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate?</p>
              <p>I cannot comment. A qualified statistician is required.</p>
              <p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
              <p>Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
              <p>Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results?</p>
              <p>Partly</p>
              <p>Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?</p>
              <p>Yes</p>
