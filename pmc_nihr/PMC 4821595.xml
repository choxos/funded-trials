                  <title>Results and significance</title>
                  <p>We recruited 50 people from a range of age groups, country of origin, time in the UK, religion and socio-economic background. Some of the barriers to presentation with dementia have been reported before, but others were specific to this group and newly identified. Many people recognised forgetfulness but neither that it could be indicative of dementia, nor the concept of dementia as applying to them. Dementia was viewed as a white person’s illness. Participants felt there was little point in consulting a doctor for forgetfulness. Many thought that seeing a GP was only for severe problems. Some said that their culture was secretive and highly valued privacy of personal affairs and therefore did not want to discuss what they regarded as a private and stigmatising problem with a GP. Participants did not appreciate their GP could refer to memory services who have more time and expertise. They were concerned about harm from medication and compulsory institutionalisation. Care should be from the family. Any intervention should emphasise the legitimacy of seeing a doctor early for memory concerns, that dementia is a physical illness which also occurs in the Black community, that help and time are available from memory services whose role is to prolong independence and support families in caring.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Black African and Caribbean elders (BACE) have a higher prevalence and earlier onset of dementia compared with the indigenous White UK population [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Timely diagnosis of dementia is recommended throughout Europe [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], as it maximises autonomy including the ability to make future choices while decisional capacity is present. It also enables people to make sense of what is happening and to receive appropriate services which may extend independence while living with dementia. Nonetheless, Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups throughout the developed world present later to dementia specialist services, frequently receiving a diagnosis when the disease is already well advanced [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], often with poorer outcomes.</p>
              <p>People with dementia and their carers usually begin help-seeking from close family and then follow this up by consulting primary care physicians.” [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] People from BME populations as a whole have been reported to present later for a number of reasons. These include normalisation of memory problems, concerns about stigma related to dementia, belief that families rather than services are the appropriate resource, previous negative experiences of health services, concern about the threat of receiving a diagnosis, language barriers and lack of knowledge[<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One small study compared eighteen carers of patients with dementia from Black Caribbean or African, South Asian and White backgrounds and found that barriers to help-seeking seemed to be culturally specific [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In order to reduce healthcare inequalities, it is important that diverse needs of differing BME groups are identified [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This would help to contribute to evidence based interventions for specific BME groups. While there have been some initiatives to address these barriers to help-seeking, their outcomes have not been evaluated [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. No initiative would be universally successful as individuals vary within as well as between groups [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>While help-seeking for memory problems among minorities as a group has been extensively researched, no-one has attempted to analyse and compare the views of diverse groups of people within Black African and Caribbean British communities. We therefore aimed in this study to explore the barriers to help seeking for memory problems from a large sample of Black African and Caribbean community members and compare common and diverging opinions amongst the varied demographic groups to identify the main themes and use this information to devise, refine and evaluate an intervention to increase timely dementia diagnosis for BACE.</p>

                <title>Sample</title>
                <p>We purposively recruited Black African and Caribbean participants from community groups and subsequent snowball sampling to achieve a maximum variation sample in terms of socio-demographic characteristics. Participants were healthy adults aged over 18, without a known diagnosis of dementia. Participants were not required to have any knowledge or experience of dementia or dementia services.</p>

                <title>Procedure</title>
                <p>Two researchers met community group leaders and members to discuss the study and provide information sheets to potential participants. Additional copies were supplied to be circulated outside the community organisations.</p>
                <p>Researchers, SB and MR jointly ran eight focus groups, ranging from 3–8 participants, from community organisations. They also conducted three individual interviews. People were given the choice whether to participate in focus groups or individual interviews. Individual interviews were offered to ensure that people who may not feel comfortable talking in a group setting, were still given the opportunity to participate and contribute. Interviews started early July 2014 and lasted three months. Each participant received a gift voucher as a thank you for their time. Interviews were held in community centres or organisation premises, UCL offices, or for some individual interviews in participant’s home. All sessions lasted approximately 60 minutes and were audio recorded. Recruitment continued until theoretical saturation was reached; that is, no new themes were emerging.</p>

              <sec id="sec009">
                <title>Interview</title>
                <p>Participants completed demographic forms before the interview, asking about their age group, sex, how long they had lived in the UK, current or last occupation and their self defined ethnicity. Following a brief introduction, the interviewers read out a case vignette about Mrs Abrahams, a 70-year old African or Caribbean lady with memory problems (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">appendix</xref>). The vignette was developed for an earlier study and content validity ascertained by checking with several memory clinic psychiatrists that her symptoms suggested significant memory problems, justifying further investigation for the possibility of dementia [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec023">appendix</xref>). We then asked how participants would help if they, a relative or close friend experienced similar problems and what would encourage them to seek help and from where. Researchers facilitated discussions using a topic guide covering questions about attitudes, feelings, beliefs, personal experiences and opinions about memory problems in general.</p>

                <title>Analysis</title>
                <p>Interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and we sent participants anonymised transcripts, and invited them to comment on their accuracy and add any further remarks as a method of quality control and validation. Nvivo Software (version 9) was used to manage and analyse the data. SB and MR independently analysed the transcripts using a thematic approach to identify emerging ideas, themes and concepts and produced a thematic coding framework. The researchers then coded the interviews using an iterative process and added new themes generated from initial codes [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion and consensus reached. The two researchers regularly reviewed emerging themes as well as consulting with the rest of the team. We have anonymised all quotations, providing non-specific demographic information.</p>

                <title>Participants and demographics</title>
                <p>Fifty people (30 women and 20 men) participated in the study. They defined their ethnicity as Black African (28), Black Caribbean (14), Black British (7) and Indo-Caribbean (1) with ages ranging from 18 to over 85 years old. They were from a wide variety of different occupational backgrounds including student, cleaner, caterer, telephonist, hairdresser, nurse, sales, project manager and engineer. Ten were born in the UK, and 39 had been living in the UK between 4 and 64 years (mean = 33 years). Ten people (8 women and 2 men) had experience of dementia, four as family carers, four who had been or were being assessed for memory problems and two as support workers. Forty-six (92%) participants were registered with a GP practice. Their sociodemographic characteristics are shown in <xref rid="pone.0151878.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>Five main themes identified obstacles to people seeking health service help for dementia. Some were posed as questions by our interviewees to which they were unsure of or differed about the answers. These were: is forgetfulness indicative of dementia; is dementia an illness of BME communities; should people seek health service help for memory problems; fear of lifestyle changes and confidentiality, privacy and family duty within individual’s culture. We discuss these below in more detail. We have presented themes in <xref rid="pone.0151878.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, along with how frequently they were discussed. We searched for variations within these themes according to differing demographic characteristics and detailed in the text when areas of dissimilarities emerged. We found that higher number of Africans reported a lack of knowledge of dementia and greater reliance on community, family and friends for support, advice and care. The majority of participants reporting delaying help-seeking because of fear of what might happen including care home admission were women. Africans in particular repeatedly mentioned not having to consider dementia in their home country or remembering having a structure in place to handle it.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This is the largest qualitative study to investigate barriers to help-seeking for memory problems specifically within the Black African and Caribbean communities. We recruited a maximum variation sample of people from a range of age groups, backgrounds, country of origin, time in the UK, religion and socio-economic background. Some of the barriers to presentation with dementia have been reported before, but others are more specific barriers not cited in the wider BME help-seeking literature.</p>
              <p>What we found which was new was that while many people recognised forgetfulness, some thought dementia was a white person’s illness and by implication possibly not a real illness for them. Forgetfulness did not indicate a potential illness that they might have and therefore, there was little point in seeking medical help from a GP for such an unimportant and minor problem. Many thought that help-seeking from a GP was only for severe, pervasive and persistent problems, causing significant interference with daily life and this was true of illness in general, as a result of paying for consultations in their countries of origin. These were new themes which were not recorded in the recent systematic review of barriers to help seeking in dementia and may differ according to the specific BME group, the health system and to the recency of immigration [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. People also believed the GP has too little time to consider anything as complex as memory and did not appreciate that they could be referred to memory services that would be able to consider their problems in more detail.</p>
              <p>While earlier studies of help seeking in dementia had identified negative experiences of the health system [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we could only find one previous study which had seen the lack of trust which was a common theme across all participants [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some said that people from the Caribbean and Africa are prone to secrecy and highly value privacy of personal affairs and that this is something they are told from childhood. While secrecy has been reported as a consequence of stigma, including self stigma in black African and Caribbean HIV and cancer patients, [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] we do not think it has been reported as a general cultural behaviour not specific to illness or within dementia. Fear, shame and stigma associated with mental illness and dementia within BME communities have been linked to problems being hidden and connected to later presentation [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] This is similar to misperceptions of the difficulty of access to services, and the risk of treatment and disease progression that have been found to be connected to later presentation with HIV of both Black Caribbean but more so amongst Black African migrants [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A general feeling of suspicion about patient confidentiality, whether GPs would listen or there is any effective help and whether confidential information could be used against you as a black person are similar to the reasons migrants with HIV give for presenting later to services [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Similar to other studies, and as with anxiety and depression, African and Caribbean individuals were less likely to seek help from Western doctors, partly as they believed that doctors simply give tablets and are therefore more likely to seek help for these conditions from religion, a herbalist or self-treatment with herbal remedies [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. African American people have also been found more likely to see loss of cognitive ability in dementia as a supernatural intervention, an act or punishment from God or a curse [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, while religion can hinder access to traditional care pathways, it also assists in a sense of internal positive coping and influences the experience of dementia care received and given [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] it is not however the case that African and Caribbean people with all illness avoid doctors and a recent study in multiple sclerosis found that white and black participants accessed similar amounts of health care [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
              <p>As in earlier research, many participants reported delaying help-seeking for memory problems because of previous negative experiences and perceptions of the health care system, normalisation of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], experiences of shame and stigma within the community [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151878.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as memory problems being dealt with within the family context first, until symptoms led to a crisis [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The stigma for individuals associated with the family knowing about going for help outside the community is similar to African refugee experiences in other Western countries [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>While we thought that barriers for the older or first generation migrants living in the UK who were not born, nor raised within the culture may no longer be present in UK born or raised participants, we found no evidence of a difference between those born in the UK; those who have lived here for a long time and relatively new immigrants.</p>
              <sec id="sec021">
                <title>Strengths and weaknesses of research</title>
                <p>A large and demographically diverse sample was recruited, ensuring a wide range of perspectives about barriers to help-seeking for memory problems in the Black African and Caribbean communities. The qualitative methodology allowed a detailed picture of barriers to help-seeking for memory problems to be explored in depth.</p>
                <p>The sample was drawn predominantly from established community centres and groups, using snowball sampling techniques. Recruitment through community organisations and leaders has been found to be the most successful way of recruiting ethnic minority people to qualitative health research but there is also a risk of community leaders choosing the participants and thus the opinions [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We recruited from many different community organisations and thus any effect of choice by the leaders would have been minimised by this heterogeneity. Participants were recruited from inner city, suburban and semi-rural areas which strengthened the generalisability of our findings. However, we did not recruit many people who did not mix within their communities. We are not claiming to generalise our findings to black communities beyond those Black African and Caribbean Communities in Britain. It is vital that BME groups are not treated as homogenous [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and their diverse needs are identified and considered [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our data does, however, indicate new themes which are worth exploring in other populations, including African Americans.</p>
                <p>We used forgetfulness and memory problems interchangeably, but some participants conceptualised the two terms differently; thinking that the word “forgetful” always described a normal phenomenon and therefore could not be a memory problem, said they would respond to them differently in terms of help-seeking behaviour.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="sec022">
                <title>Implications for the future: development of an intervention</title>
                <p>More recently, barriers to help-seeking within the South Asian community have been explored and while there are similarities, such as an assumption that forgetfulness is a part of normal ageing or concerns about stigma [<xref rid="pone.0151878.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], there are important differences, particularly with regard to the emphasis on privacy and worries about wasting GP time. This indicates that barriers to help-seeking for dementia can be specific for different BME groups and therefore worthy of targeting in an intervention.</p>
                <p>Our findings can inform an intervention to overcome some of these barriers, modify attitudes and promote timely help seeking for memory problems in Black African and Caribbean communities. It would stress that dementia is a physical illness, that people from black backgrounds also may develop dementia, and that early presentation with it can lead to better outcomes and is consistent with dutiful family care. In addition, while a GP can not necessarily spend a long time with each individual; they want people with memory problems to come to see them, to discuss with them whether the problem may be symptomatic of something more serious or to treat another cause of the problem. They can appropriately refer people with possible dementia to memory clinics where there will be time available and whose role is to prolong independence and support families in caring.</p>
                <p>The intervention should also include key information about dementia to allow people to differentiate it from occasional memory lapses and recognise when to seek professional help. It should allay worries about loss of autonomy, breach of confidentiality and freedom of choice in health decision making. The source of the information should be a recognisable authority and inspire confidence. Despite some misgivings about healthcare services, our interviewees specified the NHS (National Health Service) as a source they were comfortable with, suggesting that distrust may be at individual rather than organisational level. They suggested a logo or NHS delivery channel was considered an effective way to encourage people to treat an intervention as valuable and containing important information. Assurance that healthcare staff would be aware of the intervention and sensitive to people cultural differences were considered an important part of a successful intervention and a stepping-stone to building better relationship between service professionals and members of these communities</p>
                <p>Any intervention would require testing to ensure it met its goal of increasing equity of service provision.</p>

                <title>Interview vignette</title>
                <p>We want you to think about Mrs Abrahams who is a 70 year old woman. Family members have noted that she is more forgetful lately. She cannot remember conversations with people and forgets appointments with her doctor. She often misplaces important items like her keys and glasses. She is physically healthy but is concerned about her memory.</p>
                <p>She’s just a person we’ve made up, but you know, there are people like that, who have similar memory problems. And as we said, she’s forgetting things, she forgets where her glasses and her keys are, and people close to her have noticed the memory problems. And she’s physically healthy, but she’s concerned about her memory. So just to ask all of you, if you knew someone like this, would you think that she should get help for her memory problems.</p>
