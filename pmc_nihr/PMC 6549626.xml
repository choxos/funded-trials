                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Incidence of autistic traits, mental health problems, stress and poor coping is high among family members of children with autism. These problems are coupled with challenging behaviour among children with autism. Current treatment for these families is disjointed and costly. The need for whole family support is supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations, developments regarding children’s service provision, research and requests by families of children with autism. Despite evidence that family therapies can provide benefits to these families, efficacy has not been subject to a randomised controlled trial. Systemic Autism-related Family Enabling (SAFE) is a new family therapy intervention designed specifically for families of children with autism. We aim to establish the feasibility of running a fully powered randomised controlled trial to evaluate SAFE.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>Families of children with autism aged 3–16 years will be invited to participate. Consenting participants will be randomised 2:1 to either SAFE+support as usual or support as usual alone. The proposed primary outcome measure for the main trial will be the Systemic CORE 15. Participants will also complete proposed secondary outcome measures, indexing changes in child behaviour, child-parent attachment, anxiety and depression. Generic health economic outcome measures (EuroQol 5 dimensions and Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions) will also provide data on the feasibility of cost-effectiveness analysis. Questionnaires will be completed at baseline and 32 weeks post-allocation. Data on ability to identify, recruit, randomise, retain and collect data from families, acceptability of outcome measures, adherence of therapists and families to the intervention, appropriateness of resource use questionnaires and effectiveness of training will be collected for feasibility analysis. Qualitative data will also explore acceptability of SAFE and reasons for declining and withdrawing from the study.</p>

                  <p>The current trial protocol received ethical approval from the South West-Exeter Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 17/SW/0192). The findings of the trial will be disseminated in collaboration with our Family Consultation Group and other partners. Findings will be shared locally, nationally and internationally through events, conferences and published papers.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>More than 1% of the UK population has a diagnosis of autism.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Families of children with autism present complex needs. Children with autism have impairments in social interaction, communication and behavioural flexibility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Autism is widely accepted to have a genetic component and the Broad Autism Phenotype is disproportionally represented among family members.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Mental health problems are experienced by &gt;70% of individuals with autism and &gt;50% of their parents.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Individuals with autism suffer from high levels of anxiety and depression compared with those with other developmental conditions.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> Families of children with autism have higher rates of depression, anxiety and social phobia than families with typically developing children, or children with other developmental disorders.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Parents of children with autism are more likely to be hospitalised for mental disorders than parents of typically developing children<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; and mothers of children with autism are reported to have higher unmet needs, more difficulties coping and lower satisfaction with service interactions than mothers of children with other disabilities.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Aside from these reported difficulties, families of children with autism can have positive family experiences, sense of well-being<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and positive perceptions of their children.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Despite challenges, autism can be seen as enhancing family experience and some parents recognise that parenting a child with autism has added joy to their lives,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> made them more appreciative,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> more patient and compassionate.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
              <p>As families of children with autism often exhibit psychological morbidities alongside autism, costs of services to treat these problems are high.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Furthermore, untreated or unresponsive mental health problems impose societal costs making it hard for parents to interact effectively with services,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> potentially worsening outcomes for children and exacerbating the substantial economic burden of autism.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p>
              <p>Explanations for high levels of affective disorders in these families include: stress associated with the condition of autism, genetic factors and intergenerational family dynamics. Parenting children with autism involves stresses associated with challenging behaviour, lack of Theory of Mind and atypical attachment behaviour displayed by children.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Parents of children with autism report that a consequent lack of psychological well-being exacerbates maladaptive behaviour in their children,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> which is likely to result in unhelpful cycles of distress and hopelessness.</p>
              <p>Studies exploring the medical histories of family members indicate that the onset of affective disorders may predate the birth of the child<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 22 23</xref> suggesting that mental health difficulties cannot be wholly accounted for by stress involved in parenting. It seems, therefore, that these individuals may have been living with psychological distress for a long period of time. Depression and anxiety among family members have been tentatively linked to genetic factors independent of the Broad Autism Phenotype.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> But few studies explore the intergenerational presence of affective disorder associated with autism.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 23</xref></p>
              <p>Previous research demonstrates that experience of trauma and abuse among women is associated with elevated risk of autism developing in their subsequent offspring.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 26</xref> Hence, mothers of children with autism are more likely than the general population to be coping with previous traumatic events. In addition, these families often encounter difficulties communicating needs to external agencies,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which may trigger existing tendencies for negative affect. Families of children with autism can experience positive family life, cope well with difficulties and enjoy good relationships with their children, but they represent a high-risk group, for whom treatment is disjointed, costly and inadequate.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref></p>
              <p>A more joined-up approach is required which focuses on autism-related need, coping with challenging behaviour and mental health difficulties by encouraging fundamental reflective functioning and improving family dynamics. The Systemic Autism-related Family Enabling (SAFE) study should be placed in the context of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and recommendations<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30 31</xref> as well as developments regarding children’s service provision proposed by the Munroe Report,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> and the ‘Future in Mind’ children and young people’s mental health report.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The SAFE study also reflects recommendations by other researchers working in the field.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 36</xref> Families of children with autism themselves highlight the importance of professionals working therapeutically with children and the wider family, in contrast to parents of children with conditions such as Down syndrome who tend to stress the support needs of their child within educational and community settings.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
              <p>SAFE is a systemic family therapy approach designed by experts to address autism-related needs including mental health difficulties and problematic behaviour. Systemic family therapy is a well-recognised, evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which is recommended treatment for conditions such as conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anorexia nervosa.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Despite evidence that family therapy can provide benefits to children with autism and their parents,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39 40</xref> its efficacy for treating this condition has not been subject to a randomised controlled trial. A comprehensive search of clinical trial registries revealed no ongoing trials assessing systemic family therapy as a treatment for autism and associated mental health problems. This is surprising given guidelines and recommendations for care; the successful use of family therapies for a range of conditions and reports documenting key areas of concern for the UK autism community,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref> which overwhelmingly show that families of children with autism want interventions which make real improvements to their daily life and sense of well-being. Consequently, the overarching aim of this study is to establish the feasibility of a definitive randomised controlled trial to evaluate SAFE therapy for families of children with autism.</p>

              <sec id="s2a">
                <title>Participants and recruitment</title>
                <p>Our target population are families of children with autism, who do not have an intellectual impairment, between the ages of 3 and 16 years. SAFE is designed to have a visual, playful approach which draws from established principles of family therapy, where therapists and families work as collaborators to solve problems and effect change. SAFE activities are adaptable, family led and can be used flexibly according to the needs of the family and the age of the child. Children gain most from the intervention, however, if they can understand and communicate their responses to SAFE activities. Pilot data suggest that SAFE will be most effective and accessible for children who do not have severe symptoms or an intellectual impairment. Those children who were non-verbal and/or had severe communication difficulties found it difficult to engage with some activities. For this feasibility study, therefore, our target population is families of children with autism severity level 1 or 2 with no intellectual impairment. The authors are aware that high severity levels may not in all cases exclude children from engaging with SAFE and that the relationship between IQ and severity is complex. These issues will be explored as part of the feasibility outcomes, namely our ability to recruit eligible families.</p>
                <p>Future plans for SAFE include the development of a sister intervention which has extended non-verbal elements based on Intensive Interaction and is designed specifically to support families of children with autism and an intellectual impairment. This feasibility study focuses on families of children of school-age which fits with the priorities of one of our secondary sources of funding. Background research exploring diagnostic data for our proposed centres for the previous 2 years revealed no children without intellectual impairment diagnosed before the age of 3 years. This information strongly suggested that we would be unable to recruit any families with children below the age of 3 years. Consequently, we focused on the 3–16 age group.</p>
                <p>Participants will be identified and recruited from two study research sites: University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust (PHNT) Child Development Centre and Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust Autism Spectrum Disorder Assessment Team (ASDAT). The pathways used to identify and recruit families will vary according to local practice, and the needs of the individual families being approached. Some families will receive a diagnosis during the SAFE recruitment period, and others will have been diagnosed up to 12 months before the SAFE study recruitment period starts.</p>
                <p>Families with a diagnosis during the SAFE recruitment period will be approached by the diagnosing paediatrician, who will perform an initial eligibility check, invite the families to find out more and, if interested, refer the family to a member of the local SAFE study team. Families with a diagnosis before the SAFE study recruitment period will be identified as potentially eligible from clinic records by a suitably qualified member of the clinical team at each centre. Clinical staff in our centres and the surrounding areas are responsible for diagnosis of the children within our participating families. If the child is recruited from a diagnostic centre the clinical staff also assess eligibility. The severity levels of the children and their intellectual ability are assessed on the autism pathways in Plymouth and Cornwall by a multidisciplinary clinical team including educational and clinical psychologists, speech and language therapists and paediatricians. Assessment on the pathways occurs over a period of several months. This includes measures of IQ based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V)<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> and measures of intellectual functioning based on the British Ability Scales (BAS3)<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> as well as observations and detailed reports from the schools or nursery settings and the family.</p>
                <p>All potential participant families will receive a participant information leaflet including an invitation to take part. All interested families will be able to speak to a member of the study team to discuss the study and have any questions answered. The participant information leaflet will contain information about the study in plain English. Parents will be asked to explain the information to younger children in a way that is appropriate for their child and suggestions for how to do this will be contained in the leaflet. A home visit will be arranged by a member of the study team for those families who express interest in participating. During the visit, a research assistant will provide the families with more detailed participant information and seek consent.</p>

                <p>Participants who have received either a new diagnosis, or a diagnosis within the last 12 months will also be approached through community groups, using a recruitment poster, invitation letter, reply slip, participant information leaflet and freepost envelope. These participants will be contacted by a member of the research team by telephone at which time they will discuss the study and answer questions. The families will also be asked to consent to providing the original National Health Service (NHS) diagnosis letter, which will be used by the research staff to determine eligibility to participate in the study, and legal guardianship at the first home visit.</p>

The family feedback day will involve several separate focus group sessions organised to take place over the period of a morning or an afternoon at a local venue for each centre including focus groups aimed specifically at parents and at children. The families will be told at the start of the day that they are not obliged to respond to any question or prompt if they do not wish to and that the format of the day will be open discussion with other families in response to questions presented on a screen. They will then be invited to respond to a presented topic guide exploring the four key areas stated above through discussion with each other.</p>

                <title>The intervention</title>
                <p>SAFE is a manualised intensive programme of systemic family therapy designed to treat maladaptive autistic symptoms and mental health-related difficulties encountered by families of children with autism. SAFE provides an array of therapeutic activities based on attachment theory, established systemic practice and the known visual processing preferences of people with autism.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59–61</xref> SAFE is best seen as a toolkit with a variety of activities which can be applied to family therapy flexibly. For example, a very young child will engage with activities in a different way to teenagers. Activities include visual tasks, drawing, modelling, role-play and tracking circular patterns. Sessions are led by family need and the therapists and family work collaboratively, often in a playful way, using family resources, therapist expertise and the tools that SAFE provides. SAFE draws heavily from well-documented active and playful approaches in family therapy practice and literature.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p>
                <p>Each therapy session will include two therapists with a minimum of intermediate family therapy level of qualification and 4 days training in SAFE principles. Prior to the therapy sessions parents allocated to SAFE will complete an adapted version of the parent development interview,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> which will provide therapists with background information on family experience. The reflective functioning questions of this interview will also be revisited as an opportunity to discuss change at the 24-week follow-up. Between weeks 1 and 16, families allocated to the SAFE intervention will attend five 3-hour SAFE therapy sessions. Sessions 1 and 5 are multifamily sessions and will take place in a community setting. Sessions 2, 3 and 4 are for individual families and will take place in a community venue or the family home. The therapists will facilitate sessions which will be video recorded, as is usual practice for therapy sessions. The videotapes will be used by the therapists in supervision sessions and preparation for subsequent sessions.</p>
                <p>Following completion of the therapy programme, families will attend a group follow-up session at 24 weeks post-allocation. Families will discuss any changes they have encountered focusing on their ability to be reflective about challenges faced and solutions tried. Trained support workers from local voluntary groups will attend this follow-up session and will be invited to give the families information about continued support for families of children with autism through existing networks.</p>
                <p>Each session will include the following assessments for families to complete:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Helpful Aspects of Therapy Questionnaire.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A Between-Session Activity (BSA) homework activity.

Completion of the BSA will be recorded.</p></list-item></list></p>
                <p>At the end of each session, the therapists will also complete a training checklist and questionnaire to monitor protocol adherence.</p>

                <p>Families will typically be offered a post-diagnosis follow-up appointment with the diagnosing paediatrician. Parents of children whose symptoms are not severe may be directed to local authority parenting classes. Classes such as ‘Timeout for Autism’ (Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly) and ‘Understanding Autism’ (Plymouth) focus on the features of ASD, instructional parenting techniques and issues associated with education. Psychoeducation may also be offered, with families being directed to relevant resources, for example, The National Autism Society, Gateway ASD and the NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services. For families where a member is experiencing depression or anxiety, treatment varies and is not linked to autism-related care. Initial referral is often through the GP. Patients may receive cognitive behavioural therapy as part of the improved access for psychological therapies service. They may also receive medication and in extreme cases a period of inpatient hospital treatment.</p>

For those randomised to the SAFE intervention, adherence will be reported according to the number of group sessions attended and participation of individual family members at each of the therapy sessions. Completeness of data will be reported for each outcome measure at each relevant time point. Again this will be reported for individual family members as appropriate.</p>
                <p>For each outcome measure, the relevant scores will be calculated and presented descriptively by trial arm. Where available, published guidelines will be used to process, score and summarise the measures including, for example, the use of imputation in the event of missing items on a questionnaire. Summary measures will be calculated as appropriate, for example, means and SD, medians and ranges, numbers and percentages in categories. These measures will be presented both for baseline and for the final follow-up. The only analysis contrasting the two groups will be an interval estimate in the form of a 95% CI for the primary outcome, so that the plausibility for the effect size used in the sample size calculation for the full trial can be assessed. For this purpose, the baseline values will be used in an analysis of covariance, with acknowledgement that no effects are included for group or therapist.</p>
                <p>Focus group interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Consequent qualitative data will be managed using proprietary computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software, for example, NVivo 10, and analysed thematically.<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64 65</xref> Rigour of analysis will include ‘respondent validation’, whereby participants are provided with a summary of their transcript and analysis so that they can assess whether the interpretations being made about the data, accurately represent them. In addition, a second qualitative researcher will conduct an independent analysis of a subset of half of the focus group transcripts. Researchers will then meet to discuss and agree the findings, which will then be presented to the Family Consultation Group for discussion.</p>

                <title>Patient and public involvement</title>
                <p>Families of children with autism initiated the development of this project by communicating their complex needs and dissatisfaction with current service provision through the Plymouth Autism Network. This Network was set up by the Chief Investigator in 2011 to bring clinicians, carers, academics and individuals with autism together to share ideas, research findings and experiences. We further explored the challenges facing families of children with autism by conducting in-depth interviews and surveying over 90 families regarding their needs and the treatment they received post-diagnosis. Less than 9% of families agreed that current treatment helped with the problems they face. Our survey revealed a strong need for interventions, which support the whole family.</p>
                <p>This pilot data led to the development of a research team within the Welcome Research Hub at Plymouth University, which included a Family Consultation Group. Our Family Consultation Group worked with us to develop and refine the SAFE intervention prior to the current project. These families have also contributed to the creation of a recruitment and treatment plan, which will be manageable for families. They have offered advice about how it is best to communicate with families at the start of the study and as it progresses. In addition, the Family Consultation Group representative is a co-applicant on this study.</p>
                <p>Our Family Consultation Group will continue to be essential members of the team and work as an advisory group throughout the feasibility study and beyond. Formal structures are in place to ensure ongoing collaboration with the Family Consultation Group. Specifically, the representative for the Consultation Group is paid as a research assistant on the trial and is a co-applicant. She attends and actively contributes to monthly trial management group (TMG) meetings, all training sessions and fortnightly research team meetings. The representative reports key issues and requests to and from the wider group. Where necessary, additional meetings are held between the Family Consultation Group as a whole and other research staff. In these instances, travel and subsistence costs are available in line with NHS England guidelines on working with our patient and public voice partners.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></p>
                <p>We see our Family Consultation Group as experts in their own lives and the lives of families with similar challenges. For this reason, we feel our role is to work with them in a supportive manner as collaborators. Their contribution is valuable in the same way as other experts on the team and we aim to facilitate one another. As stated above, the Family Consultation Group have been active in contributing to the research plan. Their input is of particular value in developing recruitment procedures, designing participant information packs and providing information about potential barriers to retention. We have also worked with them to prepare and deliver a training programme for research staff and therapists. With their help we have trained recruited staff to work in a sensitive and informed manner with participants. We also value their input in interpreting and reporting data; in particular commenting on possible ways to overcome challenges for the main randomised controlled trial.</p>
                <p>Our families can help by identifying local networks and sharing their experience with new groups. Our Family Consultation Group are proactive campaigners for change and have extensive knowledge of existing bodies such as the National Autistic Society. They can also provide a family-centred perspective on research outcomes. They are, therefore, well-placed to collaborate with us in planning next steps and disseminating findings at local and national levels.</p>

                <title>Risks and safety</title>
                <p>Families of children with autism are a potentially vulnerable group. The risks associated with participating in this study are however, considered minimal, with no adverse events anticipated in any participant. For those in the intervention group, there is a slight chance that the SAFE family therapy sessions could lead to an initial increase in family disagreements as family members learn how to change the way they solve problems and talk with one another. However, the purpose of the intervention is ultimately to equip families with skills to handle these difficulties by learning how to change the way they solve problems and improve their communication, and the SAFE family therapists will be available to provide support and will be trained to handle any emerging problems. Should any issues arise the SAFE family therapists will have access to two consultant clinical psychologists to provide further support and advice.</p>
                <p>During the trial, the children with autism will remain in the care of the Child Development Centre or the ASDAT and will have access to usual care should any unforeseen circumstances arise. Other members of the family will also continue to be able to seek care and advice from the GP or any other specialist services they are concurrently involved with.</p>

                <title>Monitoring adverse events</title>
                <p>The research team have mechanisms in place to report serious adverse events (SAE) related to mental health. SAEs related to mental health may be volunteered by the participant or discovered by the therapists, research assistants or other member of the research team during the SAFE family therapy sessions, or as a result of direct reporting (e.g. by telephone) by a family member, independent clinician or other informant. SAEs will be recorded from the time of consent until the date the participant completes the follow-up or withdraws from the study.</p>
                <p>If the CI considers that the SAE is not, or is unlikely to be, associated with the trial, the CTU will obtain a second assessment of causality from an independent assessor. Any SAE which in the opinion of either adjudicator is possibly related to the trial will be reported to the Research Ethics Committee (REC) within 15 days of the local research team having become aware of the event. All SAEs will be followed until either stabilised if chronic conditions, or resolved.</p>

                <title>Dissemination</title>
                <p>If the feasibility study meets progression criteria an important part of our dissemination plan is to raise awareness of the need for a larger multicentre trial. We will, therefore, offer targeted summaries of our findings and presentations to policy makers. The findings will also be broadly disseminated, but in a manner appropriate to a feasibility study. We plan national conference presentations and published papers to inform clinicians, academics and therapists about the possible benefits of SAFE and generate interest in the future trial. We will make use of our existing connections including the Association for Family Therapy, the National Autistic Society and the Institute of Family Therapy to reach relevant audiences. Our qualitative findings will also be published with detailed accounts of the families’ reactions to SAFE and their views on its effectiveness. We will also provide forums for participating families to share their own experiences of the intervention with wider audiences through existing networks, groups and events across the UK.</p>
                <p>Our Family Consultation Group will be integral to our dissemination plan. Their involvement will include presenting their experiences as delegates at national and international conferences, being active co-authors on published papers, leading the organising committee for a local event sharing findings with families, key local stakeholders, clinicians and other interested partners; and liaising with other bodies to raise awareness of the study findings including Autistica, The National Autistic Society and the Brandon Trust.</p>

                <title>Informing potential participants of possible benefits and known risks</title>
                <p>The participant information sheets and leaflets will provide potential participants with information about the possible benefits and risks of taking part in the trial. For example, the participants will be informed that a potential risk of receiving the SAFE therapy is that the sessions may evoke difficult emotions and feelings; this could lead to family disagreement as they move towards change. The families will also be informed that benefits of the trial include the possibility of improved coping skills when faced with challenges and contribution to finding out if SAFE can progress to a national trial. Participants will be given the opportunity to discuss risks and benefits with a member of the research team prior to consenting to participate.</p>

In the leaflet, parents are encouraged to explain the trial to their younger children and some guidance for doing this is provided. The information sheet states that the participants have the right to withdraw at any point during the trial and that data collected from them will be confidential. All participants will have a home-visit prior to consent from a member of the research team and will be able to ask questions or go through the information verbally. Participants will have the process of the study explained to them including the estimated time they will have to wait prior to randomisation and starting the intervention if allocated to that arm.</p>

                <p>The trial will be conducted to protect the human rights and dignity of the participant as reflected in the Declaration of Helsinki. An important factor in protecting the participants is ongoing consultation with the SAFE Family Consultation Group. A representative of this group is a member of the research team and is involved in decision-making processes. The research team including the family consultation group are proactive in minimising discomfort and risk for participants, respecting their wishes over science and society, respecting the right to withdraw and the need for families to have access to all relevant information.</p>
                <p>The Chief Investigator will be responsible for the overall conduct of the study, keeping it to schedule and within budget. Working closely with the CTU, she will be the focal contact for enquiries from both sites. The CTU will manage the study, liaise with sites, monitor recruitment, work with the sponsor and report to TMG meetings. The TMG will meet regularly throughout the feasibility study. A Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will have an overarching monitoring responsibility. The TSC is expected to meet three times during the study, but will be additionally convened at the chairman or Chief Investigator’s request.</p>
