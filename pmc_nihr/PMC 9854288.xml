                  <p>Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPTs) Services could offer smoking cessation treatment to improve physical and psychological outcomes for service users, but it currently does not. This study aimed to understand participants' views and experiences of receiving a novel smoking cessation intervention as part of the ESCAPE trial (intEgrating Smoking Cessation treatment As part of usual Psychological care for dEpression and anxiety). We used the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Model of Behaviour (COM‚ÄêB) to understand the (i) acceptability of the integrated smoking cessation treatment, (ii) views of psychological well‚Äêbeing practitioners' (PWPs) ability to deliver the smoking cessation treatment and (iii) positive and negative impacts of smoking cessation treatment.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This was a qualitative study embedded within a feasibility randomized‚Äêcontrolled trial (ESCAPE) in primary care services in the United Kingdom (IAPT). Thirty‚Äêsix participants (53% female) from both usual care and intervention arms of the ESCAPE trial, including both quitters and nonquitters, were interviewed using semi‚Äêstructured interviews. Data were analysed using a framework approach to thematic analysis, using the COM‚ÄêB as a theoretical frame.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Psychological Capability: Integrated smoking cessation treatment was acceptable and encouraged participants to reflect on their mental health. Some participants found it difficult to understand nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Motivation: Participants were open to change during the event of presenting to IAPT. Some described being motivated to take part in the intervention by curiosity, to see whether quitting smoking would help their mental health. Physical Opportunity: IAPT has a natural infrastructure for supporting integrated treatment, but there were some barriers such as session duration and interventions feeling segmented. Social Opportunity: Participants viewed PWPs as having good interpersonal skills to deliver a smoking cessation intervention.</p>

In the United Kingdom, smoking prevalence in people with depression or anxiety is 32% compared to 14.1% in the general population.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> People with mental illnesses have a 19% reduction in the odds of achieving abstinence when trying to quit,<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> but are as motivated to quit as those without mental illness.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> These differences increase mortality in people with mental illness when compared to the general population resulting from cancer (mortality rate ratio: 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91‚Äì1.94)<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and cardiovascular disease (mortality hazard ratio: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.53‚Äì2.24).<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Integrating cessation treatment into mental health settings could prevent 78,000 deaths in the next 80 years.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>People with mental illness may use smoking to try to alleviate symptoms, for example, using smoking to relax when they feel anxious;<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> recent evidence suggests that this is counter‚Äêproductive, as smoking can in fact exacerbate and maintain mental health symptoms, and stopping smoking can improve mental health.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Qualitative studies suggest that although people with mental illness do report perceived benefits of smoking, they also accept evidence that smoking tobacco may harm mental health, and quitting might benefit mental health, and suggest that framing cessation as a treatment for mental health could motivate them to quit.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p>A cochrane review of smoking cessation treatments for people with current and historical depression found that adding psychosocial mood management to usual smoking cessation treatment (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy) increased cessation rates when compared to usual smoking treatment alone (risk ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.13‚Äì1.92). In the United Kingdom, people with depression/anxiety can access psychological therapy services, known as ‚ÄòImproving Access to Psychological Therapies‚Äô (IAPTs), in which service users receive evidence‚Äêbased therapies to improve mood and well‚Äêbeing. IAPT receives over 1.5 million referrals a year,<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and could offer smoking cessation treatment, but it currently does not. Integrating smoking cessation support within IAPT treatment for mental illness could improve physical and psychological outcomes for its service users. The World Health Organization¬†recommends that countries integrate smoking cessation interventions into primary care services, such as IAPT.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>

              <p>Qualitative studies embedded within randomized‚Äêcontrolled trials (RCTs) provide the potential to gain new understandings of participant experiences of an intervention and inform the development of future interventions.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> We have recently codesigned a smoking cessation intervention with IAPT staff and service users, and are testing the intervention in a large, acceptability and feasibility pilot RCT.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> We conducted interviews with trial participants to understand their experiences and views of the integrated smoking cessation intervention.

                <title>Recruitment procedure</title>
                <p>We used a convenience sampling method. During trial follow‚Äêup, we asked participants if they would like to take part in an interview about their experience in the study. Participants who had withdrawn from the study or did not complete follow‚Äêups were not approached for an interview. Informed consent was obtained verbally and recorded at the start of the interview; there was no written consent. The information sheet for the qualitative interviews was combined with the main trial information sheet.</p>
                <p>To ensure confidentiality, with informed consent from participants, interviews were recorded using an encrypted digital voice recorder, transcribed and anonymized. Any identifying information in the transcripts was removed, but considering the risk of reidentification, researchers involved in the study were bound to confidentiality regulations set by the University of Bath and NHS. To further protect confidentiality, access to anonymized transcript data is restricted to only approved bona fide researchers after application to the University of Bath's Research Data Archive.</p>

S. then grouped codes into categories, providing a working analytical framework that reflected the aims of the study, which were reviewed with G. T., and some inductive codes were added. K. S. then deductively coded the data based on the concepts from the COM‚ÄêB model, with some data being coded both inductively and deductively. K.

                <title>Summary</title>
                <p>We aimed to understand the experience of an integrated smoking cessation and mental health treatment among people with common mental illness. We found that generally, people with mental illness accepted integrated smoking cessation and mental health treatment, and had the psychological capability, motivation, physical and social opportunity to accept and engage with the integrated treatment. However, participants also faced several barriers in understanding tobacco withdrawal and at the service level. Participants described how PWPs had the interpersonal skills for delivering the smoking cessation intervention, but it sometimes seemed scripted or unnatural.</p>

                <title>Strength and limitations</title>
                <p>A strength of this study is that the findings are likely transferable to other primary care services, or similar services and populations, as the services involved in this study used nationally standardized treatments and service models, such as CBT, motivational interviewing and the NCSCT's standard treatment programme.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Most participants were White British, which was representative of the communities served by the NHS Trusts that we sampled,<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> but the findings may not be generalizable to more ethnically diverse areas of the United Kingdom. However, our sample was broadly representative of general IAPT users in England, being mostly white, female and a younger age. Although the sample in this study is slightly older (average age 36.9 years) than the general IAPT service user population, those aged 18‚Äì24 years are most likely to access IAPT.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Our sampling method could have introduced bias into the data, as we only sampled from those who completed follow‚Äêups, and it is possible that they could have had a more positive experience of the treatment than those who did not. Similarly, most participants completed interviews when they had completed treatment, so could have shown a recall bias where they reported mostly positive experiences of the intervention due to feeling more positive at the end of treatment, forgetting negative experiences.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>Use of a critical realist perspective allowed us to focus on understanding, instead of describing, social reality. Mental health treatment happens within a social reality as people and their actions influence the treatment pathways, and each is made up of, and influenced by, people's actions.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> A critical realist perspective assumes that human perceptions are accounts of reality, as what we observe is a social and subjective account of reality.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Critical realism allows us to understand how and why interventions work within complex environments such as primary care mental health services.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> The benefits of a critical realist perspective are that we can understand the relationship between context (the setting of an intervention), mechanisms (things that cause change) and the outcome or experience of an intervention.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Therefore, by using this perspective, we were able to understand how the experience of the smoking cessation intervention integrated within an IAPT service was influenced by the context in which it was experienced, and why or why not it was accepted in this environment.</p>

                <title>Comparison with the existing literature</title>
                <p>Integrated smoking cessation and mental health treatment was generally accepted, and participants had the capability to understand their smoking behaviour in the context of the tobacco withdrawal cycle and engage in treatment. These findings further those from our qualitative study of IAPT patients' views of integrated treatment, which found that IAPT patients accepted evidence that smoking may worsen their mental health and that quitting could improve their mental health.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> However, similar to other research, some participants described how they used smoking as a coping mechanism and prioritized their mental health treatment over quitting smoking.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>Although most participants described their smoking using a CBT model and identified withdrawal as a component of their mental illness, some participants described withdrawal and mental illness as different experiences. This contrasts with the literature on the tobacco withdrawal cycle, which suggests that irritability and low mood from nicotine withdrawal are the same experience as mental illness.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>This study found that an important factor for smoking cessation intervention uptake is having smoking cessation treatment available and offered in primary care services. This finding is in line with a systematic review that found that offering all smokers help to quit increased quit attempts, compared to telling them to quit.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> This study supports findings from our recent study, which suggests that IAPT services could be a suitable infrastructure for smoking cessation treatment, but there may be some service‚Äêlevel barriers.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Similar to a qualitative study of smoking cessation therapy for people with severe mental illness, we found that service users viewed PWPs as having good interpersonal skills to deliver smoking cessation interventions.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p>Participants were motivated to accept and engage with the integrated smoking cessation and IAPT therapy, consistent with a systematic review indicating that people with mental illness are motivated to quit smoking.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Participants stated that receiving smoking cessation treatment at the same time as mental health treatment was ‚Äòa good a time as any‚Äô.

</p>
                <p>Previous literature has suggested that altruism is an important motivator for participation in mental health trials.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> The key motivators for engagement identified in the present study were participants' openness to change and curiosity regarding the potential impact of the combined treatment approach for smoking and their mental health. These motivations reflect a primary interest in the personal benefits of taking part rather than a desire to help others. These findings are consistent with the idea of ‚Äòconditional altruism‚Äô,<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0043" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref>, <xref rid="hex13580-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> which suggests that an interest in helping others may facilitate initial engagement; however, an expectation of some personal benefit is an important driver for enrolment and subsequent participation in trials.</p>

                <title>Implications for research and practice</title>
                <p>Integrating the NCSCT's standard treatment programme for smoking cessation<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> into IAPT services is possible and accepted by people with common mental illness. Although there are financial considerations for IAPT to provide smoking cessation support on a larger scale, with funding required for training therapists, buying equipment, and so forth, it is important to remember that in the United Kimgdom, smoking costs our economy &gt;¬£11bn per year.<xref rid="hex13580-bib-0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Given that participants reported that sometimes the intervention felt rushed or scripted, it could be that further intervention refinement is required, or that IAPT services should reduce PWP caseload to lengthen the session duration. In this trial, smoking was treated as a separate intervention programme; for truly integrated treatment, smoking should be addressed synonymously with other lifestyle behaviours. Future research should investigate how to achieve this.</p>

              <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>
              <p>People with common mental illness generally accepted integrated smoking cessation and mental health treatment. Smoking cessation treatment fits well within IAPT's structure; however, there are barriers to implementation related to resources. Reducing caseloads to allow for longer sessions with smokers would support implementation. Participants were open to change when first presenting to IAPT and motivated by curiosity to see whether quitting smoking would help their mental health. Participants viewed PWPs as having good interpersonal skills to deliver smoking cessation intervention.</p>
