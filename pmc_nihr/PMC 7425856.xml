                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Child undernutrition results in poor growth in early childhood, undermines optimal development and increases the risk of mortality. Responsive feeding has been promoted as a key intervention for improving nutritional status, however measurement of this remains difficult and has rarely considered child behaviour. We therefore developed a new observed feeding tool to assess both child and caregiver behaviours, as well as their interaction during feeding, and investigate the effect of these on children anthropometric measures at 12-months of age in rural India.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>Our study was nested within the SPRING cluster-randomized controlled trial in Rewari, North India. Outcomes were children length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) Z scores at 12 months of age, based on the WHO Child Growth standards. Trained non-specialists live-coded feeding episodes using the newly designed tool. Scores were then created using principal components analysis representing child behaviour, caregiver behaviour and caregiver-child interaction. Mixed effects linear regression was used to assess associations between feeding behaviours and anthropometric outcomes.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>857 children had a meal observation and were included. Anthropometric status was poor (mean length-for-age -1.59 (SD = 1.11); mean weight-for-length -0.58 (0.95); mean weight-for-age -1.22 (1.04)). There were positive linear differences in weight-for-length per unit increase in caregiver responsive behaviours score (adjusted β-coeff = 0.006, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.011), p = 0.01), in length-for-age and weight-for-age per unit increase in child responsive behaviours score (respectively adjusted β-coeff = 0.004, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.007), p = 0.02, and adjusted β-coeff = 0.003, 95%CI = (0.00001, 0.006), p = 0.049), and in both weight-for-length and weight-for-age per unit increase in caregiver-child interaction score (respectively adjusted β-coeff = 0.007, 95%CI = (0.003, 0.012), p = 0.001, and adjusted β-coeff = 0.005, 95%CI = (0.001, 0.011), p = 0.01). No association was seen between child behaviours and weight-for-length, caregiver behaviours and length and caregiver-child interaction and length.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>We found that trained non-specialists could assess feeding episodes using a newly designed checklist. Further, child and caregiver behaviours were associated with weight and length at only 12 months of age, a reminder of the importance of interventions to improve responsive feeding quality as we strive towards achievement of the sustainable development goals.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Worldwide, about 150 million children under 5 years are stunted, 110 million underweight and 50 million wasted [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Undernutrition in early childhood is a major public health issue, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and leads to growth faltering which is related to impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development in children. Before the age of 2 years [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], a short length is a strong predictor of reduced schooling, poorer mental health in adolescence, shorter height and lower productivity in adulthood, as well as lower offspring birthweight [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This contributes to an intergenerational transmission of lost human capital and poverty [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, the poorer immunity seen in low weight children increases their risk of infectious disease-related mortality [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Improving early childhood growth is therefore crucial to reaching the Sustainable Development Goals 1 to 4, which aim to reduce poverty and undernutrition, to promote health and well-being at all ages, and provide inclusive access to education [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The period of greatest vulnerability to undernutrition is from around six months, when exclusive breastfeeding becomes insufficient to meet a child’s nutritional requirements, until that point when the child can both self-feed and eat the same diet as the rest of the family [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is usually by the age of 1 year old [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
              <p>One solution to undernutrition may be responsive feeding. “Responsive feeding” is the result of applying principles of psychosocial care to the feeding situation [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and is the name given to supportive carer behaviours during feeding, which are important to encouraging infants and young children to feed adequately. Specific responsive feeding behaviours recommended by the WHO include 1) feeding infants directly and assisting older children to self-feed, 2) being sensitive to child cues, 3) encouraging children to eat, 4) feeding slowly and patiently, 5) not practicing force-feeding, 6) trying other encouragement strategies when children refuse food, 7) minimizing distraction, and 8) interacting socially with children during meals [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These have been integrated into recent work on nurturing care in the recently launched <italic>Nurturing Care for Early Childhood Development Framework</italic> presented at the World Health Assembly, as a component of responsive caregiving [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, assessing Infant &amp; Young Child Feeding programmes with a focus on these aspects is difficult. This is because there is no method which allows non-specialists to perform a holistic responsive feeding assessment; previous studies used a broad range of methods, from assessing one individual behaviour (e.g. hand-feeding [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]) or evaluating separately various categories of behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], to developing scales combining multiple behaviours (e.g. an active feeding scale including encouragement, threatening, serving or offering additional food, demonstrating how to eat more, and ordering the child to eat more [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) or different components of feeding (e.g. a care index that includes type of food offered to the child, two responsive feeding behaviours, and use of preventive health care services [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). However, most work focuses on caregivers over child behaviours.</p>
              <p>We therefore created a new observational tool adapted for community-based interventions in low-resources settings that was suitable for 1) use with one-year-old children 2) administration in the home 3) assessment over one mealtime 4) administration by non-specialists and 5) live coding and scoring, to investigate the relationships between child &amp; caregiver behaviours during feeding with length and weight at 12 months in Haryana state, India—the country where the prevalence of both stunting and wasting is highest. In this paper, we first present a method that uses a new scoring system to develop three indices for measurement of 1) child behaviours 2) caregiver behaviours and 3) caregiver-child interaction during feeding from a larger tool. We then quantify the association of each set of behaviours with 1) length-for-age, a marker of child long-term nutritional status that evolves gradually over time, 2) weight-for-length, an indicator of child current nutritional status prone to short-term variations, and 3) weight-for-age, a summary measure for both length-for-age and weight-for-length, with short-term variations reflecting changes in weight-for-length, and long-term variations reflecting changes in length-for-age [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

                <title>Overview of SPRING trial study design</title>
                <p>This analytical cross-sectional study was done within the SPRING cluster-randomised controlled trial in India. Details on SPRING are presented elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] but in brief, SPRING in India was an innovative home visiting programme, delivered by community-based agents who used coaching techniques to support families to improve nutrition and responsive caregiving within households. The intervention was designed from the outset to be feasible, affordable and scalable through the national healthcare system. The aim was to improve growth and development through pregnancy and the first two years of life. SPRING was evaluated by cluster randomised controlled trial, with clusters designed to minimize the risk of contamination. There were 24 clusters representing catchment areas of functioning health sub-centres, the lowest level of the primary healthcare system. Clusters were allocated to intervention and control groups with a 1:1 ratio, using restricted randomisation. Both groups had access to routine maternal and child healthcare services. Primary outcomes for the trial were length-for-age Z-score, and the motor, cognitive and language scales of Bayley Scales of Infant Development III (BSID-III) [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], all measured at 18 months of age. This impact evaluation was complemented with an economic analysis and a process evaluation, which will provide a better understanding of the SPRING mechanisms of action and inform governments for scaling-up and incorporating the intervention into healthcare systems. The SPRING trial is registered with ClinialTrials.gov, number NCT02059863.</p>
                <p>SPRING was implemented in 120 villages of three administrative areas of Rewari, a predominantly rural district of Haryana state, in North India, which represents a total population of around 200,000. In Rewari, demographic and health indicators are around average for Haryana state, with a female literacy rate of 67% for an overall literacy of 76%; a sex ratio amongst the lowest in India, with 879 females per 1000 males; and an infant mortality close to the national average (41/1000 births) [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Rewari is covered by the Integrated Child Development Services, which provides complementary nutrition to all pregnant and lactating women and children [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although Rewari is considered food secure, the prevalence of stunting in children under-five years old is extremely high, at 46% according to the SPRING baseline survey in 2014 (unpublished project data).</p>
                <p>One sample size calculation was done for the SPRING-ELS substudy of which the observed feeding tool formed a part. The aim was to explore the effect of adversity on growth [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A minimum of 25 children per cluster was needed to give 90% power at the 5% level of significance to detect effect sizes between 0.4SD &amp; 0.5SD, assuming an intra-cluster correlation of 0.05, using an established formula [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The work described in this paper used all available data, exceeding this calculated number.</p>

                <p>A trial surveillance system was implemented whereby trained resident fieldworkers visited all households with women of reproductive age, married and not sterilised every 8 weeks to enrol pregnant women and newborns, and to follow up those already identified. Babies with major congenital malformations and maternal deaths in the neonatal period were excluded. Sociodemographic data were collected at enrolment by surveillance system fieldworkers using mobile phones.</p>
                <p>A separate group of non-specialist assessors did assessments when enrolled children turned 12 months of age (within -7 to +21 days of this birthday). They had minimal experience of research, child assessment or use of observational tools. These assessments took around 2.5 hours and were spread over 2 days.</p>
                <p>The assessors did anthropometrical measurements of infants at 12 months. They measured weight with a precision of 0.01Kg using SECA-384 electronic scales calibrated each week. Ideally, children were weighed with their clothes removed. In cases where this was not possible, children were weighed fully-clothed, then their clothes were removed and weighed. The child’s weight was then calculated by subtracting the weight of the child’s clothes to the weight of the fully-clothed child. Length was measured by two assessors with a precision of 0.1cm using the SECA-417 infantometer [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
                <p>Assessors aimed to observe the caregiver and child during a meal if one was planned during the 3–5 hour period in which they were in the home doing other assessments, using our new Observed Feeding Tool. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237226.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> presents the 34 items that this tool contains and details how each item was scored by observers, while <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0237226.s002">S2 Appendix</xref> present standard operating procedure for the meal observation. Two items were scored before the meal, 11 during and 21 after the meal; it covers four elements of complementary feeding: 1) hygiene practices, 2) food quantity, 3) feeding behaviours and 4) food diversity. Assessor-expert reliability tests done using videos showed an overall reliability of 90% for all items with more than 80% agreement for each assessor. To limit the risk that caregivers and children change their behaviours because they knew they were observed, assessors had received instructions to sit in an unobtrusive position and to not intervene during the meal observation.</p>
                <p>During the meal itself, the assessor ticked a box each time a mouthful of food entered the child’s mouth, up to a maximum 30 times. Simultaneously, they observed 11 specific behaviours relating to caregiver encouragement, caregiver responsiveness, harsh behaviours and the child’s response to food. They noted by ticking a box each time a specific behaviour occurred, up to a maximum of three times. After the meal, assessors estimated the volume of food consumed during the meal using a <italic>katori</italic>–a widely used small stainless steel bowl with a volume of 160mL, assessed whether the caregiver or child had ended the meal and recorded the caregiver who was mainly in-charge of feeding the child. They asked this person questions related to reasons to start feeding, and whether the meal observed was typical, in terms of feeder, place of feeding and type of food. Finally, assessors evaluated social interaction during the meal (talking &amp; singing), interruptions, whether the child had their own plate or bowl, persons eating with the child, feeding location and types of foods offered during the meal. Caregiver’s behaviours, child’s behaviours and caregiver-child interaction observed during the meal are the focus of this paper.</p>

                  <title>Outcomes</title>
                  <p>Child length and weight were converted to Z-scores using the zscore06 package for Stata15 [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] based on the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ) and weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) at 12 months were the three outcomes for this study, expressed as continuous variables. Z-scores represented the number of standard deviations from the mean when compared with WHO Child Growth Standards, which represent the gold standard to describe normal growth in healthy breastfed children irrespective of country, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We excluded from the analysis mother-child pairs whose children had missing or implausible values of anthropometry identified using standard rules used by the WHO [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>

                  <p>We created three feeding behaviour indices measuring a) child behaviours b) caregiver behaviours and c) caregiver-child interaction during feeding using data from the behavioural section of the observed feeding tool. <xref rid="pone.0237226.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents child and caregiver behaviours assessed by the observer during feeding that were included respectively in Index A and B. Index A (child behaviours) assessed child’s interest in food, child’s social interaction with the caregiver, whether the child had ended the meal and child’s expression of hunger cues after the end of the meal. Index B (caregiver behaviours) assessed caregiver’s behaviours towards self-feeding, caregiver’s encouragements to promote eating, caregiver’s reactions to child’s cues or disinterest in food, caregiver’s social interaction and attention to the child during the meal, caregiver’s behaviours that distracts the child during the meal, harshness and whether the caregiver had ended the meal. All behaviours were included in Index C. The observer assessed separately behaviours within a category (e.g. ‘promoting’ and ‘discouraging’ self-feeding behaviours) using the observed feeding tool. Each behaviour assessed was converted into a binary variable. We then ran an unrotated principal component analysis with a single component using a correlation matrix because raw data was not standardized. We extracted the first principal component of each index, with the aim of capturing the linear combination of feeding behaviours within each index which creates the maximum variance of the data. This is a similar method to that commonly employed to calculate socioeconomic status indices [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The child feeding behaviour scores were reversed because positive scores here indicated poorly quality feeding behaviours. To enhance interpretability, the raw PCA score obtained for each index was standardized on a scale from 0 (the lowest PCA score) to 100 (the best PCA score).</p>

                  <title>Modelling the association between feeding behaviours and anthropometric outcomes</title>
                  <p>We used a causal backward modelling approach [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to study the independent associations between the three feeding indices and the three anthropometry outcomes. We performed mixed-effects linear regression, accounting for clustered-design as a random effect and trial arm allocation as a fixed effect to calculate the adjusted mean growth value at each score of behaviour indices. This allowed us to examine the change in these outcomes as children were exposed to incrementally greater scores of responsiveness. All models were adjusted for the following potential confounders: sociodemographic characteristics, maternal psychological risk factors, hygiene practices and feeding environment. We did not consider food quantity or food diversity as confounders because these were likely to be on the causal pathway [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. We included child age and sex as forced variables because there was no risk of overfitting [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After running final models, we checked for multicollinearity and departure from linearity using variance inflation factor criteria and diagnostic plots. Lastly, we assessed linear interactions by <italic>a priori</italic> identified potential effect modifiers (child sex, maternal education and socioeconomic status) using likelihood ratio tests. All analyses were performed using Stata v15 (StataCorp LLC: College Station, TX, USA).</p>

                <p>The flowchart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237226.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows that among 1,726 mother-child dyads eligible for SPRING outcome assessment, 874 had a meal observation. 422 mother-child dyads were lost to follow-up prior to this mainly because families were not available for assessment (12.0%), refused consent (5.9%), had moved away (4.2%) or because the mother or child had died (2.3%). Main reasons for not being observed during a meal included complementary feeding not being introduced yet (18.1%) (i.e child exclusively breastfed), no occurrence of a mealtime while assessors were in the household (4.6%), child sickness (1.5%), consent refusal (0.4%) and interruption of meal observation by the family (0.3%). Of the 874 mother-child pairs who had meals observed, 857 were included in this analysis; 16 mother-child pairs were not included because all required data were not available, and one child was excluded because of implausible anthropometric measures.</p>

                <p><xref rid="pone.0237226.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents sociodemographic characteristics of the 857 mother-child pairs observed during feeding. Overall, 442 children (51.6%) were males, and 20 (2.3%) were twins or triplets. Most children (n = 838, 97.8%) had been delivered in facilities, of mothers with a mean age at delivery of 22.3 (SD = 3.6) years. The majority of mothers had an education level of 10th to 12th grade (n = 335, 39.1%). Most meals observed were typical in terms of food provided (92.4%), feeder (81.9%) and place of feeding (76.2%). Children ate a median of 13 mouthfuls (IQR = 9;19) of food and most of them ate less than a 1/4 of a standard katori (n = 431/857, 50.3%), representing a volume of food of about 40mL. There was no evidence of selection bias in children in our study sample compared to those not observed, with regards to trial arm, maternal education, socioeconomic status, sex, maternal age at delivery, as well as delivery place. The proportion of twins/triplets differed, with a small p-value (p = 0.01); however, prevalence of twins/triplets was very low in both samples.</p>

This was similar for weight-for-length (-0.58 Z-score, SD = 0.95) and weight-for-age (-1.22 Z-score, SD = 1.04) showing that all three anthropometry measures were below WHO standards at age 12 months. Overall, 40% of children had signs of moderate to severe undernutrition, meaning that they had at least one anthropometric outcome with a Z-score ≤-2, with 35% being stunted (low length-for-age z-score), 23% underweight (low weight-for-age z-score) and 7% wasted (low weight-for-length z-score).</p>

Of the three indices, the scores were higher in Index C (caregiver-child interaction) compared with Index B (caregiver behaviours) and Index A (child behaviours) (median scores of 73/100, 64/100 and 25/100 respectively). The principal component of Index A had an eigenvalue of 1.45 and explained 24.1% of the variability observed in the data. Similarly, these were respectively 1.66 and 15.1% for Index B, and 2.29 and 14.3% for Index C. The number of components with an eigenvalue &gt; 1 were 2/6 for index A, 5/11 for Index B and 6/16 for Index C. The majority of caregivers verbally encouraged the child to eat (95%), interacted socially (93%) and gave full attention to the child (96%) during feeding. Uncommon behaviours observed in caregivers included harshness and distraction (each 2%), encouragement as well as discouragement of self-feeding (respectively 36% and 16%), being responsive to child cues (25%) and using positive strategies to overcome child refusal to eat (18%). Concerning children, most of them interacted socially during the meal (89%) and expressed more disinterest (75%) than interest in food (57%) while eating. Most meals were child ended (55%) and 14% ended prematurely. Of note, SPRING trial arm allocation did not have a meaningful impact on feeding behaviours, with very small point estimates, wide confidence intervals and large p-values for each of the feeding scales (data not shown).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We present data from the SPRING trial, where caregiver and child behaviours were observed during a meal. We found that the Observed Feeding Tool was suitable for assessment of feeding episodes by trained non-specialists. The key finding was that, at 12 months of age, positive child feeding behaviour was associated with increased length, and that positive caregiver behaviours and caregiver-child interaction were positively associated with child weight.</p>
              <p>The Observed Feeding Tool was used by trained non-specialists to assess feeding episodes in a population of children aged 12 months with their mother in rural India. Assessor-expert reliability and agreement for each assessor were high suggesting that this tool may be suitable for assessment of feeding by trained non-specialists in community-based interventions in low-resource settings.</p>
              <p>On the whole, children showed little interest in food during mealtimes. This has been noted previously in similar settings [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and may be connected to poor appetite. Those who showed more responsive feeding behaviours towards feeding had greater weight-for-age and length-for-age, which may reflect longer-term improvements in nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>Caregivers had some behaviours suggestive of a “laissez-faire” feeding style; on the whole they did not promote self-feeding nor stop children from doing it. They did not appear to follow children’s feeding cues and did not show many strategies to overcome food refusal. “Controlling” feeding style behaviours were rare, as suggested by the low prevalence of harshness and force-feeding behaviours.</p>
              <p>Caregiver behaviours scores were associated with weight-for-length, which reflects child current nutritional status and is prone to short-term variation [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Most children did not self-feed, despite their psychomotor ability to do so from the age of 9 months [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One explanation may be that children need a long time to self-feed at that age, whereas caregivers have competing demands on their time due to day-to-day chores or work [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, we observed a high prevalence of some responsive behaviours as defined in the WHO complementary feeding guidelines, such as interacting socially with children, minimizing distraction and encouraging the child to eat [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As responsive feeding has been linked to higher food acceptance [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], our results suggests that higher caregiver behaviours scores lead to weight gain in the short-term through increasing dietary intake.</p>
              <p>Caregiver-child interaction score was higher than that of child &amp; caregiver behaviours taken independently and was associated with weight-for-length and weight-for-age. Our results are in line with previous findings which showed that caregivers may compensate for a child’s lack of interest in feeding by increasing their responsiveness [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the short-term, compensation behaviours may promote rapid weight-for-length gain in children that would reflect on their weight-for-age. However, in the long-term, compensation behaviours may result in stressful experience for both caregivers and children [<xref rid="pone.0237226.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which may explain why we did not find an association with length-for-age.</p>
              <p>Our study had several strengths. We used a whole population, representative sample, in rural India, an understudied population. We made attempts to limit the risk of Hawthorne effect and expect meal observed to reflect usual caregiver and child behaviours during feeding.</p>
              <p>Limitations are inherent to the study design and data availability. We observed only one meal per infant. Although we found that most meals were typical in terms of food provided, feeder and place of feeding, for some children, the meal observed was different from that of their usual feeding environment. The relationship of feeding styles to anthropometrical measures may be bidirectional, and this could not be assessed in this cross-sectional study. Despite considerable attempts to consider confounding, residual confounding cannot be ruled out; specifically, data were not available on birthweight and recent infection.</p>
              <p>Our results show that feeding behaviours of children and caregivers, as well as caregiver-child interaction during feeding is associated with early childhood anthropometrical measures at only 12 months of age. There is an urgent need to support optimal child growth at this crucial age, and our new tool, alongside our initial findings provide support and a potential method of evaluation for further work in LMICs towards ensuring that all children have the opportunity to thrive.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: General comment</p>
              <p>This draft article reports a cross-sectional observational study of 857 12-month-old children and their mother. This study is nested in the SPRING RCT in North India since 2013. The objective is to assess a new tool to describe child and caregiver behaviours with regards to responsive feeding recommendations and define corresponding scores, and then look after potential associations between these scores and anthropometric z-scores. Data are scarce on this subject and this article reports an important and interesting work.</p>
              <p>However, the presentation of the article could be improved as in its current state, it is presented more like a report with stress put on the methods than like a scientific article. Some parts could be shortened, while other could be detailed further.</p>
              <p>One question is why the association between trial arm allocation and feeding behaviours was not assessed in this study. When modelling the association between feeding behaviours and anthropometric outcomes, it is reported that data were adjusted in accordance (intervention vs control) but nothing is said about the size and the significance of this effect.</p>
              <p>Thereafter are some more detailed comments given section by section.</p>
              <p>Title: should be changed, as the study does not report any follow-up of growth. The text of the article is much more cautious about this aspect, reporting only associations between mother and child behaviours during meal and anthropometric status.</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>Line 67: The statistical method used to look for association between behaviours and anthropometric data should appears in the paragraph “methods”.</p>
              <p>Line 69 : age of children should be indicated here (this first sentence would rather be in the method paragraph)</p>
              <p>Line 81: it is not clear what authors mean by “different elements of growth”?</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Lines 114-120: this section should be developed a bit more. What authors are meaning by standard methods? Some articles have reported standardized methods to describe and assess mother and child behaviours during meals. They should be referenced here (some are referenced subsequently, and some are missing.) What is really new is the method used for scoring.</p>
              <p>Line 130: not impact but rather association</p>
              <p>Material &amp; method section:</p>
              <p>Line 137: title should rather be: Overview of the SPRING study design</p>
              <p>Lines 140-141: a few words about the content of the SPRING intervention would be appreciated here or in the introduction section.</p>
              <p>Line 165: a reference is missing</p>
              <p>Line 169: the sampling method specifically used for this study (in the § sample size) should be described here rather than after methods of data collection</p>
              <p>Line 178: was the assessment precisely done on the day of children’s first birthday? Or was there a range for assessment?</p>
              <p>Lines 180-192: description of methods for anthropometric assessment could be shortened here and a reference to the WHO’ s standardized methods should be added.</p>
              <p>Line 194: how long did the assessors stay in the home?</p>
              <p>Line 196/Table 1: does the study presented here use the results of all 34 items? To avoid confusion, the whole table (or questionnaire) could be provided as supplemental data, and table 1 could focus only on the items used in this study with more details about the way of scoring of each item Or maybe table 2 is this focused table? For example: the way of scoring self-feeding C1 and C2 is not clear. For C2, score should be negative ? (same for C5, C6). Is the choice of 0, 1, 2 or 3 related to the frequency of the presence of a given behaviour? This is the responsibility of the assessor?</p>
              <p>Lines 204-221: this paragraph could be shortened (for example lines 204-205 are useless). The page number should be removed.</p>
              <p>Lines 205-206 and 211-212 (and E6 in table 1): mouthful were counted but no data are provided in the results ‘section about this. This is a pity because the effect of feeding behaviours could be mediated by an effect of behaviours about food intakes. Data on the number of katoris are neither given. Please indicate the volume of a katori.</p>
              <p>Table 1, E9: Replace inside by outside the courtyard</p>
              <p>Lines 223-226: should be removed if no results about these questionnaires are given.</p>
              <p>Lines 243-245: ref. 32 cited twice in the same sentence.</p>
              <p>Table 2: Invert the caregivers behaviours (index B) and the child behaviours (index A), as it is confusing. The way of scoring each item should be explained here, and the maximum score for each category (or indice).</p>
              <p>Lines 260-261: each behaviour was converted in a binary variable. Does this mean that all behaviour had the same weight in the score? Promoting means +1 and discouraging – 1?</p>
              <p>Lines 278-279: the only words about the effect of trial arm allocation is here! Even if this is not the main purpose of the study, knowing if there was an effect of intervention on feeding behaviours, could tell us about the possibility of changing these behaviours.</p>
              <p>Lines 283-284: Indeed, increased food intakes is one of the awaited effect of the responsive feeding which could have an effect on nutritional status, so having a look on the effect of feeding behaviours on food intakes would be interesting.</p>
              <p>Results section</p>
              <p>Figure 1. To make the reading easier, the flowchart could be completed to go until the included observation</p>
              <p>Table 3: which arm is the one of intervention? Of control?</p>
              <p>Line 331: figures 2 A, B, C are not only histograms. Only the figure 2A is related to length-for age.</p>
              <p>The three figures could be deleted as information in table 4 is sufficient, or if authors want to keep them, they could be reunited in a single figure, of smaller size</p>
              <p>Lines 332-333: could be deleted</p>
              <p>Line 336: …had signs of moderate to severe undernutrition</p>
              <p>Line 338: low length-for-age z-score, low weight-for-age z-score, low weight-for-length z-score</p>
              <p>Figures 2A, B C: there is no red line. Also add z-score where needed.</p>
              <p>Lines 371-372: we would like to know which components. The 3 figures of PCA could be displayed to help the reader. Does this refer to table 2? If so, we can count only 5 comments in table 2 b for child behaviours (but indeed 11 for index B)</p>
              <p>Line 378: 75 % + 57% are not 100%, please explain</p>
              <p>Table 5 is useless as median scores of feeding behaviour indices are already in the text (line 368)</p>
              <p>Line 396: …Please change in …with a positive linear change in length-for-age Z-score of 0.004</p>
              <p>Table 6: the three stars given as table footnote are not in the table.</p>
              <p>Figures 4A, B, C: Figure captions and titles of ordinate axes should be changed: the unit for anthropometric z-scores is the number of SD, and cannot be cm or g. Since all observations were done at the same age, a correspondence can be established between length-for-age z-score change with length change (in cm), or between weight-for-age z-score change with weight change (in g). But this is not possible for weight-for-length.</p>
              <p>Discussion:</p>
              <p>The repetition of results presented in the results’ section should be avoided here, and the results could be more deeply discussed with regards of the literature on this subject.</p>
              <p>Lines 446-447: “those who showed more interest…improvements in nutrition” On which analysis is based this statement?</p>
              <p>Lines 449-451 vs 458-459: these statements seem contradictory: behaviours suggestive as laissez-faire style /high prevalence of responsive behaviours?</p>
              <p>Line 465: does a higher score means a greater utilization here?</p>
              <p>Line 474: as almost half of the initial sample was not included for different reasons, are the authors sure that the study sample is still representative?</p>
              <p>Only one meal per infant was observed, could this be a limitation?</p>
              <p>References:</p>
              <p>Check if the references are presented in a way accepted by Plos One. The current format is not easy to read. The reference 11 also should be checked.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: This was a well-described study exploring the association between feeding practices and child anthropometric outcomes. I have a number of comments relating to the statistical analysis and reporting.</p>
              <p>Abstract: where you report mean anthropometric measures please specify the quantities indicated in brackets; are they SDs or SEs? They should ideally be SEs since anthropometric measures are your outcomes. It is also unclear in the results what 'caregiver behaviours' and 'child behaviours' means - this seems to me to be a qualitative factor, therefore I am struggling to understand, on the basis of the abstract alone, how it can relate to quantitative outcomes. You need to be clear what the quantitative aspect of behaviour is being correlated with anthropometric characteristics. Having read the rest of the manuscript, I suspect you may mean 'more responsive feeding behaviour was associated with increased WFL etc'; if this is the case, you should report as such in the abstract, and also report the beta-coefficients as differences in outcomes per unit increase in responsive behaviour score.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Table 1 please indicate the directionality of the quantitative scores; for example where items were scored on a scale of 0 to 30 or 0 to 3, what do higher/lower scores indicate?</p>
              <p>Exposures: please describe how the thresholds for converting item scores into binary responses were determined.</p>
              <p>Please describe whether your PCA was based on the default Pearson correlation coefficients or whether you used tetrachoric correlation coefficients; the latter are the appropriate choice for PCA of binary items.</p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p>A descriptive table summarising the characteristics of participants who were observed in both arms, with counts (%) for categorical variables and means (SDs) for continuous ones, should be included and briefly summarised in the first or second paragraph of the sample description, after talking about the flow diagram.</p>
              <p>Table 3: means of continuous outcomes should be accompanied by SEs (more appropriate for inference, which is what is being done here) rather than SDs (which are descriptive).</p>
              <p>Table 4: as this table is reporting outcomes, the means should be accompanied with SEs not SDs.</p>
              <p>Line 364 - I suppose you mean 'the first principal component of index...' in each case; I would expect that you extracted the first PCs in each case.</p>
              <p>The counts and proportions for the binary items which are described in the paragraph starting at line 360 should also be tabulated.</p>
              <p>The beta-coefficients in table 6 are differences and should be referred to as such here and elsewhere in the manuscript.</p>

              <p>Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: General comment</p>
              <p>This draft article reports a cross-sectional observational study of 857 12-month-old children and their mother. This study is nested in the SPRING RCT in North India since 2013. The objective is to assess a new tool to describe child and caregiver behaviours with regards to responsive feeding recommendations and define corresponding scores, and then look after potential associations between these scores and anthropometric z-scores. Data are scarce on this subject and this article reports an important and interesting work.</p>
              <p>However, the presentation of the article could be improved as in its current state, it is presented more like a report with stress put on the methods than like a scientific article. Some parts could be shortened, while other could be detailed further.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for these positive comments regarding our work. We have edited in line with suggestions in the detailed comments below.</p>
              <p>One question is why the association between trial arm allocation and feeding behaviours was not assessed in this study. When modelling the association between feeding behaviours and anthropometric outcomes, it is reported that data were adjusted in accordance (intervention vs control) but nothing is said about the size and the significance of this effect.</p>
              <p>Whilst this is not the focus of this paper and will be tackled more comprehensively alongside other measures of feeding knowledge, understanding and behaviours, we have now analysed the impact of trial arm allocation on feeding behaviours as requested. Results are as follows:</p>
              <p>- Impact of SPRING trial arm on overall feeding behaviour score, adjusted for all the other potential confounders (fully adjusted): 0.02 (95%CI: -0.18;0.23), p=0.83</p>
              <p>- Impact of SPRING trial arm on child feeding behaviour score, adjusted for all the other potential confounders (fully adjusted): 0.02 (95%CI: -0.18;0.23), p=0.82</p>
              <p>- Impact of SPRING trial arm on caregiver feeding behaviour score, adjusted for all the other potential confounders (fully adjusted): 0.02 (95%CI: -0.18;0.22), p=0.85</p>
              <p>We have added the following comment to the manuscript on new lines 359-361 in the cleaned version of the revised manuscript: “SPRING trial arm allocation did not have a meaningful impact on feeding behaviours, with very small point estimates, wide confidence intervals and large p-values for each of the feeding scales (data not shown).” </p>
              <p>Thereafter are some more detailed comments given section by section.</p>
              <p>Title: should be changed, as the study does not report any follow-up of growth. The text of the article is much more cautious about this aspect, reporting only associations between mother and child behaviours during meal and anthropometric status.</p>
              <p>We have replaced ‘growth’ with ‘weight and length’.</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>Line 67: The statistical method used to look for association between behaviours and anthropometric data should appears in the paragraph “methods”.</p>
              <p>We have added this on new lines 68-69.</p>
              <p>Line 69 : age of children should be indicated here (this first sentence would rather be in the method paragraph)</p>
              <p>We have clarified this in new line 62 and 65.</p>
              <p>Line 81: it is not clear what authors mean by “different elements of growth”?</p>
              <p>We have replaced this phrase with ‘weight and length’ on new lines 83-84.</p>
              <p>Introduction:</p>
              <p>Lines 114-120: this section should be developed a bit more. What authors are meaning by standard methods? Some articles have reported standardized methods to describe and assess mother and child behaviours during meals. They should be referenced here (some are referenced subsequently, and some are missing.) What is really new is the method used for scoring.</p>
              <p>We have clarified this on new lines 117-118: “This is because there is no method which allows non-specialists to perform a holistic responsive feeding assessment”.</p>
              <p>We have added reference to four previous methods for doing elements of a feeding assessment. </p>
              <p>We have emphasized where our method adds value in new lines 132-135: “we first present a method that uses a new scoring system to develop three indices for measurement of 1) child behaviours 2) caregiver behaviours and 3) caregiver-child interaction during feeding from a larger tool.”</p>
              <p>Line 130: not impact but rather association</p>
              <p>We agree and have edited this on new line 135.</p>
              <p>Material &amp; method section:</p>
              <p>Line 137: title should rather be: Overview of the SPRING study design</p>
              <p>We agree and have edited on new line 142.</p>
              <p>Lines 140-141: a few words about the content of the SPRING intervention would be appreciated here or in the introduction section.</p>
              <p>Thank you. This is now added in lines 146-147.</p>
              <p>Line 165: a reference is missing</p>
              <p>Thank you. This is now added on new line 167.</p>
              <p>Line 169: the sampling method specifically used for this study (in the § sample size) should be described here rather than after methods of data collection</p>
              <p>We have replaced the eligibility criteria with the sample size calculation and sampling method to aid clarity for the reader on new lines 173 -178.</p>
              <p>Line 178: was the assessment precisely done on the day of children’s first birthday? Or was there a range for assessment?</p>
              <p>We have added within “-7 to +21 days of this birthday” to aid clarity (new line 188).</p>
              <p>Lines 180-192: description of methods for anthropometric assessment could be shortened here and a reference to the WHO’ s standardized methods should be added.</p>
              <p>Thank you, we have done so on new line 197.</p>
              <p>Line 194: how long did the assessors stay in the home?</p>
              <p>We have added this on new line 200.</p>
              <p>Line 196/Table 1: does the study presented here use the results of all 34 items? To avoid confusion, the whole table (or questionnaire) could be provided as supplemental data, and table 1 could focus only on the items used in this study with more details about the way of scoring of each item Or maybe table 2 is this focused table? </p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. The study focuses on Caregiver’s behaviours, child’s behaviours and caregiver-child interaction observed during the meal. The whole formatted questionnaire with details on scoring for each item is presented in supplemental data 1 (S1). To avoid confusion, we suppressed Table 1, stated that the whole tool was presented in S1 with details on scoring per each item, and kept Table 2 (new Table 1) because this table focuses on items used in this paper. </p>
              <p>For example: the way of scoring self-feeding C1 and C2 is not clear. For C2, score should be negative? (same for C5, C6). Is the choice of 0, 1, 2 or 3 related to the frequency of the presence of a given behaviour? This is the responsibility of the assessor?</p>
              <p>We have added the following to new Table 1 caption to clarify this: “Table 1. Items* of the Observed feeding Tool included in feeding behaviours indices**,***.</p>
              <p>*Each item included in the indices were made binary, scored 1 if the behaviour was observed and 0 if it was not observed</p>
              <p>**Each index was scored on a scale from 0 (lowest score corresponding to the least responsive feeding behaviours) to 100 (highest score corresponding to the highest responsiveness during feeding)</p>
              <p>***All child and caregiver items were included in the Caregiver-child interaction index. ”</p>
              <p>We needed to reverse child feeding behaviours score. This was not automatically done by the PCA. The direction of child score was opposite to that of caregiver or overall scores.</p>
              <p>We have added the following to the manuscript on new lines 254-255: “The child feeding behaviour scores were reversed because positive scores here indicated poorly quality feeding behaviours.”</p>
              <p>Lines 204-221: this paragraph could be shortened (for example lines 204-205 are useless). The page number should be removed.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We removed lines 204-205 and referred to Appendices S1 (the whole Observed Feeding Tool) and S2 (Standard Operating Procedures for the meal observation) (new lines 201-202), and removed page numbering, which allowed us to shorten the paragraph. </p>
              <p>Lines 205-206 and 211-212 (and E6 in table 1): mouthful were counted but no data are provided in the results ‘section about this. This is a pity because the effect of feeding behaviours could be mediated by an effect of behaviours about food intakes. Data on the number of katoris are neither given. Please indicate the volume of a katori.</p>
              <p>We indicated the volume of a katori on new line 217: “assessors estimated the volume of food consumed during the meal using a katori – a widely used small stainless-steel bowl with a volume of 160mL”.</p>
              <p>We have added data on feeding quantity to the results section under the paragraph “Sample Description”:</p>
              <p>- New Table 2: Description of number of mouthful (median, IQR) and number of katoris (%, n) of food eaten by children observed during a meal</p>
              <p>- New lines 312-314: “Children ate a median of 13 mouthfuls (IQR=9;19) of food and most of them ate less than a 1/4 of a standard katori (n=431/857, 50.3%), representing a volume of food of about 40mL”.</p>
              <p>However, as we wanted to study the effect of mealtime behaviours on anthropometric outcomes, “we did not consider food quantity or food diversity as confounders because these were likely to be on the causal pathway [35,36].” (This is stated in lines 273-274).</p>
              <p>Table 1, E9: Replace inside by outside the courtyard</p>
              <p>Both of these refer to being inside a courtyard with the difference being only the flooring type (paved vs mud/dust). </p>
              <p>Lines 223-226: should be removed if no results about these questionnaires are given.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comments. We have deleted these lines. </p>
              <p>Lines 243-245: ref. 32 cited twice in the same sentence.</p>
              <p>Deleted first instance.</p>
              <p>Table 2: Invert the caregivers behaviours (index B) and the child behaviours (index A), as it is confusing. The way of scoring each item should be explained here, and the maximum score for each category (or indice).</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We inverted Index A (child behaviours) and B (caregiver behaviours) in new Table 1. </p>
              <p>We describe the way of scoring items below: </p>
              <p>- First step: Each item listed in Table 1 was scored by the assessor during mealtime, as described in Appendix S1. </p>
              <p>- Second step: Items were transformed into binary for PCA (0 if the behaviour was not observed, 1 if it was observed by the observer during the mealtime)</p>
              <p>- Third step: We ran the PCA for each index and the raw score obtained was standardized on a scale from 0 (lowest possible score) to 100 (highest possible score). </p>
              <p>To clarify for the reader, we changed the title of new Table 1 to “Items* of the Observed feeding Tool included in feeding behaviours indices**,***”, a) Index A: Child behaviours, b) Index B: Caregiver behaviours”, and added notes under the table : </p>
              <p>- *Each item included in the indices were made binary, scored 1 if the behaviour was observed and 0 if it was not observed</p>
              <p>- **Each index was scored on a scale from 0 (lowest score corresponding to the least responsive feeding behaviours) to 100 (highest score corresponding to the highest responsiveness during feeding)</p>
              <p>- ***All child and caregiver items were included in the Caregiver-child interaction index</p>
              <p>Lines 260-261: each behaviour was converted in a binary variable. Does this mean that all behaviour had the same weight in the score? Promoting means +1 and discouraging – 1?</p>
              <p>As described above, a behaviour observed at least one during mealtime was coded +1, independently of it being a promoting or discouraging behaviour. A behaviour that was not observed during mealtime was coded 0.</p>
              <p>Lines 278-279: the only words about the effect of trial arm allocation is here! Even if this is not the main purpose of the study, knowing if there was an effect of intervention on feeding behaviours, could tell us about the possibility of changing these behaviours.</p>
              <p>It is important that the impact of the SPRING trial on these behaviours is not overemphasised as other work is in progress describing the trial and its impact in more detail across a range of outcomes. We do not think a detailed understanding of the trial impact is key to understanding this work. However, we have presented data on lines 359-361 as follows: “SPRING trial arm allocation did not have a meaningful impact on feeding behaviours, with very small point estimates, wide confidence intervals and large p-values for each of the feeding scales (data not shown).”</p>
              <p>Lines 283-284: Indeed, increased food intakes is one of the awaited effect of the responsive feeding which could have an effect on nutritional status, so having a look on the effect of feeding behaviours on food intakes would be interesting.</p>
              <p>You are right that there is an impact of feeding behaviours on food intakes:</p>
              <p>- Average increase in number of mouthful intake per unit increase in Child feeding behaviour score: 0.40 (95%CI:0.21;0.59), p&lt;0.0001 </p>
              <p>- Average increase in number of mouthful intake per unit increase in Caregiver feeding behaviour score: 0.36(95%CI :0.24 ;0.48), p&lt;0.0001 </p>
              <p>- Average increase in number of mouthful intake per unit increase in Overall feeding behaviour score: 0.54 (95%CI: 0.42;0.66), p&lt;0.0001 </p>
              <p>However, as we wanted to study the effect of mealtime behaviours on anthropometric outcomes, and therefore “we did not consider food quantity or food diversity as confounders because these were likely to be on the causal pathway [35,36].” (This is stated in lines 273-274). Taking into account food intakes would therefore have biased the estimates of the impact of feeding behaviours on anthropometric outcomes towards the null. In consequence, we think this is out of scope of this paper and did not report these data in the paper. </p>
              <p>Results section</p>
              <p>Figure 1. To make the reading easier, the flowchart could be completed to go until the included observation</p>
              <p>We like the flowchart and think it aids the reader in understanding the representativeness of the sample. Could the reviewer rephrase their concern if it still stands.</p>
              <p>Table 3: which arm is the one of intervention? Of control?</p>
              <p>The authors are blind to trial arm allocation and this table is simply to check for evidence of selection bias.</p>
              <p>Line 331: figures 2 A, B, C are not only histograms. Only the figure 2A is related to length-for age.</p>
              <p>We have removed the reference to histograms and made it clear that the figure reference refers to the whole paragraph (new lines 335-336). </p>
              <p>The three figures could be deleted as information in table 4 is sufficient, or if authors want to keep them, they could be reunited in a single figure, of smaller size</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We combined the three figures into one of a smaller size (new Fig. 2).</p>
              <p>Lines 332-333: could be deleted</p>
              <p>We deleted these lines. </p>
              <p>Line 336: …had signs of moderate to severe undernutrition</p>
              <p>We added “had signs of moderate to severe undernutrition” to line 330.</p>
              <p>Line 338: low length-for-age z-score, low weight-for-age z-score, low weight-for-length z-score</p>
              <p>We added “low length-for-age z-score, low weight-for-age z-score, low weight-for-length z-score” to new lines 331-333.</p>
              <p>Figures 2A, B C: there is no red line. Also add z-score where needed.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We corrected and reedited the figure. </p>
              <p>Lines 371-372: we would like to know which components. The 3 figures of PCA could be displayed to help the reader. Does this refer to table 2? If so, we can count only 5 comments in table 2 b for child behaviours (but indeed 11 for index B)</p>
              <p>Each behaviour in new Table 1 corresponds to each component of the PCA. Child feeding behaviours are composed of 6 behaviours, and there are 11 for caregiver feeding behaviours score. </p>
              <p>Line 378: 75 % + 57% are not 100%, please explain</p>
              <p>These numbers represent the proportion of children who were seen by observers as doing at least once two different types of feeding behaviours (as described in new Table 1):</p>
              <p>- 75% of children showed disinterest in food at least once during mealtime, by saying no, sticking out their tongue, closing their mouth, turning or moving away </p>
              <p>- 57% of children tried to get food, meaning that they showed interest in food during mealtime, by asking for food, pointing to food, reaching for food, touching food or opening their mouth</p>
              <p>As these two behaviours are not strictly opposites, and to avoid confusion, we changed the term “showing interest in food” by “trying to get food”. </p>
              <p>Table 5 is useless as median scores of feeding behaviour indices are already in the text (line 368)</p>
              <p>We have removed Table 5. </p>
              <p>Line 396: …Please change in …with a positive linear change in length-for-age Z-score of 0.004</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We changed to “with a positive linear difference in length-for-age Z-score of 0.004” on line 376, and similarly on lines 383 and 391. We used the term difference instead of change to answer another reviewer’s comment.</p>
              <p>Table 6: the three stars given as table footnote are not in the table.</p>
              <p>We have now corrected this in Table 6 (new Table 5) </p>
              <p>Figures 4A, B, C: Figure captions and titles of ordinate axes should be changed: the unit for anthropometric z-scores is the number of SD, and cannot be cm or g. Since all observations were done at the same age, a correspondence can be established between length-for-age z-score change with length change (in cm), or between weight-for-age z-score change with weight change (in g). But this is not possible for weight-for-length.</p>
              <p>The purpose of these graphs is to present the already-presented data in more meaningful manner to the generalist reader. We would prefer to leave them as they are currently, however are open to removing them if this is deemed necessary by the reviewers/editor.</p>
              <p>You are right that it is possible to obtain a correspondence between length-for-age Z-score change with length change, or between weight-for-age Z-score with weight change. We built our graphs in cm and grams based on the data from the WHO growth curves for both boys and girls at 12 months. </p>
              <p>Similarly, for weight-for-length, we were able to obtain a value in grams by taking as a starting point, the weight that children are expected to have for a mean height at 12 months, based on the WHO growth curves. </p>
              <p>The results we display are overall weighted means in length and weight increase for children at 12 months, for each anthropometric outcome. </p>
              <p> Discussion:</p>
              <p>The repetition of results presented in the results’ section should be avoided here, and the results could be more deeply discussed with regards of the literature on this subject.</p>
              <p>Lines 438-440: “those who showed more interest…improvements in nutrition” On which analysis is based this statement?</p>
              <p>There was a positive linear association between child responsive feeding behaviours score and length-for-age &amp; weight-for-age, which are two markers of long-term nutritional status in children. We clarified this statement and changed to: “Those who showed more responsive feeding behaviours towards feeding had greater weight-for-age and length-for-age, which may reflect longer-term improvements in nutrition [22].” (new lines 423-425)</p>
              <p>Lines 449-451 vs 458-459: these statements seem contradictory: behaviours suggestive as laissez-faire style /high prevalence of responsive behaviours?</p>
              <p>There were both a high prevalence of some of the behaviours observed in caregiver that were suggestive of a laissez-faire feeding style (such as not promoting self-feeding nor stopping the child from doing it), while other behaviours were suggestive of a responsive feeding style (such as interacting socially with children, minimizing distraction and encouraging the child to eat). We clarified these statements and changed to: “Caregivers had some behaviours suggestive of a “laissez-faire” feeding style; on the whole they did not promote self-feeding nor stop children from doing it.” on new lines 426-427; and “However, we observed a high prevalence of some responsive behaviours as defined in the WHO complementary feeding guidelines, such as interacting socially with children, minimizing distraction and encouraging the child to eat” on new lines 435-438. </p>
              <p>Line 465: does a higher score means a greater utilization here?</p>
              <p>All child and caregiver items have been put into the PCA to construct the caregiver-child interaction score. We therefore expect this score to reflect interaction between caregiver and child. Therefore, a higher score is expected to be the result of more positive interactions between child and caregiver. It can reflect how child adapts to the caregiver and how caregiver adapts to the child during feeding taking into account how “the other” behaves (caregiver for the child, and child for the caregiver).</p>
              <p>Line 474: as almost half of the initial sample was not included for different reasons, are the authors sure that the study sample is still representative?</p>
              <p>There was no evidence of difference between those included and not included by trial arm, maternal education, SES, child sex, delivery in a facility, and maternal age at delivery.</p>
              <p>It is rare to have the opportunity to do this sort of population-based sampling and we think the reader will decide how it compares to other more purposive methods of sampling.</p>
              <p>Only one meal per infant was observed, could this be a limitation?</p>
              <p>Yes, we have added this on lines 455-458: “We observed only one meal per infant. Although we found that most meals were typical in terms of food provided, feeder and place of feeding, for some children, the meal observed was different from that of their usual feeding environment.”</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: This was a well-described study exploring the association between feeding practices and child anthropometric outcomes. I have a number of comments relating to the statistical analysis and reporting.</p>
              <p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and provide details responses below.</p>
              <p>Abstract: where you report mean anthropometric measures please specify the quantities indicated in brackets; are they SDs or SEs? They should ideally be SEs since anthropometric measures are your outcomes.</p>
              <p>We have now specified in the abstract and in the main text that the quantities in brackets are SDs which we believe are an appropriate method for showing the ‘spread’ of these data around their mean.</p>
              <p>It is also unclear in the results what 'caregiver behaviours' and 'child behaviours' means - this seems to me to be a qualitative factor, therefore I am struggling to understand, on the basis of the abstract alone, how it can relate to quantitative outcomes.</p>
              <p>You need to be clear what the quantitative aspect of behaviour is being correlated with anthropometric characteristics. Having read the rest of the manuscript, I suspect you may mean 'more responsive feeding behaviour was associated with increased WFL etc'; if this is the case, you should report as such in the abstract, and also report the beta-coefficients as differences in outcomes per unit increase in responsive behaviour score.</p>
              <p>We have now done this.</p>
              <p>Methods:</p>
              <p>Table 1 please indicate the directionality of the quantitative scores; for example where items were scored on a scale of 0 to 30 or 0 to 3, what do higher/lower scores indicate?</p>
              <p>Exposures: please describe how the thresholds for converting item scores into binary responses were determined.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We describe the way of scoring items below: </p>
              <p>- First step: Each item listed in Table 1 was scored by the assessor during mealtime, as described in Appendix S1. </p>
              <p>- Second step: Items were transformed into binary for PCA (0 if the behaviour was not observed, 1 if it was observed by the observer during the mealtime)</p>
              <p>- Third step: We ran the PCA for each index and the raw score obtained was standardized on a scale from 0 (lowest possible score) to 100 (highest possible score). </p>
              <p>New Table 1 presents “Items of the Observed feeding Tool included in feeding behaviours indices, a) Index A: Child behaviours, b) Index B: Caregiver behaviours”: </p>
              <p>- Each item included in the indices were made binary, scored 1 if the behaviour was observed and 0 if it was not observed</p>
              <p>- Each index was scored on a scale from 0 (lowest score corresponding to the least responsive feeding behaviours) to 100 (highest score corresponding to the highest responsiveness during feeding)</p>
              <p>- All child and caregiver items were included in the Caregiver-child interaction index</p>
              <p>Please describe whether your PCA was based on the default Pearson correlation coefficients or whether you used tetrachoric correlation coefficients; the latter are the appropriate choice for PCA of binary items.</p>
              <p>We ran the PCA based on Pearson correlation coefficients in order to retain the same analysis principle throughout the SPRING trial including for socio-economic status, which was based on Vyas &amp; Kumarayake (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17030551/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17030551/</ext-link>)’s work on construction of SES scores in LMICs.</p>
              <p>Results:</p>
              <p>A descriptive table summarising the characteristics of participants who were observed in both arms, with counts (%) for categorical variables and means (SDs) for continuous ones, should be included and briefly summarised in the first or second paragraph of the sample description, after talking about the flow diagram.</p>
              <p>This is described in Table 3 (new Table 2). We added a paragraph to briefly summarise these results under the section “Sample Description” in new lines 307-311: “Table 2 presents sociodemographic characteristics of the 857 mother-child pairs observed during feeding. Overall, 442 children (51.6%) were males, and 20 (2.3%) were twins or triplets. Most children (n=838, 97.8%) had been delivered in facilities, of mothers with a mean age at delivery of 22.3 (SD=3.6) years. The majority of mothers had an education level of 10th to 12th grade (n=335, 39.1%)”. </p>
              <p>Table 3: means of continuous outcomes should be accompanied by SEs (more appropriate for inference, which is what is being done here) rather than SDs (which are descriptive).</p>
              <p>The purpose of the standard deviations presented in new Table 2 is to help describe characteristics of mother-child pairs included in the study sample. The SDs are used here simply to describe the variance around the means. We do not agree with the reviewer that these should be SEs. There is no inference.</p>
              <p>Table 4: as this table is reporting outcomes, the means should be accompanied with SEs not SDs.</p>
              <p>The purpose of Table 4 (new Table 3) is to describe anthropometric characteristics of children included in our study sample. The SDs used here are simply to describe the variance around the sample mean presented. We do not agree with the reviewer that an SE is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>
              <p>Line 364 - I suppose you mean 'the first principal component of index...' in each case; I would expect that you extracted the first PCs in each case.</p>
              <p>Yes, this is correct, we extracted the first principal component for each index. We have added this on new line 251.</p>
              <p>The counts and proportions for the binary items which are described in the paragraph starting at line 360 should also be tabulated.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment, we tabulated the binary items and displayed the results in a table. These appear in new Table 4.</p>
              <p>The beta-coefficients in table 6 are differences and should be referred to as such here and elsewhere in the manuscript.</p>
              <p>Thank you for your comment. We have now done this.</p>
