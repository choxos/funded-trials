                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy for prostate cancer is prone to random and systemic error and has been shown to have a negative predictive value of 70%. PRECISION and PRECISE are among the first randomised studies to evaluate the new MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) pathway with a non-paired design to detect clinically significant prostate cancer and avoid unnecessary treatment. The trials’ results individually demonstrated non-inferiority of MRI-TB compared to TRUS biopsy. An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was planned from the outset of the two trials in parallel and this IPD meta-analysis aims to further elucidate the utility of MRI-TB as the optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer.</p>

                  <p>This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021249263). A search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Registered Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed up until 4<sup>th</sup> February 2021. Only randomised controlled trials (PRECISE, PRECISION and other eligible trials) comparing the MRI-targeted biopsy pathway and traditional TRUS biopsy pathway will be included. The primary outcome of the review is the proportion of men diagnosed with clinically significant prostate cancer in each arm (Gleason ≥ 3+4 = 7). IPD and study-level data and characteristics will be sought from eligible studies. Analyses will be done primarily using an intention-to-treat approach, and a one-step IPD meta-analysis will be performed using generalised linear mixed models. A non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage points will be used. Heterogeneity will be quantified using the variance parameters from the mixed model. If there is sufficient data, we will investigate heterogeneity by exploring the effect of the different conducts of MRIs, learning curves of MRI reporting and MRI targeted biopsies.</p>

                <title>1.1. Rationale and objectives</title>
                <p>In men with a suspicion of localised prostate cancer (e.g. raised PSA and/or abnormal digital rectal exam and/or family history of prostate cancer), the traditional standard of care for diagnosis is systematic transrectal ultrasound guided (TRUS) prostate biopsy. During TRUS biopsy, 10–12 cores are taken randomly. Ultrasound traditionally does not visualize prostate cancer well, therefore TRUS biopsy is prone to random and systematic error and has been shown to have a negative predictive value of just 74% for detection of lesions with Gleason ≥ 4+3 and/ or cancer core length ≥ 6mm [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0263345.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although negative predictive value is dependent on inclusion criterion for consideration of biopsy and other factors such as what one accepts to be deemed a clinically significant cancer, this could lead to the possibility of incorrect risk stratification of patients, leading to poorly informed treatment decisions.</p>
                <p>An alternative method of diagnosing cancer in men with suspicion of prostate cancer is to perform a multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) scan of the prostate [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. mpMRI can identify suspicious lesions in the prostate with a reported negative predictive value of 85–95% for the identification of clinically significant cancer [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0263345.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], though it does require expertise in the conduct and reporting of images [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. If an MRI is suspicious (typically with a score 3–5 on a 5-point Likert scale from the PIRADs v2 score [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), a biopsy procedure must still currently be carried out to provide confirmatory pathology, and, if cancer is present, to confirm Gleason Grade to guide treatment-based decisions and prognostic discussions [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
                <p>A recent systematic review has demonstrated that MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) alone can detect more clinically significant cancer and less clinically insignificant cancer than systematic biopsy with a higher sampling efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the majority of the evidence from previous systematic reviews is from studies comparing patients who underwent both biopsy techniques (MRI-targeted biopsy and TRUS-biopsy) in the same sitting [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This within-patient design is subject to incorporation bias due to the potential knowledge of location of MRI lesions during TRUS biopsy [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], however, 9 out of 68 studies (13%) included in the systematic review was performed by the same operator, suggesting no blinding in 87% of the studies [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, this within-patient design also limits the comparison of patients who have an MRI lesion (and have both MRI-targeted biopsy and standard TRUS biopsy) which does not capture outcomes in patients who have non-suspicious MRIs (Likert score 1 or 2), who may not routinely be offered biopsy [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
                <p>Therefore, to establish the diagnostic yield of MRI-targeted biopsy compared to standard TRUS biopsy alone, the PRECISION trial [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], an international study led by University College London in the United Kingdom and the PRECISE trial [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a national study led by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Canada, were designed in parallel from the outset using a similar protocol [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] deliberately with an end goal of performing an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to avoid the above biases. Both trials randomised patients with suspicion of prostate cancer who are “biopsy-naïve” to either (a) standard TRUS biopsy or (b) MRI with or without targeted biopsy (MRI-targeted biopsy). In the standard TRUS biopsy arm, men underwent standard TRUS biopsy alone. In the MRI-targeted biopsy arm, men with a non-suspicious MRI result avoided biopsy, whereas men who had lesions scoring 3,4 or 5 on the PIRADS v2 score [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] underwent MRI-targeted biopsy alone (without the addition of standard TRUS biopsy cores) (<xref rid="pone.0263345.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Whilst the PRECISE study showed that MRI with or without targeted biopsy in men with MRI-targetable lesions was non-inferior to TRUS biopsy for the detection of clinically significant cancer, the PRECISION study demonstrated that the MRI pathway was superior. Meta-analysis may help to establish whether the MRI-pathway is indeed non-inferior or superior to the TRUS biopsy pathway. In addition, further clarification on pathological and clinical outcomes that the individual studies were not powered to evaluate may be possible.</p>

                  <p>All randomised patients with outcome data and studies with available IPD will be included in the analysis. We will use an intention-to-treat approach to compare the proportion of men diagnosed with clinically significant cancer (Gleason 3+4 or Gleason Grade Group 2 or greater) in the MRI arm and TRUS-biopsy arm. A one-step IPD meta-analysis will be performed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) to analyse all studies simultaneously while accounting for the clustering of participants within each study (random intercept model). We will use an identity link function in the model to allow estimation of the absolute difference in the proportion of men diagnosed with clinically significant cancer between the two arms. Similar to the PRECISION and PRECISE trials, a non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage points will be used to assess non-inferiority. This margin was determined at an expert consensus group meeting [<xref rid="pone.0263345.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of clinically significant cancer in the MRI arm relative to the TRUS-biopsy arm is greater than −5 percentage points, then MRI will be considered non-inferior to TRUS biopsy alone. In addition, if the lower limit exceeds zero, superiority will be inferred.</p>

For studies that meet our inclusion criterion but are unable to provide IPD, we will undertake a secondary analysis to combine the IPD meta-analysis results with published aggregate results, using a two-step IPD meta-analysis. The rationale for this analysis is to assess whether the meta-analysis results of the primary outcome is representative of those based on all the data, thus investigating data availability bias.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #1: In this study authors present their plan to conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to elaborate the utility of MRI-targeted biopsy as an optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer. The study plan is solid and well-written. I have a few comments that I the authors should address to qualify for following up with the journal for further review of their findings.</p>
              <p>- The authors have discussed limitations of a previously published systematic-review on this topic. One noted point is that a within-patient design of that study is subject to bias due to the potential knowledge of location of MRI lesions during TRUS biopsy. However, data in the afore-mentioned review is mainly obtained from studies with blinded design. Using within-patient design may be superior as it can address confounders in prostate cancer diagnosis. Authors should further justify their rational for superiority of of their meta-analysis compared to the within-patient studies with blinded design.</p>
              <p>. This within-patient design is subject to incorporation</p>
              <p>- Beside the diagnostic accuracy of each modality, the overall rate of prostate cancer depend on several factors, such as age and PSA level etc. - How will the authors address the heterogeneous baseline characteristics of the individual studies included here?</p>
              <p>- The authors have mentioned that authors of the included studied for their meta-analysis will be contacted to provide patient-level data. How would not receiving a response be addressed in this study.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review: A protocol for the VISION study: An indiVidual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing MRI-targeted biopsy to standard transrectal ultraSound guided bIopsy in the detection of prOstate cancer</p>
              <p>I would consider changing the acronym because we just had another VISION Trial published in prostate cancer, but that’s just me.</p>
              <p>The overall impression of the study protocol is good, but I have some minor concerns.</p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>I find the abstract somewhat vague. Is the intent of the analysis to analyse PRECISION and PRECISE and/or to include other RCTs?</p>
              <p>I don’t agree with the 70% NPV statement of systematic TRUS biopsy, which is also stated in the introduction. The NPV depends heavily on the inclusion criteria and what you define as NPV. A true negative patient or a patient with GS&lt;7? Death from PCa? Systematic TRUS biopsy have an NPV of 0 in men with high age, PSA&gt;100 and clinical T3/4 tumors. There is a tendency to underplay systematic TRUS biopsy as a diagnostic procedure which is not true. It may miss cancers in certain clinical scenarios, but that is not necessarily bad, just look at <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411967/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411967/</ext-link></p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>I think reference 1 is bad for a statement on the NPV of TRUS biopsy. That reference is personal comment. Also, what do you mean by NPV here? That no cancer at all is there? Again, I think it is important to acknowledge that systematic TRUS biopsy has high performance for diagnosing both the cancer, GG2 cancers and even more advanced cancers when you combine age, PSA and clinical T-category.</p>
              <p>In the next paragraph, NPV now refers to the presence of non-significant PCa.</p>
              <p>“Whilst the PRECISE study showed that MRI with or without targeted biopsy was non-inferior to TRUS biopsy,”</p>
              <p>I am not sure I understand that sentence. The trial compared target biopsies for MRI PIRADs 3-5 vs systematic TRUS biopsy.</p>
              <p>“Meta-analysis may help to establish whether the MRI-pathway is indeed non inferior or superior to the TRUS biopsy pathway. In addition, further clarification on pathological and clinical outcomes that the individual studies were not powered to evaluate may be possible”</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether I understand from the introduction that this is a meta-analysis of two trials or the two trials + other trials. If you believe that you can argue superiority of MRI+ target biopsy to systematic TRUS biopsy from PRECISION that was a non-inferiority trial that concluded statistical superiority in the post-hoc analysis and a trial that was only non-inferior I think the reader needs a little more background on how that is possible.</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>“…and no biopsy in non-suspicious MRIs (MRI±TB) compared to a strategy of standard TRUS biopsy?”</p>
              <p>I find that question a little bit self-conclusive. The problem with the trials that you are going to look into is that you are up-front comparing apples and pears. The two trials never took biopsies in patients with PIRADs 1 and 2 (at least). I don’t think its fair to compare biopsy vs no-biopsy.</p>
              <p>Problematically, the PRECISION trial included men that some would never biopsy at all, even order an MRI scan. Most patients had cT1, no family history of PCa, median age of 65 and PSA og 6,7. So its rather easy to say that if you take biopsies you find something that you wouldn’t have liked to find in that kind of man, just given the prevalence of the disease in the age group.</p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria</p>
              <p>As mentioned previously, I don’t understand why you just don’t state that you intend to include one more trial and update a previous publication. Because we all know that there is only one more trial within the narrow research question of MRI + target vs systematic TRUS biopsy</p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The proposed study protocol seems very sensible and sets out to help answer and important set of questions. The team are very experienced with this topic and will I believe deliver a great study.</p>

              </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: In this study authors present their plan to conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to elaborate the utility of MRI-targeted biopsy as an optimal diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer. The study plan is solid and well-written. I have a few comments that I the authors should address to qualify for following up with the journal for further review of their findings.</p>
              <p>- The authors have discussed limitations of a previously published systematic-review on this topic. One noted point is that a within-patient design of that study is subject to bias due to the potential knowledge of location of MRI lesions during TRUS biopsy. However, data in the afore-mentioned review is mainly obtained from studies with blinded design. Using within-patient design may be superior as it can address confounders in prostate cancer diagnosis. Authors should further justify their rational for superiority of of their meta-analysis compared to the within-patient studies with blinded design.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you very much for your comments. There are pros and cons for a within-patient design, as well as a randomised design. Whilst one design won’t necessarily be superior to the other, it is fair to say both are considered level 1 evidence in this setting. The systematic review by Kasivisvanathan et al demonstrated that 9 of the 68 (13%) studies of the within patient design had a different operator performing MR-targeted and systematic core biopsies. This means there was no blinding in 87% of studies. Due to incorporation bias, the performance of MRI targeted biopsy can influence the performance of TRUS biopsy and vice versa. An advantage of the randomised study design is that performance of one test will not be influenced by the other. This is demonstrated by the PRECISION study which showed a high detection ratio in favour of targeted alone biopsy. This was the only study included in this systematic review which performed targeted biopsy alone in the MRI arm. </p>
              <p>- Beside the diagnostic accuracy of each modality, the overall rate of prostate cancer depend on several factors, such as age and PSA level etc. - How will the authors address the heterogeneous baseline characteristics of the individual studies included here?</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you very much for the comments. It is possible that there may be only two included studies in the IPD meta-analysis (IPDMA) (PRECISE AND PRECISION). These two studies were designed from the outset with similar protocols to allow an IPDMA and as such have similar inclusion criterion (clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, PSA 20ng per millilitre or less, and no contraindications to MRI or biopsy). This protocol similarity should negate some of this heterogeneity. Furthermore, we will evaluate statistical heterogeneity across studies using the variance parameters from the random-effects model. Data permitting, subgroup analyses will be performed for the primary outcome for each potential source of heterogeneity by extending the relevant generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) to assess the interaction with trial arm as mentioned under 2.6. Data analysis – analysis of primary outcome. If there are any other studies identified, they will be examined for clinical heterogeneity, and if they are too great, they will not be meta-analysed.</p>
              <p>- The authors have mentioned that authors of the included studied for their meta-analysis will be contacted to provide patient-level data. How would not receiving a response be addressed in this study.</p>
              <p>Authors’ response: Thank you very much for the comments. For studies we do not receive a response for, we will consider undertaking a secondary aggregate analysis to combine the IPD meta-analysis results with published results from studies that did not contribute to the IPD meta-analysis. This is outlined under Protocol Section 2.4.3. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review: A protocol for the VISION study: An indiVidual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials comparing MRI-targeted biopsy to standard transrectal ultraSound guided bIopsy in the detection of prOstate cancer</p>
              <p>I would consider changing the acronym because we just had another VISION Trial published in prostate cancer, but that’s just me.</p>
              <p>The overall impression of the study protocol is good, but I have some minor concerns.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you very much for the comment. We have already published the PROSPERO registration with the name VISION and we hope to maintain consistency and keep VISION as our study acronym. Although the acronym is the same, the full study name is different. We hope that is ok for the reviewer. </p>
              <p>Abstract</p>
              <p>I find the abstract somewhat vague. Is the intent of the analysis to analyse PRECISION and PRECISE and/or to include other RCTs?</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you for your comments. We intend to analyse any eligible RCTs with the same design and have altered the abstract to reflect this. </p>
              <p>I don’t agree with the 70% NPV statement of systematic TRUS biopsy, which is also stated in the introduction. The NPV depends heavily on the inclusion criteria and what you define as NPV. A true negative patient or a patient with GS&lt;7? Death from PCa? Systematic TRUS biopsy have an NPV of 0 in men with high age, PSA&gt;100 and clinical T3/4 tumors. There is a tendency to underplay systematic TRUS biopsy as a diagnostic procedure which is not true. It may miss cancers in certain clinical scenarios, but that is not necessarily bad, just look at <ext-link xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411967/" ext-link-type="uri">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31411967/</ext-link></p>
              <p>Introduction</p>
              <p>I think reference 1 is bad for a statement on the NPV of TRUS biopsy. That reference is personal comment. Also, what do you mean by NPV here? That no cancer at all is there? Again, I think it is important to acknowledge that systematic TRUS biopsy has high performance for diagnosing both the cancer, GG2 cancers and even more advanced cancers when you combine age, PSA and clinical T-category.</p>
              <p>In the next paragraph, NPV now refers to the presence of non-significant PCa.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you, these are both fair comments. We have now adjusted the manuscript and the references to include the PROMIS study. According to the PROMIS study, the NPV for detecting clinically significant cancer (Gleason ≥ 4+3 or cancer core length ≥ 6mm) is 74%, and this number reduces to 65% and 63% when considering "Gleason ≥ 4+3 or cancer core length ≥ 4 “and “Any Gleason score 7 (≥3+4)”, respectively. The edited text now reads: “Ultrasound traditionally does not visualize prostate cancer well, therefore TRUS biopsy is prone to random and systematic error and has been shown to have a negative predictive value of just 74% for lesions with Gleason ≥ 4+3 and/or cancer core length ≥ 6mm (1,2). Although negative predictive value is dependent on inclusion criterion for consideration of biopsy and other factors such as what one accepts to be deemed a clinically significant cancer, this could lead to the possibility of incorrect risk stratification of patients, leading to poorly informed treatment decisions.”. </p>
              <p>“Whilst the PRECISE study showed that MRI with or without targeted biopsy was non-inferior to TRUS biopsy,”</p>
              <p>I am not sure I understand that sentence. The trial compared target biopsies for MRI PIRADs 3-5 vs systematic TRUS biopsy.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you for highlighting this, we have edited the sentence to make this clearer: “Whilst the PRECISE study showed that MRI with or without targeted biopsy in men with MRI-targetable lesions was non-inferior to TRUS biopsy for the detection of clinically significant cancer, the PRECISION study demonstrated that the MRI pathway was superior.”</p>
              <p>“Meta-analysis may help to establish whether the MRI-pathway is indeed non inferior or superior to the TRUS biopsy pathway. In addition, further clarification on pathological and clinical outcomes that the individual studies were not powered to evaluate may be possible”</p>
              <p>I am not sure whether I understand from the introduction that this is a meta-analysis of two trials or the two trials + other trials. If you believe that you can argue superiority of MRI+ target biopsy to systematic TRUS biopsy from PRECISION that was a non-inferiority trial that concluded statistical superiority in the post-hoc analysis and a trial that was only non-inferior I think the reader needs a little more background on how that is possible.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you very much for your comments, this is a good question. This was discussed by key members of the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy group in the design of this study, and this was the conclusion that they have made. This relates to statistical interpretation of the confidence intervals. We have discussed this in more detail for the reader in the manuscript under 2.6. Data synthesis – analysis of primary outcome: “. Similar to the PRECISION and PRECISE trials, a non-inferiority margin of 5 percentage points will be used to assess non-inferiority. This margin was determined at an expert consensus group meeting (20). If the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of clinically significant cancer in the MRI arm relative to the TRUS-biopsy arm is greater than −5 percentage points, then MRI will be considered non-inferior to TRUS biopsy alone. In addition, if the lower limit exceeds zero, superiority will be inferred.”</p>
              <p>Methods</p>
              <p>“…and no biopsy in non-suspicious MRIs (MRI±TB) compared to a strategy of standard TRUS biopsy?”</p>
              <p>I find that question a little bit self-conclusive. The problem with the trials that you are going to look into is that you are up-front comparing apples and pears. The two trials never took biopsies in patients with PIRADs 1 and 2 (at least). I don’t think its fair to compare biopsy vs no-biopsy.</p>
              <p>Problematically, the PRECISION trial included men that some would never biopsy at all, even order an MRI scan. Most patients had cT1, no family history of PCa, median age of 65 and PSA og 6,7. So its rather easy to say that if you take biopsies you find something that you wouldn’t have liked to find in that kind of man, just given the prevalence of the disease in the age group.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you for the comment. In this study design, as a proportion of patients in the MRI arm do not get biopsy, this actually makes it harder for the MRI arm to show non-inferiority for detection of clinically significant cancer than the TRUS biopsy arm, in which everyone gets a biopsy. Just to clarify, the hypothesis is that the MRI arm is non-inferior to the TRUS biopsy arm, not the other way round. We acknowledge that for clinically insignificant cancer detection, that the reviewer’s comments hold true, i.e fewer men biopsy leading to fewer insignificant cancers detected, however, we would consider this to be an advantage for a diagnostic approach. </p>
              <p>Inclusion criteria</p>
              <p>As mentioned previously, I don’t understand why you just don’t state that you intend to include one more trial and update a previous publication. Because we all know that there is only one more trial within the narrow research question of MRI + target vs systematic TRUS biopsy</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you for your comments. The only way to know whether there is more than one additional trial is to perform a systematic review, as per the PRISMA guidelines for IPD meta-analysis. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #3: The proposed study protocol seems very sensible and sets out to help answer and important set of questions. The team are very experienced with this topic and will I believe deliver a great study.</p>
              <p>Authors’ Response: Thank you for your comments.</p>
