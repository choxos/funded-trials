                <sec>
                  <title>Purpose:</title>
                  <p>Approximately 10% to 15% of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) have deleterious mutations in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> and may benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment. PARP inhibitors may also increase exogenous replication stress and thereby increase sensitivity to inhibitors of ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein. This phase II study examined the activity of the combination of PARP inhibitor, olaparib, and ATR inhibitor, ceralasertib (AZD6738), in patients with advanced TNBC.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Patients and Methods:</title>
                  <p>Patients with TNBC on most recent biopsy who had received 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy for advanced disease or had relapsed within 12 months of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible. Treatment was olaparib 300 mg twice a day continuously and celarasertib 160 mg on days 1–7 on a 28-day cycle until disease progression. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Tissue and plasma biomarker analyses were preplanned to identify predictors of response.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>70 evaluable patients were enrolled. Germline <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations were present in 10 (14%) patients and 3 (4%) patients had somatic <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations. The confirmed ORR was 12/70; 17.1% (95% confidence interval, 10.4–25.5). Responses were observed in patients without germline or somatic <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, including patients with mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes and tumors with functional homologous recombination deficiency by RAD51 foci.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>The response rate to olaparib and ceralasertib did not meet prespecified criteria for activity in the overall evaluable population, but responses were observed in patients who would not be expected to respond to olaparib monotherapy.</p>

              <p>The standard systemic therapy of advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer is cytotoxic chemotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates and immunotherapy (in those with PDL-1 positive tumor). Despite more recent developments, the median overall survival of such patients is 2 years. PARP inhibitors are indicated in the 10–15% of patients with germline or somatic BRCA mutations. Cohort E of the plasmaMATCH Trial found that when a PARP inhibitor (Olaparib) was combined with an ATR inhibitor (Celerasertib), responses were seen both in patients with BRCA mutations and in those without. Patients with pathogenic mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes and low RAD51 foci were amongst responders. This means that patients without BRCA mutations, identifiable by other molecular predictors, may be able to benefit from this therapeutic approach.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 10% to 15% of breast cancers do not express hormone receptors [estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR)] and are HER2-negative. This triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup has a poor prognosis with overall survival for those patients with metastatic disease of 1 to 2 years (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The identification of novel therapeutic targets and treatment approaches in patients with this breast cancer subtype is therefore paramount. The PARP enzyme is required for single strand break DNA repair, and cancer cell lines with defective homologous recombination (HR) are unable to tolerate the DNA damage that results from PARP inhibition, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> are needed for HR and consequently cancer cell lines deficient in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors. Approximately 10% to 15% of TNBCs have deleterious mutations in <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic>, and the PARP inhibitors olaparib and talazoparib are licensed for the treatment of advanced HER2-negative breast cancer associated with these mutations. In addition, a proportion of sporadic TNBCs may have defective HR, in part due to reduced <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> expression or <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> promoter methylation, that may therefore benefit from PARP inhibitor treatment (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref>).</p>
              <p>AZD6738 (cerelasertib) is a potent, selective inhibitor of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) protein. ATR is an apical kinase in one of the DNA-damage induced checkpoint pathways (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). During normal DNA replication ATR is recruited at stalled replication forks, which can progress to double-strand breaks (DSB) if left unrepaired. Recruitment and activation of ATR leads to cell-cycle arrest in the S-phase while the DNA is repaired; either the stalled replication fork is resolved, or there is nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis. Loss of ATR function leads to the inability to resolve stalled replication forks, resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage and cell death. Increasing the exogenous replication stress in combination with PARP inhibitors such as olaparib could increase the sensitivity of ATR inhibitors. The combination of olaparib with an ATR inhibitor is therefore hypothesised to be active in TNBC (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM serine/threonine kinase) is a further apical kinase of DNA DSB response, that signals in a partially nonredundant fashion with ATR, and ATR inhibitors have synthetic lethal activity in ATM-deficient cancers (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Preclinical models have shown that TNBC, <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutant and ATM-deficient cancer may be highly sensitive to the combination of PARP inhibitors and DNA damage response kinase inhibitors such as ATR inhibitors (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>).</p>
              <p>The plasmaMATCH trial was an open label, non-randomized, phase IIa clinical trial platform, consisting of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing in patients with advanced breast cancer linked to parallel treatment cohorts with therapies matched to mutations identified in ctDNA. The ctDNA screening component of the trial and Cohorts A–D have already been reported (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). With the low incidence of the mutations targeted (<italic toggle="yes">ESR1, ERBB2, AKT1, PTEN</italic>) in TNBC, an additional cohort, Cohort E, was added later to the adaptive trial platform to include patients with TNBC without a targetable mutation identified at ctDNA screening, treating them with olaparib (PARP inhibitor) plus ceralasertib (ATR inhibitor, formerly AZD6738). Here we report the principal results of Cohort E, along with predefined biomarker subgroup analyses.</p>

                <title>Patients</title>
                <p>Cohort E of the plasmaMATCH study was designed to recruit patients with advanced TNBC as determined on their most recent biopsy. TNBC defined as ER-negative, PgR-negative (ER- and PgR-negative defined as either Allred score 0/8 or 2/8 or stain in &lt;1% of cancer cells) or ER-negative, PgR unavailable, and HER2-negative (IHC 0/1+ or negative in situ hybridization) as determined by local laboratory. These patients had undergone ctDNA screening as part of plasmaMATCH trial registration and were not able to enter Cohorts A–D because either no actionable mutations were identified; or an actionable mutation was identified but the cohort was closed; or the patient did not meet the relevant cohort specific eligibility criteria. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and were suitable for a baseline advanced disease biopsy or had an archival advanced disease biopsy available for translational analyses. Patients had disease progression by radiological assessment and had completed at least one prior line of treatment for advanced breast cancer and/or relapsed within 12 months of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. A maximum of two prior lines of chemotherapy, antibody–drug conjugate or immunotherapy for advanced disease were permitted. If patients had received a prior platinum-containing therapy for metastatic disease they were required to have achieved a partial response (PR)/complete response (CR) or stable disease (SD) and not have progressed during or within 8 weeks of receipt of last dose of platinum.</p>

                <p>Details on ctDNA testing have been reported previously (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Treatment for patients eligible for Cohort E was with olaparib 300 mg twice daily administered orally on each day of the treatment cycle and ceralasertib 160 mg once daily administered orally on days 1–7 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Treatment was until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants could also discontinue from trial treatment at any time at their own request or be discontinued at the discretion of the treating clinician. Dose modifications were permitted for patients experiencing toxicities related to treatment. Patients underwent CT or MRI scan and bone scan at baseline, with CT or MRI scan repeated 8 weekly until 32 weeks and 12 weekly thereafter. Laboratory assessments, adverse event (AE) recording and vital signs were performed at least every 4 weeks. Toxicity was assessed using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Coding was done with use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 22.</p>

                <p>The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) defined as a confirmed CR or PR at any point during trial treatment according to RECIST criteria, version 1.1. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (defined as time from the first documentation of CR or PR until date of disease progression or last date of follow-up), clinical benefit rate (defined as CR, PR, or SD for more than 6 months during trial treatment), progression-free survival (PFS; defined as time from cohort entry to first date of either confirmed progression of disease according to RECIST criteria or death from any cause), safety and tolerability of therapies.</p>

                <title>Statistical considerations</title>
                <p>A Simon two-stage design was used with a target initial response rate of 25% and unacceptable response rate of 10%, two-sided α = 0.02 and 90% power. Stage 1 required recruitment of 37 evaluable patients and at least 5 responses to be observed to continue recruitment to a total of 69 evaluable patients where at least 13 responses were required to infer sufficient activity of the olaparib–ceralasertib combination.</p>
                <p>ORR, duration of response, and clinical benefit rate were measured in an evaluable population defined as those patients with measurable disease per RECIST at baseline and at least one on-treatment assessment; patients who stopped treatment because of intolerable toxicity or death without having a scan after baseline were evaluable and recorded as nonresponders. Proportions and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for estimation purposes were reported. For the primary endpoint, in addition to the response rate reported as a percentage (responses/number of evaluable patients), the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) and adjusted 95% CI are also reported to account for the two-stage design (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12, 13</xref>). Subgroup analyses were planned to analyze activity according to <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> status (germline and somatic) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes (from ctDNA). Analyses by <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutation status; and, in patients with no germline or somatic <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations, by ATM loss (“loss” defined as Hscore ≤10), Cyclin E1 (high/low; cutpoint = median) and RAD51 foci formation (high/low; low ≤10%) were conducted. No formal comparisons between subgroups were made.</p>
                <p>PFS used the intention-to-treat population. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted and median PFS was reported with 95% CI. Patients who were alive and progression-free were censored at date of last follow-up; patients who had non-RECIST confirmed progression (e.g., clinical progression only or radiologically confirmed but lesions not measured according to RECIST) were censored at the date progression was reported. The safety population included all patients who had at least one dose of treatment and treatment-emergent AEs where &gt;10% patients reported any grade or any patients reporting grade ≥3 were presented.</p>
                <p>Analyses used a database snapshot taken on June 15, 2021. Where reported, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were deemed significant. All analyses were conducted using Stata (version 16) and R (version 4.1.1).</p>

                <p>Between October 4, 2018 and August 27, 2020, 75 patients from 16 UK hospitals were recruited to Cohort E. 60/75 (80%) of patients had no mutation identified in ctDNA testing and 15/75 (20%) patients had ctDNA mutations (9 <italic toggle="yes">PIK3CA</italic>, 2 <italic toggle="yes">PTEN</italic>, 1 <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic>, 1 <italic toggle="yes">HER2</italic>, 1 <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic>, and 1 <italic toggle="yes">PTEN/PIK3CA</italic>) but there was no available cohort in plasmaMATCH at the time of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). The median age was 55.6 years [interquartile range (IQR), 45.7–64.1]; 42 (56%) patients had 1, and 13 (17%) had 2 prior line(s) of chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and 20 (27%) had no prior chemotherapy for advanced cancer having relapsed within 12 months of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRCA2</italic> germline mutations were present in 7 (9.3%) and 3 (4%) patients respectively.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We report Cohort E of the plasmaMATCH study, a single group phase II study in patients with TNBC. The response rate to olaparib and ceralasertib did not meet prespecified criteria for efficacy in the overall evaluable population. However, additional biomarker work identified a number of potential predictive biomarkers, which could be investigated in future clinical trials.</p>
              <p>Patients with germline and also somatic <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations are known to respond to PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, therefore the principal focus of the biomarker analysis was in patients with wild-type <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic>. Patients had RAD51 foci assessed on the most recent biopsy, and although numbers are small, those patients without <italic toggle="yes">BRCA1/2</italic> mutations but with functional HRD by RAD51 foci responded to therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; One of these patients had a germline <italic toggle="yes">PALB2</italic> mutation). Tumors with high cyclin E1 protein may have evidence of replication stress, that could be exploited by olaparib plus ceralasertib therapy, and tumors with high cyclin E1 protein were more likely to benefit from therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Although numerically higher response rates were seen in cancers with low ATM protein, the benefit seen in these patients were possibly lower than that observed with other ATR inhibitors or in preclinical models given in a more continuous schedule (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Finally, in an exploratory analysis that was not pre-stated in the trial protocol, patients with other mutations in other HRR genes were potentially likely to benefit, with a CR in a patient with a germline <italic toggle="yes">PALB2</italic> mutation, further re-enforcing the role of PARP inhibition in patients with germline <italic toggle="yes">PALB2</italic> mutations (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p>
              <p>Our study has a number of limitations. As a non-comparative phase II study we are unable to assess whether activity observed is a result of the combination therapy, or one of the individual drugs in the combination. In the recently presented VIOLETTE study (NCT03330847) patients with metastatic TNBC were randomized to receive olaparib, olaparib, and ceralasertib or olaparib and adavosertib (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Patients were stratified on the basis of an HRR assay. In patients with no mutations (including no <italic toggle="yes">BRCA</italic> mutations) in the 15 HRR genes tested, the ORR to olaparib was 3.9% (2/51) and to olaparib and ceralasertib 15.4% (8/52), further indicating that responses to the combination are observed outside of the populations where existing biomarkers would predict activity. In the absence of a ceralasertib alone arm, the activity of ATR monotherapy is unknown.</p>
              <p>Entry into Cohort E of plasmaMATCH was for patients who did not have actionable mutations in their ctDNA, or if no cohort was available, and this may have led to bias in patient recruitment. However, the cohort commenced late in the trial, the majority of patients were enrolled once other cohorts had stopped recruitment, and the patient population enrolled in Cohort E was likely overall reflective of unselected metastatic TNBC. Prior research has suggested that ATR inhibitors may have substantial efficacy in ATM-deficient cancers, yet in Cohort E we do not see strong evidence for activity in cancers with absent/low ATM expression. This may be reflective of selection on the basis of protein ATM expression, instead of selecting on the basis of ATM inactivating mutations, and/or may reflect the schedule of ATR inhibitor employed, with potentially more continuous schedules being more optimal for ATM-deficient cancers.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, we report here the result of a large phase II study in advanced TNBC with olaparib plus ceralasertib therapy. The study did not observe sufficient evidence of efficacy by the predefined criteria, and this is broadly in line with the data observed in the randomized phase II VIOLETTE study (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Nevertheless, we identify a number of biomarkers of potential benefit, in particular functional HRD by RAD51 foci, high cyclin E1 expression and pathogenic mutations in HRR genes. Further research is warranted to investigate the potential benefit of olaparib, or olaparib plus ceralasertib therapy, in these biomarker defined subset of patients with advanced TNBC.</p>
