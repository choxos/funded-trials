                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Some clinicians have observed that low-carbohydrate, low-energy diets can improve blood glucose control, with reports of remission from type 2 diabetes in some patients. In clinical trials, support for low-carbohydrate, low-energy diets has been provided by specialist staff and these programmes are unsuitable for widespread deployment in routine primary care. The aim of this trial is to test whether a newly developed behavioural support programme can effectively deliver a low-energy, low-carbohydrate diet in a primary care setting.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) with embedded qualitative study. Thirty adult patients with type 2 diabetes and body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in 2–4 general practices will be randomised 2:1 intervention or control and followed up over 12 weeks. The intervention diet comprises 8 weeks of a low-carbohydrate food-based diet providing around 800 kcal/day, followed by 4 weeks of weight maintenance. This programme will be delivered by practice nurses, who will also support patients through goal-setting, motivation and self-monitoring across four appointments, and provide a self-help booklet with recipes, shopping lists and other behavioural support. Primary outcome measures of feasibility will be met if CIs do not cross the following proportions: that 60% of intervention group participants attempt the dietary intervention, healthcare professionals conduct the intervention delivery session with at least 60% of essential elements present and 60% of participants attend the final follow-up session. Secondary outcome measures will assess process and qualitative measures, as well as exploratory outcomes including change in haemoglobin A1c and change in weight.</p>

                  <p>This study has been granted ethical approval by the National Research Ethics Service, South Central Oxford B Research Ethics Committee (ref: 18/SC/0071). The study results will inform whether to progress to a full-scale RCT to test the efficacy of offering this programme for patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care.</p>

              <p>Obesity is one of the strongest risk factors for type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with an estimated 9% increased risk for every 1 kg of weight gained,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> while even modest weight loss of 5% can improve glycaemic control.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> For people with established type 2 diabetes, dietary management remains a cornerstone of high-quality care,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> aiming to lower blood glucose levels and achieve weight loss in those who are overweight.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is strong evidence for the benefit of behavioural interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes; a large, high-quality randomised controlled trial (RCT) of over 5000 adults with type 2 diabetes showed that a 12-month intensive behavioural intervention (individual and group meetings to support decreased energy intake and increased physical activity) led to a clinically significant weight loss (mean 8.5% of initial weight, compared with 0.6% in the control group), and a significant reduction in mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; −0.6% (0.55mmol/mol), compared with −0.1% (0.1mmol/mol) (control group)) at 1 year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The benefits of the intervention were still evident at 4-year follow-up (weight loss of 4.7% and HbA1c reduction of 0.2% (0.2mmol/mol)).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Longitudinal data from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study demonstrates that every 1% (11mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c is associated with a 21% reduction in risk of diabetes-related mortality, and 37% reduction in risk of microvascular complications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Weight loss is associated with reduction in HbA1c. Observational analysis of data from RCTs shows that the ORs for a 5%–10% and ≥10% weight loss for a clinically significant 0.5% (0.5mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c were 3.5 (95% CI 2.8 to 4.4) and 5.4 (4.2 to 7.1), respectively.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The recent Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) trial demonstrated that with a low-energy, total diet replacement programme (850 kcal/day formula diet for 3–5 months), delivered within a primary care setting and designed to achieve 15 kg weight loss, 46% of participants in the intervention group (compared with 4% in the control group, OR 19.7 (7.8 to 49.8)) achieved diabetes remission at 12 months<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. However, total diet replacement with a formula product is not acceptable to some patients, some of whom may prefer a food-based diet. In addition, food-based dietary strategies may help establish a sustainable diet for the longer term.</p>
              <p>There is limited high-quality evidence for the optimal macronutrient intake for patients with diabetes wishing to lose weight, or improve their glycaemic control.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 10–12</xref> Reductions in glycaemic load, through restriction of total carbohydrate and/or changes in the type of carbohydrate to lower the glycaemic index, may have a beneficial effect, due to the direct effect of carbohydrate consumption on postprandial blood glucose levels,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> leading to a growing interest in carbohydrate-restricted diets for patients with diabetes. This is reflected in the wealth of recent reviews comparing the effects of low-carbohydrate versus high-carbohydrate diets in patients with diabetes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 14–21</xref> Intervention studies have reported that low-carbohydrate diets can reduce HbA1c by mean 0.5% (0.5 mmol/mol), and body weight by mean 4.8 kg, in people with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 22</xref> Recent data from systematic reviews demonstrate that these low-carbohydrate diets may be safe and effective in the short term, yielding greater reductions in HbA1c at 3 (−0.5%, 95% CI −0.7% to −0.2%) and 6 months (−0.4%, 95% CI −0.6% to −0.1%) than higher-carbohydrate diets.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There is no evidence of significant benefit of these diets on HbA1c or weight change at 12 or 24 months,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> although the evidence is not precise enough to exclude worthwhile effects on these variables. This apparent diminution in the benefits may be due in part to a decline in dietary adherence over time; additionally, heterogeneity in reporting of medication changes and adjustment for reduction of these in meta-analyses has been suggested to contribute to an underestimation of effect on glycaemic control.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The available evidence has key limitations, including in the variation in definition of what constitutes a ‘low-carbohydrate’ diet, and there remains a lack of pragmatic trials to demonstrate the feasibility of supporting such diets in routine practice. In most trials to date, the programme has been delivered by specialist staff, offering in-depth advice and support which is unrealistic if this is to be delivered at scale.</p>
              <p>In spite of the uncertainties in the evidence base, there is considerable interest from patients and the media in using low-carbohydrate diets in the management of type 2 diabetes<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> and some practitioners have begun to recommend patients with type 2 diabetes to follow a low-carbohydrate diet, with or without specific energy restriction.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In 2017, the James Lind Alliance identified the role of carbohydrates, dietary change and how best to support people to achieve these changes, as 3 of the top 10 research priorities in type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p>
              <p>To address this evidence gap, we will conduct an RCT to investigate the feasibility of delivering a low-carbohydrate, low-energy, food-based dietary intervention in primary care, to patients with established type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
              <p>The hypothesis is that compared with usual care, an intervention involving targeted health professional advice, goal setting and structured materials, will help patients understand and adhere to a low-carbohydrate, low-energy diet that will lead to significant reductions in weight and associated improvements in glycaemic control (or reduction in diabetic medication required to maintain glycaemic control), providing positive reinforcement of the dietary modification. Few people can maintain a low-energy diet indefinitely (the mean duration of low calorie liquid diet product in the DiRECT study was 16 weeks<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but a low-carbohydrate component offers the potential for sustained glycaemic control. Together with the possibility of returning to a low-energy regimen in the case of weight regain, this dietary strategy could provide the foundation for a sustainable approach to the management of this chronic condition.</p>
              <p>The specific aims of the Dietary Approaches to the Management Of type 2 Diabetes (DIAMOND) study are to investigate the feasibility of delivering this behavioural and dietary intervention to a population of patients with diabetes in primary care, and determine whether progression to a full-scale RCT is indicated; to assess achievements against a number of process measures to inform future trial design; and to investigate the potential physical, biochemical and economic impact of this behavioural and dietary intervention.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants will be recruited from between two and four GP practices for this feasibility study, identified through the regional clinical research network and local expressions of interest. The practices will be asked to search their computerised records to identify people who meet the inclusion criteria. Prior to invitation letters being sent, a general practitioner will screen the list of potential participants to ensure that all those identified are medically appropriate to invite to participate in the trial. The practice will then send potential participants an invitation letter asking them to contact the research team if they are interested, and a participant information sheet with further details about the study.</p>
                <p>Participants may also be identified opportunistically during routine consultations or resulting from tests performed as part of the NHS Health Checks programme or diabetes annual review appointments. GPs will provide individuals with the invitation letter and information sheet and invite the individual to ring the study team if they are interested in participating.</p>
                <p>Interested individuals will respond to the invitation letter and contact the research team by text, email or telephone. During initial telephone contact, a researcher will discuss the study with the individual and assess self-reported eligibility to participate according to the full inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed below. They will also establish verbal informed consent for the study team to access the patient’s Oxfordshire diabetic eye screening record, to ensure they meet the retinopathy screening inclusion criteria (as this may not always be coded on the GP’s electronic notes). Eligible individuals who wish to participate will be booked in for a face-to-face baseline appointment.</p>

                  <title>The DIAMOND programme</title>
                  <p>The active intervention is a behaviourally informed, low-carbohydrate, low-energy diet delivered by healthcare professionals at a GP practice. It draws on the motivational value of the relationship between the healthcare professional and the patient, but provides almost all the technical knowledge-transfer through the use of structured materials such as meal plans, thus addressing the uncertainties and lack of confidence expressed by health professionals about giving dietary advice.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The intervention aims to improve patients’ adherence to the programme by providing a structured simple behavioural support programme, including goal-setting, planning, feedback and problem-solving. It is designed to induce rapid changes in dietary composition and weight loss, followed by a sustainable maintenance programme. The intervention is envisaged to take 10–15 min of support from the GP and 80 min from the nurse to deliver over four sessions of support (baseline, week 2, week 4 and week 8).</p>
                  <p>This intervention was designed following the principles of the person-based approach.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It involved examining recent systematic reviews, reviewing qualitative studies and process assessments of these types of interventions and developing the behavioural and dietary intervention programme with a multi-disciplinary team comprising a diabetes-specialist dietitian and clinician, primary care physicians and patient involvement. Two groups of patients with type 2 diabetes, including those who had recently tried variations of a low-carbohydrate, low-energy diet, also met to discuss the intervention and to inform and advise on the dietary and behavioural support components.</p>
                  <p>The dietary component of this intervention consists of a low-carbohydrate and energy restricted diet (800–1000 kcal/day) for 8 weeks, transitioning to a 4-week maintenance period. The core principles include: advice to exclude sugary and starchy foods high in carbohydrates (eg, biscuits, confectionery, bread, pasta, potatoes) entirely from their diet (with the exception of dairy and limited fruit intake), strict portion control and avoiding energy-dense foods. Standardised ‘healthy eating’ advice regarding fresh vegetables, and lean meat and fish, is also included. After the initial 8-week intensive weight loss phase, participants will be advised to gradually increase their energy intake, reintroducing one ‘normal-sized’ meal at a time, until they remain weight stable, but with guidance on maintaining a sustainable lower-carbohydrate diet in the longer term.</p>
                  <p>The design of this intervention has been additionally informed by behavioural analysis, identifying domains of the Behaviour Change Wheel<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and Theoretical Domains Framework<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> to promote successful behaviour change. Using these frameworks, the key influencing factors which have been targeted are: psychological capability (including knowledge, skills, decision processes and behavioural regulation), social and physical opportunity (social influences and environmental context), reflective motivation (beliefs about capabilities and consequences, optimism, intentions, goals and reinforcement).</p>
                  <p>To address these components, the intervention will include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A brief behavioural intervention consisting of both dietary and motivational advice, including the rationale behind the intervention, to be delivered by a healthcare professional in primary care.

This feasibility study is not powered to detect statistical differences in efficacy outcomes but will examine the following parameters in order to test trial procedures, process, resources and management, to aid sample size estimates for a future trial, to determine the most appropriate primary outcome measures for a future trial and to inform further development of the intervention strategy.</p>

The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). Withdrawn participants will not be replaced in this feasibility study. To reflect the burden of participation and promote participant retention and complete follow-up, participants will be offered a £20 gift card on attending the 12-week follow-up appointment.</p>

Analysis for progression criteria will use data from all participants recruited to the trial. Descriptive statistical methods along with inferential statistics presenting CIs will be used to analyse and report progression criteria.</p>

Descriptive comparative summary statics (eg, difference in means or proportions, together with 95% CIs, comparison with baseline and overall change compared with control group) will be used.</p>
                <p>Acceptability and experience of the intervention by participants and healthcare professionals will be collected as qualitative data from interviews and focus groups conducted after intervention completion.

                <p>This study evolved through patient demand in the local area, to know more about dietary options and in particular low-carbohydrate diets for people with type 2 diabetes. We convened two panels of patients with type 2 diabetes, one consisting of members who had recently tried variations of a low-carbohydrate, low-energy diet, to inform and advise on the dietary and behavioural support components of the intervention, the patient materials and the perceived benefits or burdens of the study for patients. One patient member has subsequently joined the trial management group and will be involved in trial steering decisions during the monitoring and running of the trial, and regarding progressing to a full-scale trial.</p>

                <title>Qualitative substudy</title>
                <p>The purpose of the nested qualitative sub-study is to explore patients’ and healthcare professionals’ experience of receiving, enacting and delivering this intervention, and of participating in the study. We will seek the views of up to 10 patient participants from the intervention group, from those who consent to be contacted for the nested qualitative study, and 6–8 healthcare professionals. The patient participants chosen will aim to reflect a range of success with weight loss and glycaemic control, with thought given to not mixing those who have found the programme easy or successful, with those who have not achieved their goals. Additionally, we will aim to capture a breadth of participant characteristics (age, gender, social class, ethnicity or, for the healthcare professional interviews, the participant’s profession). All healthcare professionals who have been involved in the study will be invited to take part. Should more participants volunteer than are required, purposive sampling will be used to ensure both GPs and nurses are represented in the cohort, and to include those who have conducted a greater number of sessions.</p>
                <p>Focus groups will be conducted after all participants have completed their 3-month study follow-up period. Written informed consent will be taken before the focus group commences. All focus groups will be audio recorded, and these audio-recordings will be transcribed. Patients will be reimbursed for their time and practices will be reimbursed for the healthcare professionals taking time out from their clinical duties to participate.</p>
                <p>Focus groups will follow broad topic areas based on the study objectives, but will encourage participants to discuss their perceptions and experiences freely and in depth. Topics will include: the acceptability of the intervention; views on which components of their treatment group they felt were effective and which were not effective; thoughts about impact on experience of diabetes and its management; thoughts about weight management going forwards. Data will be analysed using thematic analysis.</p>
