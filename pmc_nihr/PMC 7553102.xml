                <p>Background<bold>.</bold> In the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App (mAFA)-II trial, the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology, incorporating AF screening and integrated management strategy, was associated with improved short-term clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to report adherence/persistence and long term (≥1 year) clinical outcomes of the mAFA-II trial, with mHealth-supported optimised stroke prevention, symptom control and comorbidity management.</p>
                <p>Methods. We studied an adult population screened for AF, where identified patients could enter a structured program of holistic and integrated care based on the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway using mHealth with a mAFA intervention. In this cluster randomised trial, comparing mHeath intervention to usual care, the primary composite outcome was ‘stroke/thromboembolism, all-cause death and rehospitalization’.</p>
                <p>Results<bold>.</bold> The 1261 subjects (mean age 67.0 years, 38.0% female) who were followed up over one year (mean follow-up 687 (standard deviation, SD 191) days) in the intervention arm, had a lower risk of the composite outcome of ‘ischaemic stroke/systemic thromboembolism, death, and rehospitalization’ (hazard ratio, HR 0.18, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.13–0.25, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), compared to usual care (1212 subjects, mean age 70.1 years, 42.1% female). Of 842 patients using their smart devices for ‘Better symptom management’, 70.8% had good management adherence (monitoring time/follow-up since initial monitoring ≥ 70%), with the persistence of use of 91.7%.</p>
                <p>Conclusion. Amongst AF patients with long term use (≥1 year) of mHealth technology for optimising stroke prevention, symptom control and comorbidity management, adherence/persistence was good and associated with a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="para0004">The priorities of atrial fibrillation management include stroke prevention, decisions on rate or rhythm control and proactive management of comorbidities, as well as lifestyle changes. Given that atrial fibrillation patients can present to a diverse range of health care professionals, including general practitioners, non-cardiologists and cardiologists, there has been proposals to streamline the patient care pathway into a simple holistic and integrated approach that can be followed by all stakeholders and understood by patients.</p>
              <p id="para0005">One such approach to holistic atrial fibrillation care is the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway, as follows: ‘A’ Avoid stroke. Anticoagulation; ‘B’ Better symptom management with patient-centred symptom directed rate or rhythm control; ‘C’ Cardiovascular risk and Comorbidity management, including lifestyle changes[<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Atrial fibrillation Better Care pathway has been shown in post-hoc analyses of clinical trial cohorts and observational studies to be associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduces healthcare costs<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0006">Even before a patient enters the care pathway, we also need improvements in screening, and next, to show how detected atrial fibrillation patients can be entered into structured management programme. We previously reported that photoplethysmography based general-population atrial fibrillation screening approach was feasible, whereby 0.23% with “suspected” atrial fibrillation from a screened population of 246,541 received a notification of suspected atrial fibrillation, of which 87% were confirmed as atrial fibrillation, and 80% of high-risk patients were subsequently anticoagulated<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Short term outcomes (mean followup 262 days) of such identified atrial fibrillation patients randomized into the mAFA-II (mobile Atrial Fibrillation App) cluster randomized trial using mobile health (mHealth) based integrated care management found a significant reduction in the composite outcome of ‘ischaemic stroke/systemic thromboembolism, death, and rehospitalization’, compared to usual care<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the long-term adherence/persistence of mobile health technology use and the impact on clinical outcomes, remains uncertain although the approach has been increasingly proposed for chronic disease management. The mAFA programme is still ongoing (patients can still download and start using the mAF App), but we need to answer the question on ‘long term users’ (ie. using mHealth for &gt;1 year) which is the current specific focus of the present paper.</p>
              <p id="para0007">In the present report from the mAFA-II trial, the objective was to report adherence/ persistence and long term (≥1 year) clinical outcomes of the mAFA-II trial, with optimised stroke prevention, symptom control and comorbidity management. Hence, the subgroup of atrial fibrillation patients with mobile health technology use and follow up of over one year were included into this ancillary analysis.</p>

In brief, the programme included the pre-mAFA phase of screening for atrial fibrillation in the general population<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Then those with identified atrial fibrillation were considered for entry into the mAFA II cluster randomized trial<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, to validate an integrated care approach based on the Atrial fibrillation Better Care pathway.</p>
              <p id="para0009">The study was approved by the Central Medical Ethics Committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Approval number: S2017-105-02) and registered on the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) [chictr.org.cn; registration number ChiCTR-OOC-17014138 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=24191" id="interref0001">http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=24191</ext-link>)].

At least 14-days monitoring was proposed for the subjects; but they could freely monitor their pulse rhythm beyond 14 days<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. All ‘identified atrial fibrillation’ in atrial fibrillation screening phase were followed up by mAFA programme telecare team, but in this long-term cohort, we focused on the subgroup of subjects with ‘identified’ atrial fibrillation followed up for over one year.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para0040">Amongst atrial fibrillation patients with long term use (≥1 year) of mobile health technology for optimising stroke prevention, symptom control and comorbidity management, their adherence/persistence was good and associated with a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes, when compared to those managed with usual care. Second, patients using the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App had a reduced risk for the primary composite outcome of ‘ischaemic stroke/systemic thromboembolism, death, and rehospitalization’, compared to usual care. Third, &gt;70% of subjects using mobile health technology had good management adherence, with the persistence of use of 91.7%.</p>
              <p id="para0041">As far as we are aware, the mAFA programme is the first mobile health technology based programme for atrial fibrillation screening, followed by a structured patient care pathway based on the principal components of atrial fibrillation management. The present analysis focused on the subgroup of participants enroled for ≥1 year was pre-planned to assess adherence/persistence and long-term outcomes, given that the overall mAFA programme is continually enroling subjects, using the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App.</p>
              <p id="para0042">Atrial fibrillation confers a significant health, economic, and social burden, with the increased risk of stroke, death, dementia, heart failure and hospitalization<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Hence, its early diagnosis with appropriate management would help prevent the main atrial fibrillation-related complications. However, even before the patient with atrial fibrillation enters any management pathway, there is the need to improve the detection of this arrhythmia.</p>
              <p id="para0043">Smart technology is increasingly deployed to help with screening for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, the continuous monitoring of pulse rhythm on home with wearable devices is practical, which has been proven to improve the early identification of atrial fibrillation[<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Following its detection, the next important step is to manage these identified atrial fibrillation patients with a holistic integrated approach, to achieve the main goals of atrial fibrillation management. While much attention has focused on stroke risks of atrial fibrillation, we recognize the high mortality and other adverse outcomes associated with this common arrhythmia. Indeed, of the mortality outcomes associated with atrial fibrillation, only one in 10 is stroke related and &gt; 7 in 10 are cardiovascular[<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="para0044">Efforts are therefore being directed to streamline the management of atrial fibrillation in an integrated manner, which needs a simple approach that can be followed by all healthcare practitioners (general practioners, non-cardiologists, cardiologists), the patient, and their carers. This has led to the proposal of the ABC (Atrial fibrillation Better Care) pathway, whereby ABC pathway compliance has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and lower healthcare costs<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Such a uniform message (‘Simple as ABC….’) applicable to all stakeholders is important given that conflicting information received from different healthcare providers can negatively affect adherence with management<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0045">The benefits of integrated care on atrial fibrillation outcomes are increasingly evident. In the meta analysis by Gallagher et al. demosntated that the use of an integrated care approach in atrial fibrillation reduced the risk for cardiovasular hospitalisations by 42%<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Indeed, an integrated care apporach in the present mAFA II trial long term extension cohort reduced the risk for rehospitalisation by 31%. Other nurse-driven (or nurse-led) integrated care approachs have also been demonstrated to be clinically beneficial for atrial fibrillation patients<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="para0046">However, there are growing challenges on how best to apply mobile health technology into atrial fibrillation management, with marked heterogeneity of published findings. In the SUPPORT-AF study, the supportive tools based on electronic medical records, supplemented by email notifications, related to anticoagulant prescribing was feasible, but did not increase anticoagulant use in patients with atrial fibrillation. <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> Patient refusal or non-adherence was suggested as the main reason for a patient being non-anticoagulated. Also, it may be inadequate to simply inform physicians with the rate of anticoagulant use by patients under their care, but there is the need to support the physicians to ascertain the underlying barriers to anticoagulant use and assess stroke (and bleeding) risks, while improving patient's knowledge as part of a streamlined integrated care management pathway approach.</p>
              <p id="para0047">In the mAFA-II trial, we previously reported the short term outcomes (mean follow-up of 262 days) associated with mobile health management based on the Atrial fibrillation Better Care pathway, with a significant reduction in the composite outcomes, that was largely driven by hospitalisations<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In the present analysis of those (long term) mAFA participants with ≥ 1 year use/followup, there were maintained reductions in the composite outcome and hospitalization using mAFA trial intervention. Importantly, for the individual components of the ABC pathway, there were significant reductions in ischaemic stroke, extracranial bleeding, recurrent atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation-related symptoms, as well as heart failure during long term followup. This was associated with good adherence and persistence with the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App and the overall mAFA programme.</p>
              <p id="para0048">We did not observe a significant difference in all-cause death alone, perhaps associated with significant reduction in ischaemic stroke over one year in patients on mAFA intervention compared to usual care (Supplementary Fig. 5). Another possibility is that the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak might have led to suboptimal atrial fibrillation ‘usual-care’ management (e.g. less anticoagulant monitoring) leading with additional cardiovascular events<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Suboptimal ‘usual-care’ management includes a decline in oral anticoagulant use without mobile Atrial Fibrillation App intervention, as previously reported<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which could contribute to worse outcomes (including more ischaemic strokes) in those allocated to the ‘usual care’ arm of the trial.</p>
              <p id="para0049">Uptake and use of the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App increased even more during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic period in China. Indeed, digital wearables, telehealth/E-visit, remote management, etc. have been proposed for disease management by academic societies since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A similar program, e.g. TeleCheck-AF programme, is carrying out atrial fibrillation management through teleconsultations, but without any outcome data<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The present study provides some descriptive evidence for mobile health technology for atrial fibrillation management during the current challenging coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p id="para0050">Important limitations should be recognized. This study was performed in a healthcare system with widespread smartphone use, and the results may not be generalizable to other healthcare settings. While we conducted a cluster randomized trial and have adjusted for cluster effect and baseline risk factors, residual confounding may still be present. Moreover, there was possibly selection bias with more male, younger subjects during atrial fibrillation screening phase, although the baseline characteristics were balanced in mAFA-II trial phase of the programme.</p>
              <p id="para0051">The present report which focuses on the subgroup of patients using the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App for over one year, so the patients with less than a year of follow-up were excluded from this analysis. Nonetheless, any ‘hard’ clinical outcomes in all patients from this subgroup (ie. with &gt;1 year use), even those occurring at &lt; 1 year were also recorded, but less censored data could bias the outcome analysis. Of note, we have also compared the baseline characteristics of patients with mobile Atrial Fibrillation App use &lt; 1 year and ≥1 year (Supplementary Table 5). The patients enroled into mAFA programme for over one year were more likely to have more comorbidities, compared with patients using the mobile Atrial Fibrillation App for &lt; 1 year. Finally, we found generally good adherence and persistence with the mAFA programme, but this may reflect our relatively young mean age of the study cohort. Further analyses from the mAFA II trial would focus on the elderly and those with clinical complexity, such as multimorbidity.</p>
