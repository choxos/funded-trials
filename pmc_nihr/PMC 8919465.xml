                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. In critically ill adults, there are data that suggest the use of Selective Decontamination of the Digestive tract (SDD), alongside standard infection control measures reduce mortality and the incidence of HCAIs. SDD-enhanced infection control has not been compared directly with standard infection prevention strategies in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) population. The aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in critically ill children comparing SDD with standard infection control.</p>

                  <p>Paediatric Intensive Care and Infection Control is a parallel group pilot cRCT, with integrated mixed-methods study, comparing incorporation of SDD into infection control procedures to standard care. After a 1-week pretrial ecology surveillance period, recruitment to the cRCT will run for a period of 18 weeks, comprising: (1) baseline control period (2) pre, mid and post-trial ecology surveillance periods and (3) intervention period. Six PICUs (in England, UK) will begin with usual care in period 1, then will be randomised 1:1 by the trial statistician using computer-based randomisation, to either continue to deliver usual care or commence delivery of the intervention (SDD) in period 2. Outcomes measures include parent and healthcare professionals’ views on trial feasibility, adherence to the SDD intervention, estimation of recruitment rate and understanding of potential patient-centred primary and secondary outcome measures for the definitive trial. The planned recruitment for the cRCT is 324 participants.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In critically ill children, healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with a reported prevalence of 7%–14%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–5</xref> HCAIs can develop either as a direct result of healthcare interventions such as medical or surgical treatment, or from being in contact with a healthcare setting. In the critical care setting, the high use of invasive devices such as endotracheal tubes, vascular and urinary catheters increase the risk of secondary infection by opportunistic organisms. In particular, respiratory HCAIs (ventilator associated pneumonia, VAP) may occur with spread of commensal and other organisms from oro-pharyngeal and upper gastrointestinal compartments into the lungs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref></p>
              <p>Evidence from adult intensive care studies suggests that using Selective Decontamination of the Digestive tract (SDD) alongside standard infection control measures reduces mortality and VAP.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> It has been shown that the use of SDD influences the microbiological ecology of the unit, thereby reducing incidence of HCAIs in both exposed and non-exposed patients. Despite this, SDD has not been routinely adopted due to concerns that it may promote antimicrobial resistance.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 8</xref> Recent ecological studies conducted in adult intensive care have found that SDD was associated with a reduction in antibiotic utilisation<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9–13</xref>; two large cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) have been recently undertaken to further evaluate the clinical effects of SDD in adult intensive care. One reported no change in the incidence of blood stream infections, but the incidence of ventilator acquired pneumonia and overall antimicrobial use have not yet been reported.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Another large-scale multicentre study using the same formulation as the Paediatric Intensive Care and Infection Control (PICnIC) study has recently completed enrolment of critically ill adults in Australia, Canada and the UK.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p>
              <p>SDD has yet to be compared directly with modern infection control protocols within the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) population. The only trial data suggest a reduction in incidence of VAP but not mortality, however the study was underpowered and the observed mortality was very low.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, a clinical trial comparing SDD with standard infection control methods is required. Given the paucity of data describing the use of SDD in PICU and to establish the appropriate safety and ecological monitoring protocols, it is first imperative to establish whether a large, multicentre trial is feasible.</p>
              <p>The PICnIC pilot study is a feasibility study designed to determine whether it is possible to conduct a cRCT of SDD in critically ill children who are likely to be ventilated for &gt;48 hours, and to explore and test the acceptability of key components of the study to healthcare professionals and families of patients.</p>

                <p>The ability to randomise PICUs to either control or intervention will be assessed by the successful random assignment of three PICUs to the intervention without delay to subsequent phases of the trial.</p>
                <p>The willingness and ability of healthcare professionals to screen and recruit eligible children will be assessed by the proportion of eligible children recorded on study screening logs successfully recruited to the pilot cRCT and the reported reasons for non-recruitment.</p>
                <p>The potential recruitment rate for a future definitive cRCT trial of SDD-enhanced infection control in eligible children will be estimated by combining the proportion of eligible children recruited to the pilot cRCT with the size of the potentially eligible population (estimated from nesting the screening log data from participating PICUs within the national UK PICU data from PICANet).</p>
                <p>Adherence to the SDD protocol will be assessed by the proportion of eligible children allocated to the intervention receiving (1) both elements and (2) each individual element of the SDD intervention, the number of days on which these elements were received relative to days eligible for the SDD intervention and the reported reasons for nonadherence.</p>
                <p>Procedures for assessing and collecting selected clinical and ecological outcomes and for AE reporting will be assessed by the proportion of children with complete data for these outcomes including, for ecological outcomes, the proportion consenting to additional study specific sample collection.</p>

                  <p>The PICnIC pilot study is set up to test the feasibility of the protocol to recruit eligible patients. Therefore, there is no primary outcome to be compared between the two groups and, hence, a usual power calculation to determine sample size is not appropriate. Instead, the sample size has been determined to be adequate to estimate critical parameters to be tested to a necessary degree of precision. Based on available data from PICANet, it is anticipated participating sites will see approximately 4.5 eligible children per week, therefore, the anticipated recruitment rate is three children per PICU per week providing a total of approximately 324 children in 18 weeks, of which 90 would receive the intervention. The sample size of children receiving usual care would be sufficient to estimate a binary outcome present in 20% of the population with a precision of ±5%.</p>
