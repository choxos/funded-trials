                  <title>Aim</title>
                  <p>The best method of initial airway management during resuscitation for out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is unknown. The airway management techniques used currently by UK paramedics during resuscitation for OHCA are not well documented. This study describes the airway management techniques used in the usual practice arm of the REVIVE-Airways feasibility study, and documents the pathway of interventions to secure and sustain ventilation during OHCA.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Method</title>
                  <p>Data were collected from OHCAs attended by paramedics participating in the REVIVE-Airways trial between March 2012 and February 2013. Patients were included if they were enrolled in the usual practice arm of the study, fulfilled the main study eligibility criteria and did not receive either of the intervention supraglottic airway devices during the resuscitation attempt.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Data from 196 attempted resuscitations were included in the analysis. The initial approach to airway management was bag-mask for 108 (55%), a supraglottic airway device (SAD) for 39 (20%) and tracheal intubation for 49 (25%). Paramedics made further airway interventions in 64% of resuscitations. When intubation was the initial approach, there was no further intervention in 76% of cases; this compares to 16% and 44% with bag-mask and SAD respectively. The most common reason cited by paramedics for changing from bag-mask was to carry out advanced life support, followed by regurgitation and inadequate ventilation. Inadequate ventilation was the commonest reason cited for removing a SAD.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Paramedics use a range of techniques to manage the airway during OHCA, and as the resuscitation evolves. It is therefore desirable to ensure that a range of techniques and equipment, supported by effective training, are available to paramedics who attend OHCA.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0005">In the United Kingdom (UK) there are 118 out of hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) per 100,000 population per annum.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The ambulance service attends 60,000 OHCA patients each year,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> with half of these cases receiving a resuscitation attempt. Unfortunately survival rates remain low, with approximately 7% of OHCA patients in the UK surviving to hospital discharge.<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="par0010">There is an urgent need to investigate interventions which improve outcomes from OHCA. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival rates,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and effective ventilation is an essential component of CPR unless the duration of cardiac arrest is very short.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Effective ventilation is associated with both return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological recovery following cardiac arrest.<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Pre-hospital clinicians should secure the airway and provide effective ventilation without prolonged interruptions in chest compressions.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The pre-hospital environment is challenging: access to the patient may be problematic and the risk of regurgitation and aspiration are high.<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A functioning airway device may also dislodge during patient extrication and transport.</p>
              <p id="par0015">The best method for managing the airway during OHCA is unknown, although several recent observational studies have provided data. The practice of tracheal intubation by paramedics has been questioned because of the risk of unrecognised oesophageal intubation and prolonged interruptions in chest compressions.<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> UK ambulance services have been encouraged to consider the use of newer supraglottic airway devices.<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Supraglottic airway devices are now used routinely in many UK ambulance services,<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with some services also phasing out intubation training for new paramedics. In 2011/12 London Ambulance Service reported 1,439 successful OHCA intubations and 1,570 successful SAD placements.<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="par0020">A secondary analysis of data from North America showed that tracheal intubation was associated with better outcomes than the use of SADs.<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In contrast, data from a Japanese registry of OHCA suggests that bag-mask ventilation is associated with improved outcomes when compared with both SADs and tracheal intubation.<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This has led to calls for a prospective, randomised clinical trial to determine which airway is best for OHCA.<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Preliminary work for such a trial has now been undertaken. REVIVE-Airways (ISRCTN 18528625) is a recently completed feasibility study comparing usual airway care during OHCA with two commonly used SADs: the i-gel and the Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme (LMAS).<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Both the i-gel and the LMAS have been studied successfully in OHCA.<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p>
              <p id="par0025">Paramedics now use SADs routinely, and usual practice comprises a range of techniques and procedures; the best airway option may be different for different pre-hospital clinicians and different patients.<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Moreover, there is a distinction between initial airway management and other airway interventions that may be adopted at different stages of resuscitation. That patients may have more than one airway device during resuscitation has been highlighted previously,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> but the precise sequence of airway interventions has never been reported. This investigation describes data extracted from patients treated in the ‘usual practice’ arm of the REVIVE-Airways feasibility study. This data provides a unique opportunity to examine the usual airway management provided by paramedics during CPR for OHCA and the pathway of interventions made to sustain and secure ventilation in the pre-hospital environment.</p>

                <title>Setting</title>
                <p id="par0030">Data were collected from out of hospital cardiac arrests attended by South Western Ambulance Service North Division paramedics participating in the REVIVE-Airways feasibility study between March 2012 and February 2013, serving a total population of approximately 2.2 million people. Participating paramedics were randomised to one of three arms: the i-gel; the Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme (LMAS); or Usual Practice. Randomation was stratified by years of experience and distance of the paramedic's ambulance base station from hospital.</p>

                <title>Eligibility</title>
                <p id="par0035">Data were included if patients were attended by a paramedic randomised to the ‘usual practice’ arm of the REVIVE-Airways feasibility study, and the patient fulfilled the main study eligibility criteria (adults 18 years or older in non-traumatic OHCA and attempted resuscitation was indicated according to national guidelines), and the patient did not receive either of the intervention supraglottic airway devices (the i-gel or LMAS) at any time during the resuscitation attempt.</p>

                <label>2.3</label>
                <title>Data collection</title>
                <p id="par0040">Paramedics who consented to take part in REVIVE-Airways were randomised to one of the three study arms (usual practice, the i-gel or the LMAS). The process of randomisation was completed by a statistician independent of the trial using a computer-generated random number sequence, and allocation was fully concealed from the participating paramedics and research team.Randomisation was stratified by length of service and location of the paramedic's base station (distance from hospital). Analysis of groups post-randomisation indicated that there were no differences between groups in either length of service or distance of the paramedics base station from hospital. After randomisation, paramedics attended a two-hour training session to provide them with updates on resuscitation guidelines and the opportunity to rehearse airway management skills and wereinstructed to use their allocated method of airway management for each OHCA that they attended during the 12 month data collection period. Paramedics in the usual practice arm had access to the standard airway management equipment that was issued by the ambulance service at the time the study took place; bag valve mask, tracheal tubes and the Ambu AuraOnce Disposable Laryngeal Mask Airway. These paramedics were asked to continue to manage the airway as they would usually do in accordance with national and local guidelines and to complete a case record form (CRF) to detail the airway management techniques used for each eligible patient that they attended during the study period. The CRF contained fields for: method of initial airway management; ventilation success; presence and degree of air leak; incidence of regurgitation; further interventions made; reasons for any changes in the airway management technique.</p>

Of 615 patients enrolled in REVIVE-Airways, 209 (34%) were randomised to usual practice and 198 (95%) received usual practice (did not receive either of the two intervention devices during the resuscitation attempt). These patients were attended by 49 of the 171 paramedics randomised to participate in REVIVE-Airways. The mean (standard deviation) number of patients attended per paramedic was 4.0 (2.6).

                <p id="par0075">Reasons for making a change to airway management are also shown in <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The most common reason cited by paramedics for changing from bag-mask was to ‘perform ALS’ (Advanced Life Support); i.e. move to a more advanced airway management technique (41%), with half opting for intubation and half for a SAD. Inadequate ventilation was the reason given in 16% of cases; adequate ventilation was measured and defined as visible chest movement with each ventilation and audible air entry in both axillae on stethoscope auscultation. Regurgitation was cited as the reason for change in 31% of cases and intubation was the alternative method in 82% of patients who had inadequate ventilation or regurgitation. For patients with a first SAD, ‘perform ALS’ was the reason for change in 14% of patients, all of whom were subsequently intubated. A SAD was abandoned on 41 occasions and inadequate ventilation or problems with positioning were cited as the reasons for removing it in 19 (46%) cases. Displacement of a SAD occurred on five occasions in a total of three patients.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0085">We have documented in detail the airway interventions undertaken by paramedics while resuscitating 196 OHCA patients, and have shown that they made more than one intervention in two-thirds of cases. Just over half of paramedics opted for a bag-mask as their initial airway management technique, with the others split between intubation and a SAD. However, where bag-mask was used as the initial technique an alternative was adopted subsequently in 84%, and in 30% of cases two or more changes were made. When intubation was attempted as the initial technique, a change in airway management was made in one quarter of cases, primarily due to failed intubation, and very few underwent more than one change. SADs fell somewhere between bag-mask and intubation in the subsequent use of alternative techniques. This implies that when a patient is successfully intubated as the initial approach to airway management it is usually definitive, whereas the bag-mask or SAD is used frequently as a ‘stepping stone’ to ventilate the patient until it becomes ineffective or the opportunity to intubate the patient arises. This approach has potential advantages: a simple airway technique used initially may enable paramedics to focus on chest compressions and defibrillation, moving to more advanced techniques when the situation has become more stable or following ROSC/R. However, changes in airway management may interrupt chest compressions, which is known to be detrimental to resuscitation success, so understanding the frequency and reason for such changes is valuable.</p>
              <p id="par0090">These data may also be interpreted by scrutinising all changes made, irrespective of when this occurred. When a bag-mask was abandoned, intubation was the alternative in the majority (58%) of cases, with a SAD used in about a third of changes. The propensity to intubate increased once a SAD had proved unsuccessful, with subsequent intubation in 80% of cases. Conversely, when intubation proved unsuccessful, re-intubation was the chosen intervention in only a quarter of cases, with a SAD used as the alternative in 43%. Overall, if an airway technique proved unsuccessful intubation or re-intubation was the preferred alternative and accounted for over half of all the changes made, whereas the SAD was used as an alternative in just over a quarter of changes. Therefore, if a change in airway management occurred, paramedics in this study were twice as likely to intubate as they were to insert a SAD. However, when intubation was attempted after airway management with an alternative technique, the intubation failure rate was unexpectedly high at 29/94 (31%): this may be because problems encountered with one airway technique increase the likelihood of subsequent difficulty in tracheal intubation.</p>
              <p id="par0095">Most studies of airway management during OHCA are retrospective analyses that allocate patients into distinct groups (typically tracheal intubation, SAD insertion or bag-mask ventilation), and compare outcomes based on a single documented airway intervention.<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Some investigators have dichotomised patients into basic (bag-mask) and advanced (tracheal intubation and SAD) airway management techniques.<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Based on our findings, these studies may have artificially compartmentalised patients into single airway intervention groups, and do not address adequately the possibility that multiple airway devices may have been used. Thus, by associating an outcome with any single airway management technique, these observational studies are too simplistic. The optimal method for managing the airway during cardiac arrest may incorporate multiple techniques, and change as the resuscitation attempt proceeds.</p>
              <p id="par0100">A retrospective study that analysed separately those patients who had been exposed to both tracheal intubation and SAD insertion, whether successful or not concluded that tracheal intubation was associated with better outcomes.<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="par0105">The incidence of regurgitation and aspiration is higher in OHCA than in-hospital cardiac arrest.<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Paramedics cited regurgitation as the reason for making a change to BVM or SAD airway management in a quarter of cases, and intubation was the alternative for almost all of these. It is not clear whether the airway management changes were made because the regurgitation made ventilation impossible with a bag-mask or SAD, or because the paramedic was concerned about the risk of pulmonary aspiration, and therefore elected to protect the airway by tracheal intubation. Understanding the meaning of ‘inadequate ventilation’ as a reason cited for changing a SAD to an alternative technique would be a useful area for future research, especially if this is having a detrimental effect on the resuscitation attempt.</p>
              <p id="par0110">Paramedic experience, skills and beliefs are all likely to impact on their airway management decisions; however, a strength of our study is that the paramedics were randomised to one of three study arms, and the randomisation was stratified by experience and ambulance station location. This makes it likely that the paramedics in this study represented a wide range of clinicians. The reasons given by these paramedics for changing their airway management technique provide valuable insights into the merits and limitations of the various methods. For example, regurgitation was cited as the reason for abandoning a bag-mask in nearly one third of patients, compared with 18% for a SAD. In addition, displacement of a SAD proved to be an unexpectedly infrequent event.</p>
              <p id="par0115">There are several limitations to our work. Participating paramedics had access to only one type of SAD; other devices may have different properties, and the optimal SAD in OHCA has not yet been identified. In addition, the paramedics had volunteered to take part in a research study, and may not represent all practitioners in their preferences and skills. They had recently received airway refresher training, and knew that they would be reporting their actions during each OHCA they attended. Finally, these data rely on self-report, and were not independently verified. There were no reports of unrecognised oesophageal intubation or other adverse events in this patient group, but we cannot exclude the possibility that reporting was incomplete.</p>
              <p id="par0120">This study arose from a unique opportunity to examine the actions taken by paramedics when they have access to tracheal tubes, SADs and bag-mask ventilation. Understanding usual practice is an important prerequisite to designing a randomised clinical trial (RCT) to determine definitively the optimal initial airway management strategy during out of hospital cardiac arrest. Prospective trials of airway management in OHCA that are properly powered for important clinical outcomes (e.g. neurological outcome at 6 months) are essential.</p>

There is a tendency to move in a staged way to more advanced airway management techniques. Initial use of a bag-mask is often switched for an alternative technique during the arrest.
