              <p>Recovery of arm function in people who survive a stroke is commensurate with severity of impairment at stroke onset.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Those people who have severe impairment of the arm at onset and who do not recover useful arm function, are likely to develop contractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Contracture formation is exacerbated in those who have certain forms of spasticity.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="bibr5-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr6-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> It can therefore be hypothesised that the lack of movement (as a result of the paralysis) in addition to the fixed positioning (associated with some forms of spasticity) accelerate the formation of contractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Contractures are characterised by the combination of increased stiffness and loss of range of movement at a joint. Contractures can be established within four weeks of a stroke and 52% of stroke survivors have developed a contracture at six months.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In some cases where motor recovery is delayed, it is possible that contractures could limit the recovery of meaningful function rather than the lack of neuro-plastic potential.</p>
              <p>One way of slowing contracture development is through intensive mobilisation using cyclical electrical stimulation and this has been demonstrated previously in stroke patients at risk of wrist flexion contractures.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to explore if preventing the fixed positioning associated with spasticity (using additional treatment with botulinum toxin) could reduce both contractures and the rate at which contractures were formed. It was hypothesised that the reduction of spasticity and contractures would lead to a subsequent improvement in arm function. This study, therefore, also aimed to quantify changes in arm function following treatment.</p>

              <p>Stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit in a tertiary care district general hospital were eligible to participate if they were; aged over 18, with a diagnosis of a first stroke within the last 42 days, and had a score of less than or equal to two on the easiest pick and place task on the grasp subsection of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) (i.e. lift and place a 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup> wooden block).<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The exclusion criteria were; significant musculoskeletal conditions prior to stroke, contra-indications to electrical stimulation, known previous spasticity, hypersensitivity to excipients of BoNTA, infection at the proposed injection sites, or pregnancy.</p>

Immediately following treatment, spasticity in the elbow flexors and wrist flexors decreased in the treatment group. This decrease was seen for six weeks and four weeks in the elbow and wrist of the treatment group respectively. It is important to note, that although the spasticity in the treatment group started increasing, after this early decrease, it was always lower than that measured in the control group. At the elbow, the differences were significant between weeks two and twelve, and, at the wrist the differences were significant between the weeks two and six.</p>

In the control group, the stiffness about the elbow continued to increase until the end of the study period. In the treatment group, there was an immediate and significant decrease in stiffness immediately following treatment. The stiffness then gradually started to increase, however, the stiffness was always lower than that measured in the control group, though not statistically significant. At base line it was possible to achieve anatomical zero in both groups. Over the study period both groups lost passive range of motion and the loss was greater in the control group. The rate in the loss of passive range of extension at the elbow was 2.7 degrees/week slower in the treatment group when compared to the control group.</p>

In the control group, the stiffness about the wrist continued to increase until the end of the study period. In the treatment group, there was a decrease in stiffness immediately following treatment and the stiffness remained low until six weeks after treatment. The stiffness then gradually started to increase. Although, the stiffness in the treatment group was always lower than that measured in the control group the differences were not statistically significant. The passive range of extension mirrored the changes in stiffness, that is, the control group showed a systematic loss whilst the treatment group showed a period of plateau until after the week six measurement after which a loss in passive extension was observed. The passive range of extension was higher in the treatment group at all time points after treatment and was only significant at the week six measurement. The rate in the loss of passive range of extension at the wrist was 1.8 degrees/week slower in the treatment group when compared to the control group.</p>

                  <p>Wrist flexion contractures were quantified by measuring the stiffness and the passive range of movement about the joint. This table summarises the data from the repeated measurement taken at baseline, 2-weeks, 4-weeks, 6-weeks and 12-weeks post injection, and six months post stroke. The mean and standard deviation for the placebo and treatment group are reported for each time point of measurement. In addition, the mean difference (MD), the 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) of this difference and the respective <italic>P</italic>-values are reported. Values &lt;0.05 are in bold text.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This study has shown that post stroke spasticity occurs significantly earlier than previously reported and has demonstrated that the Tardieu Scale lacks sensitivity in identifying these patients. This inability of commonly used clinical scales to measure spasticity has been previously reported and discussed.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Additional treatment with Botulinum toxin on the first presentation of spasticity (measured neurophysiologically) did lead to the expected reduction in spasticity and the physiological effects of the treatment were consistent with the pharmacokinetics of the drug, that is, effects lasted between four to six weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> One hypothesis was that early treatment would lead to a reduction or prevention of contractures and the data suggests that following a single cycle of Botulinum toxin we reduced the rate of contracture formation and also reduced the need for additional treatment with splints.</p>
              <p>This study confirms the findings from three previous studies in terms of the short term effects of treatment on spasticity and in the longer term on stiffness. Three previous studies that have specifically investigated Botulinum toxin in the early stage after stroke provided evidence that it may be effective in reducing stiffness.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> One study<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> used the same technique as our study to identify spasticity whereas the two other studies<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> used variations of the Modified Ashworth Scale to identify and assess stiffness as an indirect measure of spasticity.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The reduction in the rate of contracture formation seen during the first six weeks of the treatment was not sustained. The most plausible explanation for the reduction in rate of contractures in the early stages was related to reduced levels of flexor muscle spasticity. Once the effects of Botulinum toxin on the motor neurone junction were reversed, the risks of the joints being held in flexed position would have increased, particularly if the patients had not recovered useful arm function. This could explain the reversal in the rate of contracture formations after the six weeks window.</p>
              <p>One could therefore hypothesise that, for patients who have not recovered useful function, additional treatments or larger initial doses of toxin may be required. Increasing the doses could lead to a more diffuse weakening effect which would potentially be detrimental to recovery. Treatment is normally repeated every three months and one may need to consider repeating treatment every two months as the clinical befit does not last three months. Further research is required to investigate these two options in stroke. A third option is to consider a range of concomitant treatments that might include splinting in addition to cyclical electrical stimulation and botulinum toxin.</p>
              <p>The response to treatment and contracture development was different between the elbow and the wrist with a greater treatment effect observed at the elbow. One explanation is that there is a greater proportion of connective tissue present in the forearm flexors may lead to a greater amount of collagen crosslinks which is a major cause of stiffness.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Despite use of EMG/e-stim or ultrasound localisation techniques there is the possibility the treatment was better targeted for the muscles that control elbow flexion as opposed to the muscles that control wrist and finger flexion.</p>
              <p>The second hypothesis was that using botulinum toxin to reduce spasticity and contractures could lead to an improvement in arm function. There were two plausible pathways to facilitate the recovery of arm function. The first was that, unlike systemic antispastic agents, botulinum toxin will not depress the central nervous system and therefore not interfere with the potential for neuronal recovery.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr"/>–<xref rid="bibr18-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The second was that the short term prevention of contractures and the suppression of spasticity, whilst simultaneously providing treatment with electrical stimulation, would improve the recover the recovery potential in these severely disabled patients. The results in study suggest that early treatment with botulinum toxin did not facilitate the recovery of arm function in the short term. The most likely reason for a failure to demonstrate functional benefit was that many of our patients may have had severe strokes with a lower potential for recovery<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and a paucity in the access to an appropriate intensity/dose of rehabilitation for the upper limb.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> It was, however, reassuring that the early treatment of spasticity with botulinum toxin appears not to have interfered with the recovery of arm function in those who are likely to have had the potential for functional recovery.</p>
              <sec id="section14-0269215520963855">
                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>It is possible that the treatment with electrical stimulation may have contributed to recovery by increasing the cortical plasticity potential through increased excitability in the sensory-motor cortex.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215520963855" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The impact of this confounder was limited as patients in both groups received treatment with electrical stimulation. Future studies may want to delineate any interaction or confounding effects between these two treatments in relation to contracture development and functional improvement. A further issue was that the original aim was to recruit patients in the early stages after a stroke, that is, before spasticity developed. As a result of delays in getting consent from consultees some patients had already developed spasticity on day of recruitment and this could have reduced the impact of treatment.</p>
                <p>On the basis of this study there is justification for a larger multi-centre clinical trial (with stratification/minimisation based on predicted recovery potential) with health economic analysis to investigate the potential efficacy of this treatment further. Further mechanistic studies aimed at more effectively targeting the treatment, the dose of treatment and the repetition cycles for the treatment are also required as treatment selection was based on consensus guidelines as opposed to research evidence.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>This study has demonstrated that spasticity can be identified early after stroke and that the current clinical scales lack the sensitivity to identify the early signs of spasticity. Treating spasticity with Botulinum toxin reduces spasticity and the rate of contracture formation. The effects of treatment were consistent with the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the Botulinum toxin, long terms clinical benefits, such as reducing the need for contracture management devices is possible. Early treatment with Botulinum toxin did not facilitate recovery of arm function, however, there was no evidence that treatment hindered functional recovery.</p>
