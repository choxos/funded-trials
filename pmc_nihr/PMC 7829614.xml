                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Although targeted biological treatments have transformed the outlook for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 40% of patients show poor clinical response, which is mechanistically still unexplained. Because more than 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have low or absent CD20 B cells‚Äîthe target for rituximab‚Äîin the main disease tissue (joint synovium), we hypothesised that, in these patients, the IL-6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab would be more effective. The aim of this trial was to compare the effect of tocilizumab with rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) stratified for synovial B-cell status.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>This study was a 48-week, biopsy-driven, multicentre, open-label, phase 4 randomised controlled trial (rituximab <italic>vs</italic> tocilizumab in anti-TNF inadequate responder patients with rheumatoid arthritis; R4RA) done in 19 centres across five European countries (the UK, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). Patients aged 18 years or older who fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis and were eligible for treatment with rituximab therapy according to UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines were eligible for inclusion in the trial. To inform balanced stratification, following a baseline synovial biopsy, patients were classified histologically as B-cell poor or rich. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) centrally in block sizes of six and four to receive two 1000 mg rituximab infusions at an interval of 2 weeks (rituximab group) or 8 mg/kg tocilizumab infusions at 4-week intervals (tocilizumab group). To enhance the accuracy of the stratification of B-cell poor and B-cell rich patients, baseline synovial biopsies from all participants were subjected to RNA sequencing and reclassified by B-cell molecular signature. The study was powered to test the superiority of tocilizumab over rituximab in the B-cell poor population at 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was defined as a 50% improvement in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI50%) from baseline. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN database, ISRCTN97443826, and EudraCT, 2012-002535-28.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 28, 2013, and Jan 17, 2019, 164 patients were classified histologically and were randomly assigned to the rituximab group (83 [51%]) or the tocilizumab group (81 [49%]). In patients histologically classified as B-cell poor, there was no statistically significant difference in CDAI50% between the rituximab group (17 [45%] of 38 patients) and the tocilizumab group (23 [56%] of 41 patients; difference 11% [95% CI ‚àí11 to 33], p=0¬∑31). However, in the synovial biopsies classified as B-cell poor with RNA sequencing the tocilizumab group had a significantly higher response rate compared with the rituximab group for CDAI50% (rituximab group 12 [36%] of 33 patients <italic>vs</italic> tocilizumab group 20 [63%] of 32 patients; difference 26% [2 to 50], p=0¬∑035). Occurrence of adverse events (rituximab group 76 [70%] of 108 patients <italic>vs</italic> tocilizumab group 94 [80%] of 117 patients; difference 10% [‚Äì1 to 21) and serious adverse events (rituximab group 8 [7%] of 108 <italic>vs</italic> tocilizumab group 12 [10%] of 117; difference 3% [‚Äì5 to 10]) were not significantly different between treatment groups.</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>The results suggest that RNA sequencing-based stratification of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue showed stronger associations with clinical responses compared with histopathological classification. Additionally, for patients with low or absent B-cell lineage expression signature in synovial tissue tocilizumab is more effective than rituximab. Replication of the results and validation of the RNA sequencing-based classification in independent cohorts is required before making treatment recommendations for clinical practice.</p>

                </p>
                <p id="para30">We searched PubMed for clinical trials, observational studies, and review articles with the search terms ‚Äúrheumatoid arthritis‚Äù, ‚Äúrituximab‚Äù, ‚ÄúB cells‚Äù or ‚ÄúB lymphocytes‚Äù, and ‚Äúsynovial membrane‚Äù. Articles published between June 1, 2010, and June 1, 2020, were considered for inclusion. Several post-hoc analyses of randomised clinical trials that investigated the use of peripheral blood biomarkers to predict response to rituximab were identified, but none of them proved effective for patient stratification in clinical practice. Only a few observational studies provided a direct analysis of the disease tissue (ie, the synovial membrane) before treatment with rituximab. Although specific cellular subpopulations and molecular signatures were found to be associated with response, no firm conclusions could be made in relation to the prediction of treatment response, mainly because of the small sample sizes and absence of randomisation.</p>
                <p id="para40">
                  <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para50">R4RA is the first biopsy-driven, multicentre, randomised trial comparing tocilizumab with rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had inadequate responses to anti-TNF drugs stratified for synovial B-cell status. Although there was no significant difference between the rituximab and the tocilizumab groups using histological B-cell classification for the primary endpoint, the study showed a significant difference in favour of tocilizumab in the number of patients with an improvement in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) by 50% or more and CDAI less than 10¬∑1 (ie, low disease activity, defined as major treatment response; CDAI-MTR). Moreover, when classification was done with RNA sequencing, tocilizumab was superior to rituximab both for the primary outcome and CDAI-MTR. In patients who were classified as B-cell poor, tocilizumab was also superior to rituximab for most secondary outcomes.</p>

                  <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                </p>
                <p id="para70">The R4RA trial represents a milestone in the mechanistic investigation at the disease tissue level of the relationship between drug mode of action and clinical response. Compared with the current clinical approach, R4RA shows that in patients with low or absent of B cell expression signature in synovial tissue an alternative treatment‚Äîsuch as IL-6 receptor inhibition with tocilizumab‚Äîis superior to B-cell targeting with rituximab. Replication of the results and validation of RNA sequencing classification in independent cohorts might lead to the integration of molecular pathology into clinical algorithms to guide treatment allocation of target biological therapies according to drug target expression levels in the disease tissue.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="para80">Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic immune mediated inflammatory disease characterised by synovitis and joint damage that results in considerable morbidity and increased mortality.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have transformed the outlook for patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, the absence of a meaningful response to treatment in approximately 40% of patients and the potential side-effects and high cost of biological DMARDs have underlined the need to identify predictive markers of response to facilitate patient stratification before treatment and ensure the best therapeutic outcome.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para90">B cells are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis by driving synovial inflammation through the production of local disease specific autoantibodies,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> secreting proinflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and acting as antigen presenting cells. The important role of B cells is also supported by the efficacy of the specific CD20 B-cell depleting drug, rituximab.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Rituximab is licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis after unsuccessful conventional synthetic DMARDs and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy.</p>
              <p id="para100">However, in this more therapy-resistant patient cohort, clinical response to rituximab is heterogeneous, with only 30% of patients reported to have a 50% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR50) at 6 months.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Given the mechanism of action of rituximab, it was hypothesised that the number of circulating B cells before and after treatment could be used to predict treatment response. However, pretreatment peripheral B-cell numbers or depletion levels, measured by conventional flow cytometry, found no association with clinical outcome.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Moreover, although the depth of depletion measured by high-sensitive flow cytometry initially appeared to be more informative, small studies have reported contradictory results.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Nevertheless, these studies have highlighted that a high number of circulating CD20 negative plasmablasts and preplasma cells was associated with non-response. However, the crucial question remains unanswered: why‚Äîdespite the profound depletion of peripheral blood B cells induced by rituximab in most patients‚Äîdo only approximately half of patients respond to this therapy? How the number and depletion of B cells in the disease tissue (synovium) relates to rituximab response is also unclear. In that context, variable results from small, observational, biopsy-based studies have been reported.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In particular, the number of synovial CD79a B cells reported before treatment,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and the reduction of specific molecular signatures<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and synovial plasma cells after treatment<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> have shown an association with response to rituximab. However, the observational nature of these studies, the small number of patients analysed, and the use of different timepoints for assessment of treatment outcome has made drawing firm conclusions difficult.</p>

The randomisation list and allocation algorithm were prepared by the trial statistician and securely embedded with the application code so that it was not accessible to end users. The programmer was responsible for implementing the allocation algorithm into the randomisation database. The trial manager and trial management team were responsible for checking patient eligibility and doing the randomisation procedure centrally. The randomisation result was sent electronically to all the clinical trial site staff by the trial office except the named joint assessor (research nurse or assistant) at each site, who remained masked to study drug allocation.

                <p id="para170">A minimum of six synovial biopsies were embedded in paraffin en masse and assessed histologically.

Synovial tissues with a CD20 score less than two were classified as B-cell poor; tissues with CD20 score of two to four and CD20 B-cell aggregates were classified as B-cell rich. Any discrepancies in classification were resolved through mutual agreement (between HR and GT). Patients were classified as unknown if definite synovial tissue could not be identified. B-cell rich samples were classified as germinal centre positive if CD21 follicular dendritic cell networks were present (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 14</xref>). As predefined in the study protocol, only patients classified as B-cell rich or B-cell poor were included in the primary analysis.</p>
                <p id="para180">A minimum of six synovial samples per patient were immediately immersed in RNA-Later for RNA sequencing.

Primary efficacy analysis evaluated the number of patients meeting the primary endpoint. Patients could be deemed non-responders (predefined in the protocol) if they had CDAI50% but did not have low disease activity, with a CDAI of less than 10¬∑1 (CDAI-major treatment response; CDAI-MTR); thus, a supplementary efficacy analysis in line with the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines (2019) was done to evaluate the number of patients meeting CDAI-MTR. In addition, as predefined in the protocol, an aim of the trial was also to test both cellular and molecular signatures in the synovial tissue; therefore, CDAI50% and CDAI-MTR were also evaluated in patients classified according to the RNA sequencing.</p>
                <p id="para210">The study was not powered to evaluate comparative efficacy of either drug in the B-cell rich cohort; however, assessment of CDAI50% response and CDAI-MTR at 16 weeks was done as a supplementary analysis where the response rate of rituximab was compared with tocilizumab. Additional secondary efficacy analyses included assessment of CDAI remission; Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and DAS28-C reactive protein (CRP) moderate or good EULAR response; DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP low-disease activity; DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP remission; and patient reported outcomes, such as fatigue (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). In addition, to assess the performance of the RNA sequencing stratification method, as a post-hoc analysis we evaluated the RNA sequencing FANTOM5 B cell module by varying the cutoff between B-cell rich and B-cell poor tissue to determine whether the median value was optimal (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 16</xref>). The CDAI50% rates of response in patients classified as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and negative were compared in a post-hoc analysis.</p>
                <p id="para220">The incidence and severity of treatment and procedure emergent adverse events were monitored throughout the study; adverse event coding was done according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 22). The causality and expectedness of all serious adverse events in relation to the trial treatment was assessed by the principal investigator (or delegated medic), according to the severe adverse event definition. If a severe adverse event related to the treatment was unexpected it was considered a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. All severe adverse events up to week 48 (and up to 30 days later) were reported by relatedness using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities lowest level term classification. All adverse events up to week 48 (and up to 30 days later) were reported using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system organ class classification. Recurrent events (events that occurred more than once in the same participant) were considered as one event.</p>

                <p id="para230">A sample size of 82 patients who were B-cell poor was needed to provide 90% power to detect a 35% difference (assuming 55% response rate to tocilizumab and 20% to rituximab (unpublished data) in patients classified as responders by the primary endpoint. The assumed proportion of patients recruited who were B-cell poor was 60%, B-cell rich was 35%, and germinal centre positive was 5%. After estimating that 10% of biopsy samples would be ungradable and assuming a 5% dropout rate, a total of 160 patients would be required to recruit 82 patients who were B-cell poor. No power calculation was done for patients who were B-cell rich.</p>
                <p id="para240">The primary endpoint and other binary endpoints were analysed using a œá<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact test. For continuous outcomes, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was done, with treatment as factor and baseline value as the continuous covariate. When the assumptions for the ANCOVA were not met, non-parametric ANCOVA was used. Changes from baseline within groups were analysed with a paired Wilcoxon test.</p>
                <p id="para250">Although the study was not powered to evaluate comparative efficacy of either drug in patients who were B-cell rich, we tested whether rituximab was as efficacious as tocilizumab as a secondary analysis. The analysis of the interaction between treatments and pathotypes was done through the likelihood ratio test between two nested logistic regression models: one with pathotype and treatment as covariates and the other with pathotype, treatment, and their interaction as covariates.</p>
                <p id="para260">All efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and then on the per-protocol set to assess the robustness of the results. The per-protocol population included all patients from the intention-to-treat population who did not have any major protocol violations (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>). The list of deviations that excluded a patient from the per-protocol population was reviewed at a classification meeting before the data lock. Safety analyses were done on the safety population (intention-to-treat population, including participants who received at least one dose of the trial medication). In the safety analysis, patients were analysed according to their actual treatment in case this differed from the scheduled treatment (randomised or switched). Missing values assumed to be missing at random were imputed using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations and implemented using Amelia (version 1.7.5; R package).</p>
                <p id="para270">All statistical analyses were done using R (version 3.5.1). The trial is registered on the ISRCTN database, ISRCTN97443826, and EudraCT, 2012-002535-28.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para380">Rituximab remains an important therapeutic option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis; however, clinical response remains heterogeneous, with only 30% of patients with an inadequate response to anti-TNF reported to have an ACR50 response at 6 months.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The mechanism of response and non-response remains unknown. Thus, understanding these mechanisms is crucial to avoid unnecessary exposure to a potentially toxic drug and delay in bringing disease under control. Because more than 50% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis show low or absent B-cell infiltration in the main disease tissue (joint synovium), the rituximab versus tocilizumab in anti-TNF inadequate responder patients with rheumatoid arthritis (R4RA) trial was designed and independently supported by the UK NIHR to determine whether target expression levels (CD20 B cells) and B-cell associated molecular signatures in the synovial tissue can provide a mechanistic explanation for drug mode of action and treatment response.</p>
              <p id="para390">In this first biopsy-based, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in rheumatoid arthritis, we tested the hypothesis that, in patients stratified for low or absent synovial-biopsy CD20 B cells‚Äîthe target for rituximab‚Äîtocilizumab, a specific IL-6-receptor inhibitor, would be superior. In patients classified as B-cell poor by histological classification, there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups for the primary endpoint: CDAI50%. However, tocilizumab was superior to rituximab in patients with low disease activity, defined as CDAI50% and CDAI-MTR (CDAI &lt;10¬∑1).</p>
              <p id="para400">In addition, when patients were classified as B-cell poor or B-cell rich by RNA sequencing, both the primary endpoint and CDAI-MTR reached statistical significance in the B-cell poor group. The statistically significant interaction between RNA sequencing and the study drugs observed with CDAI-MTR suggests that the treatment effect difference between rituximab and tocilizumab was statistically different between the RNA sequencing-stratified B-cell poor and B-cell rich groups.</p>
              <p id="para410">The reasons for the histological and RNA sequencing differences are likely to relate to the sensitivity of the classification technique. CD20 staining was evaluated at three cutting levels on a minimum of six biopsies, which is recommended for use in clinical trials and reported to be representative of the whole joint tissue.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although the semi-quantitative score used for balanced stratification (before randomisation) had been validated both against digital image analysis and the transcript concentrations, determined using the FANTOM5-derived B-cell related gene set,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> because no published gold standard is available, the cutoff of 0‚Äì1 for B-cell poor classification and 2‚Äì4 for B-cell rich classification was set arbitrarily on the basis of a previous pilot study and might not have been at an optimal level for the whole trial. Furthermore, considering that these cutoffs were determined by physically counting the number of CD20 B cells, miscounting had the potential for misclassification.</p>
              <p id="para420">Classification with RNA sequencing was determined by applying a FANTOM5-derived module, which includes 73 genes associated with B cells.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Additionally, the six biopsied were homogenised and pooled to provide a more integrated measure (expression of 30‚Äà000 genes) of pathobiological processes within the entire active joint and arguably a more precise estimate of the number of mature CD20 B cells and B cells at different stages of differentiation (eg, plasmablast and preplasma cells). Because plasmablast and preplasma cells, both in the peripheral blood and synovial tissue, have been shown to influence response to rituximab,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> the RNA sequencing classification clearly appears to be more sensitive. In addition, the application of RNA sequencing classification overcame a number of limitations associated with histological classification, including the replacement of subjective assessments of synovial B-cell infiltration by histopathology with an objective method using the median transcript expression levels of a B-cell gene set module. Of note, in a post-hoc analysis, the FANTOM5 B cell module median values were confirmed to have performed optimally because varying the cutoffs across a 20% range made no difference to results of the study based on the primary outcome measure.</p>
              <p id="para430">In patients classified as B-cell poor by RNA sequencing, tocilizumab was significantly superior to rituximab not only in relation to CDAI50% and CDAI-MTR but also in most of the secondary endpoints considered, which suggests a closer association with a broad range of outcome measures. However, in patients classified as B-cell rich by RNA sequencing the efficacy of rituximab overlapped with tocilizumab suggesting that target expression levels in the disease tissue are important mechanistically in determining non-response and response. Namely, in patients classified as B-cell poor, tocilizumab is more efficacious at inhibiting non-B-cell dependent pathways (eg, IL-6), whereas in patients classified as B-cell rich, tocilizumab and rituximab are similarly efficacious at modulating B cell function.</p>
              <p id="para440">This study also highlighted the potential importance of synovial biopsy in relationship to clinical response and RF and ACPA serological status because no statistically significant difference in clinical response rates to rituximab or tocilizumab were reported between patients who were positive and those who were negative for RF and ACPA. Thus, it is possible that the synovial biopsy might be more sensitive than serology in stratifying patients to rituximab therapy because‚Äîalthough there is a strong association between RF and ACPA positivity and B-cell rich synovitis<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>‚Äîthere are some patients who are RF and ACPA positive but have low or absent B cells in the joint. However, these results must be interpreted with caution considering the small number of patients who were seronegative in the trial, with a potential for a false-negative finding; most studies have reported better response to rituximab in patients who are RF and ACPA positive.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para450">Regarding safety, although a higher number of serious adverse events and adverse events were reported in the tocilizumab group, these appeared largely unrelated to study drug, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Of note, there were no serious adverse events related to the synovial biopsy supporting previous data confirming the safety of minimally invasive ultrasound-guided procedure done by rheumatologists.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para460">The study had some inevitable limitations. First, the potentially inaccurate binary B-cell poor or B-cell rich histological classification. Resolution of this issue will require analysis of the trial to determine a precise cutoff or a different classification method (eg, using continuous variable data, such as transcript concentrations) that is a sensitive predictive tool of clinical response marker for other therapeutic targets (eg, PD1).<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Second, the choice of tocilizumab as an active comparator to rituximab might not have been optimal because tocilizumab itself modulates B-cell function and survival.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Third, the study design, with no drug allocation double-blinding, might have favoured the faster acting tocilizumab, given as monthly infusion, compared with rituximab, given every 6 months. However, because no study drug funding was provided, tocilizumab was the only choice available according to NICE guidance, and the Ethics Committee advised against double-blinding the trial because it would be impractical and extremely inconvenient for patients. Fourth, despite the washout period for TNF inhibitors and standardisation of steroid and conventional synthetic DMARD therapy at trial entry, it is possible that baseline resistant and responsive pathways were modulated heterogeneously by previous or concomitant therapy. Finally, the choice of an improvement of CDAI50% as a primary binary outcome, rather than EULAR-DAS28-ESR response, illustrates the different sensitivity of the available assessments methods. EULAR-DAS28-ESR response would have led to meeting the primary outcome even by the histological classification.</p>
              <p id="para470">In conclusion, we report the results from the first pathobiology-driven, stratified, multicentre randomised trial in rheumatoid arthritis, which showed that although the histological classification of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue was insensitive in determining treatment response in the primary analysis RNA sequencing stratification had significant associations with clinical responses. Additionally, in patients with low or absent B-cell lineage expression signature (the target for rituximab) tocilizumab was superior to rituximab with regard to the number of patients with a CDAI50% or CDAI-MTR, and for most of the secondary outcomes.</p>
              <p id="para480">In patients presenting with a B-cell rich synovium, rituximab was as effective as tocilizumab. These results suggest that disease tissue target expression concentrations are important to inform treatment response. However, because of the limitations of the study, the reported findings cannot justify a change in clinical practice. Nonetheless, replication of the results in independent trials (eg, the biopsy-driven Medical Research Council-funded Stratification of Biologic Therapies for Rheumatoid Arthritis by Pathobiology trial; EudraCT 2017-004079-30), and the validation and refinement of the RNA sequencing pathology classification (eg, using continuous variable data rather than a binary classification), might lead to the development of tests of clinical use for treatment allocation of specific targeted biological therapies‚Äîaccording to the corresponding target expression levels in the disease tissue‚Äîand towards precision rheumatology.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para490">The ability to target biological therapies to the right patients, rather than continue current practice of trial and error, might improve clinical response and early remission, with a major effect on disability and related health and societal costs while also reducing patient exposure to potentially toxic drugs. This would also align rheumatology practice with other disease in which the integration of molecular pathology into clinical algorithms leads to treatment allocation according to drug target expression levels in the disease tissue as part of routine clinical practice.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p>

                <p>The original academic pilot study, upon which the R4RA trial was based, identified B-cell status and associated expression profiles in the synovial biopsy as a good predictor of patient response to treatment with rituximab. The degree of association and predictive accuracy found in that study was high to the 94% level. These findings were IP protected by Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, Patent Cooperation Treaty number: PCT/GB2015/052088. We would like to thank the independent members of the Data Monitoring Committee Max Parmar, John Gribben and Chris Deighton for their expertise ensuring the trial was done to the highest standard. We would also like to thank the independent members of the Trial Steering Committee Patrick Kiely, Di Skingle, James Galloway, Adam Young, and David O'Reilly for their expertise and insightful advice given throughout the study; the Patient Advisory Group represented by Zoe Ide for their continuous support in evaluating trial documentation and the linked research as well as in disseminating the importance of precision medicine among patients and through patient organisations (eg, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society); and all of the patients participating in the trial for their generous contribution of time, patience, and willingness to consent to a minimally invasive procedure that they would not have had as part of their routine care. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the UK NIHR for funding the trial (grant reference: 11/100/76) and Versus Arthritis for providing infrastructure support through the Experimental Arthritis Treatment Centre (grant number: 20022).</p>
