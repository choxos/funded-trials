                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The majority of older people (&gt; 65 years) in hospital have frailty and are at increased risk of readmission or death following discharge home. In the UK, following acute hospitalisation, around one third of older people with frailty are referred on for rehabilitation, termed ‘intermediate care’ services. Although this rehabilitation can reduce early readmission to hospital (&lt; 30 days), recipients often do not feel ready to leave the service on discharge, suggesting possible incomplete recovery. Limited evidence suggests extended rehabilitation is of benefit in several conditions and there is preliminary evidence that progressive physical exercise can improve mobility and function for older people with frailty, and slow progression to disability. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Home-based Older People’s Exercise (HOPE) programme as extended rehabilitation for older people with frailty discharged home from hospital or intermediate care services after acute illness or injury.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial, to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the HOPE programme. This individualised, graded and progressive 24-week exercise programme is delivered by NHS physiotherapy teams to people aged 65 and older with frailty, identified using the Clinical Frailty Scale, following discharge from acute hospitalisation and linked intermediate care rehabilitation pathways. The primary outcome is physical health-related quality of life, measured using the physical component summary score of the modified Short Form 36- item health questionnaire (SF36) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported physical and mental health, functional independence, death, hospitalisations, care home admissions. Plans include health economic analyses and an embedded process evaluation.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This trial seeks to determine if extended rehabilitation, via the HOPE programme, can improve physical health-related quality of life for older people with frailty following acute hospitalisation. Results will improve awareness of the rehabilitation needs of older people with frailty, and provide evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the targeted exercise intervention. There is potential for considerable benefit for health and social care services through widespread implementation of trial findings if clinical and cost-effectiveness is demonstrated.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par46">Frailty is an especially problematic expression of population ageing, with profound implications for planning and delivery of health and social care services. Frailty is characterised by reduced biological reserves and increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes including falls, disability, hospitalisation and care home admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It develops through age-related decline in several physiological systems, which collectively results in a vulnerability to sudden health status changes triggered by relatively minor stressor events. A majority of older people (&gt; 65 years) in UK hospitals have frailty and are at increased risk of readmission or death following discharge home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par47">Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength) is a core component of frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and periods of immobility in older age, such as those experienced during an acute illness or injury, can accelerate loss of skeletal muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the inflammatory response commonly associated with acute illness or injury can lead to catabolism of muscle protein for generation of energy and immune proteins, further accelerating loss of muscle mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is especially problematic in frailty because accelerated loss of skeletal muscle function can compromise the capability to perform activities of daily living independently (e.g. walking, dressing, toileting), jeopardising successful functioning in the home environment. This may then increase the need for home care or admission to long-term care residence.</p>
                <p id="Par48">In the UK, following hospital admission with acute illness or injury, approximately one third of older people with frailty are provided with a period of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This National Health Service (NHS) rehabilitation is often provided via ‘intermediate care’ (IC), which is a range of community rehabilitation services predominantly for older people with frailty to promote recovery of independence and reduce premature need for long-term care. IC is typically organised in two general forms: bed-based rehabilitation, or home-based rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], provided across a range of settings (e.g. community hospital and hospital at home/community therapy services). National guidelines for both bed-based and home-based IC recommend only a brief contact (2 to 6 weeks) with services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Findings from the 2014 UK National Audit of Intermediate Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] identified that many recipients of IC did not feel ready to leave the service, indicating the possibility of incomplete recovery. Although reduced early readmission to hospital (&lt; 30 days) has been reported in five studies of IC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], no difference in re-admissions between 60 days and 6 months has been identified, indicating that the early benefits of IC may not be sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Indeed, the benefits of rehabilitation in IC are shown to attenuate over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A key challenge is how to successfully reduce the loss of independence that often affects older people with frailty following hospital discharge. An intervention augmenting usual NHS rehabilitation, provided post-discharge for older people admitted to hospital, is required to improve longer-term outcomes. A programme of progressive physical exercise with integrated behaviour change techniques is a candidate intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par49">Exercise has positive physiological effects on skeletal muscle, brain and endocrine systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Additionally, observational studies have identified a consistent inverse dose-response relationship between physical activity and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which may be especially relevant following acute illness or injury. Randomised controlled trial evidence indicates that exercise can down-regulate inflammation in older people and that the benefit is most pronounced in older people at greatest risk of disability and loss of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Systematic reviews of exercise interventions for older people with frailty have reported evidence for improvements in mobility and activities of daily living, but few studies used well-validated frailty tools or measured effects on quality of life and no studies reported on cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Exercise programmes based on progressive strength training were important for functional improvement. This evidence for positive physiological, mobility and functional benefits of exercise in frailty supports our proposal for a home-based exercise intervention to extend the rehabilitation period for older people with frailty following acute illness or injury.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Successful exercise programmes often incorporate strategies to promote behaviour change. Behaviour change strategies demonstrated to have a positive effect on health behaviour adherence include goal setting, self-monitoring, demonstration of behaviour, provision of feedback, use of materials such as exercise logs and manuals, enablement through social support, and extended periods of contact/support from a health care provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is difficult to draw causal links between single behaviour change strategies and effective health behaviour interventions due to the nuanced and multifaceted nature of many health interventions and health care provider interactions. However, a successful exercise programme supported by physiotherapists will likely need to include many of these behaviour change strategies as elements of the programme and its delivery.</p>
                <p id="Par51">We have developed and tested in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), a home-based exercise intervention for older people with frailty (Home-based Older People’s Exercise (HOPE) programme) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] aimed at improving strength, endurance and balance. The HOPE programme development has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], utilising a staged approach to the synthesis of evidence and a co-design approach and refinement process. The intervention is presented to participants in an exercise manual and delivered by community-based physiotherapy teams. The manualised nature of the intervention and use of face-to-face and telephone support is consistent with evidence-based strategies to promote physical activity behaviour change, and intervention adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The HOPE programme has been tested in an earlier pilot trial involving 84 community-dwelling older people, with evidence for feasibility, acceptability, and potential for a positive, clinically important intervention effect on mobility. Informed by previously effective behaviour change programmes, the HOPE programme has been extended by a further 12 weeks of telephone-based support for intervention sustainability for the HERO trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par52">Here we report the protocol for the HERO trial, a multi-centre individually randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the HOPE programme for older people with frailty discharged home from hospital or IC services following admission with acute illness or injury.</p>

                <p id="Par85">Local research staff will monitor potential participants throughout their admission and seek informed consent approximately 48 h prior to discharge home from hospital or from IC. Eligible participants will be approached and the study will be introduced to them verbally. During this approach, the researchers will also carry out an assessment of capacity to provide informed consent to participate. Interested participants will be given verbal and written information about the trial, given appropriate time to consider involvement and discuss participation with family/friends. Written informed consent will be sought; this will be timed with appropriate proximity to planned discharge. If the potential participant has capacity and chooses to consent, final eligibility assessments will be undertaken (CFS, MoCA, TUGT) and, if appropriate, the baseline assessments will be completed ahead of randomising the participant to their treatment allocation.</p>

If this work confirms that it is reasonable to assume data are missing at random (MAR), the primary analysis will use multiple imputation to deal with missing data. We will include a wide range of variables in the imputation models, including all variables in the substantive analysis, plus, as far as computationally feasible, all variables predictive of the missing values themselves (including potentially time of death) and all variables influencing the process causing the missing data, even if they are not of interest in the substantive analysis. If the initial work does not confirm MAR, we will explore the use of other more complex methods for the primary analysis taking account of data missing not at random (MNAR), such as pattern mixture modelling. To assess the impact of death on our potential treatment effect, we will then undertake a sensitivity analysis by repeating the primary analysis modelling but exclude those participants who have died. A per protocol analysis or Complier Average Causal Effect Model of the primary outcome will also be conducted based on pre-defined criteria associated with intervention adherence.</p>

              <p id="Par165">The primary within-trial analysis will compare direct costs and 12-month outcomes of participants randomised to the HOPE programme (+ usual care) versus control (usual care alone). The perspective adopted will be that of the NHS and Public Social Services. Secondary analyses will adopt a societal perspective taking account of productivity costs and out-of-pocket expenditures incurred by participants. Data collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months will be utilised to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing the intervention with the control group. Mortality and quality of life (derived from the EQ-5D-5L) over the study period will be used to generate QALYs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

The model will be a Markov or semi-Markov state model. Transition rates for the model will be estimated from the clinical study data. Where this is not possible (e.g. outcomes of hospital readmission/care home placement), we will follow recommended best practice in identifying and synthesising the best available evidence in the literature.</p>

                <p id="Par192">Feasibility discussions, setting-up and starting recruitment at trial sites, demonstrate that all trial sites are different in terms of service provision and pathways through the acute hospital, to intermediate care services. The foci of screening and recruitment activity differ between organisations, but a challenge facing all research teams is the numerous pathways from admission to ultimate rehabilitation discharge, and the variability and unpredictable duration of patients’ time under the care of those services. Screening and recruitment is challenging when split across many services and settings between both hospital services and separate bed-based and community-based rehabilitation services. Local research teams’ screening and tracking processes for potential participants are likely to evolve over time as services evolve and pathways potentially change.</p>

                <p id="Par195">This trial seeks to determine if the HOPE programme as extended rehabilitation for older people with frailty following acute illness or injury can improve physical health-related quality of life. The HOPE programme will be embedded within existing NHS services and pathways in a wide range of trusts both in terms of geography and size, and the diversity of the populations, to make the trial findings generalisable to a population of older people with frailty. The trial is powered such that robust conclusions may be drawn around clinical and cost-effectiveness of a theory-driven exercise intervention with potential for improved health-related quality of life. The results will improve awareness of the rehabilitation needs of older people with frailty. Findings from the embedded process evaluation will contribute to understanding factors which would facilitate wider implementation of the HOPE programme, these include factors influencing trial implementation, intervention fidelity, and the experiences and perspectives of trial participants and providers. The HERO trial findings will have considerable potential for benefit to older people with frailty and for health and social care services, through the commissioning and delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation services, if effectiveness is demonstrated.</p>
