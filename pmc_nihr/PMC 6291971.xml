                  <p id="Par1">We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a loyalty scheme based intervention involving rewards for increasing physical activity in public sector employees.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A cluster randomised wait-list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18–65 years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Between September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation = four) and 853 participants to the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 19 with 457 participants) or control group (<italic>n</italic> = 18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54·4%) intervention and 236 (59·6%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference = − 336, 95% CI: -612 to − 60, <italic>p</italic> = 0·02) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 2·97 h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p = 0·62), which could result in net savings ranging from £66 to £735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par37">There is a strong business case for investing in the health and wellbeing of the workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is estimated that for every £1 invested in workplace health and wellbeing, there is a potential return of over £4 as a consequence of reductions in absenteeism and improvements in productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with a possible dividend to the economy in the region of £30 billion annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With increasing numbers of inactive office-based occupations, improvements in physical activity (PA) levels may contribute positively to wellbeing, mental health, absenteeism and productivity. Evidence to support the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions is mixed, with previous meta-analyses of workplace PA interventions showing small, positive, short-term effects on PA levels, but an absence of evidence on maintenance and cost-effectiveness from different perspectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">The lack of evidence for the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PA interventions is not unique to workplace interventions. A systematic review found that PA interventions targeting adults showed small positive effect sizes between 6 and 15 months follow-up (SMD 0·20–0·28), with few studies thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A further systematic review demonstrated that there were distinct mediators of PA behaviour change during initiation (first 6 months of a behaviour) and maintenance (beyond 6 months of a behaviour) phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This research points to the need to design interventions that purposefully support the transition from initiation to maintenance of behaviour change which involves distinct theoretical and implementation approaches.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Our earlier research demonstrated the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a workplace PA intervention in a pilot quasi-experiment, collaborating with the business sector, and purposefully developed on a sustainable ‘business’ model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In partnership with retailers, we adapted the general underlying business principles of a loyalty scheme, an existing mechanism that supports behaviour change in the private sector, and applied it to a public health setting. In the business sector, some loyalty schemes encourage repeated behaviour (i.e., loyalty), such as shopping at a particular retailer, by rewarding participants for their repeated business by collecting points and the opportunity to convert these into subsequent rewards, such as, retail vouchers. Using similar principles, we developed the “Physical Activity Loyalty Card” whereby participants earned points for minutes of PA, which could then be redeemed for rewards. Our pilot data provided evidence to support the potential of such an intervention to impact positively on workplace health and wellbeing, and provide economic benefits from a public health, employer and retailer perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Consequently, using pilot data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] we developed a pragmatic intervention primarily aimed at increasing PA levels among office-based public sector employees in Northern Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The intervention incorporated evidence-based behaviour change techniques, and was underpinned by relevant theory. A cluster RCT design was employed to minimise the risk of contamination of the intervention between the trial groups. Our aims were to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention versus the waiting-list control group. A further aim was to understand the underpinning mechanisms of PA behaviour change, through process analysis of hypothesised mediating variables.</p>

                <p id="Par41">The study was a cluster RCT, with a parallel mediation analysis and economic evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par42">Nine public sector organisations in two cities (Belfast and Lisburn) in Northern Ireland were purposively sampled from those within a 2 km radius of the city centre or which could offer PA opportunities within a 2 km radius of their location and had a minimum of 100 employees in predominantly office-based occupations. Meetings were held with senior management of these organisations to explain the study purpose and practicalities.</p>
                <p id="Par43">Participants were healthy adults working in office-based occupations in public sector organisations. Recruitment methods were email invitations to employees and posters placed around each workplace advertising the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Potential participants were able to access further information (including the Participant Information Sheet) and register their interest to participate on the study website. They were asked to complete a screening questionnaire via the study website or by telephone, to confirm their eligibility, based on the following inclusion criteria: based at recruited worksite at least 4 h/day (within core hours of 8 am-6 pm) on at least 3 days/week, current contract anticipated to last for the duration of the study, access to internet at work, able to give informed consent, and no self-reported recent medical events that would limit ability to participate in PA (assessed using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, PAR-Q).</p>
                <p id="Par44">The trial was delivered according to the updated published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ethics approval was obtained from the Office for Research Ethics Committee Northern Ireland (ORECNI) (reference number 14/NI/0090; approval granted May 21, 2014). Local NHS Health and Social Care Trust approvals were obtained from Research Governance departments before the start of recruitment.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="Par45">Clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention group or waiting-list control group (1:1). Clusters were the smallest work groups or units (e.g. a large open plan office) within each participating organisation. A random allocation sequence was drawn up by the trial statistician using a computer generated random sequence, and group allocation was stratified to ensure a similar number of clusters of each size and type (i.e. small organisations &lt; 20 employees; medium organisations 20–50 employees; large organisations &gt; 50 employees; school) in both intervention and control groups. Allocations were only accessible by an independent trial statistician and those delivering the intervention until after the trial had finished. The outcome of the randomisation was communicated to participants by email after baseline measurements were complete.</p>
                <p id="Par46">It was not possible to blind participants to group allocation. Research staff collecting the outcome data were masked to allocation, as were the statisticians and health economists conducting the analysis (the randomisation variable was unlabelled in the main dataset).</p>
                <p id="Par47">Eligible participants were introduced to the study by the research team and gave written informed consent prior to completion of baseline data collection and before group allocation was assigned.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="Par48">Intervention components included the provision of points which could be converted into rewards (retail vouchers) contingent on meeting PA behaviour goals. The PAL Scheme integrated a PA remote tracking system with web-based monitoring and evidence-based behaviour change tools such as self-monitoring and goal-setting.</p>
                <p id="Par49">The 6 month intervention involved placing wifi beacons (sensors) at specific locations in the vicinity of participating workplaces to encourage PA within a 2 km radius of participants’ worksites (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The wifi beacons were placed at locations along footpaths, in local parks, leisure centres, shopping malls, bus stops and train stations. Maps of various walking routes and details about PA opportunities tailored to the workplace were provided on the study website. Participants’ PA was logged when they engaged in PA within an approximate 25 m radius of the wifi beacons carrying their PAL keyfob. The place, date and time of the bout of PA was logged. Participants could access their account on the study website and receive real-time feedback on the number of minutes of PA logged by the tracking system. Participants were encouraged to undertake 150 min/week of PA which was in line with current guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Minutes of PA were converted to points (1 point for 1 min of activity recorded), and collected points were redeemable for rewards (downloadable retail vouchers) sponsored by, and redeemable at, local businesses. To reduce the risk of ‘gaming’ (i.e. any items to cheat the system in order to gain more points without doing PA, for example, driving rather than walking between sensors), a daily points cap was implemented and the transit times between wifi beacons checked for anomalous values. Bonus rewards and Double Points Days were offered to participants.</p>
                <p id="Par50">Participants completed a Contingent Valuation (CV) survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] at baseline which provided their stated preferences to assess the minimum level of financial incentive necessary for them to increase moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This information helped determine the overall level of the rewards available for earned points. The intervention had several other components designed to enhance the effectiveness of the incentives. The techniques included the provision of regular tailored motivational emails, tailored feedback, and information on walking routes in the vicinity of the participating workplaces and links to other resources such as PA advice. It also included self-regulation techniques of goal setting, self-monitoring, and prompts to behaviour (described in detail elsewhere) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These components were delivered via the study website and designed to have multiple effects: (a) to increase usage of the study website, (b) as effective behaviour change techniques in their own right, and (c) as techniques designed to aid the transition from more extrinsically motivated behaviour to more intrinsically motivated habitual behaviour.</p>
                <p id="Par51">The financial incentive component of the intervention was based on principles of Learning Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] by providing an immediate reward (extrinsic motivation) for behaviours that offer health gains in the future. The use of contingent reinforcement hypothesised that repetition of the behaviour-reward cycle would lead to workplace PA becoming a ‘learned’ behaviour and lead to habit formation, which fit within a self-regulation control theory framework. Motivational messages (persuasion) and social support (vicarious experience) would increase self-efficacy satisfaction with the consequences of behaviour change acting as a reinforcing mechanism, in addition to the reinforcement of financial incentives. Thus, the financial incentive component was embedded in a complex intervention containing evidence-informed behaviour change techniques. A logic model underpinning the intervention was developed (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par52">Those assigned to the waiting-list control group (<italic>n</italic> = 396) were offered the opportunity to participate in the intervention after the final follow-up period (i.e. 12 months post-baseline). Participants in this group completed outcome measures at the same time points as the intervention group but received no other intervention.</p>

This outcome was also collected at 12 month follow-up. Although only workplace PA was incentivised, we hypothesised that participants would be encouraged to be more active generally and so we chose a measure of total PA as our primary outcome which is most public health relevant.</p>
                <p id="Par54">Secondary outcomes at 6 month follow-up were self-reported measures of workplace PA (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire; GPAQ), health (Short Form-8), well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale; WEMWBS), health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5 L), and work-related impacts (absenteeism and presenteeism using the WHO Health and Performance Questionnaire).</p>

Costs included the intervention costs (apportioned per participant) and health-care resource use. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accrued over the 6 month follow-up period. The primary economic analysis reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimated by dividing the adjusted difference in mean costs between groups by the adjusted difference in mean QALYs between groups. ICER estimates were compared with a £20,000 - £30,000 per QALY threshold applied by NICE. A supplementary Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was undertaken from an employer’s perspective by using a ‘net-cost model’, incorporating the intervention costs and the avoided costs of absenteeism and productivity loss due to sick days using a human capital approach (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par76">In this cluster RCT, there was a significant reduction in mean steps/day (the primary outcome) in the intervention group compared to the control group at 6 months post-baseline (adjusted mean difference = − 336, 95% CI: -612 to − 60, <italic>p</italic> = 0·02). There was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group in mean steps/day at 12 months post-baseline (adjusted mean difference = − 570, 95% CI: -1267 to 127, p = 0·11).</p>
              <p id="Par77">By contrast, the study found significant intervention effects for improvement in mental wellbeing. However, this was not supported with findings from the quality of life and mental health measures, and so we are cautious in over-interpreting this positive finding. It is conceivable that mental wellbeing improved in the intervention group as a result of being involved in an employee health and wellbeing trial at a time when there were significant re-structuring in the organisations.</p>
              <p id="Par78">Further, there was a 60% probability of the intervention being cost-saving from an employer’s perspective arising from reduced absenteeism (p = 0·62). Whilst the decline in absenteeism hours was not statistically significant it is arguably economically significant and worth exploring in future studies powered to detect such economic impacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Hence, from the employers perspective and valuing absenteeism using a human capital approach, the intervention could be deemed to be worthwhile.</p>
              <p id="Par79">Our analyses included an adjustment for season which would suggest that the 6 month difference in steps/day between the intervention and control groups was not due to a seasonal effect. Given the rationale for intervention, its theoretical underpinning and our pilot data, these results defy easy explanation. Our qualitative findings point to some issues with the level and type of incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Participants redeemed 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. These aspects were informed a priori via a CV survey with all participants, and with the types of vouchers were discussed in pre-intervention focus groups with the target population. They were also shown to be popular in our pilot work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our intervention was 6 months in duration which is in line with other PA interventions attempting to elicit and support PA maintenance (a period consonant with the mean in a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Usage data from the PA monitoring system showed that the minutes of activity recorded on the system declined over the 6 month intervention period (participants logging at least 10 min of activity via the PA monitoring system on 25% of all possible intervention days). However, from our qualitative findings it is clear that some participants reported feeling frustrated with early technological glitches that impacted on accurate monitoring of PA behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. New rewards, walking routes, and double point’s days were regularly introduced in an attempt to keep the format fresh and appealing but this did not improve workplace PA. The importance of study context should not be underestimated in the interpretation of our study findings. During our recruitment phase, a number of participating organisations undertook significant re-structuring due to the then current economic austerity, resulting in uncertainty regarding job security and job location; a time when employee health and wellbeing was at its most vulnerable. The impact of this was evident in our qualitative data which highlighted how motivation can be more usefully seen as a property of systems (incorporating technologies, organisation and action) rather than just of individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Further details regarding the findings from the process evaluation are provided in Gough et al. (2018) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and Murray et al. (2019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par80">Our findings suggest interesting conjectures regarding causal mechanisms. The use of financial incentives to change health behaviours is often criticised for ‘crowding out’ intrinsic motivation in line with Self Determination Theory - albeit based on laboratory based experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Findings from our ‘real-world’ study provide evidence to the contrary in two ways: (1) our results showed increased internal forms of motivation (i.e. identified regulation, integrated regulation and intrinsic motivation) for the intervention group compared to the control group at 4 weeks and 6 months; (2) results demonstrated that there was no intervention effect for financial (extrinsic) motivation at 4 weeks. These findings have important implications in respect of some of the contentious issues highlighted in the literature on the use of financial incentives for achieving behaviour change. They suggest that using financial incentives within a complex behaviour change intervention with multiple components collectively does not necessarily diminish, and may facilitate intrinsic motivation. Our results also suggest that the provision of financial incentives does not necessarily increase financial (extrinsic) motivation. These findings are in line with a systematic review of psychological and economic studies which concluded that there was no evidence that extrinsic incentives would crowd out incentivised health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, given the complex nature of this intervention, it is important to note that the positive findings for internal motivation could also be related to our use of self-regulation Behaviour Change Techniques including self-monitoring and feedback on PA behaviour.</p>
              <p id="Par81">More generally, whilst the intervention group showed increases in some hypothesised mediators of initiation, these increases were not related to PA behaviour at 6 months. However, hypothesised mediators of maintenance were related to PA behaviour at 6 months. Especially notable are the findings that internal motivation mitigated reduction in PA behaviour at 6 months. Self-regulation appears to have mitigated and attenuated the reduction in steps in the intervention group. As reported above, our results run counter to predictions of Self Determination Theory suggesting that there is a role for financial incentives and self-regulation interventions. However, the amount of variance explained by our measured mediators of behaviour change was low. Therefore, future studies would need to examine other potential mediators of behaviour change to shed further light on these associations. Our previous systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] suggested that studies of mechanisms of intervention effect have generally been of poor methodological quality and would benefit from a framework based on consensus about how mediation should be measured and tested in trials of complex interventions. Such a framework should include the use of formal mediation tests, the embedding of evidence-based techniques for changing hypothesised mediators and the need to investigate constructs with particular relevance for initiation <italic>and</italic> maintenance of behaviour change. Future research should also examine mediators of adverse effects such as found in the present study so we can better understand unintended consequences and negative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par82">Despite the improvements in some secondary outcomes and positive net-benefit for employers, the primary outcome (steps/day) declined significantly in the intervention group. These results pose several scientific and real world implementation challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], including how to balance positive and negative results when primary and secondary outcomes are discordant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par83">There is a long standing belief that positive results are favoured by scientific journals and that this may contribute to “publication bias”. On the other hand, some journals claim now to select articles for publication based on their contribution to the literature and welcome null results that challenge conventional wisdom or prior expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results from our trial certainly challenged prior expectations. However, it is notoriously hard to disprove any hypothesis, and so negative studies must have the precision and strength of design to be reasonably persuasive. The revised sample size and power calculations for our trial were approved by the study funder, and the effect size on which they were premised was within the category of “moderate” effect sizes observed in past PA interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Even though attrition and loss to follow-up was higher than predicted (43% observed vs 15% predicted), (albeit comparable to literature published during the conduct of our trial.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] we might have concluded that accepting the null hypothesis at 12 months was justified. However, the primary outcome was specified at 6 months and the non-significant difference in mean steps/day at 12 months (~ 500 steps) was, arguably, still of a magnitude which could be of public health importance. We would probably have claimed as much had the direction of the intervention effect been positive. Some may also argue that with a primary outcome of total PA, the lack of a significant intervention effect is not surprising given that the intervention specifically incentivised workplace PA. However, we hypothesised that participants would also be encouraged to further participate in additional PA outside the workplace. Workplace PA was specifically measured using the remote sensing monitoring system (sensors and keyfobs) and the GPAQ which incorporates a workplace PA domain. However, we also used a well-validated pedometer, followed a standardised measurement protocol (including sealing the pedometer to prevent reactivity), and we supplemented the data with the GPAQ and daily PA monitoring using the remote sensing system. There was consistency in the direction and magnitude of our findings for total PA and workplace PA.</p>
              <p id="Par84">If the significant negative effect at 6 months is indicative of a true negative effect <italic>of this intervention in this setting</italic>, one might still ask whether the result is generalisable. Is this recruited sample of public sector office workers in Northern Ireland representative of office workers elsewhere in the UK?

Thus it is important to further investigate the potential causal mechanisms using mediation and moderation analyses to gain a better understanding of our findings. Our study was not powered to detect changes in mediating variables, and because of low power and multiple testing, the results need to be interpreted with caution.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par85">In summary, the PAL Scheme intervention was not more effective than waiting-list control. Reduced health care costs, reduced absenteeism and improved mental wellbeing in the intervention group are somewhat noteworthy, and results suggest that the intervention could be cost beneficial for employers. However this needs to be explored within a trial powered on the economic outcome of productivity and/or absenteeism. Finally, we believe our results pose several scientific and real world implementation challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials.</p>
