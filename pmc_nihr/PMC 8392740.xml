                  <p>The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) on individuals with cancer has been profound. It has led to increased anxiety, distress and deconditioning due to reduced physical activity. We aim to investigate whether SafeFit, a multimodal intervention of physical activity, nutrition and psychological support delivered virtually by cancer exercise specialists (CES), can improve physical and emotional functionings during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                  <p>A phase III non-randomised intervention trial, target recruitment of 1050 adults with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of cancer. All recruited participants will receive the multimodal intervention delivered by CES for 6 months. Sessions will be delivered 1-to-1 using telephone/video conferencing consultations. CES will work with each participant to devise a personalised programme of (1) physical activity, (2) basic dietary advice and (3) psychological support, all underpinned by behaviour change support.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>Physical and emotional functioning as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Secondary outcomes: overall quality of life measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L, health economics, patient activation, self-efficacy to self-manage chronic disease, distress, impact of COVID-19 on emotional functioning, self-reported physical activity, functional capacity and nutrition. Adherence to the intervention will also be measured and a process evaluation conducted.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has led to reprioritising of clinical care, and the impact on individuals with a cancer diagnosis has been profound. Treatments and follow-up care have been severely disrupted, affecting 650 000 people with cancer in the UK alone, and many supportive services have also been postponed.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Moreover, once infected with SARS-CoV-2, people with cancer experience significantly worse clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Although not all people living with and beyond cancer are now advised to shield, many remain fearful of leaving their homes due to the risks of contracting the virus and the consequences of COVID-19.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>For many people with cancer, the pandemic has resulted in deconditioning due to social isolation, reduced physical activity and changes to eating habits that limit their ability to consume sufficient energy and nutrients to meet their needs. Cancer is typically a disease of older adults who are at particular risk of pulmonary complications as a result of COVID-19, which will likely be exacerbated by reduced cardiopulmonary fitness associated with such reductions in activity levels. Furthermore, smoking, poor nutrition and obesity are independent risk factors for developing cancer, which concurrently increase vulnerability to severe COVID-19.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p>
              <p>Good nutrition and regular physical activity have proven to be effective at addressing a variety of disease and treatment-related consequences of cancer, and optimising physical fitness is also likely to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, supporting this population to maximise engagement in physical activity and to improve nutritional status is imperative.</p>
              <p>Supporting psychological well-being is also vital for people with cancer. Higher levels of anxiety and depression are associated with poor quality of life and physiological outcomes both early in the treatment pathway and in patients who have completed treatment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref> Many people with cancer will continue to experience distress, depression and anxiety months and years after cancer treatment completion. These issues are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic through reduced access to informal social support networks and formal psychological support services. Macmillan Cancer Support reported in June 2020 that over 27 000 people with cancer in the UK have experienced panic or anxiety attacks because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
              <p>The SafeFit Trial, as described in this paper, was conceived when our research team was forced to pause recruitment to the Wessex-Fit-4-Cancer Surgery Trial,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> a multimodal prehabilitation trial delivered in community settings. We wanted to develop a new programme to support patients throughout and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The multimodal structure of the intervention is informed by the recent Macmillan, Royal College of Anaesthetists and National Institute of Health Cancer and Nutrition Collaboration, Research Principles and Guidance for Prehabilitation within the Management and Support of People with Cancer.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The guidance advocates for a multimodal approach encompassing exercise, nutrition and psychological support in order to optimise patients with cancer prior to treatment, increasing their resilience to withstand cancer therapies and hastening their recovery.</p>
              <p>It is now accepted that people with cancer require ‘end-to-end’ pathway support, at the point of diagnosis, throughout treatment and recovery. The SafeFit Trial adopted the multimodal prehabilitation model for universal provision of support with patients recruited at any point in the treatment and recovery pathway. People with cancer are increasingly turning to remote support services, and distanced and home-based interventions have been shown to be effective in supporting dietary and physical activity behaviour change.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, evidence suggests that inclusion of a supervised component increases intervention adherence<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and longer-term maintenance of physical activity behaviour change.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p>
              <p>Considerable research has explored the most effective ‘ingredients’ of a behaviour change intervention in cancer populations to improve engagement and adherence to such interventions as well as to promote longer-term behaviour change. A recent Cochrane review supports the use of goal setting, setting of graded tasks and instruction on how to perform behaviour to maximise intervention adherence.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Additionally, action planning and social support are associated with maintenance of behaviour change.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, there is growing evidence of the role of self-efficacy—a person’s belief in their ability to perform a given task—in supporting behaviour change with evidence that self-efficacy is a mediator of exercise behaviour in clinical populations and a predictor of exercise adherence.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The SafeFit Trial is underpinned by behavioural science using evidence-based behaviour change techniques to optimise patient engagement and to support self-management and long-term behaviour change.</p>
              <p>The proposed trial explores the impact of SafeFit, a virtually delivered multimodal intervention, on the physical and emotional well-being of people with cancer.</p>

Five items for physical function and four for emotional function are answered using a Likert scale scoring of 1–4 to provide a function score from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent higher functioning. This subscale has been used in previous interventions in cancer populations and is sensitive to change over time.</p>

                  <p>It will be the responsibility of the CES to complete a pre-session screening checklist to monitor condition, medical contacts, medication and COVID-19 status. Exercise will continue, be modified with observation, or stopped and review sought from the treating medical team. In the case of an acute medical event during the exercise session, the CES will advise the participants to call their general practitioner (GP) or 111. If concerned about collapse, the CES will call 999. The CES will ask the participant to repeat the distress thermometer before each session. If the participants score 8 or above for 2 consecutive weeks, they will be encouraged to contact Macmillan Cancer Support helpline and/or their GP. In the case of suicidal or self-harm ideation, the CES will advise contacting Samaritans, SHOUT, GP or 111. If concerned about immediate risk, the CES will call 999. Participants who experience a marked deterioration in their nutritional state (eg, stricture, swallow, inanition and weight loss) will be directed back to their cancer care team. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 will have their exercise intervention paused for 14 days but, symptoms allowing, will be able to receive the other interventions. The exercise intervention will also be paused if anybody in their household is displaying COVID-19 symptoms. Acute events and changes in condition and/or treatment plan will be reported to the trial team. Cases of immediate physical or mental health concern will be raised with the chief investigator or senior clinician with delegated authority. All other cases will be discussed at a weekly multidisciplinary clinical team review. In case of incomplete information or ongoing investigation, it will be the responsibility of the participant to gain clinical sign-off before resuming trial activity. All adverse and series adverse events will be recorded.</p>

                  <p>A comprehensive process evaluation will enable identification of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of and participation in the SafeFit Trial. It will afford an in-depth understanding of processes, relationships and communications that helped or hindered conduct of the trial.</p>
                  <p>The process evaluation will assess acceptability of the SafeFit Trial from the perspective of participants and professionals delivering the programme as well as identifying barriers and enablers to engagement with and adherence to the programme. We will also capture data to explain how the intervention worked, who it did and did not work for and why, along with other issues with delivery of the intervention and participant receptivity. Qualitative in-depth semistructured interviews will be conducted with participants enrolled in the trial and professionals involved in the delivery of the trial. This will include n=25 participants who will be purposively sampled to include a range of age, sex, disease type, time since diagnosis and adherence to scheduled calls. Interviews will focus on the barriers and facilitators to participation in the trial and success (or not) of behaviour change. These data will provide explanatory insight into the findings of the trial.</p>
                  <p>Interviews will also be conducted with CES delivering the trial as well as administrative personnel coordinating the trial (n=15). The purpose of these interviews is to understand the barriers and facilitators to the delivery of the prescribed interventions as well as views of the usefulness of training received.</p>
                  <p>Normalisation process theory (NPT) will underpin the conceptual framework that will structure the process evaluation (ie, the interview schedules, findings and their interpretation). NPT provides an explanatory framework to better understand the routine embedding of healthcare interventions in their social contexts, in particular, <italic toggle="yes">why some processes seem to lead to a practice becoming sustained over a long term, while others do not</italic>. The starting point of NPT are the dynamics associated with the embedding of a practice, that is, what people actually do and how they work together.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p>

                  <title>Patient and public involvement (PPI)</title>
                  <p>People with cancer were consulted at the outset of this trial. We worked closely with four research partners, including individuals living with cancer (who were shielding), caring for someone with cancer and recovering from cancer. They provided suggestions of how potential participants might be reassured of the safety of the trial as well as support they might need to access the virtual intervention. They also reviewed trial questionnaires and patient facing documentation and piloted the self-referral process. Moreover, they agreed to be members of our steering group and will contribute to the oversight of the trial. In previous trials conducted by our research group, PPI representatives have been invited to speak at conferences and stakeholder events, providing powerful testimonies. We intend to continue this approach with the current trial. The research team will liaise with the PPI involvement lead in University Hospital Southampton’s Biomedical Research Centre to identify training and support needs of our research partners throughout the trial.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis plan and sample size calculation</title>
                  <p>Preliminary data suggest that approximately 62% of patients will have a ‘good’ Ppysical function score of &gt;83 at baseline, and 43% of patients will have a ‘good’ emotional function score at baseline (&gt;71) as determined by threshold for clinical importance for the EORTC-QLQ-C30.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In order to detect an 8% improvement in the proportion of patients with good physical/emotional function score with 90% power (alpha=0.05), 1050 patients will be required (allowing for 20% drop-out).</p>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise baseline demographic and clinical variables. For continuous variables, the mean and SD will be calculated for normally distributed data. If the data are not normally distributed, the median and IQR will be calculated. Categorical or binary variables will be summarised as frequency and percentage of total.</p>
                  <p>The primary endpoints are EORTC-QLQ-C30 physical and emotional function scales measured at 6 months. The McNemar test will be used to investigate whether there is a difference in the proportion of patients with good physical and emotional fFunction scores at the end of the intervention (6 months) compared with baseline. In order to account for multiple comparisons, the Holm procedure will be used to adjust p values.</p>
                  <p>Repeated measures logistic regression will be used to investigate the change over all trial visits (baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months) and to adjust for clinically prognostic factors which will include age, gender, cancer type, tumour site and systemic anticancer treatment.</p>
                  <p>Subgroup analysis will also be performed. The proportion of patients with good physical and emotional function score at 6 months (with CI) will be calculated for each subgroup and will be displayed on a forest plot, along with the p value for interaction. COVID-19 status (confirmed COVID-19, suspected COVID-19, self-isolation and none), curative versus palliative, chemo/rad versus not, surgery versus not, adherent to intervention versus not (adherence is defined as completing &gt;70% of calls with CES), tumour site, baseline quality of life (above 85 vs 85 total EORTC-QLQ-C30 score).</p>
                  <p>Analysis of secondary endpoints (including but not limited to anxiety, depression, confidence to self-manage chronic disease, physical activity and dietary behaviour change, and Duke activity status) will be performed using the appropriate statistical tests/regression models, depending on the outcome data type (ie, continuous, ordinal and binary), and taking into account the paired nature of the data (before and after intervention). This will be described in a detailed statistical analysis plan.</p>
                  <p>In the exploratory analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to investigate the relationship between change in emotional and physical function and mortality within 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier plot will be used to illustrate the survival of different patient groups.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>The SafeFit Trial provides a novel approach to deliver exercise, nutrition and psychological support to people with cancer. The virtual method of delivery allows access to this personalised and holistic support from individuals’ homes, mitigating any risk of exposure to COVID-19 as well as removing well-established barriers to in-person interventions, including travel and ability to integrate programmes within other life commitments. Underpinned by evidence-based behaviour change techniques, it aims to empower participants to establish new behaviours that will be embedded in their everyday lives for the long term. The trial is limited by the lack of comparison group. Measures of behaviour change are self-report and thus may introduce bias.</p>
