                  <p id="Par2">This is a randomised controlled trial to determine if early-targeted treatment of a large PDA with parenteral ibuprofen in extremely preterm babies improves short and long-term health and economic outcomes. Infants born between 23<sup>+0</sup> and 28<sup>+6</sup> weeks of gestation, confirmed by echocardiography as having a large PDA (with a diameter of at least 1.5 mm and unrestricted pulsatile PDA flow pattern), with parental informed consent, were randomly allocated to receive either ibuprofen or placebo within 72 h of birth. The primary outcome is a composite of death by 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age.</p>

                  <p id="Par3">Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be described by randomised group. The primary analysis will be on the modified intention to treat (ITT) population. Counts and percentages will be presented for binary and categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range will be presented for continuous variables. For binary outcomes, risk ratios and confidence intervals will be calculated using log binomial or Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models, or quantile regression models if skewed. Analyses will be adjusted for all minimisation factors where technically possible, and correlation between siblings from multiple births will be accounted for by nesting the clusters as a random effect. Both crude and adjusted effect estimates will be presented, with the primary inference based on the adjusted estimates. Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals will be used for all pre-specified outcome comparisons.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par38">This paper details the proposed presentation and analyses for the main paper(s) reporting results from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme funded multicentre randomised controlled trial of early treatment for closure of large Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) with ibuprofen in extremely preterm infants (Baby-OSCAR).</p>
              <p id="Par39">Baby-OSCAR is a randomised controlled trial to determine short- and long-term health and economic outcomes of the treatment of a large PDA in extremely preterm babies with ibuprofen within 72 h of birth. Infants who were born between 23<sup>+0</sup> and 28<sup>+6</sup> weeks of gestation, confirmed by echocardiography as having a large PDA, were randomised to receive either ibuprofen or placebo within 72 h of birth. The primary outcome is a composite of death by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, or moderate or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">This paper describes the statistical analysis plan for the short-term outcomes of the main trial, including the analysis principles, definitions of outcomes, methods for primary analysis, pre-specified subgroup analysis, and secondary analysis. The analyses for both the long-term outcomes at 2 years of age and the health economic evaluation will be detailed in separate publicly-available analysis plans.</p>
              <p id="Par41">This statistical analysis plan conforms to the published guidelines on the content for statistical analysis plans in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and was finalised prior to completion of short-term follow-up to the trial. Any deviations from this plan will be described and justified in the final report of the trial.</p>

              <title>Background information</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Rationale</title>
                <p id="Par42">This trial follows an internal pilot phase, which has been run to assess the suitability of trial procedures and likelihood of recruitment targets being achieved. The trial aimed to recruit approximately 730 infants in total (including those recruited during the internal pilot phase) from 35 UK tertiary neonatal units (and five for the internal pilot phase).</p>
                <p id="Par43">PDA is associated with a number of serious and life-threatening short and long term complications including low blood pressure (hypotension), bleeding in the lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) and brain (intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)), systemic complications such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and long term health problems such as neurodevelopmental disability and chronic respiratory problems. The persistence of PDA is associated with an 8-fold rise in neonatal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, as PDA is very common in extreme preterm babies and is associated with a prolonged need for respiratory support and hospitalisation, it places a significant financial burden on the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
                <p id="Par44">Historically, clinicians who have been concerned about the complications associated with a PDA have attempted to close PDAs utilising medical (pharmacological) or surgical treatment. Traditionally, medical treatment is instituted as prophylactic treatment (within 24 h of birth) or symptomatic treatment (usually 5−7 days after birth). Prophylactic pharmacological treatment of all preterm babies unnecessarily exposes a large proportion of babies to the potentially serious side effects of drug treatment, when their PDA would have closed spontaneously. Symptomatic treatment on the contrary delays treatment whilst waiting for symptoms to appear and could result in a loss of treatment benefit as irreversible damage may have already been done.</p>
                <p id="Par45">Moreover, the practice of a conservative approach of not treating seems to originate from uncertainty regarding the management of PDA rather than evidence favouring no intervention. This is because most studies conducted to date have involved more mature preterm babies (over 1000 g or 28 weeks of gestation) whose PDA is more likely to close spontaneously. The studies were also largely designed to assess PDA closure rates rather than clinically important outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par46">It is now suggested that large PDAs (those with a diameter of ≥ 1.5 mm) through which blood flow is pulsatile and unrestricted are less likely to close spontaneously. Targeted early treatment of large PDAs whilst asymptomatic has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of both the prophylactic and symptomatic approaches. Although clinical detection of PDA whilst asymptomatic is challenging, it can be assessed using bedside echocardiography.</p>
                <p id="Par47">Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially indomethacin and ibuprofen have been widely used for the treatment of PDA. Short-term efficacy of indomethacin and ibuprofen are equivalent in the treatment of PDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ibuprofen however appears to reduce the risk of NEC and is associated with fewer clinical gastrointestinal and renal side effects compared to indomethacin; hence it is the drug of choice for this trial. Paracetamol has also been recently reported in case studies for closure of symptomatic PDA but further research needs to be done to establish its effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par48">The aim of this trial is to examine whether the pharmacological closure of a large PDA (identified by echocardiography) in extremely preterm babies whilst asymptomatic has a clinically important impact on both short- and long-term health and economic outcomes.</p>

                <title>Objectives of the trial</title>

                  <p id="Par76">The primary outcome is defined as a composite outcome of death by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (as defined in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

                  <p id="Par77">The need for oxygen is subjective and hence oxygen dependency to differentiate mild from moderate BPD will be confirmed using an ‘oxygen reduction test’. This is based on the threshold at which the baby is able to maintain oxygen saturations ≥ 91% whilst breathing in air or at a given minimum FiO<sub>2</sub>. Babies unable to maintain oxygen saturations ≥ 91% in room air will be considered to be oxygen dependent and classed as moderate BPD (oxygen requirements 22–29% or 0.01–1.0 L/min by low flow nasal cannula). Those babies who can be weaned to room air and stable will be categorised as having mild BPD. This test will only apply to those babies whose oxygen requirements are &lt; 0.3 or low flow oxygen &lt; 1.1 L/min, and who have not received any additional respiratory support in the previous 24 h. Babies outside of this will not be tested, but their oxygen requirements will be captured on the relevant case report form.

                <title>Sample size and power</title>
                <p id="Par112">Evidence from the TIPP trial suggests that the risk of death or BPD in extremely low birth weight babies at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age allocated placebo is 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48% to 56%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, this trial investigated the effect of prophylactic treatment and included all babies weighing 500−999 g. More recent information using data derived from the latest report of Neonatal Survey Database from the Trent region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] provides an approximate rate of death or BPD by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age of 53% for all babies admitted to the neonatal unit. These babies would have been treated according to clinical judgement and therefore a proportion of them would have been treated with ibuprofen. Given that the risk of death or BPD in babies with a large PDA is inherently higher, it is estimated that the risk in this group is 60%.</p>
                <p id="Par113">Su et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] compared ibuprofen to indomethacin in babies of ≤ 28 weeks of gestation having a PDA who were less than 24 h old. The combined outcome of death within 30 days or BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age was observed to be 42% (95% CI 29% to 55%).</p>
                <p id="Par114">It is therefore expected, given that babies will be enrolled up to 72 h after birth, that the treatment group incidence of death/BPD at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age will be approximately 48% in the intervention arm. This would imply an absolute risk reduction of 12% (60% to 48%) in the primary outcome of the trial for babies randomised to treatment compared to placebo, which is considered a clinically important difference.</p>
                <p id="Par115">Some babies will require open-label treatment in either the treatment or placebo arm. As open-label treatment should be limited to symptomatic babies meeting only defined criteria, it is considered to have minimal or no effect on the primary outcome. Thus, adjustment of the sample size for open-label treatment is not considered necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par116">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts a sample size curve for the primary outcome of the trial of death or BPD by 36 weeks of postmenstrual age, assuming 90% power, a two-sided 5% significance level and a 60% control group event rate for the primary outcome.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Sample size per arm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2021_5324_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par117">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarises this information and allows for 1% loss to follow-up in the primary outcome. Minimal loss to follow-up is expected for the primary outcome since it is a short-term outcome and recorded whilst the baby is in hospital.
<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sample size required by event rates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Control group event rate</th><th>Active Rx group event rate</th><th>Absolute risk reduction</th><th>Relative risk reduction</th><th>Approximate total sample size required</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>60%</td><td>47%</td><td>13%</td><td>22%</td><td>620</td></tr><tr><td><bold>60%</bold></td><td><bold>48%</bold></td><td><bold>12%</bold></td><td><bold>20%</bold></td><td><bold>730</bold></td></tr><tr><td>60%</td><td>49%</td><td>11%</td><td>18%</td><td>870</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>
                <p id="Par118">Thus a sample size of approximately 730 babies in total (365 per arm) would be required to detect an absolute risk reduction of 12% (power 90%, 2-sided significance level of 5%) from a control group event rate of 60% to a treatment group event rate of 48%, assuming 1% lost to follow-up.</p>
                <p id="Par119">n multiple births, the babies are genetically either identical or very similar, so their outcomes are likely to be correlated. However, since multiples will be randomised independently, the loss of precision from multiples randomised to the same arm will be offset by the gain in precision from multiples randomised to the opposite arm, hence there will be a negligible impact on power.</p>

                <title>Interim analyses and stopping rules</title>
                <p id="Par140">A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent of the applicants and of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), will review the progress of the trial at least annually and provide advice on the conduct of the trial to the TSC and (via the TSC) to the HTA. The committee will periodically review trial progress and outcomes as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. death, severe IVH).</p>
                <p id="Par141">Interim analyses will be supplied, in strict confidence, to the DMC, as frequently as the Chair requests. The DMC will aim to meet in person at least annually, or more often as appropriate. At the request of the DMC, interim meetings, in person or by teleconference, will be organised. Major trial issues may need to be dealt with between meetings, by phone or by email.</p>
                <p id="Par142">The DMC will be blinded to treatment allocations. The trial statistician will bring a sealed envelope containing the treatment allocations (provided by Head of Trials Programming) that can be opened to break the blind, if considered necessary.</p>
                <p id="Par143">In the light of interim data and other evidence from relevant studies, the DMC will inform the TSC if, in its view, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt that the data indicate that the trial should be terminated. A decision to inform the TSC of such a finding will in part be based on statistical considerations. Appropriate proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified precisely. A difference of at least 3 standard errors in the interim analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting or modifying the study prematurely.</p>

Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression models, with mean differences and confidence intervals presented for approximately normally distributed outcomes. Skewed continuous outcomes will be analysed using quantile regression models, with median differences and confidence intervals presented. Time-to-event outcomes will be analysed using Cox regression and hazard ratios with confidence intervals will be presented.</p>
              <p id="Par234">Analyses will be adjusted for all minimisation factors where technically possible. Centre will be treated as a random effect in the models, and all other factors as fixed effects, including multiple births. Correlation between siblings from multiple births will be accounted for in the adjusted model by nesting ‘multiple’ cluster as a random effect within centre. All factors will be fitted as fixed effects in quantile regression, as random effects cannot be modelled using these methods of analysis. Both crude and adjusted effect estimates will be presented, but the primary inference will be based on the adjusted estimates.</p>
