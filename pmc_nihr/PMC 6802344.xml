                  <p id="Par1">Patients with functional motor disorder (FMD) experience persistent and disabling neurological symptoms such as weakness, tremor, dystonia and disordered gait.

Here we present the protocol of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of a specialist physiotherapy programme for FMD.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par19">Functional motor disorder (FMD) can be defined as neurological symptoms affecting movement that are caused by loss of control or agency over movement, rather than a structural disease process. FMD is the motor-dominant variant of functional neurological disorder (also known as conversion disorder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Typical presentations of FMD include weakness, tremor, jerks, dystonia, gait disorder, or a combination of these symptoms. Most patients also experience non-motor functional neurological symptoms, such as sensory disturbance, memory complaints, pain, fatigue or dissociative seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is also common for patients with FMD to have comorbid health problems such as neurological disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. FMD is often described as a condition at the interface between neurology and psychiatry.</p>
              <p id="Par20">The incidence of FMD is reported to be in the range of 4 to 12 per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], making it similar in incidence to multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. The long-term outcome is variable but often poor. A systematic review of long term follow up studies found that approximately 40% of patients were the same or worse at an average of 7 years and the majority of patients remained symptomatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, little is known about the outcome of patients who receive timely specialist interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par21">In recent years, specialist physiotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment for FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A number of cohort studies report positive results from physical interventions that are based on a biopsychosocial understanding of FMD and encompass psychosocial therapeutic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The first controlled trial of physical-based rehabilitation for FMD, published in 2014, compared an intervention group with patients waiting for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this study 60 patients with a functional gait disorder were randomised to a 3-week inpatient physical rehabilitation programme or a 4-week waiting list. Group comparisons demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with treatment across a range of physical and quality of life outcome measures. The mean differences immediately after the intervention were 6.9 units in the Functional Mobility Scale (15 point range), 8.4 Functional Independence Scale units (108 point range), and 11.7 SF12 Physical Domain units (maximum score 100). Post intervention improvement was sustained at 12 months follow up, except for the SF12 Mental Health domain which showed an immediate treatment effect of 6.7 units (100 point range) but was no longer statistically different from baseline scores at 12 months.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Our group has recently completed a single centre, randomised feasibility trial of specialist physiotherapy for FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The intervention was based on a consensus recommendation paper describing physiotherapy for FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and had been previously tested in a small prospective cohort study (<italic>n</italic> = 47) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This intervention was developed using a novel “movement retraining” model, harnessing and making explicit the internal inconsistencies seen in FMD which are used to make the diagnosis. For instance, an inability to carry out volitional movements (e.g. active ankle dorsiflexion) with retained ability to carry out movements of the same muscle groups in a different context (e.g. retained ability to activate dorsiflexor muscles by standing on their heels). The feasibility trial randomised 60 patients to either our specific specialised physiotherapy protocol for FMD or a treatment as usual control (consisting of referral to standard community neuro-physiotherapy). Participants were followed up at 6 months. The intervention was considered unsuitable for people whose primary problem (above motor symptoms) was pain, fatigue or dissociative seizures, and such patients were excluded from the study. We also excluded people who had psychiatric comorbidity (such as anxiety or depression) that was deemed to require assessment and treatment before starting physiotherapy. 32% of patients with FMD seen in the recruiting neurology clinics met the inclusion criteria. 90% of this group consented to participate in the trial and only 5% were lost to follow up. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable.</p>
              <p id="Par23">As part of the feasibility trial we tested a range of physical, mental health and quality of life outcome measures. At 6 month follow up, the intervention group scored higher on measures of physical function but there were no differences in scores of mental health. The Short Form 36 (SF36) Physical Function domain showed a mean difference between groups of 19.8 (95% CI 10.2, 29.5, Cohen’s d = 0.7), after adjusting for baseline scores. In a patient-rated 5-point Likert scale of impression of change, 72% of the intervention group rated their symptoms as improved at 6 months, compared to 18% in the control group. These promising results highlight the importance of progressing this research and conducting an adequately powered randomised trial.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In summary, there are a number of small studies showing promise that specialist physiotherapy is effective for people with FMD, however, there is a lack of evidence from adequately-powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Here we report the protocol for a RCT of specialist physiotherapy for functional motor disorder (Physio4FMD). In work leading up to this research, we developed consensus recommendations for physiotherapy treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The trial intervention was based on these recommendations and further developed during the course of our clinical practice and clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In line with MRC guidelines for evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we have completed proof of principle in a feasibility trial, obtaining preliminary evidence for efficacy in a small sample. The next stage is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness, as well as generalisability of the intervention in a pragmatic multicentre RCT.</p>

The trial will compare a specialist physiotherapy protocol with treatment as usual, which is defined in the trial as a referral to a community physiotherapy service suitable for people with neurological symptoms. Participants are randomised with a 1:1 ratio to either treatment arm and will be assessed at baseline (pre-randomisation), 6 and 12 months post-randomisation.

Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be informed about the study by the neurologist and provided with a patient information sheet. The neurologist will then seek agreement from the patient to be contacted by a member of the research team. Those willing to take part in the trial will be invited to an appointment to provide informed consent and complete baseline assessments before being randomised to their treatment allocation.</p>

                <p id="Par60">* The decision to exclude a patient due to psychiatric comorbidity is a clinical decision made by the neurologist, rather than a decision based on a screening tool or questionnaire. We believe that no single screening tool or questionnaire would serve this purpose. Additionally, there is insufficient data on which to base cut-off scores to exclude patients on any particular questionnaire.</p>
                <p id="Par61">** Pain, fatigue and dissociative seizures are not absolute exclusions. Based on previous research we expect most participants to experience persistent pain and fatigue to various degrees. The participant is only excluded if these symptoms are judged to be likely to prevent them from engaging with the intervention.</p>

                  <title>Specialist physiotherapy (intervention group)</title>
                  <p id="Par62">Participants in this group will receive a protocolised, specialist physiotherapy programme that has been designed based on a specific and novel biopsychosocial understanding of FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This understanding emphasises the role of self-focused attention in driving symptoms and this is addressed as part of the intervention by (i) helping the patient to understand the role of attention and; (ii) movement retraining with an external focus of attention (implicit motor learning). These are important ways in which the intervention differs from typical neurorehabilitation, which usually involves explicit motor learning strategies and exercises that encourage attention to be directed towards movement and sensations. See Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for a description of the intervention following the TIDIER framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The intervention is also based on published consensus recommendations for physiotherapy treatment of FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The key elements of the intervention are (i) symptom education; (ii) movement retraining with redirection of the patient’s focus of attention; and (iii) developing a long term symptom management plan. The intervention is delivered over 9 sessions within a 3-week period, plus a 3-month follow up session. Two sessions may be scheduled in 1 day if separated by a break. Flexibility is allowed in the arrangement of sessions over the 3 weeks to accommodate other commitments of the patient and physiotherapist.

Name</td><td>Provide the name or a phrase that describes the intervention.</td></tr><tr><td>Physio4FMD: Specialist physiotherapy for functional neurological disorder.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">2. Why</td><td>Describe the rationale, theory, or goal of the elements essential to the intervention.</td></tr><tr><td><p>The rationale for the Physio4FMD treatment is primarily based on a particular aetiological model for FMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The model highlights two key mechanisms that drive functional motor symptoms. These are:</p><p> 1. Functional motor symptoms require the patient’s <underline>attention, at a level without voluntary control,</underline> to be directed towards their body in order to manifest. When the patient’s attention is distracted, the movement disorder disappears or dampens.</p><p> 2. The patient has an <underline>expectation, at a level without voluntary control,</underline> that their movement will be abnormal; this expectation is associated with a particular illness belief (e.g. my legs are paralysed). Expectations of abnormal movement influence motor output with symptoms arising as a ‘habit’ that the nervous system has got in to.</p><p>The Physio4FMD intervention addresses attention-related movement problems by retraining activity (movement) while redirecting the patient’s focus of motor attention. Altered expectations and illness beliefs are addressed through education, demonstrating to the patient that they can move normally and helping the patient to develop strategies that normalises their movement during every day activities.</p><p>The essential elements of the intervention are:</p><p> 1. Prior to physiotherapy, the participant receives a diagnosis of FMD by a neurologist. The neurologist gives a thorough explanation of FMD and how the diagnosis was made positively based on clinical features, and not as a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p> 2. Education about FMD, following which the participant and physiotherapist collaboratively devise a formulation to theorise how the patient developed their movement problem using the aetiological model as a framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p> 3. Education about common problems associated with FMD (persistent pain, fatigue and memory/concentration problems).</p><p> 4. Movement and posture retraining, with the participant’s focus of attention directed away from their body (areas addressed include sitting postures, sit to stand, walking, getting on and off the floor, stairs, upper limb problems, and use of walking aids).</p><p> 5. Developing a self-management plan (which includes understanding medication, addressing boom-bust patterns of activity, how to incorporate movement strategies into daily routine, self-management goals, and managing symptom exacerbations and relapses).</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">3. What: Materials</td><td>Describe any physical or informational materials used in the intervention, including those provided to participants or used in intervention delivery or in training of intervention providers. Provide information on where the materials can be accessed (such as online appendix, URL).</td></tr><tr><td><p><underline>Information for Neurologists, document</underline>: Each trial neurologist will receive a document summarising their role in the trial, which includes an explanation of how to apply the eligibility criteria, how to explain FMD to patients, how to discuss the trial with potential participants, and requirements for follow up.</p><p><underline>Patient Workbook</underline>: Each intervention participant is given a workbook, which guides the intervention. The workbook is completed by both the participant and the physiotherapist during treatment. Key sections of the workbook are: (i) understanding the diagnosis; (ii) neuroanatomy and physiology; (iii) pages for participants to reflection on sessions; (iv) analysis and exploration of movement; (v) movement retraining; (vi) understanding problems associated with FMD (pain, fatigue and memory problems); and (vii) self-management plan. Amongst other goals, the workbook helps to standardise the intervention.</p><p><underline>Physiotherapy Intervention Manual</underline>: Each physiotherapist providing the trial intervention will receive an intervention manual that complements the Physio4FMD training programme.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4. What: Procedures</td><td>Describe each of the procedures, activities and/or processes used in the intervention, including any enabling or support activities.</td></tr><tr><td><p><underline>Neurology</underline>: Prior to enrolling in the trial, participants in both groups are seen by one of the study neurologists. The diagnosis of FMD is made and explained to the patient following a standardized explanation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Participants in both arms of the trial will be followed up by their neurologist at least once within 12 months of their initial neurology consultation.</p><p><underline>Physiotherapy – Education</underline>: Participants receive a standardised explanation of FMD using the workbook as a guide. This is followed by an individualised formulation, where the participant and physiotherapist collaboratively devise a theoretical explanation for how the person came to develop FMD, using a symptom model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The formulation seeks to determine relevant risk factors, triggers, initial symptoms, examples of attention affecting movement, adaptive coping strategies, secondary changes, and social factors. Education includes information about some common problems associated with FMD (pain, fatigue, and memory/concentration).</p><p><underline>Physiotherapy – Movement Retraining</underline><bold>:</bold> Movement retraining generally follows a sequential motor learning approach, building up desired movement patterns starting from elementary, symptom free components of movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Problematic movement patterns and tasks are identified in the initial assessment; only those relevant to individual are retrained. The workbook prompts exploration and practice of 7 key tasks (i) sitting postures, (ii) sit to stand, (iii) standing and walking, (iv) arm and hand problems, (v) use of walking aids, (vi) getting on and off the floor, and (vii) using stairs.</p><p>Movement retraining is tailored to the individual, but should adhere to the key principle of employing strategies that redirect the patient’s focus of motor attention. In practice this is achieved by:</p><p> • Asking the patient to focus on the goal of the task rather than the mechanics of movement</p><p> • Practice movements in front of a mirror (the patient focus of attention is redirected externally to their reflection)</p><p> • Redirecting the patient’s focus to an another part of their body or a specific component of the movement</p><p>Specific exercises and activities to retrain movement that conform to the above principles are suggested in the intervention manual and have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If available, the physiotherapist may choose to use the following standard physiotherapy adjuncts: electrical muscle stimulation, treadmill, other exercise equipment.</p><p><underline>Physiotherapy – Personal Reflections</underline>: At the end of each physiotherapy session, the participant is encouraged to write a reflection in their workbook, addressing several prompts. The subsequent session starts by reviewing the reflection of the previous session and discussing any questions or issues that arise. After which, a plan is made for the current session.</p><p><underline>Physiotherapy – Self-Management</underline>: To conclude treatment, a personalised self-management plan is developed, which usually includes: (i) a summary of useful strategies that help to normalise movement; (ii) activity plans to address boom and bust patterns and how to progress activity; (iii) future goals; and (iv) what to do on difficult days and during periods of symptom exacerbation.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5. Who provided</td><td>For each category of intervention provider, describe their expertise, background and any specific training given.</td></tr><tr><td><p><underline>Neurologists</underline>: All neurologists involved in the trial will be employed at a consultant level at one of the trial sites. Only neurologists with a clinical interest and experience in treating patients with FMD will be invited to participate. They will receive training from one of the research neurologists (ME or JS) in person or by telephone, lasting 30–60 min. The training topics are listed in item 3 above. This information will be supplemented with written information.</p><p><underline>Physiotherapists</underline>: The intervention physiotherapists will have at least 2 years’ experience working in the field of neurological physiotherapy. Each will undergo 1 week full time training, delivered by the research physiotherapists (GN and KH). Competency will be assessed according to a checklist that ensures the physiotherapist has demonstrated an understanding or proficiency in delivering the key ingredients of the intervention.

                  <p id="Par63">The intervention is guided by a workbook that is completed by both the patient and physiotherapist during sessions and the patient is encouraged to write a reflection at the end of each day. The intervention starts by taking a full history from the patient and completing a physical assessment. This is followed by education about FMD according to a specific biopsychosocial aetiological model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The patient and physiotherapist then collaboratively devise a formulation to theorise how the patient developed their movement problem using the biopsychosocial model as a framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It takes into account risk factors, triggering events, psychological factors (such as panic at onset), self-focused attention disrupting normal movement, and secondary problems (such as unhelpful reinforcement of symptomatic movement patterns). Movement retraining mostly occurs within the context of tasks such as standing up, sitting down, walking, drinking from a cup, etc. It generally follows a sequential motor learning approach, where elementary symptom-free components of movement are established and then built upon in successive stages to reshape normal movement patterns. Strategies that normalise movement (for example, redirecting the patient’s focus of motor attention away from the body) are incorporated into movement retraining. Examples of such strategies have been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Movement retraining is practised and progressed over the remaining sessions, interspersed with information about managing pain, fatigue and concentration problems, if they are relevant to the individual. A long-term self-management plan is completed in the workbook in the final sessions. The 3 month follow up session is an opportunity to review and update the self-management plan, as well as to provide encouragement and reassurance.</p>
                  <p id="Par64">The physiotherapists delivering the trial-intervention will have at least 2 years’ experience working in neurorehabilitation. They will receive a manual describing the intervention and will undergo a comprehensive training programme delivered over 5 consecutive days. They will also receive a supervisory phone call from an experienced member of the trial team for each participant treated in the trial, which aims to provide clinical support, as well as ensuring fidelity with the trial intervention.</p>

                  <p id="Par65">The control arm of the trial is “treatment as usual”, which, for the purposes of this trial, is a referral to a community physiotherapy service appropriate for patients with neurological symptoms. The referral letter to physiotherapy will come from the diagnosing neurologist. It will state the diagnosis and that the patient may benefit from physiotherapy treatment. The referral letter will be accompanied by a copy of the patient’s neurology consultation letter.</p>
                  <p id="Par66">We will monitor the content of the control physiotherapy arm via participant report in a telephone survey. There are no formal evidence-based guidelines for physiotherapy for FMD, therefore the treatment received by the control participants will be variable. Based on the preceding feasibility trial we expect that most physiotherapists will provide a combination of gait retraining, stair practice, balance, non-specific cardiovascular exercise, specific strengthening exercises, stretching, and provision of walking aids or splints. The frequency and number of physiotherapy sessions provided by community therapy services will differ between centres, according to local policies. In addition, some trial participants may also be offered treatment from occupational therapy and/or clinical psychology, although in our feasibility trial we found that this was rare. Additional treatments such as these will be recorded at the 6 month and 12 month data collection (via the patient self-complete Client Service Receipt Inventory).</p>
                  <p id="Par67">We anticipate that, in general, the intervention will differ from the control treatment in the following ways: (i) greater emphasis on education using a specific aetiological model; (ii) movement retraining will focus on redirecting attention away from the movement; (iii) greater emphasis on self-management; (iv) greater number of sessions; (v) higher intensity or frequency of sessions; (vi) use of FMD specific written materials (i.e. workbook); (vii) acknowledging and addressing coexisting problems (i.e. pain, fatigue, and concentration). We will examine these assumptions in a post-treatment telephone survey of participants from both groups.</p>

The calculation used the ANCOVA method with one pre and one post randomisation measurement, assuming a standard deviation of 22, which gave an estimated sample size of 75/group. The sample size was inflated to account for therapist effect (clustering) in the intervention arm, assuming eight therapists. We assumed the average number of participants treated by physiotherapists delivering the trial intervention (cluster size) will be 9 after 20% drop out. The resulting inflation factor was 1.4, which we applied to both groups to give equal group sizes of 105/group. The sample size was then inflated by a factor of 1.25 to account for a 20% dropout rate.</p>

              <p id="Par90">To our knowledge, this will be the first adequately powered, parallel group design RCT of physiotherapy or physical rehabilitation for FMD. The trial compares a protocolised specialist physiotherapy intervention with treatment as usual. The primary outcome is physical disability at 12 months post randomisation, as measured by the SF36 Physical Function domain. We will also assess a range of secondary outcomes and complete a comprehensive health economic analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par91">We support the choice of our primary outcome because the SF36 Physical Function domain has been found to be a valid measure of physical and mobility related disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. While it is a self-report measure, it asks respondents to report limitations on their ability to carry out particular activities rather than the level of distress associated with these. The physical functions sampled include vigorous activities (such as participating in strenuous sports); moderate activities (such as pushing a vacuum cleaner); carrying groceries; climbing stairs; walking 100 yards/several hundred yards/more than a mile; and bathing or dressing. Poor Physical Function domain scores have been found to be related to low scores of physical performance tests such as low grip strength and longer Timed Up and Go test scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par92">Our trial has a pragmatic design, in that it is conducted and contained within the real-world limitations of NHS pathways. The results of pragmatically-designed trials are considered to have greater generalisability than research conducted under highly controlled ideal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The pragmatic nature of our trial has implications that are both strengths and limitations of the trial design. One limitation of our pragmatic design is the ‘treatment as usual’ control condition. In the NHS there are no formal evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of FMD; therefore, we expect large variations in the number of sessions and the content of physiotherapy treatment received by control participants. We will monitor the provision of control physiotherapy (by participant report), and in the post hoc analysis we will explore the impact of the number of sessions received by control participants on treatment outcome. We considered trying to standardise the control intervention; however, this was not possible within our budgetary constraints.</p>
              <p id="Par93">The pragmatic nature of our trial gives rise to a number of design strengths. We have a relatively relaxed eligibility criteria that reflects the heterogeneity of people with FMD. Although we expect that only 25–30% of patients with FMD are suitable for a physiotherapy-led intervention (and will therefore meet our eligibility criteria), we have no restrictions on phenotype, age or symptom duration. The intervention is delivered within current NHS services by clinicians who would normally be involved with this patient group. Thus our outcomes should be considered generalisable.</p>
              <p id="Par94">The outcome measures are largely patient-reported subjective outcomes (with the exception of the HES data (Hospital Episode Statistics, linked to individuals), which will be reported for each participant and will be used to compare episodes of NHS care pre- and post-treatment). Objective measurement of symptoms and disability in FMD is a complex issue. Snapshot tests (such as dynamometry, gait speed, and movement disorder severity) have questionable reliability and validity as physical examination, is by definition, internally inconsistent in patients with FMDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This is related to the mechanistic role of self-directed attention in driving the motor symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Arguably, subjective report could therefore be considered a more valid measure of disability and distress in FMD. Reliance on patient reported outcomes allows for less obtrusive remote assessments (via web-based forms and post), which in turn may limit the introduction of artificial aspects to outcome measurement (e.g. the desire to please the clinician) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To support the battery of patient reported outcomes, we will report and analyse NHS Digital data on episodes of care. This non-patient reported and objective outcome will be considered a proxy measure of improvement.</p>
              <p id="Par95">If the trial intervention proves to be clinically and cost effective, there will be a strong argument in support of commissioning specialist services for people with FMD, and rolling out the intervention across the NHS. A positive result should also have an international impact, providing an impetus for the development of FMD services beyond the UK. Although this is a trial of neurology and physiotherapy treatment, the data gathered on the usefulness of the trial intervention may well have important implications for the clinical practice of occupational therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists working with people with functional neurological disorder.</p>
