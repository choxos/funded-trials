                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>The risk of death from spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage is increased for people taking antiplatelet drugs. We aimed to assess the feasibility of randomising patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage to desmopressin or placebo to reduce the antiplatelet drug effect.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>DASH was a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre feasibility trial. Patients were recruited from ten acute stroke centres in the UK and were eligible if they had an intracerebral haemorrhage with stroke symptom onset within 24 h of randomisation, were aged 18 years or older, and were taking an antiplatelet drug. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a single dose of intravenous desmopressin 20 μg or matching placebo. Treatment allocation was concealed from all staff and patients involved in the trial. The primary outcome was feasibility, which was measured as the number of eligible patients randomised and the proportion of eligible patients approached, and analysis was by intention to treat. The trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN (reference ISRCTN67038373), and it is closed to recruitment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022, 1380 potential participants were screened for eligibility. 176 (13%) participants were potentially eligible, of whom 57 (32%) were approached, and 54 (31%) consented and were subsequently recruited and randomly assigned to receive desmopressin (n=27) or placebo (n=27). The main reason for eligible patients not being recruited was the patient arriving out of hours (74 [61%] of 122 participants). The recruitment rate increased after the enrolment period was extended from 12 h to 24 h, but it was then impaired due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 54 participants included in the analysis (mean age 76·4 years [SD 11·3]), most were male (36 [67%]) and White (50 [93%]). 53 (98%) of 54 participants received all of their allocated treatment (one participant assigned desmopressin only received part of the infusion). No participants were lost to follow-up or withdrew from the trial. Death or dependency on others for daily activities at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;4) occurred in six (22%) of 27 participants in the desmopressin group and ten (37%) of 27 participants in the placebo group. Serious adverse events occurred in 12 (44%) participants in the desmopressin group and 13 (48%) participants in the placebo group. The most common adverse events were expansion of the haemorrhagic stroke (four [15%] of 27 participants in the desmopressin group and six [22%] of 27 participants in the placebo group) and pneumonia (one [4%] of 27 participants in the desmopressin group and six [22%] of 27 participants in the placebo group).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Our results show it is feasible to randomise patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage who are taking antiplatelet drugs to desmopressin or placebo. Our findings support the need for a definitive trial to determine if desmopressin improves outcomes in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage on antiplatelet drug therapy.</p>

              <p id="para10">In 2019, approximately 3 million deaths were due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage worldwide.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Two-thirds of survivors are left dependent on others.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Approximately a quarter of patients are taking antiplatelet drugs at the time of intracerebral haemorrhage in high-income countries, and this proportion is increasing.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Prestroke antiplatelet drug use is associated with a 27% relative increase in 1-month case fatality, compared with patients who do not use antithrombotic drugs.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> There is no proven effective drug treatment for intracerebral haemorrhage, although blood pressure lowering might improve outcomes.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> This topic area has been highly prioritised by patient and public involvement groups.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para20">Desmopressin is a licensed prohaemostatic drug that is commonly used in the treatment of inherited bleeding disorders. In other settings, such as for patients on antiplatelet drugs undergoing cardiac surgery, use of desmopressin can reduce the risk of bleeding for patients taking antiplatelet drugs.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage is closely related to haematoma expansion, which is a predictor of poor prognosis and is associated with death and disability.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Use of antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, time from onset of symptoms to baseline imaging, and intracerebral haematoma volume on baseline imaging are independent predictors of haematoma expansion.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p>

                    <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para50">We searched MEDLINE Ovid (from database inception) and Embase Ovid (from database inception) on Feb 10, 2023, combining search terms for desmopressin, intracerebral haemorrhage, and randomised controlled trials. No language restrictions were applied. Desmopressin reduces bleeding in some settings (eg, patients taking antiplatelet drugs undergoing cardiac surgery) and has a well established role in inherited coagulopathies. No randomised trials have been completed that compared desmopressin with placebo for reversing antiplatelet drug effects in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.</p>
                  <p id="para60">
                    <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para70">DASH was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of performing a large randomised trial to assess efficacy of desmopressin for spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage in patients exposed to antiplatelet drugs. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial comparing desmopressin with placebo in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage who are taking antiplatelet drugs. No safety concerns or clinically relevant hyponatraemia occurred.</p>
                  <p id="para80">
                    <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
                  </p>
                  <p id="para90">Given sufficient recruiting centres and pragmatic trial methodology, it should be feasible to conduct a definitive trial to determine if desmopressin improves outcome in patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with intracerebral haemorrhage. Important considerations for a definitive trial are allowing 24 h after stroke symptoms onset for recruitment, facilitating recruitment out of hours, and using simplified temperature monitoring for desmopressin.</p>
                </boxed-text>
              </p>
              <p id="para100">Recommendations of international guidelines for the management of intracerebral haemorrhage in people taking antiplatelets are conflicting.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> We hypothesised that desmopressin might reduce bleeding and improve outcomes in people with intracerebral haemorrhage. To our knowledge, no randomised trials comparing desmopressin with placebo have been conducted in people with intracerebral haemorrhage. Before embarking on a definitive randomised controlled trial, to determine the effectiveness of desmopressin, we conducted a feasibility trial to test the methods for a full trial, to understand whether participants could be recruited to such a trial and, if so, the rate of recruitment. The primary objective was to assess the feasibility of randomising, administering the intervention, and completing follow-up for patients treated with desmopressin or placebo, to inform a definitive trial.</p>

              <sec id="cesec30">
                <title>Study design and participants</title>
                <p id="para110">DASH was a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre feasibility trial. Participants were enrolled by investigators from emergency departments or acute stroke units at ten hospitals in the UK. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethics approval was obtained from the East Midlands–Nottingham 2 research ethics committee (18/EM/0184). The DASH trial protocol has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Four substantial amendments were planned by the trial management committee, reviewed and supported by the trial steering committee, and approved by the funder and research ethics committee: SA/01/19 (addition of day 90 postal follow-up form); SA/02/19 (change of site principal investigator); SA/03/19 (increase in recruitment time window from 12 h to 24 h after stroke, update to Investigational Medicinal Products storage guidelines, and removal of day 90 questions on postal follow-up questionnaire regarding low sodium and fluid overload); and SA/04/21 (temporary change of chief investigator; closure of one recruiting centre). Ten sites were open to recruitment before the pandemic and before all research was suspended. The study was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic from March 26, 2020, to June 29, 2020, after which centres reopened according to capacity at sites. One site did not reopen. Even though the other nine sites reopened on June 2, 2020, they had reduced capacity and recruitment rates never reached pre-pandemic levels. To help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on recruitment, the trial end date was extended from: Dec 31, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021 (costed extension), and Dec 31, 2021, to June 30, 2022 (no-cost extension).</p>
                <p id="para120">Patients were included in the trial if they met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were that the patient was an adult (aged ≥18 years), with intracerebral haemorrhage confirmed on brain CT, and prescribed and thought to be taking a daily oral antiplatelet drug in the preceding 7 days (ie, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors). In the initial version of the protocol, patients were eligible if they could undergo randomisation within 12 h of symptom onset. After a substantial amendment (SA/03/19 on Nov 22, 2019) due to slow enrolment, participants could be recruited if they could undergo randomisation within 24 h from onset of symptoms. Exclusion criteria were known secondary causes of intracerebral haemorrhage, patients at risk of fluid retention, systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, known drug-eluting stent in previous 3 months, allergy to desmopressin, pregnant or breastfeeding, life expectancy of less than 4 h or planned for palliative care only, Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 5, and modified Rankin Scale score of more than 4.</p>
                <p id="para130">Patients with the capacity to give informed written consent were approached directly; otherwise, a relative or close friend was approached for consent. If a relative or friend could not be identified, a professional representative (ie, doctor) not associated with the trial could be approached for proxy consent. Patients were approached again for consent when they regained capacity. This procedure is in accordance with emergency consent approvals.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para140">Participants were randomised centrally to receive either desmopressin or placebo (1:1), with a 5% random flip, using a computer-generated randomisation sequence in real time. Treatment allocation was concealed from all staff and participants in the trial. Randomisation involved minimisation on key prognostic risk factors: age (≥70 years); sex (male); time since onset (≥3 h); systolic blood pressure (≥170 mm Hg); and presence (or no information on presence or absence) of intraventricular haemorrhage. Randomisation allocated a number corresponding to a treatment pack and the participant received treatment from the allocated numbered pack. It was considered not possible to mask personnel preparing the injection for administration to the treatment allocation because the ampoules of active and placebo injections were different and carried the manufacturer's identifying information. Clinicians, patients, and outcome assessors (ie, clinical, radiological, and haematological assessors) were blinded to treatment allocation.</p>

              <sec id="cesec50">
                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para150">Participants allocated desmopressin received a 20 μg dose intravenously. Desmopressin (Ferring Pharmaceuticals, West Drayton, UK) was supplied in 1 mL glass ampoules at a concentration of 4 μg/mL; five ampoules were added to 50 mL sodium chloride 0·9%, and the infusion was done for 20 min. Participants allocated placebo received sodium chloride 0·9% intravenously. The placebo was prepared by adding three 2 mL ampoules of sodium chloride 0·9% to 50 mL sodium chloride 0·9%, and the infusion was done for 20 min. In clinical trials of desmopressin for intracerebral haemorrhage, a dose of up to 0·4 μg/kg was used.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The desmopressin dose was capped at 20 μg. Capping the dose has similar efficacy to using a weight-adjusted dose for patients with inherited bleeding disorders,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and we considered there would be a lower risk of errors in the emergency setting using a standard dose. All patients received usual standard care, including venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression devices, blood pressure lowering therapy, and neurosurgery if appropriate.</p>
                <p id="para160">According to the summary of product characteristics,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> desmopressin should be stored at 2–8°C. We developed a pharmacy manual such that desmopressin or placebo was quarantined in the event the storage temperature was less than 2°C or higher than 8°C for 28 days cumulatively (as per stability data) or any temperature higher than 25°C. We summarised temperature excursions, including total number of temperature excursions, number of desmopressin or placebo packs that were exposed, quarantined, or destroyed, and the number of participants receiving desmopressin or placebo who had been exposed to temperature excursion. Although not listed as a specific outcome in the protocol, the incidence of temperature excursions contributes to the overall assessment of feasibility and is presented.</p>
                <p id="para170">Sites were required to complete screening logs for consecutive patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Participants’ age, sex, medical history, antiplatelet drug use, intracerebral haemorrhage location, intraventricular haemorrhage, and modified Rankin scale score were obtained at baseline by local investigators. Participants were reviewed again on day 2, at hospital discharge, and on day 90 to gather information on interventions, adverse events, discharge date, and discharge destination (eg, patient's own home or to nursing home care).</p>
                <p id="para180">At day 90, central assessors trained in administering the appropriate questionnaires, and who were masked to treatment allocation, followed up each participant by telephone. Questionnaires administered were the Barthel index (to measure disability; 0–100, with 0 indicating severe disability and 100 indicting no disability), the modified Rankin scale (to measure functional independence; 0–6, with 0 indicating no disability through to 6 indicating death), the EuroQol-5D health state utility and visual analogue scale (to measure quality of life), the telephone interview for cognitive status-modified (to assess cognition), and the Zung depression scale (to assess mood). Serious adverse events were also reported by telephone up to day 90 (and could be reported at any time).</p>
                <p id="para190">Brain imaging (CT head scan) was performed before randomisation and 24 h after administration of the allocated treatment to measure haematoma volume. Haematoma volume was measured centrally, by a trained assessor who was masked to treatment allocation, using semi-automated segmentation. Haematoma expansion was defined as an absolute increase in haematoma volume of greater than 6 mL or relative growth of greater than 33%.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p>
                <p id="para200">To assess baseline platelet function, platelets were stimulated with arachidonic acid or adenosine diphosphate. Platelet cell surface P-selectin expression was then measured using a standardised assay (Platelet Solutions, Nottingham, UK) to assess retrospectively whether patients were taking antiplatelet drugs, as previously described (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 5</xref>).<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF Ag Kit, Siemens, Marburg, Germany), Von Willebrand factor activity (Innovance VWF Ac kit, Siemens, Marburg, Germany), and chromogenic factor VIII were measured centrally, at baseline and 1 h after allocated treatment, by assessors who were masked to treatment allocation. Serum sodium was assessed locally 24 h after administration of the desmopressin or placebo, and these results were made available to the clinical team. Hyponatraemia was defined as a sodium concentration less than 135 mmol/L. Moderate to severe hyponatraemia was defined as a sodium concentration less than 125 mmol/L.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para210">The primary outcome measures of this feasibility trial were the proportion of eligible patients who were enrolled and received their allocated treatment, the proportion of eligible patients who underwent randomisation (and reasons for non-randomisation), the proportion of screened patients who were eligible, the rate of participant recruitment per month per site, time to randomisation after hospital admission, adherence to the allocated treatment, the proportion of participants followed up to 90 days (and reasons for loss to follow up), and the proportion of randomised participants with full outcome data available (and reasons for non-availability of data).</p>
                <p id="para220">Secondary outcomes were change in haematoma volume at 24 h (including changes meeting the definition of haematoma expansion), hyponatraemia at 24 h, length of hospital stay, discharge destination, death or dependency at day 90 (modified Rankin scale score &gt;4), mortality within 28 days and up to day 90, serious adverse events up to day 90 (including thromboembolic events), disability at day 90 (Barthel index), quality of life at day 90 (EuroQol), cognition at day 90 (telephone interview for cognitive status-modified), and mood at day 90 (Zung depression scale). Other secondary outcome measures were baseline platelet dysfunction (measured by P-selectin assay), and change in factor VIII, Von Willebrand factor antigen, and Von Willebrand factor activity at 1 h after administration of desmopressin or placebo. The manufacturer of the P-selectin assay closed their business before the end of the trial, so analysis of this outcome in all participants was not completed. A protocol-defined health economic assessment will be reported separately.</p>
                <p id="para230">All adverse events on day 1 (including during infusion) and for the 24-h period after dose administration were collected. All adverse events were assessed for seriousness, expectedness, and causality by adjudicators masked to treatment allocation. Serious adverse events were categorised in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities. Serious adverse events occurring within the first 7 days were assessed for seriousness, expectedness, and causality. Fatal serious adverse events and safety outcome events (eg, fluid overload and hyponatraemia) were reported until day 90.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para240">No formal sample size was calculated because this study was a feasibility trial to inform potential recruitment rates for a definitive trial. However, we considered that if more than 50 participants were randomised from ten centres in a 12-month period, it would be probable that, assuming similar recruitment rates in additional centres, a larger study recruiting approximately 1200 participants in around 50 centres recruiting for 60 months would be feasible.</p>
                <p id="para250">Data were analysed by a qualified statistician, using a validated software package (SAS version 9.4). A statistical analysis plan (SAP) was agreed on before database lock and release of randomisation codes. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed the data during the trial on July 14, 2019 (n=3), and March 13, 2020 (n=24). A further Chairman's review was conducted on Oct 4, 2021 (n=44).</p>
                <p id="para260">All available data were used, including overall numbers of patients presenting to the participating hospital stroke services and screening data. Sites completed and returned monthly screening logs on consecutive patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and included ineligibility or reasons for non-inclusion. When summaries by treatment group were provided, these were based on an intention-to-treat population, with the exception of safety data. A safety population was defined to summarise the safety data in this study, and these participants were summarised according to the treatment they received irrespective of randomisation. Variables were summarised by treatment group, using summary statistics. Counts were summarised using n (%), and continuous variables were summarised using mean (SD) or median (IQR) depending on their distribution.</p>
                <p id="para270">Because the proposed primary efficacy outcome in a definitive trial would be death or dependency at day 90, measured using the modified Rankin scale, we compared between treatment groups the full modified Rankin scale at day 90, using unadjusted ordinal logistic regression, and death and dependency at day 90 (modified Rankin scale score &gt;4), using unadjusted binary logistic regression. Results of these analyses are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% CIs. No formal statistical comparisons were made for any of the other outcome measures. The occurrence of missing data was also reported, with no imputation of missing data.</p>

After the pandemic, 13 participants were potentially eligible but not approached for recruitment due to sites being on hold, no investigational product being available, or not having capacity, compared with no eligible patients missed for these capacity reasons before the pandemic. 1204 (87%) of 1380 participants were considered ineligible. The most common reasons for ineligibility were no history of antiplatelet use (843 [70%] participants) or presentation to hospital more than 24 h after symptom onset (152 [13%] participants; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 2</xref>). 176 (13%) of 1380 participants were potentially eligible, of whom 57 (32%) were approached for consent. 54 (31%) consented and were subsequently recruited and underwent randomisation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The most common reasons for the 122 eligible patients not being recruited were the patients arriving out of hours (74 [61%] participants), no doctor being available (17 [14%] participants), and recruitment being on hold (ten [8%] participants; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>).

              <p id="para330">26 of 27 participants in the desmopressin group received all the trial treatment; one patient received a part infusion because of a fault with a leaking bag of sodium chloride. All participants in the placebo group received the full allocated treatment. All participants remained in their allocated group for the duration of the trial, with no participants lost to follow-up or withdrawing from the trial (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). All 54 participants had day 90 outcome data (the anticipated primary outcome in a definitive trial).</p>

Median change in haematoma volume at 24 h was 0 mL (IQR –1·4 to 2·0) in the desmopressin group and 0·5 mL (IQR –0·7 to 2·1) in the placebo group. Haematoma expansion occurred in five (21%) of 24 participants in the desmopressin group and five (23%) of 22 participants in the placebo group. Median length of hospital stay was 9 days (IQR 3–15) in the desmopressin group and 6 days (2–22) in the placebo group. Five patients in each treatment group died before 28 days. At day 90, in the desmopressin group, 18 (67%) patients had been discharged home, four (15%) were in hospital or residential care, and five (19%) had died. In the placebo group, 16 (59%) patients were at home, four (15%) were in hospital or residential care, and seven (26%) had died.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para390">The findings of the DASH trial showed the feasibility of running a large randomised trial of desmopressin in patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with intracerebral haemorrhage. 176 (13%) of 1380 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage were eligible for the DASH trial. Of these, 54 (31%) participants were recruited. The measures in place to follow up participants worked well, and no patients were lost to follow-up. Desmopressin and placebo infusions were administered in full for all but one participant. No safety concerns, such as thrombosis, were reported. Hyponatraemia is a known side-effect of desmopressin, and our results showed the incidence of mild hyponatraemia was higher for those treated with desmopressin, with no instances of moderate or severe hyponatraemia, suggesting its safety in this clinical setting. To our knowledge, the DASH trial is the first randomised trial to compare desmopressin with placebo in patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with intracerebral haemorrhage. A 2021 systematic review<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> identified three retrospective controlled studies (including 263 patients in total) assessing desmopressin in intracerebral haemorrhage. No randomised controlled trials have been done since this systematic review, although further case series have been published.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para400">The proposed primary efficacy outcome in a definitive trial would be death or dependency at day 90, measured using the modified Rankin scale. For a definitive study, we estimate approximately 1500 eligible patients would need to be recruited, a recruitment rate of up to 500 participants per year in the UK. Notably, DASH was conducted before, during, and after the global COVID-19 pandemic, during which time staff were redeployed to work in alternative areas. Therefore, the participant recruitment rate for a definitive trial could be increased from that observed in DASH. Furthermore, a future clinical trial to assess efficacy would be most likely to be successful if it were embedded into clinical practice, which would increase recruitment because it would be possible for clinical teams to randomly assign patients out of hours. In a definitive trial, a more pragmatic approach to temperature monitoring should be used, requiring that desmopressin be stored in a fridge, in line with current clinical practice.</p>
              <p id="para410">A pragmatic decision was made in the DASH trial to administer desmopressin or placebo as soon as possible after diagnosis, but to allow enrolment up to 24 h after symptom onset for patients who presented late or for whom enrolment was not possible in the first few hours. This decision is in contrast to ongoing trials of prohaemostatic drugs, such as the FASTEST trial of recombinant factor VIIa (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03496883" id="interrefs10">NCT03496883</ext-link>) and the TICH-3 trial of tranexamic acid (ISRCTN97695350), in which much tighter periods (2 h and 4·5 h, respectively) have been selected. There is growing awareness that the greatest risk of haematoma expansion occurs early after intracerebral haemorrhage, with previous clinical trials<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> suggesting administration of prohaemostatic therapy occurred too late after stroke onset to improve outcome. Although the risk of haematoma expansion is greatest in the first few hours after intracerebral haemorrhage onset, it can occur for the first 24 h, particularly in patients on antiplatelet therapy. The largest systematic review, including 30 000 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage on antiplatelet therapy from 23 studies, reported that such patients had larger baseline haematoma volume and were more likely to have haematoma expansion over 24 h compared with patients not on antiplatelet dugs (haematoma expansion OR 2·58 (95% CI 1·18–5·67), but not beyond this timepoint.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> In TICH-2,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> 165 (35%) of 611 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage on antiplatelet treatments underwent haematoma expansion after enrolment (mean 4·1 h) within the first 24 h.</p>
              <p id="para420">Several mechanisms have been proposed for how desmopressin might potentially reduce bleeding for patients on antiplatelet drugs. For instance, desmopressin stimulates release of Von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from endothelial Weibel-Palade bodies. Von Willebrand factor causes platelet adhesion to collagen through platelet glycoprotein 1b-V-IX receptors, and might also bind platelets together directly through their glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Increased concentrations of Von Willebrand factor, therefore, have the potential to compensate for the platelet function defect associated with antiplatelet drugs. Another suggested mechanism is that desmopressin might increase the formation of procoagulant platelets.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Participants treated with desmopressin had a greater increase in Von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than did those treated with placebo, although no formal statistical comparison was made.</p>
              <p id="para430">Guidelines currently provide conflicting guidance on use of desmopressin for patients on antiplatelet drugs with intracerebral haemorrhage. The Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine recommend a single dose of 0·4 μg/kg desmopressin for patients with intracranial haemorrhage who were exposed to antiplatelet agents;<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> for patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure, these guidelines recommend that desmopressin can be used in addition to platelet transfusion. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association advise that further studies are necessary to determine if there is a subgroup of patients taking antiplatelet drugs with intracerebral haemorrhage who might benefit from desmopressin.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party of the Royal College of Physicians guidelines<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and British Society for Haematology guidelines<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> make no recommendations.</p>
              <p id="para440">The DASH trial has several strengths. First, it provides randomised data for the use of desmopressin for acute intracerebral haemorrhage. Second, the methodology of the trial was rigorous, and the feasibility of the approach under investigation was demonstrated. Finally, there is substantial worldwide mortality and a large morbidity burden from intracerebral haemorrhage, and a lack of consensus in guidelines, so the study is of great importance for increasing knowledge.</p>
              <p id="para450">The DASH trial has some limitations. First, only research-active stroke units participated in the trial, so it is possible recruitment rates would be different in a definitive study. Recruitment was put on hold midway through the trial because of the COVID-19 pandemic and recruitment rates never reached pre-pandemic levels. The prolonged recruitment period associated with the funding extensions was an important modification that had meaningful implications for the ability of the trial to surpass the recruitment target and address its objectives. Furthermore, information provided in screening logs was restricted to data provided by each study site; these data were collected locally and it was not possible for the central research team to verify it. Second, the placebo was non-identical to desmopressin, although the risks of unmasking were minimised by fully concealing treatment allocation from clinicians, patients, and outcome assessors. Third, one of the most common reasons for patient exclusion was presenting out of hours or more than 24 h after symptom onset and, therefore, our data might not be representative of all patients. Streamlining trial processes for a future trial might reduce the time from confirmation of intracerebral haemorrhage on imaging to administration of desmopressin or placebo. Finally, the six patients who were taking dual antiplatelet therapy were all randomised to placebo. In a large definitive trial, we would consider minimisation on additional prognostic factors, such as antiplatelet therapy and baseline stroke severity.</p>
              <p id="para460">In summary, given sufficient recruiting centres and pragmatic trial methodology, it should be feasible to conduct a definitive trial to determine if desmopressin improves outcomes in patients on antiplatelet drug therapy with intracerebral haemorrhage. Although this trial could be delivered as a standalone study, it might be more efficient as part of a platform trial or to embed in an existing intracerebral haemorrhage trial. Given the high mortality and morbidity after intracerebral haemorrhage in patients exposed to antiplatelet drugs, and the increased frequency of patients taking antiplatelet drugs, even a small reduction in morbidity or mortality could reduce the risk of death and leave tens of thousands of patients free from disability.</p>

Submitted requests will require a protocol detailing hypothesis, aims, analyses, and intended tables and figures. Where possible, we will perform the analyses; alternatively, deidentified data and a data dictionary will be supplied for the necessary variables for remote analysis.
