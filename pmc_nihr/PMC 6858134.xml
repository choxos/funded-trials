                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>During a cluster randomised trial, (the 3D study) of an intervention enacting recommended care for people with multimorbidity, including continuity of care and comprehensive biennial reviews, we examined implementation fidelity to interpret the trial outcome and inform future implementation decisions.</p>

                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Mixed-methods process evaluation using cross-trial data and a sample of practices, clinicians, administrators and patients. Interviews, focus groups and review observations were analysed thematically and integrated with quantitative data about implementation. Analysis was blind to trial outcomes and examined context, intervention adoption, reach and maintenance, and delivery of reviews to patients.</p>

                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>The trial included 1546 people with multimorbidity. 11 general practitioners, 14 nurses, 7 administrators and 38 patients from 9 of 16 intervention practices were sampled for an interview.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Staff loss, practice size and different administrative strategies influenced implementation fidelity. Practices with whole administrative team involvement and good alignment between the intervention and usual care generally implemented better. Fewer reviews than intended were delivered (49% of patients receiving both intended reviews, 30% partially reviewed). In completed reviews &gt;90% of intended components were delivered, but review observations and interviews with patients and clinicians found variation in style of component delivery, from ‘tick-box’ to patient-centred approaches. Implementation barriers included inadequate skills training to implement patient-centred care planning, but patients reported increased patient-centredness due to comprehensive reviews, extra time and being asked about their health concerns.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Implementation failure contributed to lack of impact of the 3D intervention on the trial primary outcome (quality of life), but so did intervention failure since modifiable elements of intervention design were partially responsible. When a decisive distinction between implementation failure and intervention failure cannot be made, identifying potentially modifiable reasons for suboptimal implementation is important to enhance potential for impact and effectiveness of a redesigned intervention.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The increasing prevalence of multimorbidity, driven by ageing populations across the world, is a major challenge to health services. There is broad consensus about how primary care for people with multimorbidity should be organised,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> but little evidence about the effectiveness of recommended strategies. Reflecting this absence of evidence, the 2016 National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Multimorbidity clinical guideline recommended more research on how best to organise primary care to address the challenge of improving care for people with multimorbidity.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the largest trial to date of an intervention based on the consensus of opinion about best practice for multimorbidity care, the 3D study evaluated a patient-centred approach for the people with multimorbidity, defined for this trial as people with three or more long-term conditions on a disease registry. The approach included continuity of care and regular holistic reviews (3D reviews) in primary care (general practices in the UK) with a focus on addressing quality of life, mental as well as physical health, and polypharmacy. The hypothesis was that this would improve patient-centred care, reduce treatment burden and illness burden and improve quality of life (the trial primary outcome).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p>
              <p>Process evaluation of trials evaluating complex interventions can inform decisions about the wider implementation and applicability of those interventions. A comprehensive process evaluation can help interpret trial results and inform real-world implementation<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> by providing explanations when interventions are not effective.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This may be because of intervention failure (the intervention was delivered as intended but did not improve outcomes, so should not be implemented) and/or implementation failure (the intervention was inadequately implemented and so might need additional research to further examine effectiveness).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, distinguishing implementation and intervention failure is often not straightforward<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> and may require detailed examination of implementation fidelity.</p>
              <p>We have previously reported baseline data from the 3D study,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> main trial findings<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12 13</xref> and analysis of the patient-centredness of the 3D review.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> At baseline, many practices had already combined multiple long-term condition reviews into one appointment but other recommended care<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> was less evident. For example, only 10% of patients were aware of receiving a care plan and 35% were rarely or never asked what was important to them in managing their health.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The main trial results showed no effect from the 3D intervention on the primary outcome of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) or other related secondary outcomes such as well-being and treatment burden, but a consistent beneficial effect on patients’ experience of care as more person centred.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Analysis of observational and interview data about intervention delivery indicated that the main reasons for the perceived increase in patient-centredness were that when patients attended for an intervention review, they were first asked about their most important health concerns and then given a longer, comprehensive review encompassing all health issues.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The aim of this paper is to examine whether the measured lack of effect on the primary outcome in the 3D trial was due to implementation or intervention failure, and thereby inform future intervention development and evaluation.</p>

                <p>The intervention and trial evaluation are described briefly here, having been reported in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 12 13</xref> The core components of the intervention included offering greater continuity of care and 6 monthly, two-part patient-centred, comprehensive health reviews, conducted by a named nurse and general practitioner (GP) and underpinned by a purpose-designed electronic template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). A pharmacist also completed an electronic medication review. Practices were expected to deliver two complete reviews to every participating patient during the trial, including all review components. However, practices could decide the detail of how they would provide the reviews, enhance continuity of care and reduce the number of review appointments. Administrators and clinicians nominated by the practices received two short (2–3 hours) training sessions from the trial team on the intervention’s rationale and the use of the computer template. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">Online supplementary appendix 1</xref> shows the TIDieR checklist<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> for the intervention design. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> details the work that administrative staff, clinicians and pharmacists were expected to do to deliver the intervention.

Four practices were initially purposefully sampled during early stages of the trial, using baseline data and observation of practice team training, for detailed qualitative investigation of all aspects of implementation, including context, adoption, delivery and maintenance. This sampling reflected our assumptions that (1) larger practices may have lower continuity of care and a lower proportion of clinicians taking part in 3D, which may influence implementation and (2) practices whose care for patients with multimorbidity already reflected aspects of the 3D approach may adopt 3D more readily. These four practices were included in every stage of data collection. An additional five practices were responsively sampled at later stages for focused observation of clinicians’ style of delivery of 3D reviews and to examine variations in models of delivery that emerged during the trial. In total 9 of the 16 intervention practices were sampled.</p>

                  <p><bold>Interviews with practice staff:</bold> At baseline, interviews in the four initially sampled practices with the 3D lead GP, the lead nurse and the key administrator explored usual care, initial reactions to the intervention and implementation arrangements. Interviews at the end of the trial in the same four practices, and in a fifth, responsively sampled practice where a nurse practitioner delivered all reviews, explored experience of delivering the intervention and maintenance. These interviews lasted 15–50 min. Most individuals were interviewed at both the beginning and end of the trial to achieve a longitudinal perspective on implementation and to see how their initial response to the intervention changed in light of their experience of implementing it, but there were also a few single interviews.</p>
                  <p><bold>Observation of 3D reviews with follow-up interviews:</bold> Twenty-eight 3D reviews were observed and recorded in the four initially sampled practices and in four of the responsively sampled practices, including one in which a research nurse, rather than a practice nurse, conducted most of the part 1 reviews. Observation notes were informed by an observation checklist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">online supplementary appendix 2</xref>). The checklist was based on the intervention components and directed attention to whether components were delivered and the manner of their delivery. Where possible, brief follow-on interviews with the clinician and/or patient whose review had been observed were completed on the same day. These interviews lasted 5–24 min.</p>
                  <p><bold>Focus groups and interviews with</bold><bold>patients</bold>: In the four initially sampled practices, patients varying in health status and satisfaction with care according to baseline questionnaire data were invited to focus groups or individual interview towards the end of the trial, to explore their experience of receiving the intervention. One focus group per practice took place, lasting about 1 hour. Patients preferring individual interviews were interviewed for 20–50 min in a convenient location, usually their own home. All the focus groups and interviews were carried out by CM.</p>

The template also recorded the pharmacist’s completion of a medication review, their recommendations and whether these had been noted by the GP. In the second part of the review delivered by a GP (except in one practice), recorded data included medication adherence and description of at least one main problem in the health plan, together with patient and GP actions to address the problem.

Qualitative analysis was led by CM with input from AS, LW and BG, who commented on the developing coding framework, double coded a sample of transcripts and agreed the final themes. Additionally, to further enhance trustworthiness and credibility of findings, two members of the patient and public involvement group each coded four transcripts to check interpretation of the data from the patient perspective.

              <p>The results examine (1) adoption of the intervention by practices, (2) reach and maintenance and (3) delivery of reviews to patients. In quotes, staff and patients are identified by practice pseudonym, role and a number.</p>

                <title>Adoption: organisational components</title>
                <p>The two core components of organisational adoption were continuity of care and arranging the two-part 3D reviews.</p>
                <sec id="s3-1-1">
                  <title>Continuity of care</title>
                  <p>Practices were asked to allocate a named GP to 3D patients for their reviews and for any appointment between reviews. Continuity of care was evaluated as a secondary outcome for the trial and, measured using the Continuity of Care index,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> increased slightly in the intervention arm.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, some patients experienced reduced continuity because their GP left during the trial. Others were allocated a different GP for the intervention, either to share workload or because their usual GP was not participating in 3D. These patients often continued to see their usual GP for appointments other than reviews.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>[My usual GP had to get changed. There’s three doctors in our practice and they were doing I think 12 patients, so it was split between three doctors. So I had to go with [GP2]. (Focus group Lovell Patient 8)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>The four initially sampled practices (Beddoes, Davy, Harvey and Lovell) provided insight into contextual influences. Harvey already had a ‘personal list’ system with high continuity, but during the trial this was disrupted when several GPs left the practice. Beddoes supported 3D participants to see their allocated GP between reviews. At Davy, continuity was poorly implemented due to staff loss and because receptionists were unaware of 3D. Lovell continued with their usual system, which they felt delivered adequate continuity of care.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>Most people see the doctor they want to see, so I think from a continuity point of view we know our patients very well and we’ve all been here a long time. [Group interview Lovell GP1]</p>

                  <title>Arranging reviews</title>
                  <p>Administrative survey data from 15 intervention practices showed variation in the way practices arranged reviews (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Ten practices involved the whole administrative team, but in four, one or two administrators arranged 3D reviews in isolation. Reach was lowest in these four practices. In the remaining practice (Cabot), a dedicated research nurse arranged all the reviews, bypassing the administrative team. Notably, some 3D patients received the 3D reviews in addition to, rather than instead of their usual individual condition reviews, as intended.</p>

                    <p>I think there became a problem where patients were being invited in for their 3D and then a couple of months later, they'd get invited in for their diabetes and their asthma because one person up there wasn’t talking to the other one. [Interview Blackwell Nurse 1]</p>

                  <p>At Lovell and Harvey, existing arrangements for long-term condition reviews (one of the sampling criteria) underpinned the 3D review arrangements, reducing confusion. At Davy, the two administrators involved had to set up a different system for 3D patients. Being a large practice in which the rest of the administrative team were unaware of 3D requirements, difficulties arose when patients needed to re-arrange the appointment. At Beddoes, clinical and administrative staff decided collectively how they would implement the administrative aspects of 3D, but it differed from usual arrangements.</p>
                  <disp-quote>
                    <p>We’d had a team meeting after the training with the senior nurse and the GPs to decide what was the best way forward and then I met with the admin team to say, What would you like to see on your screen so that you know they’re part of the 3D study and so that you know about the appointments? (Interview Beddoes practice manager)</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>Overall, adoption was inconsistent, affected by practices’ choices in respect of continuity and arrangements for reviews. Duplication of reviews in some practices suggests difficulty in testing effectiveness of an intervention in a research situation that involves a short-term alteration to accustomed methods of providing care, that affects only a subset of patients.</p>

Reach varied between practices from 38% and 94% (median 66%) of all recruited patients in a practice receiving both the nurse and GP appointments in first round reviews, and between 0% and 93% (median 47%) in second round reviews. Initial implementation of the intervention was, therefore, not well-maintained.</p>

                <p>In the four initially-sampled practices, the qualitative data revealed contextual factors reducing the time window for delivering reviews. Lovell started delivering 3D reviews straight after training and had the highest reach of any practice in the intervention arm. The other three practices delayed starting, Davy because of the sudden loss of three of their long-term condition nurses and two GPs, Harvey because they were changing their system for sending letters re-calling patients for long-term reviews, and Beddoes because of staff sickness. Once started, Davy administrators struggled to organise reviews, hampered by ongoing sickness in the nursing team, and only managed to schedule 25% of the reviews required. The greatest challenge was accommodating paired reviews within over-stretched appointment schedules.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>And I think because you’re trying to tally it up with the doctor and the nurse, trying to find the time with the nurse if they’ve got more than one problem … and again they’re not full time; they work part time. [Interview Davy Administrator 1]</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Difficulties with arranging appointments reinforced practices’ initial fears that the time demand and workload of implementing the 3D intervention would be too great. One suggestion made by GPs was that patients could be selected using more stringent criteria to reduce the overall number and maximise the chance of benefit. Another suggestion, from nurses, GPs and patients, was that the reviews need not involve the GP every time and/or could be shorter. Some comments suggested a lack of perceived value of the second-round reviews and that a second-round review with the nurse alone would be more time-efficient.</p>

                  <title>I know they need to be reviewed but do they need to be reviewed by nurse and GP?</title>
                  <p>… because if we saw them for review and they were happy. Do they honestly need to see the GP to say “Are you still happy, like from last week”? (Interview Guppy Nurse 1)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Practices may therefore have been less motivated to arrange second reviews, and one practice reported that fewer patients responded to the invitation to attend them.</p>
                <disp-quote>
                  <p>As a practice we’ve actually struggled to get them in for their second ones … we’ve written to them all twice – probably 30% of them haven’t booked in and so we have had a bigger DNA rate for the second ones than the first ones. (Interview Beddoes GP1)</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>Overall, reach and maintenance were lower than intended, indicating a degree of implementation failure. Attention to context showed this was mainly a result of unanticipated events (eg, staff loss or sickness) affecting practice capacity. However, aspects of intervention design (eg, the inclusion of two reviews in 1 year with both nurse and GP each time) may also have impacted reach and maintenance.</p>

                <p>In 3D reviews that took place, each of the intervention components (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>) detected by the electronic search were completed in at least 92% of the delivered reviews, except medication adherence which was completed in 84% and printing the health plan in 77% (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP4">online supplementary appendix 4</xref>).

                  <p>Some GPs and nurses commented on the value and novelty of asking about all patients’ health concerns at the start of the consultation<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> but others were conscious of their clinical responsibility for managing the long-term conditions.

                    <p>They want to discuss … the things that are happening to them at that particular moment … they’ve got a bad cold, or the cat’s died or something else and they don’t want to talk about their diabetes or their COPD. [Interview Beddoes GP3]</p>
                  </disp-quote>
                  <p>There was also observed variation in how patient’s concerns were elicited, recorded in the agenda and addressed in the health plan. The printed agenda was intended to reflect the patient’s perception of health problems (as well as clinical concerns), but nurses were often observed to reframe patients’ problems into more medical terms. For example, one patient said: ‘I can’t take these naproxen now because … they’ve upset my stomach’ and the nurse recorded ‘gastric problems’. This medicalisation of problems may have contributed to some patients’ perception that the agenda was simply a means for the nurse to communicate their findings to the GP, rather than an agenda that the patient owned.</p>

                  <p>Health plans were intended as collaborative agreements between patient and GP, recording identified problems and specific actions for patient and GP to address each recorded problem. The patient and GP actions were well completed (93% and 92%, respectively, for the first problem) but the health plan was printed less frequently (77%) (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). This may reflect GPs apparent dislike of the health plan and a perceived lack of value, as well as observed technical difficulties printing the plan. Interview data included reservations about the formulation of the health plan, which may have made GPs reluctant to give them to patients.</p>

                  <p>During observations, a collaborative dialogue based on patients’ chosen goals was seldom generated, and most plans were based on actions suggested by the GP.

                <title>Summary of findings</title>
                <p>The process evaluation identified that implementation was somewhat deficient in adoption (arranging the requisite number of 3D reviews, ensuring continuity of care, reducing the overall number of reviews) and aspects of delivery (creating health plans), but most delivered reviews included all components. Reasons for incomplete implementation included unexpected pressure on resources, implementation choices made by practices (including not involving the entire administrative team), and insufficient training for using patient-centred approaches. During delivery of reviews to patients, using the template was the key to maintaining ‘fidelity of form’, but variation in the patient-centredness of delivery sometimes undermined ‘fidelity of function’.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The overall prediction made by the process evaluation team while blind to the trial results was that the intervention would have improved patient experience in patients who received 3D reviews, but not changed HRQOL (the findings were presented and this prediction made at the trial steering committee meeting immediately before unblinding). The prediction of improved experience was based on the positive feedback from patients in focus groups and interviews suggesting improvements in their perceptions of care. The prediction of unchanged HRQOL was based on limited engagement of patients in the health plans (observed and described by clinicians), a lack of evidence of major changes to quality of care and feedback from administrators and clinicians about difficulties organising reviews. The trial results confirmed these predictions,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which increase our confidence in the process evaluation findings.</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses</title>
                <p>Strengths include predesigning the process evaluation based on a published framework for process evaluation of cluster randomised trials<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 17 18</xref> covering all trial stages and maintaining responsiveness to emerging information. This maximised the likelihood that all factors that might influence implementation fidelity, including context, were considered.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Data of varying and complementary types were collected from a wide range of sources, both purposively sampled and cross-trial. The purposive sampling of practices mitigated the limitation that only a subset of practices and individuals involved in the trial were interviewed or observed, and we explored the full range of variation in implementation and reach (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>), including quantitative process data from all practices. In accordance with published guidance,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> the process evaluation analysis took place blind to the trial results.</p>

                <title>Comparison to other literature</title>
                <p>An aim of the 3D process evaluation was to examine implementation fidelity to distinguish between implementation failure and intervention failure in the event of a null result. This distinction matters because it is important to avoid discarding a potentially effective intervention that was poorly implemented.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 29 30</xref> Implementation difficulties and deficiencies are not infrequently identified in effectiveness evaluations of complex healthcare delivery interventions<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31–34</xref> but are not always elucidated.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 35</xref> In this study, we found evidence of a degree of implementation failure and, in addition to identifying poorly implemented components, we have considered reasons for poor implementation and whether they are modifiable. Non-modifiable reasons include unexpected events in individual practices, most commonly staff leaving and not being easily replaceable. Potentially modifiable reasons for adoption problems include the individual choices practices made about arranging reviews, influenced by practice size and existing recall systems, but implementation was also affected by the research trial context. Implementation in these circumstances is short term, and only applies to a subset of patients, with the majority still receiving usual care, which increases the risk of confusion and duplication. This circumstance influenced administrative choices made by practices, which in turn affected implementation.</p>
                <p>The role of intervention design and setup, including training provided by research teams to practices, is significant and modifiable. In common with other research teams, we experienced difficulty in establishing a new way of working,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36 37</xref> although care did change enough that patients reported statistically significant changes in their experience of care in the intended direction (eg, having a greater sense of being consulted about their experience of health) and greater satisfaction with their care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The evidence suggested that this was attributable to the design of the intervention reviews (longer, comprehensive and asking first about the patient’s concerns),<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> but there was also evidence that intervention design negatively affected implementation in some potentially modifiable ways. Implementation of health plans suffered from insufficient training and a lack of coherence between the health plan format and GP current practice, clearly suggesting that intervention design relating to both these aspects could be improved. Professional perceptions that some patients were unprepared to engage in health planning suggests that additional patient-targeted intervention components and/or better clinician training addressing attitudes and barriers to engaging in health planning and supporting self-management<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> might facilitate collaboratively agreeing a plan of action. Many professionals did not see value for many patients in doing a second comprehensive review in the same year, which likely contributed to lower reach for second reviews, and suggests that more targeted follow-up might have been a better design than routine rereview for all.</p>
                <p>Our overall judgement was that there was, therefore, evidence of both implementation failure and intervention failure, but that these were linked rather than truly distinct because in this case aspects of intervention design influenced implementation. Improvements in intervention design could be focused on incorporating skills practice in the 3D training, better selection and preparation of patients, improvement to the health plan including a different format and greater patient ownership. We could also consider greater flexibility in follow-up reviews to allow varying intensity of follow-up tailored to patient need.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a dilemma between ensuring an intervention is implemented with high fidelity and allowing flexibility to suit local circumstances. The intervention design did allow for some adaptation ‘at the periphery’<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and distinguished between core components that must be implemented in a particular form and less closely specified components whose form could vary, as long as the intended function was achieved.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This is recommended to facilitate implementation in individual practices, but it is not straightforward to choose where to specify intervention elements as ‘central’ and where to allow flexibility. In retrospect, some flexibility in follow-up reviews would be reasonable in future iterations of this type of intervention. A further change, which might plausibly alter impact on HRQOL, would be to evaluate implementation over a longer period (although that clearly has significant cost implications) or as a whole practice improvement intervention delivered to all eligible patients, rather than running a parallel system of care for individual trial participants. However, this creates the paradox that providing an intervention outside the context of a research trial may be more likely to provide a true representation of its effectiveness, but the effectiveness cannot be proved without the research.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In the context of an intervention that followed the recommendations and best evidence for care of people with multimorbidity, where the trial provided strong evidence that there was no effect on the primary outcome of HRQOL but an improvement in patient-centred outcomes, we found evidence of both implementation and intervention failure. Although this challenges the assumption that implementation and intervention failure can be clearly distinguished, we believe that the distinction does provide a useful framework to help interpret trial findings and to systematically identify modifiable and non-modifiable factors to inform future implementation decisions. This paper provides a worked example of how to use these concepts in process evaluation. We conclude first, that in the case of the 3D trial a truer test of the intervention effectiveness might be achieved by modifications that support better implementation, including whole practice implementation over a longer period to allow embedding. Second, it is important to examine reasons for implementation deficiencies to determine whether there were implementation failures and the reasons for them and whether they might be modifiable in order to avoid discarding a potentially effective intervention.</p>
