                  <p>Infection is the leading cause of death in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis (AAV). Expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells is associated with increased risk of infection and mortality, but is only present in cytomegalovirus (CMV)–seropositive individuals.

                  <p>In a proof-of-concept open-label clinical trial, 38 CMV-seropositive AAV patients were randomized to receive valacyclovir for 6 months or no intervention. CMV reactivation was measured monthly in plasma and urine. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells were enumerated at baseline and at 6 months. At 6 months, 36 patients were vaccinated with a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine.

          <body>
            <p>The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAVs) are autoimmune, inflammatory conditions characterized by necrotizing inflammation affecting small to medium blood vessels, leading to end organ damage [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The introduction of successful immunosuppressive regimens for inducing disease remission has transformed their management. However, patients with AAV continue to experience significant excess morbidity and mortality, with infection being the leading cause of death [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Respiratory infections are very common among AAV patients and although pneumococcal vaccination is indicated, vaccine responses are suboptimal [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, impaired vaccine response is a marker of poor immunologic function and is independently associated with increased all-cause mortality [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
            <p>We have previously demonstrated in patients with AAV that the expansion of a subset of CD4 T cells that have lost expression of the costimulatory molecule CD28 (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells) is independently associated with risk of infection and all-cause mortality [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells are proinflammatory and expand under inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4–6</xref>]. Furthermore, this expansion is associated with a reduction in naive CD4 T cells [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], suggesting a consequent diminished ability of the immune system to respond to new antigenic challenges. Loss of CD28 suggests repeated exposure to a persistent antigen [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and we, and others, have demonstrated that significant expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells occurs exclusively in cytomegalovirus (CMV)–seropositive individuals [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>]. CMV infection itself has been linked to impaired immune response to heterologous antigens [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>] and has been implicated as a driver of the observed age-associated decline in immune function in the general population [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref>].</p>
            <p>We hypothesized that subclinical asymptomatic reactivation of CMV drives expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells in AAV and that this is associated with impaired immune response to heterologous antigens. Furthermore, we postulated that antiviral therapy might act to ameliorate this effect, offering potential clinical benefit. To investigate this, we conducted a proof-of-concept open-label clinical trial of valacyclovir therapy in CMV-seropositive AAV patients in remission and vaccinated patients at the end of treatment with a T-cell–dependent 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).</p>

              <title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title>
              <p>Thirty-eight CMV-seropositive patients with AAV in stable remission were recruited from the vasculitis clinic at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) National Health Service Foundation Trust (Birmingham, United Kingdom) and participated in a single-center, proof-of-concept, open-label, randomized clinical trial of oral valacyclovir vs standard care (no anti-CMV treatment) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01633476). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Yorkshire and The Humber, United Kingdom. The trial study protocol has been published previously [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
              <sec id="s7">
                <title>Clinical Trial</title>
                <p>The trial was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of valacyclovir-induced CMV suppression in AAV and to investigate whether prevention of subclinical CMV reactivation limits expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells.</p>
                <p>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had a documented diagnosis of AAV, were in stable remission for at least 6 months, on maintenance immunosuppression with no more than 1 agent in addition to prednisolone (prednisolone dose ≤5 mg), and were CMV seropositive (anti-CMV immunoglobulin G [IgG] detected in blood). Exclusion criteria were estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;15 mL/minute/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, B-cell–depleting therapy within 12 months or T-cell–depleting therapy within 6 months, presence of other chronic infection (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, tuberculosis), or treatment with anti-CMV therapies within the previous month.</p>
                <p>Between 1 August 2013 and 28 February 2016, eligible patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 6 months of oral valacyclovir (2 g 4 times a day; dose adjusted according to creatinine clearance), or no additional therapy, and followed up for an additional 6 months. Block randomization by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell percentage (&lt;40% or ≥40%) was used (Primary Care Clinical Research and Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom). The randomization used mixed blocks of random size not known to the investigators. Although patients and investigators were not blinded, laboratory staff undertaking the CMV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay that informed the primary outcome were blinded to treatment allocation. An interim safety analysis was undertaken after 10 patients completed treatment.</p>
                <p>The clinical trial primary outcome was time to first CMV reactivation in blood or urine (defined as ≥200 viral copies/mL) within 6 months of randomization. Reactivation episodes detected at baseline prior to treatment commencement were not included in this analysis. Secondary outcomes were change in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell proportion from baseline to end of treatment, change in soluble markers of inflammation from baseline to end of treatment, and number of adverse events.</p>

                <p>At 6 months, 36 of 38 AAV patients (18 treated/18 controls) were vaccinated with a T-cell–dependent PCV13 (0.5 mL; Prevnar, Pfizer) as per clinical recommendations [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Participants had not received pneumococcal vaccination in the preceding 5 years. Blood was drawn prior to vaccination and 4 weeks postvaccination to determine serotype-specific anti-IgG titer for 12 pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV13 (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6b, 7f, 9v, 14, 18c, 19a, 19f, 23f) using a multiplex assay quality assured externally by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Serum was separated from blood by centrifugation and cryopreserved at –80°C until analysis. Because a protective level of serum antibody has not been strictly defined and may differ among serotypes, we used the antibody response ratio (ARR) as a measure of immune response to vaccination as previously employed by others [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ARR was calculated (antibody titer at 4 weeks postvaccination / antibody titer prior to vaccination), and mean ARR (sum of ARR in all serotypes assessed / number of serotypes) was utilized as a single measure of immune response.</p>

Cells were co-cultured with saturating amounts of anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (Ebioscience) and stimulated with SEB (0.2 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) to assess CD4 T-cell functional capacity. Unstimulated cells served as controls. Following overnight incubation, cells were stained with fixable viability dye eFluor-506 (Ebioscience), then costained with saturating amounts of anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C, washed with flow cytometry buffer, fixed, and permeabilized using an intracellular flow cytometry staining kit (Ebioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then stained with anti–interferon gamma (IFN-γ), anti–tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and anti–interleukin 2 (IL-2) monoclonal antibodies. The ability of IFN-γ–positive SEB-responsive cells to coproduce TNF-α, IL-2, and CD154 was evaluated as a measure of CD4 T-cell functional capacity.</p>

                <p>A reduction in the plasma levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ, cytokines known to be produced by CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells, occurred only in treated patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).

                <p>To confirm the impact of subclinical CMV reactivation on the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells, a post hoc analysis was carried out in control patients to investigate the relationship between change in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells and episodes of viral reactivation. Control patients who had at least 1 episode of CMV reactivation had an increase in the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells compared to those who did not reactivate (1.2% [interquartile range {IQR}, –0.7% to 2.5%] vs –1.3% [IQR, –6.9 to 0.6]; <italic>P</italic> = .037; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).

                <title>Subclinical CMV Reactivation and Consequent Expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-Cells Is Associated With Impaired Immune Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination</title>
                <p>To determine whether subclinical reactivation of CMV and the consequent expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell subset is linked to reduced response to heterologous antigens, 36 of the 38 trial patients (18 treated, 18 controls) were vaccinated with a T-cell–dependent PCV13 at the end of the valacyclovir treatment period. Analysis of prevaccination and 4-week postvaccination serotype-specific IgG titers revealed a statistically significant increase in all pneumococcal serotypes across the entire patient group, with the exception of serotype 14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>Patients with evidence of subclinical CMV reactivation during the 6 months preceding vaccination had a significantly suppressed immune response to PCV13 (ARR) across all pneumococcal serotypes analyzed, compared to individuals with no CMV reactivation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

                <title>Expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-Cell Subset Is Associated With Reduced Functional Capacity of the CD4 Compartment</title>
                <p>Given that PCV13 is a T-cell–dependent pneumococcal vaccine, we next sought to determine whether expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell subset is associated with reduced functional capacity of the CD4 compartment. To address this, PBMCs were stimulated with a superantigen (SEB) immediately prior to PCV13 vaccination. SEB-responsive CD4 T cells were identified by IFN-γ expression. Functional capacity was then evaluated by assessing for coexpression of the activation marker CD154 and cytokines TNF-α and IL-2 on SEB-responsive CD4 T cells.</p>
                <p>Increasing CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell percentage was strongly correlated with a reduction in the proportion of multifunctional (CD154<sup>+</sup>TNF-α<sup>+</sup>IL2<sup>+</sup>) SEB-responsive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (ρ = –0.663; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The same relationship was observed when multifunctional capacity was assessed.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that subclinical reactivation of CMV drives expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell subset that has previously been associated with increased risk of infection and mortality in AAV. We show that CMV reactivation and consequent expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells are associated with impaired immune response to a T-cell–dependent PCV13, and that antiviral therapy safely suppresses subclinical reactivation of CMV and limits the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells. Moreover, our findings show that reduction of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells is associated with improved immune response to pneumococcal vaccination, suggesting that suppression of CMV may have important therapeutic benefit in AAV, in improving the immune response to heterologous antigens. This is of significant clinical relevance, as infection represents a leading cause of death in patients with AAV and the immune response to vaccination is currently suboptimal.</p>
              <p>CMV-specific T cells in healthy individuals fluctuate over time, suggesting a degree of ongoing subclinical CMV reactivation [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our study, subclinical CMV reactivation was completely suppressed by valacyclovir. After cessation of treatment, CMV DNA was again detected in the urine of some patients, suggesting that such episodes represent subclinical viral reactivation rather than viral DNA from uroepithelial cells that might have come into contact with latent virus. We found that subclinical CMV reactivation occurred in more than a quarter of AAV patients in remission over 12 months, indicating that CMV reactivation is a frequent event in these patients. It is anticipated that viral reactivation will be even higher during the acute phase of the disease, at a time when patients are exposed to intensive immunosuppressive therapy and heightened systemic inflammation [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In keeping with this, we have previously observed that the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells increases during the first year in patients with AAV [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Taken together with our current findings, this suggests a heightened degree of subclinical CMV reactivation during this time.</p>
              <p>CMV is increasingly recognized as one of the most immunodominant infections encountered by the human immune system. The virus profoundly modulates the immune system with up to 10% of the CD4 and 40% of the CD8 compartments being comprised of CMV-specific T cells [<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Previous studies in the general population have suggested that this CMV-induced “memory inflation” is associated with suppression of the memory response to heterologous antigens such as Epstein-Barr virus [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and influenza viruses [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our in vitro studies suggest that expansion of the memory response to CMV, represented by the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell subset, is associated with a progressive decline in the functional capacity of the CD4 compartment. Moreover, the proportion of multifunctional CD4 T cells was found to correlate with the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination. CD4 T-cell help is essential for B-cell clonal expansion and antibody synthesis [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hence, reduced functional capacity of the CD4 compartment is likely to represent one of the mechanisms by which CMV infection leads to the observed impaired immunity to heterologous antigens, particularly in the context of a T-cell–dependent pneumococcal vaccine.</p>
              <p>Our study has certain limitations. We did not achieve our recruitment target of 50 patients for the clinical trial, due to fewer patients being eligible for inclusion in the trial than originally anticipated. Nevertheless, valacyclovir treatment completely suppressed subclinical CMV reactivation and reduced CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell expansion in treated patients. We assessed CMV reactivation on a monthly basis. It is possible that reactivation episodes occurring in the intervening period may have been missed; however, the likelihood of this would be expected to be equally distributed between the treatment and control groups. There was a nonsignificant difference in baseline CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell percentage between the 2 groups. To account for this, paired ratio <italic>t</italic> test analysis of change in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T cells examined differences in the ratios of paired values rather than absolute difference. Due to practical considerations, our study was open-label. However, laboratory staff analyzing samples comprising primary outcome data were blind to treatment allocation.</p>
              <p>The results presented here support a mechanism whereby CMV infection reduces the immune response to heterologous antigens in patients with AAV. Our findings suggest that this is mediated by subclinical reactivation of the virus and consequent expansion of the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell subset that is associated with a reduction in the overall functional capacity of the CD4 compartment. Importantly, suppression of CMV reactivation with antiviral therapy limits CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell expansion, and this in turn is associated with improved response to a T-cell–dependent pneumococcal vaccine.</p>
              <p>Our findings provide proof of principle for the potential benefit of CMV suppression in AAV and support the design of larger studies to determine the frequency of subclinical reactivation of CMV during the more active phase of the disease, and to investigate the potential for CMV suppression to improve the immune response to vaccination and reduce risk of infection, the leading cause of death in AAV.</p>
