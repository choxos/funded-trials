                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) carries a high mortality without liver transplantation (LT) in children. Liver transplantation, though lifesaving, is limited by timely donor organ availability, the risks of major surgery and complications of life-long immunosuppression. Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) improves synthetic and detoxification functions in small animal models. The encapsulation of hepatocytes in alginate protects it from the recipient immune system while the intraperitoneal route of administration allows large volumes to be infused. The safety and possibly short-term efficacy of encapsulated hepatocytes has been observed in a named patient use. A novel type of microbeads (HMB002) has been developed, using a modified alginate and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Its safety and medium-term efficacy need to be studied in the context of clinical study while optimizing the hepatocyte function and viability using modifications of the alginate and MSCs co-encapsulation.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>A single centre, non-randomised, open-label, single-arm Simon’s two stage study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, biological activity and tolerability of transplantation of a single intraperitoneal dose of microbeads made from an optimum combination of a modified alginate, MSCs and hepatocytes in 17 patients less than 16 years of age with acute liver failure (Stage 1: 9 patients and Stage 2: 8 patient). Safety will be assessed by documenting moderate to severe (including life threatening and death) adverse events due to HMB002 in the first 52 weeks post-procedure. Tolerability will be assessed by observing the proportion of initiated infusions where &gt;80% of infusion is received by the patient. Biological activity will be reflected in patient survival with native liver at 24 weeks post treatment.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p>HMB002, if safe and efficacious in acute liver failure, could be a bridge until the liver regenerates or a suitable organ becomes available. There are multiple advantages to using HT. HT, when delivered by the intraperitoneal route, is less invasive than LT. Hepatocytes from a single donor liver can be used to treat multiple patients. Cryopreserved cells provide an off-the-shelf emergency treatment in PALF. When encapsulated, alginate encapsulation of hepatocytes precludes the need for immunosuppression unlike in LT.</p>

The trial may be prematurely discontinued by the sponsor, Chief Investigator or regulatory authority based on new safety information or for other reasons given by the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB), regulatory authority or ethics committee concerned. The sponsor and CI reserve the right to stop the trial at any time, for any justifiable reason. In the event of premature termination, the sponsor will notify the regulatory authorities. During the course of the study, the trial will be put on hold for safety related events that trigger a halt in patient recruitment, pending a safety investigation and a safety meeting of the DSMB. If following an internal safety review the sponsor deems it appropriate to restart the trial, this can be done after approval of a substantial amendment. Agreement from the sponsors will be required prior to the disclosure of any trial related data. The sponsor will not be involved in analysis and interpretation of data except that related to safety investigation and will not be involved in writing of the report.

              <p>Pediatric acute Liver Failure (PALF) carries a high mortality without liver transplantation (LT) in children [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Liver transplantation, though lifesaving, is limited by timely donor organ availability, the risks of major surgery and complications of life-long immunosuppression. Given the regenerative potential of the liver, complete regeneration of the failing liver can be achieved after PALF. This has been demonstrated in auxiliary liver transplantation for PALF where 70% of recipients were able to regenerate their native liver [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) improves synthetic and detoxification functions in small animal models of acute liver failure [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HT, if shown to be safe and efficacious in acute liver failure, could bridge the patient to full recovery if the native liver regenerates or, failing this, support them until a suitable organ is available for LT. HT has multiple advantages over LT. Hepatocyte isolation can yield billions of cells from a single donor liver, that can be used to treat multiple patients. These cells can be cryopreserved for a number of years, providing an off-the-shelf treatment in emergency situations such as PALF. The encapsulation of hepatocytes in alginate protects them from the recipient immune system and precludes the need for immunosuppression, unlike in LT. The intraperitoneal route of administration of microbeads allows large volumes to be infused. HT when delivered intraperitoneally is less invasive than LT. The safety and possibly short-term efficacy of encapsulated hepatocytes has been observed in a named patient use [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mesenchymal stromal cells are known to improve the viability and function of hepatocytes [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288185.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We have now developed a novel microbead prototype (HMB002) using modified alginate and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) under good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. Safety and medium-term efficacy (up to 24 weeks while awaiting liver regeneration) need to be studied.</p>

                <title>Trial objectives</title>
                <p>The trial objective is to evaluate if HMB002 is a safe and effective form of liver support in Pediatric acute liver failure to bridge the patient to native liver survival or liver transplantation. This study will involve intraperitoneal infusion of HMB002. The exact formulation of HMB002 is proprietary but the infusate will consist of alginate beads suspended in transplant medium (1:1 v/v). This is given as a single infusion under ultrasound guidance while observing for any adverse events related to increase in intrabdominal pressure. This will be in addition to standard of care in Pediatric acute liver failure. The beads will be removed using laparoscopy prior to discharge of the patient from hospital, or at time of transplantation, to minimize or eliminate the risk of adhesions within the peritoneal cavity.</p>

                <title>Trial design</title>
                <p>This is an, open-label, single-arm, single centre study. A Simon’s two-stage design for a one-sample exact test will be used. We assume a one-year survival rate of 0.20 or less under the null hypothesis, and 0.5 or more under the alternative, with 80% power and 5% type I error rate.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome survival measure is set at 24-weeks. Although response to treatment is anticipated to be within the first 4–6 weeks, short to medium term morbidity in children who have been critically unwell in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or High Dependency Unit (HDU), is best determined at a longer time point such as 24 weeks. This way almost all possible later deaths due to the acute liver failure (or early post-transplant deaths) will be effectively captured.</p>

                  <title>Sample size</title>
                  <p>Simon’s two-stage design for a one-sample exact test was estimated, assuming a one-year survival rate of 0.20 or less under the null hypothesis, and 0.5 or more under the alternative, with 80% power and 5% type I error rate. A total of 17 patients will be recruited into the study (at the end of stages 1 and 2). 9 patients will be recruited into the study in the first stage. Once 9 patients have completed their 24 weeks visit, the study will stop for futility if only 2 or fewer patients have survived with the native liver. At the end of the second stage, if 7 or more patients out of the 17 enrolled have survived with native liver at 24 weeks post HMB002 treatment, this will demonstrate proof of concept. DSMB approval is required for progression to Stage 2, where the trial will continue to recruit a further 8 patients. this will be extended to 17 patients as part of the Simon two stage design if there is evidence to support continuation. A long-term follow-up period will be used to monitor safety over a 10-year period post investigational medicinal product (IMP) infusion.</p>

                  <p>We will aim to recruit the 17 patients (stage 1 and 2) in approximately 36 months. Each individual patient will be intensively followed up for 52 weeks after receiving HMB002 infusion and then for long-term safety monitoring for a further 9 years. The end of the trial will be defined as the last patient 10-year annual follow up post IMP infusion. The duration of the study will also depend on the progression of the study from stage 1 to stage 2.

                      <p><sup>a</sup> Screening and infusion may take place on the same day (Day 0) depending on clinical decision by delegated physician. <sup>b</sup> HMB002 infusion will be performed on Day 0 following complete review of all inclusion and exclusion criteria and completion of all pre-infusion checks. See section 4.3 Dosing regimen for details on dosing intervals between subsequent patients. <sup>c</sup> Urine or serum pregnancy test (in cases of oliguria) will be performed in females of child bearing potential (FOCBP). FOCBP will only be included after a confirmed negative pregnancy test at screening. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to inclusion into the study. However, patients will be hospitalised at the time of screening and until recovery of their native liver or after transplant. Hence, during hospitalisation it is assumed that patients will be sexually abstinent, which is considered a highly effective method of contraception. Therefore, females of child bearing age are eligible for the trial without need for any additional testing or contraception. Should the patient survive with or without liver transplantation, participants will be advised as to highly effective methods of contraception if this is this is appropriate. <sup>d</sup> Intra-abdominal pressure will be measured using urinary catheter where possible, at pre-dose (10 minutes prior to start of IMP infusion) and post dose: 1 hr, 8 hrs and 24 hrs (day1). <sup>e</sup> IMP Infusion site to be reviewed at 2 hrs, 4hrs, 6 hrs, 8hrs, 12 hrs and 24 hrs post infusion. <sup>f</sup> Vital signs include Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR), Respiratory Rate (RR), Temperature and Oxygen Saturation (02 Sats). On Day 0, vital signs will be taken at Pre-dose (approximately 30 mins and 10 mins prior to start of IMP infusion) and Post-dose: 30mins, 1hr, 1.5hrs, 2 hrs, 2.5 hours, 3 hrs, 3.5 hrs 4 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hrs and 24 hrs (Day1). <sup>g</sup> Recording of ventilator settings, ionotropic support (including drugs and dose) and need for renal replacement therapy will be collected as part of standard supportive treatment. On Day 0, supportive treatment data will be collected at pre-dose (30 mins and 10 mins prior to start of IMP infusion and post dose: 30mins, 1hr, 1.5hr, 2hrs, 2.5hrs, 3hrs, 3.5hrs, 4hrs, 8hrs, 12 hrs &amp; 24 hrs(Day 1). <sup>h</sup> Clinical Blood Tests 1 include haematology (full blood count and differentials), clotting factors (INR, APTT, fibrinogen) liver function tests (ALT, AST, Creatine Kinase, Total bilirubin, Conjugated bilirubin (only done at screening and if clinically applicable), ALP, Albumin, total protein), urea and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, creatinine) and Ammonia. At Day 0, bloods will be taken pre-dose (between -4 to -1 hour prior to IMP infusion) and post dose: 1 hr, 8hrs, 16hrs and 24hrs (day1). <sup>i</sup> Clinical Blood tests 2 include blood glucose, lactate and blood gases (pH, Partial pressure of O2, Partial pressure of carbon dioxide, standard bicarbonate). On Day 0, these blood will be taken pre dose (10mins prior to start of IMP infusion) and post dose: 1hr, 2hrs, 4hrs, 8hrs, 16hrs, 24hrs (day1). <sup>j</sup> Bloods for translational research on Day 0 –to be taken approximately 10 mins prior to IMP infusion and 1 hour post IMP infusion. Aliquots of certain human products (fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and albumin) administered as part of standard of care will also be sent as controls. <sup>k</sup> Neurological Assessment includes Glasgow Coma Scale and Pupil response. <sup>l</sup> PedsQL<sup>™</sup> Quality of Life Inventory questionnaires for parent and child will be optional; completed at screening and week 52 visits. <sup>m</sup> The beads will be removed using laparoscopy prior to discharge of the patient from hospital or washed out at the time of transplantation, whichever occurs first. Usually this will be within 4 weeks of the procedure but in any case, microbeads will be retrieved within 24 weeks of HMB002 infusion. <sup>n</sup> Live<bold>r</bold> Transplant form will be completed for those patients who go onto receive a transplant within the duration of the study. <sup>o</sup> Patients will be discharged from hospital following recovery with either native liver or post liver transplant. Discharge post IMP infusion form to be completed. <sup>p</sup> End of study/withdrawal form will be completed following completion of the study or for those patients who did not complete the study. <sup>q</sup> All outpatient study visits following discharge, will have a flexible window of +/- 3 days except week 52 visits where +/- 7 days is permitted. <sup>r</sup> Long term follow up data will be collected annually within +/- 1 month window. FBC, LFT and abdominal ultrasound will be collected annually until year 5 post IMP. SAEs and associated concomitant medications (except SAEs excluded from reporting) will be collected until end of study.</p>

                  <p>Safety parameters and adverse event (AE, SAE, SAR and SUSAR) information will be collected from the point of parent/legal guardian consent until week 52 post IMP administration. During the infusion and for at least 24 hours afterwards the patient will be continuously monitored in PICU / NICU / HDU. Intra-abdominal pressure will be monitored via the bladder if possible. Safety will be assessed using history of symptoms which have occurred or worsened since study commencement, physical examination, blood tests including white cell count, haemoglobin, platelets, Urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, lactate, venous blood gas. While an inpatient, need for intervention and escalation of care will also be recorded. Ultrasound may be used to assess for intra-abdominal bleeding.</p>
                  <p>During long term follow up (post week 52 visit), AEs and SAES will be documented in the medical notes as per routine care practise and reviewed by clinicians. However, only SAEs, SARs and SUSARS will be reported (excluding known complications following liver transplant). Any serious adverse events that are deemed related to the IMP will be considered unexpected (SUSARs). All liver transplants will be reported as an SAE. However, known complications which are universal in patients post liver transplant will not be reported as SAEs to the sponsor, unless they result in death, are considered to be related to the study drug or worse than what would normally be expected.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Our previous alginate encapsulation technique used PRONOVA<sup>™</sup> UP, an ultrapure alginate that satisfied GMP standards. We had optimised the alginate percentage, cell density and bead size allowing the best cell survival, and demonstrated that this alginate was not immunogenic using in vitro tests [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, this alginate led to limited in vitro cell survival. The development of HMB002 followed the hypothesis that co-encapsulation of hepatocytes with MSCs, in modified alginate microbeads, would substantially improve the survival and function of hepatocytes and be a feasible and effective form of cellular therapy for acute liver failure [<xref rid="pone.0288185.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288185.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>This trial, while demonstrating the safety of HMB002 would support the design of a larger study if the intervention is found to be safe. The trial will also report 52-week survival outcome. This is not anticipated to change from 24-week outcome as this trial is to attempt to rescue acute liver failure. If the 52-week outcome differs from the 24-week outcome this observation will be an important consideration in the design of any future trial. The target population is too small and too unwell to do any significant dose escalation study.</p>
