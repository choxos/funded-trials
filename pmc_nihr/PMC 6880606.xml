                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects 30–50% of women at some time in their lives and is an embarrassing and distressing condition which can be associated with potentially serious comorbidities. Current antibiotic treatments such as metronidazole are effective but can result in side effects, and recurrence is common. This trial aims to investigate whether lactic acid gel is clinically effective and cost effective in the treatment of recurrent BV compared with metronidazole.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">VITA is an open-label, multicentre, parallel group randomised controlled trial for women with a clinical diagnosis of BV and at least one previous BV episode in the past 2 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intravaginal lactic acid gel 5 ml once daily for 7 days or oral metronidazole tablets 400 mg twice daily for 7 days. All participants will be followed up for 6 months to assess health status and healthcare costs. A subgroup will be interviewed to further explore adherence, tolerability and acceptability of treatment. The estimated sample size is 1900 participants to detect a 6% absolute increase in response rate to 86% in those receiving lactic acid gel. The primary outcome is participant-reported resolution of BV at Week 2.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Results from this trial will help inform UK treatment guidelines for BV and may provide an alternative effective treatment for recurrent episodes of this condition which avoids repeated exposure to antibiotics.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par22">Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition which causes an offensive smelling vaginal discharge and is associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission, pelvic inflammatory disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The normal bacteria found in the vagina include numerous lactobacilli which produce lactic acid maintaining a low pH and inhibiting the growth of other bacteria. In BV the pH rises in association with loss of lactobacilli and there is an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Current treatment with oral antibiotics to reduce the associated overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina can be effective in the short term, but it is frequently associated with side effects and 30% rate of recurrence over the subsequent 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], necessitating repeated antibiotic treatment. Knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis of BV is limited and the factor(s) initiating BV are unknown, although viral bacteriophages, novel sexually transmitted bacteria, bacterial biofilms and disruption to the bacterial microbiome have all been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par24">BV was diagnosed in 100,636 women attending sexual health clinics in England in 2014, and around 30,000 women will have recurrent BV within 3 months of their initial treatment. The prevalence of BV has not changed significantly over the past 5 years (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par25">The recurrent nature of BV leads to frequent use of antibiotics. The use of lactic acid gel as treatment would reduce antibiotic exposure in the population as recommended in the ‘Action plan to support the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy 2013 to 2018’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-antimicrobial-resistance-strategy-2103-to-2018">www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-5-year-antimicrobial-resistance-strategy-2103-to-2018</ext-link>) and the ‘European strategic action plan on antibiotic resistance 2011–2016’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.euro.who.int/_data/assets/pdf_file/0011/148988/RC61_Pres_Rodier_antibiotic_resistance.pdf">www.euro.who.int/_data/assets/pdf_file/0011/148988/RC61_Pres_Rodier_antibiotic_resistance.pdf</ext-link>).</p>
              <p id="Par26">Lactic acid gel (pH 4.5) used intravaginally replicates the production of lactic acid by lactobacilli in the normal vagina. Previous small studies of daily intravaginal acid gel or pessary for the treatment of BV have reported inconsistent results, with efficacy ranging between 18 and 100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The regimen used most commonly in previous trials was once daily application for 1 week, and an increased frequency of dosing did not affect the response rate (efficacy 23–93% for once daily versus 18–100% for twice daily). To permit comparison with previous trials, to maximise participant acceptability and because the effectiveness of this regimen remains unconfirmed, we propose using 4.5% lactic acid gel inserted intravaginally once a day for 7 days. Although the use of topical lactic acid gel is not recommended in current BV treatment guidelines due to a lack of evidence from well-designed randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the proposed trial will advance our understanding by assessing whether intravaginal lactic acid gel is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of recurrent BV, and can reduce antibiotic usage in this large group of women.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The factors affecting the acceptability of topical treatment for BV are not known, and a qualitative assessment of adherence to and acceptability of treatment, and how these can be improved, will be performed.</p>
              <p id="Par28">BV is a common disease with serious physical and psychological sequelae. There is therefore the potential for substantial health gain if a more effective and well-tolerated regimen can be identified, which also reduces antibiotic exposure. The prospects for the study findings to influence clinical practice are high based on the multicentre approach including primary care, robust study design, existing availability of lactic acid gel and identified need to limit antibiotic use to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>Justification for design</title>
                <p id="Par29">This trial will compare the effectiveness, tolerability, adherence, acceptability and cost effectiveness in participants with BV randomised to intravaginal lactic acid gel (intervention) versus those randomised to oral metronidazole (control). A pragmatic trial design is used to maximise its relevance to patients and clinicians and to facilitate rapid adoption into clinical practice. A qualitative assessment will also investigate the acceptability of treatment, and if necessary, address issues raised by participants.</p>
                <p id="Par30">A superiority design has been chosen and powered to detect an absolute difference of 6% in the resolution of BV between the two treatment arms, with an assumed effectiveness of oral metronidazole of 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par31">There will be no blinding of participants to treatment, as this will maximise treatment compliance and allow comparison of the acceptability of the two treatments. A double placebo (“double dummy”) design for oral versus vaginal modes of treatment delivery was not considered to be acceptable to most women.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Participants will take their own vaginal samples at baseline and at the Week 2 follow-up. The taking of such samples is widely used in clinical practice and is acceptable to women. At their baseline visit, participants will be instructed on how to take their own vaginal samples; they will then take their own baseline samples, which will be shipped to a central laboratory by site staff. Before they leave the clinic (or General Practitioner [GP] practice), participants will be provided with a second sampling kit and instructions for taking their own vaginal samples at home at Week 2.</p>
                <p id="Par33">After the baseline visit, participants will not be required to attend any further face-to-face visits, reflecting usual clinical practice. All follow-up data will be collected by participants via online questionnaires.</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Choice of treatment</title>
                <p id="Par34">The aim of this trial is to determine if using lactic acid gel in the vagina to ‘replace’ vaginal acidity is better than oral metronidazole for treatment of BV. Some previous studies have suggested that this approach could be successful, but they are not conclusive, and current guidelines highlight a need for more evidence before recommending the use of intravaginal lactic acid gel.</p>
                <p id="Par35">Previous small studies of daily intravaginal acid gel or pessary for the treatment of BV have reported inconsistent results with efficacies of 18–100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The regimen used most commonly in previous trials was once daily application for 7 days, and an increased frequency of dosing did not affect the response rate (efficacy 23–93% for once/day compared with 18–100% for twice/day). To permit comparison with previous trials, the intervention group will receive a regimen of lactic acid gel inserted intravaginally once a day for 7 days, to maximise participant acceptability and because the effectiveness of this regimen remains unconfirmed.</p>
                <p id="Par36">If effective, the use of lactic acid gel will result in decreased antibiotic treatment use, which will maintain the balance between the gut bacteria (microbiome) for individual participants and reduce the potential for development of antimicrobial resistance in the community. In addition, it will provide an alternative treatment for women who have failed to respond to current treatment for BV with systemic antibiotics.</p>
                <p id="Par37">The control group will receive a 7-day course of twice daily 400 mg oral metronidazole. This has been chosen as the comparator because it is recommended as first line therapy in the UK national BV treatment guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], it is active against a wide range of the anaerobic bacteria associated with BV and it is commonly used in clinical practice supported by evidence from randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>

                <title>Aims and objectives</title>
                <p id="Par38">The trial hypothesis is that intravaginal lactic acid gel is clinically effective and cost effective in the treatment (i.e. resolution of symptoms) of women with recurrent BV compared with oral metronidazole. The aim is to test this hypothesis by comparing symptom resolution in the intervention group (receiving intravaginal lactic acid gel) with the control group (receiving oral metronidazole) for women with recurrent BV.</p>
                <p id="Par39">The primary objective of the trial is to determine whether intravaginal lactic acid gel is better than oral metronidazole for symptomatic resolution of recurrent BV. Secondary objectives include the following: comparing the time to first recurrence of BV symptoms; comparing the frequency of BV episodes over 6 months; comparing the frequency of BV treatments required over 6 months; comparing microbiological resolution of BV on microscopy 2 weeks after presentation; comparing the tolerability profiles of lactic acid gel and metronidazole; comparing adherence to lactic acid gel versus metronidazole tablets; comparing acceptability of use of lactic acid gel versus metronidazole tablets; determining comparative presence of concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at baseline and at Week 2; comparing quality of life (measured using the SF-12™ Health Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]); comparing the cost effectiveness of using intravaginal lactic acid gel versus oral metronidazole tablets. In addition, samples for further microbiological analysis, including gene sequencing, will be collected for future investigation into the factors associated with successful treatment.</p>

                <p id="Par40">The primary outcome is resolution of BV based on participant-reported resolution of symptoms at Week 2. Secondary outcome measures are as follows: time to first recurrence of BV; number of participant-reported BV episodes over 6 months; number of participant-reported BV treatment courses over 6 months; microbiological resolution of BV on microscopy of vaginal smears at Week 2; comparative tolerability of lactic acid gel and metronidazole assessed by web-based participant reporting of side effects (including nausea, vomiting, taste disturbance, vaginal irritation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain) and via participant telephone interviews; participant-reported adherence to treatment; acceptability of treatments via qualitative assessment in a subgroup of participants; prevalence of concurrent STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis) at baseline and at Week 2; quality of life as assessed by SF-12™ Health Survey at baseline, Week 2 and 6 months; comparative cost effectiveness of using intravaginal lactic acid gel versus oral metronidazole tablets via National Health Service (NHS) Service use questionnaire.</p>

                <title>Qualitative telephone interviews</title>
                <p id="Par76">A subgroup of participants will be contacted for semi-structured telephone interviews to explore acceptability and adherence to trial treatment, and how these can be optimised. A random sample of participants who gave optional consent to be contacted will be recruited until initial analysis suggests data saturation. The sample size will then be reviewed to check that it is representative of the trial target population in terms of age, ethnicity, recruiting site and number of BV episodes. Where necessary, further participants will be recruited to ensure a diverse spread of the target population. The final sample size is expected to be approximately 30 participants (15 in each trial arm). Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed and uploaded into NVivo to assist with data management. Transcripts will be coded and analysed thematically.</p>

                <p id="Par77">At the baseline visit, participants will be provided with a kit for taking their own vaginal samples at Week 2. The central laboratory will perform the following tests on vaginal samples taken at baseline and at Week 2: microscopic assessment of BV; nucleic acid amplification tests for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis. Results will be returned within 1–2 months for the recruiting site to review (investigator and research nurse) and to arrange further testing or treatment according to local protocols. These trial tests will not form the basis for patient management at the baseline visit; clinicians will take additional tests processed locally to inform immediate patient care as indicated by the patient’s clinical presentation.</p>

                <title>Adverse events and pregnancy reporting</title>
                <p id="Par78">The safety profiles of the treatments in this trial are well characterised. Metronidazole is being used for its licensed indication and lactic acid gel is being used within its intended use covered by the CE mark. In order to provide secondary outcome data to compare tolerability of the two treatments, specified adverse reactions experienced during trial treatment will be reported. The following are regarded as expected for the purpose of this trial and will be reported on the Week 2 questionnaire completed by the participant: nausea, vomiting, taste changes, vaginal irritation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea. Serious adverse events are not anticipated in this low-risk trial but will be recorded if reported by participants.</p>
                <p id="Par79">Although lactic acid gel is considered safe for use in pregnancy and metronidazole is frequently prescribed for treatment of BV in pregnancy, patients will be asked to confirm that they are not pregnant as part of the screening process. Participants will also be asked to confirm their pregnancy status during their follow-up period. Any pregnancies reported during the period between randomisation and Week 2 will be followed up for outcomes.</p>

                  <p id="Par82">The analysis and reporting of the trial will be in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. A full Statistical Analysis Plan will be developed and agreed prior to database lock and unblinding of the analysing statistician. Continuous variables will be summarised in terms of the mean, standard deviation, median, lower and upper quartiles, minimum, maximum and number of observations. Categorical variables will be summarised in terms of frequency counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics of demographic and clinical measures will be used to assess balance between the randomised arms at baseline, but no formal statistical comparisons will be made.</p>
                  <p id="Par83">The primary approach to between-group comparative analyses will be by the modified intention-to-treat method, i.e. including all participants who have been randomised and without imputation of missing outcome data. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to investigate the impact of missing data and adherence to treatment.</p>
                  <p id="Par84">The evaluation of the primary outcome will be performed using a mixed effects model for binary outcome that includes factors used in the minimisation. The comparison of lactic acid gel with oral metronidazole will be presented using the risk difference in the proportion of participants who reported resolution of symptoms at Week 2, along with the 95% confidence interval (CI).</p>
                  <p id="Par85">Secondary outcomes will be analysed using appropriate regression models dependent on data type (binary, continuous, count, survival, etc.) and will include factors used in the minimisation and baseline value of the outcome where measured. The analyses of secondary outcomes will be considered supportive to the primary, and estimates and <italic>p</italic> values, where presented, should be interpreted in this light.</p>

Since the trial is powered to detect overall differences between the groups rather than interactions of this kind, these subgroup analyses will be regarded as exploratory.</p>

Resource use data will be collected prospectively via nurse/assessor/participant completed forms and will include questions on treatment use, GP or other clinic visits to estimate the costs associated with the administration of both treatments. The main resources to be monitored include: (1) additional staff time for explaining the lactic acid intervention and responding to concerns associated with treatment; (2) time and resources associated with clinical examination, additional medication and monitoring during the follow-up period as well as treating any adverse events; (3) the costs associated with treatment, for example the costs of lactic acid gel and applicators.</p>

              <p id="Par112">This trial uses a pragmatic design to maximise its relevance to clinicians and participants, to help ensure rapid adoption into clinical practice and to provide value for money. If effective, the use of lactic acid gel will provide an alternative treatment for women who have failed to respond to previous therapy for BV, benefitting both patients and the NHS. It will also result in decreased antibiotic use, which will maintain the balance of the gut bacteria (microbiome) for individually treated participants in addition to reducing the potential for the development of antimicrobial resistance in the community. This is an important area for clinical research, and results from the trial will help inform UK treatment guidelines for BV in addition to supporting the Department of Health’s Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
