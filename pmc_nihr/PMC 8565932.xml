                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>OnCovid is an active European registry study enrolling consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with a history of solid or haematological malignancy and who had a diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this retrospective study, patients were enrolled from 35 institutions across Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, and entered into the registry at the point of data lock (March 1, 2021), were eligible for analysis. The present analysis was focused on COVID-19 survivors who underwent clinical reassessment at each participating institution. We documented prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and described factors associated with their development and their association with post-COVID-19 survival, which was defined as the interval from post-COVID-19 reassessment to the patients’ death or last follow-up. We also evaluated resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients treated within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis. The OnCovid study is registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs61">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT04393974" id="interrefs62">NCT04393974</ext-link>.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>2795 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, were entered into the study by the time of the data lock on March 1, 2021. After the exclusion of ineligible patients, the final study population consisted of 2634 patients. 1557 COVID-19 survivors underwent a formal clinical reassessment after a median of 22·1 months (IQR 8·4–57·8) from cancer diagnosis and 44 days (28–329) from COVID-19 diagnosis. 234 (15·0%) patients reported COVID-19 sequelae, including respiratory symptoms (116 [49·6%]) and residual fatigue (96 [41·0%]). Sequelae were more common in men (<italic>vs</italic> women; p=0·041), patients aged 65 years or older (<italic>vs</italic> other age groups; p=0·048), patients with two or more comorbidities (<italic>vs</italic> one or none; p=0·0006), and patients with a history of smoking (<italic>vs</italic> no smoking history; p=0·0004). Sequelae were associated with hospitalisation for COVID-19 (p&lt;0·0001), complicated COVID-19 (p&lt;0·0001), and COVID-19 therapy (p=0·0002). With a median post-COVID-19 follow-up of 128 days (95% CI 113–148), COVID-19 sequelae were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1·80 [95% CI 1·18–2·75]) after adjusting for time to post-COVID-19 reassessment, sex, age, comorbidity burden, tumour characteristics, anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 severity. Among 466 patients on systemic anti-cancer therapy, 70 (15·0%) permanently discontinued therapy, and 178 (38·2%) resumed treatment with a dose or regimen adjustment. Permanent treatment discontinuations were independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3·53 [95% CI 1·45–8·59]), but dose or regimen adjustments were not (0·84 [0·35–2·02]).</p>

                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Sequelae post-COVID-19 affect up to 15% of patients with cancer and adversely affect survival and oncological outcomes after recovery. Adjustments to systemic anti-cancer therapy can be safely pursued in treatment-eligible patients.</p>

                <p id="para50">OnCovid is an active European registry study enrolling consecutive patients who are aged 18 years or older, have a diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> and have a history of solid or haematological malignancy (either active or in remission at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis). The study population was accrued from 35 institutions across six countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>). Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, were included at the time of data lock (March 1, 2021), and COVID-19 survivors reassessed at participating institutions after COVID-19 recovery were eligible for analysis in this study.</p>
                <p id="para60">OnCovid was granted central approval by the UK Health Research Authority (UK HRA; 20/HRA/1608) and by the corresponding research ethics committees at each participating institution. Full waiver of consent was granted by the UK HRA because of the the anonymised nature of patient data and retrospective nature of the study. Core study data were collated from electronic medical records into a case report form designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture software (REDCap, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA). Multisite access and data curation was coordinated by the Medical Statistics Unit in Novara (Italy).</p>

                    </p>
                    <p id="para90">We searched PubMed from database inception to July 24, 2021, for articles published in English on the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer using the search terms (“COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”) AND (“oncology” OR “cancer” OR “malignancy”). Although registry studies have provided evidence of high case fatality rates (ranging from 20–40%), there is no evidence to document the medium-term and long-term outcomes of these patients. In particular, the prevalence and clinical impact of COVID-19 sequelae is poorly understood in patients with cancer. Most published studies derived information on the impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer by evaluating all-cause mortality during short observation times without considering the longer-term impact of COVID-19 and discontinuation of anticancer therapy in COVID-19 survivors.</p>
                    <p id="para100">
                      <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
                    </p>
                    <p id="para110">To our knowledge, this is the first study to document that 15% of patients with cancer who survive COVID-19 have a wide range of sequelae, most commonly fatigue and respiratory symptoms. We found that patients with sequelae from COVID-19 have significantly inferior survival and are more likely to permanently discontinue systemic anti-cancer therapy. Only permanent treatment discontinuations, not treatment modifications, led to inferior survival outcomes; a finding that supports efforts aimed at continuing to actively manage a patient population viewed as being highly clinically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

                    <p id="para130">Our study describes the clinical characteristics of patients who survive COVID-19. Clinical evidence of post-COVID-19 syndrome is documented in 15% of patients with cancer, in whom COVID-19 sequelae represent a significant barrier towards the continuation of systemic therapy. Prospective studies are urgently needed to identify effective management strategies of COVID-19 related sequelae.</p>

                <p id="para140">Methods have been previously published.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The clinical definition of COVID-19 followed WHO criteria.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In this analysis, we focused on patients who survived COVID-19 and underwent a formal clinical reassessment in the oncology clinic at each participating institution after recovery from COVID-19. The timing of follow-up was not standardised but dictated as per standard of care at each institution.</p>
                <p id="para150">We documented prevalence and type of COVID-19 sequelae at the time of first oncological assessment after COVID-19 recovery. These data were assessed by treating physicians during clinical consultation on the basis of symptom review, physical examination, and imaging or laboratory findings. Patients were evaluated at each participating institution by investigators as per local practice, when clinically indicated.</p>
                <p id="para160">No predefined timepoints for follow-up were dictated to treating physicians and patients were entered into the database at any time of their COVID-19 history. Clinical definitions of COVID-19 sequelae followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Sequelae were categorised according to the system or organ involved into respiratory symptoms (including dyspnoea and chronic chough), residual fatigue, weight loss, neurocognitive sequelae (including cognitive impairment, visual impairment, anosmia, dysosmia, aysgeusia, dysgeusia, headache, confusion, and lethargy), non-respiratory residual organ dysfunction (including heart failure and kidney failure), and others (eg, residual fever, muscle cramps, arthralgia, and skin conditions).</p>
                <p id="para170">To describe clinical attitudes towards resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy, investigators were asked to provide, when available, the specific reason underlying permanent cessations of systemic anti-cancer therapy (among performance status deterioration, disease progression during COVID-19, and residual organ disfunction) and dose or regimen adjustments (including avoiding potential immune suppression or other adverse events, reducing hospital attendance, avoiding intravenous administration, and others; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>).</p>
                <p id="para180">To evaluate the post-COVID-19 anti-SARS-CoV-2-S (spike) IgG seroprevalence, investigators were asked to report pre-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG antibody information, as per local national guidelines.

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="para190">The main objectives of this analysis were to describe prevalence and impact of COVID-19 sequelae and post-COVID-19 systemic anti-cancer therapy resumption in the OnCovid population. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact on the risk of death of COVID-19 sequelae and permanent cessation or regimen adjustments of systemic anti-cancer therapy in the relevant analyses.</p>
                <p id="para200">For statistical analyses, COVID-19 sequelae were clustered as respiratory (either alone or combined with other complications) and non-respiratory sequelae, and according to the presence of more than one concomitant sequelae. In addition, to provide an estimate of COVID-19 severity and sequelae distribution across different age groups, we reported sequalae proportions with the corresponding rates of COVID-19 complications and hospital admission due to COVID-19 within six predefined age categories: &lt;40 years, 40–49 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, and ≥80 years.</p>
                <p id="para210">We evaluated the impact of sequelae on post-COVID-19 survival (ie, after recovery from COVID-19, measured in days) with univariable and multivariable analysis, defined as the interval from the date of the first post-COVID-19 clinical reassessment and the date of patients’ death or last follow-up. Accounting for the unbalanced distribution of patient and disease-related features across the subgroups, we adopted a fixed multivariable regression model, adjusting all survival estimates for clinical characteristics already known to affect clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and cancer.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The included covariates were incorporated following clinical prioritisation. All of the included covariates have been shown to be associated with both the short-term (30-day mortality) and medium-term (6-month mortality) outcomes at the latest update of the registry, which included 1392 patients.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref>
</p>
                <p id="para220">The following variables of interest were used as covariates within the survival analysis: (1) sex (male <italic>vs</italic> female), (2) age (≥65 years <italic>vs</italic> &lt;65 years), (3) number of comorbidities (0–1 <italic>vs</italic> ≥2; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>), (4) primary tumour (clustered as breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological or genitourinary, haematological, thoracic, or other), (5) tumour stage (defined as advanced <italic>vs</italic> non-advanced by radiological assessment for solid tumours or disease-specific criteria [eg, Rai and Binet criteria for haematological malignancies]), (6) tumour status (presence of active <italic>vs</italic> non-active disease by disease-specific criteria), (7) receipt of any anticancer therapy within 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including non-systemic therapy (yes <italic>vs</italic> no), (8) having at least one COVID-19 complication, including acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, kidney injury, secondary infection, sepsis, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, or other (yes <italic>vs</italic> no), (9) receipt of any COVID-19-specific therapy, including antivirals, antimalarials, antibiotics, corticosteroids, or other (yes <italic>vs</italic> no), and (10) hospitalisation (pre-existing for any cause, including cancer <italic>vs</italic> due to COVID-19 <italic>vs</italic> not required).</p>
                <p id="para230">Because COVID-19 survivors were assessed at multiple timepoints throughout the study, we also evaluated the prognostic impact of time from cancer diagnosis to post-COVID-19 reassessment (patients with missing date of cancer diagnosis were excluded) and time from COVID-19 diagnosis to post-COVID-19 reassessment. Additionally, we provided separate analysis reporting of the impact of sequelae on post-COVID-19 survival in patients with remission or non-measurable disease versus active malignancy. We then evaluated patterns of resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients who were on active treatment within 4 weeks of their COVID-19 diagnosis. Additionally, we evaluated the associations between systemic anti-cancer therapy dose adjustments, permanent discontinuation of systemic anti-cancer therapy, and patients’ characteristics, and described the corresponding proportion of COVID-19 sequelae according to systemic anti-cancer resumption pathways (ie, unchanged, resumption following dose or regimen adjustments, and cessation). We also evaluated the impact of different patterns of systemic anti-cancer therapy resumption on post-COVID-19 survival with univariable and multivariable analysis, following the same criteria.</p>
                <p id="para240">Lastly, we evaluated the post-COVID-19 anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG seroprevalence in a subgroup of patients. To define patient or disease characteristics possibly related to seroconversion, their distribution according to antibody status were analysed with univariable analysis. Serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested in clinical practice at participating institutions and seroconversion was defined as the presence of a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG antibody test after COVID-19 resolution. Given the pragmatic nature of this registry, for all analyses, we decided to exclude all patients with incomplete information, missing information, or who did not have follow-up data after COVID-19 diagnosis to preserve the integrity of our results and avoid incurring bias, as per standard of care clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="para250">Baseline characteristics were summarised as categorical variables and reported using descriptive statistics. Associations between categorical variables were tested using Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> test. Linear trends were tested with the Cochran-Armitage test. All time-to-event intervals without censored data, including time from cancer diagnosis or COVID-19 diagnosis to post-COVID-19 reassessment, were reported as median values with relative IQR. Survival intervals were computed from post-COVID-19 reassessment at each participating institution to death or last follow-up. All estimates and analyses of post-COVID-19 survival were done with the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons computed with the log-rank test. A p value of less than 0·05 was considered significant.

              <p id="para380">In patients who were on systemic anti-cancer therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, patients who continued or resumed systemic anti-cancer therapy with dose or regimen adjustments had a similar outcome compared with those who continued or resumed systemic anti-cancer therapy without changes to dosage or regimen (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>D). However, systemic anti-cancer therapy discontinuation was associated with shortened post-COVID-19 survival compared with that for patients with unchanged therapy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>D). After adjusting for sex, age, comorbidity burden, primary tumour, tumour stage and status, receipt of COVID-19 therapy, presence of complicated COVID-19, hospitalisation, and sequelae, permanent systemic anti-cancer therapy cessation was confirmed to be independently associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3·53 [95% CI 1·45–8·59]; p=0·0017) but dose or regimen adjustments were not (0·84 [0·35–2·02], p=0·2744; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para400">To our knowledge, this study provides for the first time a detailed account of clinical characteristics and outcomes from the largest European registry of patients with cancer and COVID-19, focusing specifically on SARS-CoV-2 infection survivors. Despite evidence of protective anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres in over 90% of evaluable patients, we identified that 15% of COVID-19 survivors with cancer present to their first oncological follow-up with sequelae from SARS-CoV-2 infection, most commonly fatigue and respiratory symptoms. We provide novel and clinically important evidence showing that the presence of COVID-19-related sequelae identifies a subgroup of patients with significantly worse survival independent of background oncological characteristics and risk factors for worse outcome from COVID-19.</p>
              <p id="para410">Evolving evidence suggests that morbidity from COVID-19 extends beyond the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 replication within the host. Alongside complications that occur during the acute phase of the disease, the persistence of symptoms beyond 21 days after infection has been described in 36% of patients who survive COVID-19.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Up to 25% of patients report symptoms for more than 6 months after COVID-19 resolution,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> with evidence of psychophysical compromise requiring medical treatment in 14% of COVID-19 survivors.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para420">Protracted asthenia is a dominant symptomatic consequence from SARS-CoV-2 infection in over 60% of hospitalised COVID-19 survivors up to 6 months after discharge.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Similarly, dyspnoea and other respiratory symptoms are highly prevalent in the post-acute phase, especially after severe COVID-19.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> In line with published evidence, we show that sequelae are more likely in patients with cancer who had been hospitalised or treated medically for severe COVID-19 and in patients who, before COVID-19, displayed significant risk factors for life-threatening illness, including older age, male sex, higher comorbidity burden, and a history of smoking .<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para430">Given the positive association between age and rates of complicated COVID-19, we evaluated the age-related distribution of COVID-19-related sequelae in the OnCovid population. Surprisingly, we reported a peak in the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae in patients in the seventh decade of life, highlighting a non-progressive association between age, COVID-19 severity, and proportion of hospitalisation. Although it is recognised that post-COVID-19 syndrome can affect young patients and those who were never hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 infection,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> the reduction in the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae in patients aged 80 years and older is an unexpected finding, suggesting a potential role for immune senescence as a mechanistic contributor that leads to higher mortality but lower risk of developing sequelae.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</p>
              <p id="para440">Oncological characteristics, including tumour stage, presence of active cancer, and, most importantly, exposure to anti-cancer therapy before COVID-19 were not associated with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 sequelae; a finding of paramount importance in understanding the natural course of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer as it provides further data in support of the safe delivery of anti-cancer therapy in the context of an ongoing pandemic threat.</p>
              <p id="para450">Although this study is, to our knowledge, the first to show the association between COVID-19 sequelae and worse survival outcomes in patients with cancer, consolidating evidence suggests that radiological, biochemical, and symptomatic impairment of at least one physiological function is documented in up to 70% of COVID-19 survivors<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> and that ensuing multi-organ dysfunction contributes to a substantial excess in mortality after initial hospitalisation for COVID-19.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para460">Unlike populations without cancer, outcomes of patients with cancer who survive COVID-19 are strongly affected by features of underlying malignancy and capacity to continue or promptly resume effective anti-cancer treatment. This observation is particularly true for our dataset, in which 50% of patients had a diagnosis of advanced malignancy and 66% had active disease at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
              <p id="para470">In our study, resumption of systemic anti-cancer therapy occurred in most patients who survived COVID-19. Patients with haematological malignancies reported the highest rates of treatment cessations or modifications. This finding is perhaps unsurprising considering the higher clinical vulnerability to COVID-19 of this patient group<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> and the higher intensity of treatment regimens, characterised by an increased risk of myelosuppression compared with those delivered in solid tumours.</p>
              <p id="para480">Albeit limited by a short follow-up period, the initial evidence that dose and regimen adjustments that were required in 40% of patients did not lead to worse survival seems to be reassuring, underscoring the importance of maintaining individualised oncological management to preserve oncological outcomes. However, approximately 15% of patients permanently discontinued systemic anti-cancer therapy after COVID-19 in the context of worsening performance status or interval disease progression. The emergence of COVID-19 sequelae was a leading contributor to the decision to permanently withdraw systemic anti-cancer therapy.</p>
              <p id="para490">It should be emphasised that the evaluation of post-COVID clinical status is difficult to assess in patients with cancer given that constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue and anorexia) are overlapping features of progressive malignancy and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Fatigue and dyspnoea are also frequently reported by cancer survivors as a late effect of active anti-cancer therapy.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Although it is likely that the decision to interrupt treatment might have been dictated by a combination of factors, the non-negligible proportion of permanent discontinuations in our study is concerning and calls for prospective efforts aimed at facilitating a prompter recognition and treatment of reversible factors to facilitate safe reintroduction of systemic anti-cancer therapy. Sadly, clinical experience from SARS survivors suggests that fatigue, a key symptomatic determinant of post-COVID-19 syndrome and a likely contributor of worsening performance status in patients with cancer, can last for more than 40 months in up to 40% of patients.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para500">In a disease area lacking level 1 evidence for interventions, interest is growing in the development of multidisciplinary programmes aimed at combining physical therapy, rehabilitation, and psychological support to COVID-19 survivors.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Our data argue for improved awareness, recognition, and early treatment of COVID-19 sequelae in patients with cancer as an important step towards the promotion of optimal oncological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors.</p>
              <p id="para510">An important aspect of our study is that it included only survivors of COVID-19, and thus several features associated with survival of COVID-19 were more represented compared with other registry data that included patients who died from COVID-19,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> including higher representation of female sex, patients age 65 years or younger, low burden of comorbidities, no history of smoking, hospitalisation not required for COVID-19, and not requiring oxygen.</p>
              <p id="para520">A limitation of our study stems from the fact that COVID-19 sequelae were primarily defined symptomatically during clinical consultation, rather than on the basis of periodic and pre-planned diagnostic tests (eg, pulmonary function or cross-sectional imaging), leading to a potential underreporting of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic sequelae. Moreover, the higher symptomatic burden of patients with active cancer might have affected a correct causal attribution of symptoms to either COVID-19 or underlying malignancy. The absence of predefined timepoints for the assessment of sequelae and patients’ data entry into the registry exposes our analysis to unavoidable selection bias. However, there is evidence to suggest that patient and clinician reported prevalence of symptoms post-COVID-19, reported at 13·7% by the UK Office of National Statistics,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> scales well with the proportion of patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome, reported as 14% in population-based studies in the UK.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>
</p>
              <p id="para530">In addition, the median follow-up period of 4 months in our study partially limited our capacity to evaluate longer-term outcomes of COVID-19, which require follow-up times of at least 6 months, as shown in the general population.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Nonetheless, the prognosis of patients with cancer is poorer than COVID-19 survivors without cancer, and a slightly shorter observation time enabled us to describe characteristics of COVID-19 survivors with cancer, a fragile patient population requiring tailored management strategies.</p>
              <p id="para540">Lastly, we must consider that by the database lock on March 1, 2021, only 178 (7%) of 2634 patients received at least one dose of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, all of them after COVID-19 recovery. Therefore, we were not able to account for the possible role that the vaccines will have in preventing or reducing the impact of COVID-19 sequelae.</p>
              <p id="para550">Despite the acknowledged limitations, our study brings novel evidence to the growing field of research on COVID-19 that suggests that, in patients with cancer, organ damage, of which symptomatic sequelae are a proxy, could contribute to a significant worsening of patients’ survival, irrespective of oncological prognosis. Taken together, our data underscore the clinical significance of post-COVID syndrome in patients with cancer, a newly emerging prognostic domain that should be promptly identified in the clinic. Further research should prioritise the discovery of viral and host factors that are linked to the development of sequelae to allow for an improved diagnosis and for the implementation of better tailored treatment strategies to improve survival and quality of life of COVID-19 survivors with cancer.</p>
