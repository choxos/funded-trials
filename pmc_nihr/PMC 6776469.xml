                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="P1">The Brief Intervention for Weight Loss Trial enrolled 1882 consecutively attending primary care patients who were obese and participants were randomised to physicians opportunistically endorsing, offering, and facilitating a referral to a weight loss programme (support) or recommending weight loss (advice). After one year, the support group lost 1.4kg more (95%CI 0.9 to 2.0): 2.4 kg versus 1.0 kg. We use a cohort simulation to predict effects on disease incidence, quality of life, and healthcare costs over 20 years.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="P2">Randomly sampling from the trial population, we created a virtual cohort of 20 million adults and assigned baseline morbidity. We applied the weight loss observed in the trial and assumed weight regain over four years. Using epidemiological data, we assigned the incidence of 12 weight-related diseases depending on baseline disease status, age, gender, body mass index. From a healthcare perspective, we calculated the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) accruing and calculated the incremental difference between trial arms in costs expended in delivering the intervention and healthcare costs accruing. We discounted future costs and benefits at 1.5% over 20 years.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="P3">Compared with advice, the support intervention reduced the cumulative incidence of weight-related disease by 722/100,000 people, 0.33% of all weight-related disease. The incremental cost of support over advice was £2.01million/100,000. However, the support intervention reduced health service costs by £5.86 million/100,000 leading to a net saving of £3.85 million/100,000. The support intervention produced 992 QALYs/100,000 people relative to advice.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="P5">Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care is effective. In the first randomised trial of such an intervention, called BWeL (Brief intervention for Weight Loss) ISRCTN26563137,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> we screened consecutive patients attending 137 primary care physicians in England for obesity, defined as a BMI of at least 25kg/m<sup>2</sup> for people of Asian ethnicity or 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> for people of other ethnicities together with a raised body fat percentage for age and gender. Eighty-three percent of people who had a BMI at or above these limits agreed to participate and 1882 participants were enrolled. In the support intervention, physicians advised patients that the best way to lose weight was to attend one of two well-known UK commercial weight management programmes which are available as a 12-week group programme paid for by the English NHS and offered them a referral to the group. These were Slimming World and Rosemary Conley. If the patient agreed to this, s/he was given a specific appointment before leaving the practice. Of the 940 participants in this arm, 77% of the patients agreed to the referral and 40% attended. For the 942 participants in the advice arm, physicians advised the patient their health would benefit from weight loss. Patients welcomed the intervention; one in 500 thought the intervention inappropriate and unhelpful, while more than four in five thought it appropriate and helpful. The mean weight loss among all people offered the intervention at 12 months was 2.4kg in the support condition and 1.0kg in the advice condition, an adjusted difference (95% confidence interval) 1.43 (0.89 to 1.97). Twenty-five percent of the support condition lost 5% of their body weight, compared with 14% of the control, an odds ratio 2.11 (1.67 to 2.68).</p>
              <p id="P6">It is uncertain whether this is a cost-effective intervention. Firstly, although the intervention is of modest cost, it yielded modest weight loss.

                <p id="P7">We modelled the cost-effectiveness of a one-off delivery of both the support and advice intervention in the trial. To do so we created virtual cohorts of 20 million people by randomly sampling with replacement from the adult population enrolled in the BWeL trial. We applied a BMI growth equation to the BMI of cohort members, simulated using a Monte Carlo process. The data on BMI change were projected forward based on past trends in BMI for age and gender-specific groups in the English population taken from the Health Survey for England from 2004 to 2014. The individuals in the virtual cohort model were followed in annual cycles for 20 years or until death from 2015 to 2035. In each year, an individual could develop obesity-related disease, recover from it, or die from it. The probabilities of these outcomes depended on age, sex, and BMI with the data for these probabilities derived from systematic reviews of the literature. If an individual developed disease, we modelled the QALY decrement that ensued and the healthcare costs, with the data again derived from the literature. The modelling used the UK Health Forum (UKHF) Microsimulation Model. This model was developed for the Foresight Tackling Obesities Report and has been used subsequently to predict the prevalence of obesity in various countries or specific cohorts, and its consequences on health outcomes, and the economic costs that these entail in the population.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p>
                <p id="P8">In the first year, we applied the mean weight loss observed in each trial arm to eligible individuals in each virtual cohort. We then assumed that in the second and subsequent four years, any weight lost was regained linearly back to where their starting BMI percentile would have been if the person was following natural trends for their age and gender. These trends were derived from the Health Survey for England.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus individuals where there is average weight gain over time (typically younger groups) returned to a weight higher than baseline and those where there is average weight loss (typically older groups) returned to a point lower than baseline. After the fifth year of the simulation, individuals in both scenarios progressed along their BMI percentile, following national trends in BMI for their age and gender. We therefore assumed that weight trajectories diverged for five years and that all lost weight was regained and that the intervention did not recur.</p>

                <title>Data on obesity-related disease</title>
                <p id="P10">In the second stage of modelling, we assessed the incidence of 12 obesity-related diseases in the cohort. These were breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, hypertension, knee osteoarthritis, oesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, and stroke. At baseline, we applied baseline prevalence based on a person’s age, gender, and BMI using data from the literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Appendix Table 2</xref>). In each year of the 20-year period, the model calculated an individual’s transition probability using a Monte Carlo process of developing disease based on their age, sex, current disease state, medical history and risk factor (BMI). The incidence was assumed to depend solely on <italic>current</italic> BMI, which, at least for diabetes, appears to be the case.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For the stochastic transitions used in the microsimulation, this probability was derived from an application-generated random number to determine if the transition takes place for a particular individual. The data on the incidence of disease and the relation of that to BMI was derived from published sources which in turn were derived from periodically updated systematic searching and appraisal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table 2 Appendix</xref>). In addition, in each subsequent year of the modelling, the disease could remit, continue, or lead to death and those data too were derived from epidemiological sources and applied stochastically to cohort members. In each year of the modelling, we calculated the incidence of each obesity-related disease in each arm of the model, calculated as the number of new cases of disease occurring in the cohort that were alive in that year. We totalled these incidences to give the cumulative incidence over the 20-year period and expressed these as per 100,000 persons as different numbers were alive in each year of the cohort. This represents the total number of new cases of weight-related disease occurring in this cohort during this time. As people are at risk of all diseases and because these typically co-occur e.g. many people develop both diabetes and hypertension, this is different from the number of people with a disease.</p>

The largest cost was that of the weight loss programme itself (£49.50), which was the NHS contracting cost applicable in 2015, the base year of the modelling, if the participant chose to take up this offer. The costs of healthcare for incident disease modelled comprised primary care costs (staff and prescriptions); secondary care (inpatient: elective, non-elective, outpatient and other secondary care); urgent care/emergency care costs (ambulance and accident and emergency); community care costs; and cost of care provided in other settings: In the NHS budget cost database, only the total healthcare expenditure of diabetes, as opposed to type 2 diabetes was available.

The largest contributors were pre-diabetes (64,470), diabetes (34,824), and hypertension (79,764), with 14,472 cases of heart disease and 10,115 cases of stroke. In the support arm, the cumulative total incidence was 218,707 cases per 100,000 people, a reduction in cumulative incidence of obesity-related disease of 0.33%.

                <p id="P15">The support intervention cost between £1.95 and £51.45 per person, depending on the patient’s response, while the advice intervention cost £1.95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Appendix Table 3</xref>). The incremental cost of the support intervention over advice was £20.10/person or £2.01 million/100,000 persons. The main additional cost was the cost of the weight loss programme. However, it reduced health service costs by 5.86 million/100,000 leading to a net saving of £3.85 million/100,000.</p>
                <p id="P16">By 2035, the reduced incidence of disease from the support intervention produced an additional 992 QALYs/100,000 persons relative to advice. This resulted in a dominant result for the ICER: more effective and at lower cost. This result varied over the 20 years. In the third year, the intervention was cost-effective by NICE standards and cost-saving by the ninth year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="P17">Relative to advice to lose weight, a physician’s opportunistic offer of referral to group-based community weight loss support programme was more effective at reducing the incidence of obesity-related disease. Although it was costlier in the short-term, it was cost-effective from the third year after its implementation and cost-saving from year nine and over an entire 20-year period, while yielding an additional 992 QALYs/100,000 people.</p>
              <p id="P18">The main strength of this study relates to the underpinning data from a trial and the model we used to model the long-term health impact. The randomised design of the trial, delivered at population-level rather than to a selected group of motivated participants makes it possible to estimate the population level impact of physician-led interventions. The model addresses the question relevant to policy: how the initial costs of offering treatment for obesity are balanced in relation to the disease prevented. The model was developed for the UK Foresight Report and has updated since then.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</p>
              <p id="P19">We randomised people to a control intervention which was physician advice to lose weight to improve health, and this could be a limitation. In clinical practice, it is rare to make opportunistic interventions on weight,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and so advice to lose weight does not represent usual care. The cost of delivering the brief advice intervention would not ordinarily have been incurred and thus our analysis underestimates the cost difference between usual current care and the active intervention in the trial, thus overestimating the cost-effectiveness. However, the costs of the advice intervention were modest at £0.2 million/100,000 and even removing this cost entirely would not change the findings that the support intervention was cost-saving. Moreover, it is plausible that physician advice itself spurred action in some participants. On average, participants in this arm lost 1kg, about 700g more than epidemiological evidence might suggest.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> If this were so, this may have underestimated the ICER because it underestimated the weight gain difference and hence health benefits of weight loss. Neither issue seems likely to change the conclusion that the support intervention, involving endorsing, offering, and facilitating a referral to a modestly priced group-based weight management service is cost-saving and improves health to a greater extent than either simple advice or usual care, namely no intervention. A further limitation is that the results are based on a trial analysis and therefore apply directly only in the UK where physicians have access to referral to a programme that is modestly priced and effective. However, if physicians only have access to more costly weight loss programmes, then the cost saving would diminish, albeit the cost of the weight loss programme would have to be three times greater for the support arm to be cost neutral over 20 years. A final issue is that the microsimulation model is not currently able to conduct sensitivity analyses.</p>
              <p id="P20">The analysis was conducted from the healthcare perspective, including only costs and benefits occurring in healthcare. A societal perspective would have included costs to the participants from attending the weight loss programme, for example, and the opportunity cost of the time spent doing so, which is considerable. We also excluded other costs that are arguably relevant including some weight-related diseases due to lack of data to model the impact and indirect and social care costs of the weight-related diseases in the model. Weight-related diseases are major risk factors for dependency in old age.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, we excluded costs that might arise from treatment and care for people with non-weight-related disease, which is likely to increase in incidence simply as a result of a longer life following weight loss<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. which may reduce or eliminate the cost-savings. However, there is a debate about whether these additional costs should be included or not.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A lifetime societal perspective may have given a different estimate of the costs and benefits. However, our analysis was conducted in the same manner as other health economic analyses used to inform healthcare spending decisions, but the total net financial impact of this (or other healthcare) intervention on society remains unknown.</p>
              <p id="P21">Another limitation is that the trial followed up participants at three months and one year, during which time participants regained weight. Their experience was typical of trials in general and we assumed that they would regain all lost weight over the next four years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> If weight regain were either more rapid or slower than this or if all weight lost was not regained, as occurred in the Diabetes Prevention Program,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the cost-effectiveness would change. Our assumptions were based on a systematic review that estimated the rate of weight regain and found no evidence that the means by which weight loss occurred affected the rate of regain.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Those few trials that have followed people for up to five years or longer have not observed that all weight lost has been regained.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, as with most modelling, the assumptions are critical to the outcomes obtained. Validating this model would be difficult. In this study, all participants were recruited opportunistically and very briefly to conceal the nature of the intervention. By follow-up, many had forgotten being enrolled in a study and follow-up over 20 years, as would be required to directly estimate the costs of healthcare and assess quality of life would be difficult and, even in a trial of nearly 1800 people, would be subject to occasional high cost episodes of healthcare that can affect health-economic assessments, as we have observed previously.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A final issue is that this economic analysis could not include a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. There are a large number of parameters in the model and a single run of the model takes several days. Running a sensitivity analysis would require a super computer.</p>
              <p id="P22">The BWeL trial was the first trial to examine the effectiveness of physician-delivered opportunistic brief interventions. This is therefore the first cost-effectiveness evaluation of this kind of population-level intervention for weight-loss. However, although the central feature of BWeL was the physician-delivered brief intervention offered to a population not seeking support, <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> the biggest cost element and the element that delivered the weight loss was the 12-week commercial weight management programme to which primary care physicians referred the participants. This kind of service is available for physicians to refer to in many parts of England, and there is evidence that this is an effective programme.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The most recent such evaluation suggested that, compared with a self-help intervention (for which there is evidence of effectiveness),<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> the 12-week programme was cost-saving.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Our findings extend this evaluation because they included a delivery mechanism that has potentially a very high reach, certainly much higher than waiting for patients to ask for support, which is what happens in usual care. The large majority of people visit a primary care physician annually, making several visits a year.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Physicians could feasibly give a 30-second intervention sufficiently often to greatly expand the reach of effective weight loss programmes to have a real population impact and it would be valuable to assess this. That said, the same model was used in both cost-effectiveness evaluations. Although we have tried to be explicit about some assumptions in the model, it is possible that different models would produce different outputs and replicating these results in a different model would be helpful. A final issue is that this intervention, a brief opportunistic intervention by a physician, if implemented by policy, would be implemented recurrently. For example, English general practitioners have a requirement to update smoking status and provide support in how to quit to their patients that smoke every two years. Here we modelled the cost-effectiveness of the intervention as delivered only once, replicating a within-trial cost-effectiveness evaluation, but the impact of both recurrent costs and the impact on recurrent benefits remain unknown. Further modelling could usefully explore a range of scenarios to understand the possible impact of rollout of this programme.</p>
