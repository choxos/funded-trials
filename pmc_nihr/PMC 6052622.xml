                  <p id="Par1">Evidence on the effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for hip osteoarthritis is limited and conflicting. The primary objective of the Hip Injection Trial (HIT) is to compare pain intensity over 6 months, in people with hip OA between those receiving an ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of corticosteroid with 1% lidocaine hydrochloride plus best current treatment with those receiving best current treatment alone. Secondary objectives are to determine specified comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes, and to explore, in a linked qualitative study, the lived experiences of patients with hip OA and experiences and impact of, ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">The HIT trial is a pragmatic, three-parallel group, single-blind, superiority, randomised controlled trial in patients with painful hip OA with a linked qualitative study. The current protocol is described, in addition to details and rationale for amendments since trial registration. 204 patients with moderate-to-severe hip OA will be recruited. Participants are randomised on an equal basis (1:1:1 ratio) to one of three interventions: (1) best current treatment, (2) best current treatment plus ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of corticosteroid (triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg) with 1% lidocaine hydrochloride, or (3) best current treatment plus an ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride alone. The primary endpoint is patient-reported hip pain intensity across 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months post-randomisation. Recruitment is over 29 months with a 6-month follow-up period. To address the primary objective, the analysis will compare participants’ ‘average’ follow-up pain NRS scores, based on a random effects linear repeated-measures model. Data on adverse events are collected and reported in accordance with national guidance and reviewed by external monitoring committees. Individual semi-structured interviews are being conducted with up to 30 trial participants across all three arms of the trial.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par49">Hip osteoarthritis affects a substantial, and growing, number of people worldwide. Its incidence and prevalence are increasing due to ageing and obesity. It is estimated that between 10 and 18% of those aged over 60 years are affected, rising to one in three patients over the age of 85 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], with a substantial proportion experiencing persistent pain, loss of function and decline in health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par50">In 2016, in the United Kingdom (UK), an estimated 92,465 primary total hip replacement (THR) operations were carried out, with approximately 90% being performed for OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Whilst not all patients with hip osteoarthritis will need a THR, the numbers of THR are continuing to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients with hip OA are typically treated in primary care for several years before referral for surgical opinion, with evidence suggesting that primary care management is suboptimal and that patients with hip pain feel their pain is neglected despite consulting their general practitioner (GP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In one observational study from the Netherlands, patients with incident hip OA remained under GP care for an average of 7 years (82 months) before referral to orthopaedics, suggesting that a considerable period of time is available to help patients through the application of non-surgical interventions before surgery is suggested as an option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This is important, as non-surgical interventions could significantly contribute to postponing hip replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which in turn can delay or prevent future revision surgery.</p>
              <p id="Par51">A range of treatments, including analgesia and exercise therapy, are available to help people with hip OA, although the evidence supporting their use, especially in primary care settings, is limited. Influential organisations including the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), Arthritis Research UK and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) highlight the lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted exclusively with people with hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. NICE guidance for the non-surgical treatment of OA advises a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, with education, exercise and weight reduction being core treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Options for analgesia include paracetamol, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opiates, with intra-articular corticosteroid injection recommended as an adjunct for those with moderate-severe pain.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Intra-articular corticosteroid injection is not used to treat patients with hip OA as widely as it could be in the UK owing to a lack of local availability and uncertainties about patient selection and potential benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Intra-articular hip injection is typically administered using imaging guidance, either fluoroscopy or ultrasound, to improve the accuracy of the injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The evidence supporting the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for hip OA is limited and conflicting. Of the five published RCTs of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for hip OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], all recruited small numbers of participants from secondary care (≤40 per treatment group) and employed short-term follow-up (maximum three months). Whereas two RCTs with hip OA patients have demonstrated clinical benefits at eight weeks post-injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and two at three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], one reported no significant difference in pain or function at three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There is evidence that beneficial effects of knee injections persist to six months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. All previous RCTs of corticosteroid injections for hip OA have included a ‘placebo’ arm of injections of either local anaesthetic or saline but only one has compared clinical effectiveness of corticosteroid injection with best usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par53">There is, therefore, promising evidence to support the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for patients with hip OA, although current research is restricted to small studies of more severely affected patients with only short-term follow-up. The available studies therefore do not reflect the true range of disease managed in primary care, where patients may have less severe disease and are more likely to have multi-morbidity which limits their other treatment options. To ensure healthcare services improve outcomes for patients we need to ensure there is a robust and appropriate evidence-base to support clinical decision making.</p>

              <p id="Par54">The current protocol (version 6.0, 3 April 2018) is described below. Key amendments to the protocol since trial registration are highlighted with comments in square brackets and described in detail, along with rationale for change, in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Key Protocol Amendments since Trial registration</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Protocol Section</th><th>Original protocol</th><th>Amended details</th><th>Date of Amendment REC approval</th><th>Rationale for amendment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Secondary objectives</td><td>To explore reasons for non-participation in the study and perceptions of recruitment processes with aim of identifying any modifiable barriers to recruitment [To undertake only if recruitment less than anticipated at 3 month review]</td><td>Objective removed</td><td>May 2018</td><td>We could not to complete the qualitative objective - to explore reasons for non-adherence - due to low recruitment to this qualitative study of people who were eligible for the trial but unwilling to participate. Furthermore, we had identified key modifiable issues to facilitate method of recruitment relating to eligibility criteria (see below) and recruitment route (see ‘Progress of the trial’).</td></tr><tr><td>Inclusion Criteria</td><td>Moderate-to-severe hip pain (a score of four or more on a 0–10 numeric rating scale (NRS)) on the day of assessment</td><td>Moderate-to-severe hip pain (a score of four or more on a 0–10 numeric rating scale (NRS)) on average over the last 2 weeks and current hip pain rated as at least 1 out of 10 (on a 0–10 NRS) on the day of assessment</td><td>September 2016</td><td>During the first 5 months of recruitment we observed that, due to the day-to day variability of osteoarthritis symptoms, a number of potential participants did not meet the eligibility criterion of pain of 4/10 on the day of assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>Exclusion Criteria</td><td>Any contraindications to the use of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride as listed in Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) e.g. complete heart block, hypovolaemia,</td><td>Any contraindications to the use of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride as listed in Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) e.g. complete heart block, hypovolaemia, porphyria</td><td>September 2016</td><td>A review of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) for lidocaine hydrochloride revealed a new contraindication (porphyria). Porphyria was added to the exclusion criteria as part of an urgent safety measure and subsequent amendment.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Receiving anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or low molecular weight heparin)</td><td>Receiving anticoagulants (warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or low molecular weight heparin), ritonavir or cobicistat</td><td>January 2017</td><td>It was noted in the MHRA Drug Safety Update dated 14 December 2016 ‘Cobicistat, ritonavir and coadministration with a steroid: risk of systemic corticosteroid adverse effects’ that coadministration of corticosteroids, including intra-articular triamcinolone, with an HIV-treatment-boosting agent may increase the risk of corticosteroid side-effects including adrenal insufficiency, adrenal suppression and Cushing’s syndrome, due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Receiving cobicistat or ritonavir were added to the exclusion criteria as part of an urgent safety measure and subsequent amendment.</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Size</td><td>To address the primary objective, the analysis will be based on comparisons of participants’ ‘average’ follow-up pain NRS scores, based on a random effects linear repeated-measures model, with a ‘cluster’ size of 4 (denoting 4 follow-up assessments) and a postulated coefficient of 0.5. A sample size of 232 will provide 90% power (5% two-tailed significance) to detect a minimum difference of 1.5 points in mean pain NRS score (anticipated baseline SD of pain scores = 4.5 points; effect size of 0.33) between I1 and I2 across the 6-month follow-up period, allowing for total of 15% loss to follow-up. As our trial also evaluates I3 (against I1), we have three groups of interest and hence need 348 participants.</td><td>To address the primary objective, the analysis will be based on comparisons of participants’ ‘average’ follow-up pain NRS scores, based on a random effects linear repeated-measures model, with four follow-ups and postulated correlations of 0.5 for repeat-measures and 0.2 for baseline-outcome. A sample size of 136 (68 per arm) provides 80% power (5% two-tailed significance) to detect a minimum difference of 1 point in mean pain NRS score (anticipated SD of about 2.5; effect size of 0.4) between I1 and I2 across the 6-month follow-up period, allowing for 15% loss to follow-up. As the trial also evaluates I3 (against I1), there are three groups of interest and hence 204 participants are needed.</td><td>May 2018</td><td>The Data Monitoring Committee noted poor recruitment and suggested rerunning the sample size calculations to ensure the original sample size assumptions were still valid. The observed baseline standard deviation (SD) of the primary outcome based on data collected from participants recruited by this time point (n = 65) was 1.7 (and the SD for follow up scores was around 2.5) – i.e. much lower than the SD of 4.5 expected before the start of recruitment on which the original sample size calculation was based. The clinically important difference of 1.5 (originally stated) in the context of this baseline SD would be ‘large’ (effect size above 0.8). The clinically important difference of 1.5 was considered to be too large in relation to the lower expected SD. The clinically important difference for the NRS-pain scale has taken different values across studies; an absolute difference of 1 has been specified in some studies (which would relate to a “moderate” effect size (0.5) when the SD is around 2; or, 0.4 in relation to higher SD of 2.5 which is observed across follow up time points). Hence, we felt that a revised effect size of 0.4 is justifiable. Using this revised effect size of 0.4 and revised power of 80% (on the advice of the TSC), the sample size was amended as described, and was approved by the funder, TMC and DMC.</td></tr><tr><td>Recruitment period</td><td>The monthly target for recruitment will be 20. A recruitment period of 18 months will therefore be required.</td><td>An amended recruitment period of 29 months is required to meet the revised sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 204). The monthly target for recruitment has been adjusted from 20 to 10.</td><td>May 2018</td><td>During the first 18 months of trial recruitment an average of 7 patients per month were recruited. Recruitment improved since greater emphasis has been placed on recruitment route 3 to an average of 10 per month. Recruitment period was recalculated based on observed recruitment and revised sample size.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p>

For patients identified by route 3, a brief, provisional eligibility screen will have been carried out over the telephone by the CTU administrator prior to the appointment being made and a preliminary informed consent to ‘screening assessment’ are taken prior to any eligibility assessment.</p>
                  <p id="Par101">The clinical consultation is undertaken by the local PI (or authorised delegate). In accordance with the UK Clinical Trial Regulations, a patient’s eligibility to participate in the trial is the responsibility of a medically qualified doctor.

The median sagittal plane (MSP) is at 90 degrees to the table top and the anterior superior iliac spines (ASISs) are at equal distance from the table-top. The arms are raised onto the pillow. The legs are slightly internally rotated to bring the necks of femora parallel to the table-top. Gonad protection is applied if appropriate. The beam is centred in the midline, midway between the ASIS and the upper border of the symphysis pubis.</p>
                  <p id="Par105">Lateral oblique hip: From the initial AP pelvis position the patient is rotated laterally through 45 degrees onto the side under examination and supported in this position with foam pads. The knee and hip are flexed and externally rotated to bring the lateral aspect of the thigh in contact with the table-top. The arms are rested on the pillow. Gonad protection is applied. The beam is centred to the femoral pulse.</p>

                  <p id="Par121">Preparation for the injection includes: LOGIQ ultrasound system with a 1-4 MHz curvilinear transducer (GE Healthcare, Hatfield, England); disposable sterile transducer sheath; disposable 25G needle for regional anaesthesia of skin and superficial soft tissues, and disposable 22G spinal needle for regional anaesthesia of deeper soft tissues and intra-articular injection. Three syringes are prepared containing: 3mls 1% lidocaine hydrochloride; 4mls 1% lidocaine hydrochloride and 1 ml 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide.</p>
                  <p id="Par122">A sterile aseptic technique is observed. The participant lies supine with legs extended into a neutral position of comfort. The skin is cleaned with chlorhexidine 0.5% solution. The transducer is covered with gel and a sterile sheath. Sterile gel is applied to the external surface of the sheath. The anterior capsule of the hip joint is located using ultrasound guidance and 3mls 1% lidocaine hydrochloride is introduced to the overlying skin and superficial soft tissues using a 25 g needle. A 22G spinal needle will then be inserted, observing its route in real-time by ultrasound, until its tip is seen to enter the anterior joint capsule. 1 ml of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride is injected into the hip to confirm correct placement and 40 mg of triamcinolone acetonide (1 ml volume) with a further 3mls of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride is injected showing distension of the capsule by the fluid under ultrasound (total intracapsular volume 5mls). The needle is withdrawn, haemostasis ensured and a dressing applied over the injection site. Participant should be advised to wait 15 min following injection or alternatively ensure that they are accompanied by a responsible adult for that time. Participants are advised to observe minimal weight-bearing for 24 h following the injection, and not to drive for 24 h.</p>

                <p id="Par141">All participants enrolled in the trial are asked to complete a paper questionnaire at the baseline clinic appointment and a posted questionnaire after 2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months. Questionnaires will capture data on all outcome measures (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par142">Baseline data collection includes: demographics (date of birth, gender, marital status); hip pain questions: uni/bilateral, duration; previous hip injection; participant treatment preference and expectations; comorbidity; self-reported height and weight (Body Mass Index - BMI), other musculoskeletal pain (Body manikin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and anxiety and depression – Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Patient Health Questionnaire 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par143">For participants receiving I2 and I3, bilateral ultrasound images are stored, and scored on the presence or absence of synovitis and effusion. Participants are also asked which injection they think they received.</p>
                <p id="Par144">Non-responders to the 2-week follow-up postal questionnaire are sent a repeat questionnaire and PIL after 10 calendar days. Those who do not respond to the repeat questionnaire within 10 days are telephoned by the Research Nurse (who will remain blind to group allocation), in order to try to capture key primary outcome data and to minimise missing data. A postal MDC form is mailed to the participant if the participant has not been contacted after 5 phone-call attempts.</p>
                <p id="Par145">At other follow-up time-points, non-responders are sent a reminder postcard after 10 days. Those who do not respond to the reminder postcard are sent a repeat questionnaire and Participant Information Sheet with a further covering letter after a further 10 days. Non-responders to the repeat questionnaire are telephoned by the Research Nurse (blind to treatment allocation) 10 days later.

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p id="Par147">To address the objectives of the trial, 204 participants (68 in each arm) need to be recruited over a 29-month period [amended since trial registration, see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and ‘Progress of trial’]. To address the primary objective, the analysis will be based on comparisons of participants’ ‘average’ follow-up pain NRS scores, based on a random effects linear repeated-measures model, with four follow-ups and postulated correlations of 0.5 for repeat-measures and 0.2 for baseline-outcome. A sample size of 136 (68 per arm) provides 80% power (5% two-tailed significance) to detect a minimum difference of 1 point in mean pain NRS score (anticipated SD of about 2.5; effect size of 0.4) between I1 and I2 across the 6-month follow-up period, allowing for 15% loss to follow-up. As the trial also evaluates I3 (against I1), there are three groups of interest and hence 204 participants are needed.</p>

                <title>Statistical methods</title>
                <p id="Par148">The analysis will be undertaken according to an analysis plan agreed with the TSC and DMC, incorporating statistical analysis, health economics and qualitative analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par149">The main statistical analysis is based on reporting guidelines for the design and conduct of parallel-arm trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The main treatment analysis will be conducted blinded to treatment allocation and will be analysed on an intention to treat (ITT) approach with all randomised participants retaining their original randomised group. Estimation through linear mixed modelling takes account of missing data (under the missing at random (MAR) missingness assumption). Analysis will be adjusted for baseline covariates (pain, age and gender). Additional sensitivity analysis will address the robustness of the findings to deviation from the MAR assumption – specifically through considering plausible ‘missing not at random’ (MNAR) scenarios.</p>
                <p id="Par150">Key baseline characteristics of participants in the three treatment groups will be presented to illustrate comparability. The linear mixed model will be used to derive estimates of ‘average’ pain across the four time points (thus reflecting summary pain assessment across the full follow-up period) as well as estimates of pain at each time point (by modelling the interaction of group by time). In each evaluation, a random-slope model will be preferred (to a random-intercept model) if the goodness-of-fit of the model is significantly improved through time-projected random-slope specification. Statistical significance is at the 5% probability level (two-tailed). The collection of data and statistical analysis will be performed blinded to treatment allocation. The primary clinical evaluation will be a comparison of pain NRS scores over the 6-month follow-up period (with repeated measures at 2 weeks and 2, 4 and 6 months) between those treated with best current treatment plus corticosteroid and lidocaine injection, and those treated with best current treatment alone.</p>
                <p id="Par151">The secondary clinical evaluations will include: evaluation of pain NRS score differences between groups at each of the individual time points (2 weeks, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months) as well as between-group comparison of secondary outcome measures over the 6-month follow-up period. Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) will be through linear-regression in respect of numerical outcomes, and logistic-regression in relation to categorical outcome measures. A number of follow-up data are anticipated to be retrieved through minimum data collection, and therefore we will use multiple imputation (MI) using chain equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] to impute missing secondary outcome data – the prediction models will include baseline variables and the (primary) pain outcome measure as predictors. MI, similar to mixed modelling, estimates effect on the basis of an MAR missingness mechanism. Estimation of the primary outcome measure based on MI evaluation will be carried out as a sensitivity analysis of the main MMRM analysis. In addition, an MI analysis incorporating plausible deviations from ignorable missingness will be considered in respect of sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome to MNAR missing data.</p>
                <p id="Par152">The primary analyses will be adjusted for the following baseline covariates: pain score, age and gender (and EQ5D for health economic evaluation). Estimates of clinical effect will be shown as mean (SDs) differences (for numerical outcomes) and odds ratios (for dichotomous outcomes), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). As previously stated, regression analysis will be based on a linear model for numerical outcomes and binary logistic model for dichotomous outcomes with a random-effects component being added to the model for repeated measures data, to take into account the intra-cluster correlation. To help in interpreting the size of the estimated clinical effect for the between-group difference in pain (overall and at individual time points) we will calculate the standardised mean difference (‘effect size’) which is the ratio of the estimated mean difference to the standard deviation of pain scores in the total randomised population. For all evaluations of the primary outcome, we will present mean and 95% confidence interval estimates. The number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% CI will be calculated in respect of the comparison between best current treatment plus corticosteroid and 1% lidocaine hydrochloride injection and best current treatment alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par162">The health economic analysis will determine the cost-effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for hip OA and best current treatment compared with best current treatment alone. A cost-consequence analysis will initially be reported, describing all important results relating to costs and outcomes. An incremental cost-utility analysis will be undertaken using participant responses to the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire at baseline and each follow-up time-point, to calculate the cost per additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. The base-case analysis will adopt an NHS perspective and will include costs of the intervention and best current treatment, and other hip OA-specific health care utilisation. These may include primary care consultations, prescriptions, secondary care contacts and over-the-counter purchases by participants. Information on health care resource use and work absenteeism will be collected from participant questionnaires at six months. The robustness of the results will be explored using sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty in the confidence to be placed on the results of the economic analysis will be explored conducting a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to estimate cost effectiveness acceptability curves. Results from a broader societal perspective will also be presented, and will include participant-incurred and productivity costs in addition to heath care costs.</p>

                  <title>Progress of the trial</title>
                  <p id="Par168">Recruitment commenced in January 2016. Unfortunately, review of recruitment 3–6 months into the trial revealed that recruitment was sub-optimal and less than 50% of that predicted. Two key amendments were made (detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="Par169">First on 19th August 2016 the eligibility criteria were amended. Criterion 3 was originally ‘Moderate-to-severe hip pain (a score of four or more on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS)) on the day of assessment’. During the first 5 months of recruitment we observed that, due to the day-to day variability of osteoarthritis symptoms, a number of potential participants did not meet the eligibility criteria of pain of 4/10 on the day of assessment. The TSC suggested amending the criterion to ‘moderate to severe hip pain (a score of four or more on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS)) on average over the last two weeks and current hip pain rated as at least one out of 10 (on a 0-10 NRS) on the day of assessment’. This amendment was approved by the DMC and Research Ethics Committee (REC). Forty-eight participants had been recruited at the time of this amendment.</p>
                  <p id="Par170">Second, in March 2017, the Data Monitoring Committee noted poor recruitment and suggested rerunning the sample size calculations to ensure the original sample size assumptions were still valid. The observed baseline standard deviation (SD) of the primary outcome based on data collected from participants recruited by this time point (<italic>n</italic> = 65) was 1.7 (and the SD for follow up scores is around 2.5) – i.e. much lower than the SD of 4.5 expected before the start of recruitment on which the original sample size calculation was based. The clinically important difference of 1.5 (originally stated) in the context of this baseline SD would be ‘large’ (effect size above 0.8). The clinically important difference of 1.5 was considered to be too large in relation to the lower expected SD. The clinically important difference for the NRS-pain scale has taken different values across studies; an absolute difference of 1 has been specified in some studies (which would relate to a “moderate” effect size (0.5) when the SD is around 2; or, 0.4 in relation to higher SD of 2.5 which is observed across follow up time points). Hence, we felt that a revised effect size of 0.4 is justifiable. Using this revised effect size of 0.4 and revised power of 80% (on the advice of the TSC), the sample size was amended as described under ‘sample size’ heading, and was approved by the funder, TMC and DMC. A funded extension was requested, to extend recruitment from 18 months to 29 months, and approved in November 2017.</p>
                  <p id="Par171">We removed a second qualitative objective to explore reasons for non-participation in the trial, to address any modifiable barriers to recruitment. This was in part due to limited capacity within the research team and low recruitment to this qualitative study of people who were eligible for the trial but unwilling to participate. All amendments have received ethical approval.</p>
                  <p id="Par172">Recruitment via Route 3 commenced 12 months into recruitment and was noted to be more successful and became the principle route of recruitment from July 2017.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par173">This paper describes the design of pragmatic randomised trial which investigates the comparative clinical and cost effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in reducing pain in people with hip OA. A number of issues have been addressed in the design of this trial.</p>
              <p id="Par174">As the majority of patients with hip OA are managed exclusively in primary care, it is important that the evidence base for recommended interventions is suitable for patients treated in this setting, especially at a time when clinical commissioning groups in the UK are redesigning NHS clinical pathways. The study participants in the existing five RCTs which have evaluated the effectiveness of corticosteroid intra-articular injections recruited participants from secondary care and are unlikely to be representative of the wider primary care population. Furthermore, three performed injections under fluoroscopic guidance which is not available in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par175">Eligibility criteria were defined to recruit a representative primary care population of moderate to severe hip OA patients, protect patient safety and also to ensure maximum generalisability of the results to primary care. We deliberately did not exclude patients who were considered by clinicians to be eligible for onward referral for surgery. This decision was taken on the advice of our TSC, and particularly two lay members of the committee, who felt it was important that patients with more severe OA should still be offered choice of non-surgical interventions.</p>
              <p id="Par176">Whilst conducting the trial in a setting that is very close to primary care is crucial to our research question and to optimizing the generalisability of the findings, we recognised the need to maximise recruitment and achieve realistic recruitment targets. Recruitment to this trial within the first 5 months was lower than half that expected and amendments to the study eligibility criteria and recruitment routes are addressing this.</p>
              <p id="Par177">In summary, this paper describes the rationale and design for a randomised pragmatic trial that aims to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid injections in hip OA. The proposed trial will make an important contribution to the evidence base available to support effective conservative management of hip OA in primary care and will inform both patient management and future research for treatment options for hip OA.</p>
