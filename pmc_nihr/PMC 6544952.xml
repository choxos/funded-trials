                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Intestinal inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD) is caused by mucosal immune system reactivity to luminal antigen and results in debilitating symptoms, reduced quality of life, impaired work productivity and significant health care costs. Not all patients respond to conventional and biologic therapies, with chronic inflammation ensuing. Although surgical resection may be required, disease frequently returns and surgery may not be an option, or may be declined. Case reports suggest potential benefit after haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for patients with refractory CD.</p>
                  <p id="Par2">The ASTIC trial asked whether HSCT could cure CD. Few patients achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission for 3 months, off all medication with no evidence of active disease, and there were a high number of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including one patient death. However, beneficial effects were observed in some aspects of disease activity. The ASTIClite trial will investigate these potential benefits and safety using a lower intensity regimen than ASTIC.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Ninety-nine participants will be recruited from secondary care IBD centres in the UK into a multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT, ASTIClite) and an observational follow-up, and randomised to autologous HSCT versus standard care (ratio 2:1).</p>
                  <p id="Par4">The primary endpoint is treatment success at week 48, defined as mucosal healing without surgery or death. Secondary endpoints relating to efficacy, safety and mechanistic analyses will be evaluated at week 8, 14, 24, 32, 40 and 48.</p>
                  <p id="Par5">Long-term safety of the low intensity HSCT regimen forms the primary endpoint for the EBMT follow-up study and will be assessed annually for 4–7 years.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par6">ASTIClite will compare HSCTlite with standard care with respect to safety, efficacy and quality of life, and capture outcomes allowing findings to be generalised to current clinical practice in the UK. It will also provide significant mechanistic insights into the immunological consequences of HSCTlite and its impact on treatment outcomes. The observational follow-up will provide information, which is currently unavailable for this population.</p>

              <p id="Par39">Intestinal inflammation in Crohn’s disease (CD) is caused by mucosal immune system reactivity to luminal antigen and results in debilitating symptoms, reduced quality of life, impaired work productivity and significant health care costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. CD accounts for 27,000 hospital admissions in the UK each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Biological medications account for the largest element of patient costs in both secondary and tertiary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with anti-TNF therapy-related costs also having increased over the last 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par40">Although many patients respond to conventional and biologic therapies, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) portfolio cohort trial, Personalised Anti-TNF Therapy in Crohn’s disease (PANTS) (UKCRN 14175 &amp; 17,747) of 1610 CD patients commencing anti-TNF therapy reports primary non-response at week 14 in 23·8% (95% CI 21·4–26·2) and non remission at week 54 in 63·1%, (60·3–65·8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Second line therapy with the gut-selective integrin inhibitor vedolizumab and an antibody against p40 (IL-12 and IL-23), ustekinumab are approved by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for patients with CD refractory to or intolerant of steroids and conventional immunomodulators. However, in one phase III trial, vedolizumab did not achieve its induction primary endpoint in patients previously exposed to anti-TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In another phase III trial, vedolizumab was not more effective than placebo at week 6 among patients with refractory CD, with remission in approximately 30% of patients by week 10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, patients with treatment refractory CD face persistent symptoms related to disease activity in addition to the morbidity associated with chronic steroid exposure. Although surgery may be an option, this may result in a permanent stoma and is often declined. An option for patients with refractory CD is haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for which case reports suggest exceptional benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
              <sec id="Sec2">
                <title>The ASTIC trial</title>
                <p id="Par41">Under the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Autoimmune Diseases Working Party (ADWP), a randomised controlled trial, Autologous Stem cell Transplantation for Crohn’s Disease (ASTIC) was designed to answer the following questions; (i) does HSCT ‘cure’ CD and (ii) is any observed benefit derived from the cyclophosphamide or the stem cell transplant? [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For this, eligible patients underwent high dose (4 g/m<sup>2</sup>) cyclophosphamide / G-CSF mobilisation and were then randomised to immediate HSCT or conventional care for 1 year. Few patients in either group achieved the primary endpoint of clinical disease remission for 3 months, off all medication, with no evidence of active disease on imaging and endoscopy. In retrospect, this primary endpoint was more ambitious than that which had been used in any other trial published in this disease area. In addition, it may not be in a patient’s interest to have a protocolled withdrawal of therapy to meet the primary endpoint (off all therapy), given that it is known patients can relapse after HSCT and respond to therapies to which they were previously refractory. Finally, there were a high number of adverse (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that were not clinically acceptable, and one patient death. Consequently, HSCT is rarely used for patients with refractory CD in the UK.</p>
                <p id="Par42">However, ASTIC did demonstrate significant benefits in endpoints that are more traditional for therapeutic trials in this area and remain of clinical importance and relevance to patients, such as steroid-free clinical remission, mucosal healing and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. After the primary endpoint, patients in the control arm underwent HSCT. Subsequent analysis of the impact of HSCT in all patients in the ASTIC program reported that 50% of patients achieved regression of all endoscopic ulceration at 1 year. In addition, clinical factors that predict treatment success or AEs were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A report by the EBMT in 2018, suggested that the retrospective analysis of HSCT for CD in multiple European centres, autologous HSCT appeared safe and effective in refractory CD, but that further trials are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>

              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Risks and benefits</title>
                <p id="Par43">The incidence of CD is increasing, particularly in young adults who may live with their disease for many decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients with refractory CD suffer impaired quality of life and disease- or treatment-related morbidity. In addition, refractory CD is associated with a heavy burden of direct health care costs including disease assessment, outpatient care, inpatient care, intravenous nutrition, surgery and medication costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Biological therapies (both licensed and in phase III trials) are of a lower efficacy in treatment-experienced patients and have high acquisition costs. In the absence of an effective alternative, these patients are likely to be exposed to a sequence of expensive therapies that deliver a diminishing potential for benefit and increasing risk of harm.</p>
                <p id="Par44">The ASTIC trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] reported a high burden of AEs and one death. Subsequent specialist review suggested that the high dose cyclophosphamide used at both mobilisation and conditioning may have been a factor for many of the mobilisation-related infectious AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research also highlighted the importance of supportive care in reducing the incidence of SAEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Analysis of the entire ASTIC cohort using more traditional endpoints demonstrates a significant benefit of this therapy at 1 year. Importantly, this analysis and previous studies have suggested that HSCT appears to restore responsiveness to anti-TNF therapies to which patients were previously refractory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent single centre cohort study with long-term clinical and endoscopic follow-up showed benefit extending to 5 years. Finally, reduced intensity mobilisation and conditioning regimens have been associated with lower morbidity in malignant and autoimmune disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p>

                <title>ASTIClite</title>
                <p id="Par45">ASTIClite is a multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of HSCTlite at inducing regression of intestinal ulceration in patients with refractory CD compared with standard care.</p>

              <title>Rationale for the study</title>
              <p id="Par46">Many specialists feel it would be inappropriate to interpret the complex ASTIC clinical trial with the simple message that HSCT is not effective for refractory CD for the following reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par47">The primary endpoint was more ambitious than in any other CD trial and the low frequency of patients that achieved it suggests that the trial was underpowered;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">Both control and intervention group received cyclophosphamide at the relatively high dose of 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> for mobilisation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), which had significant short-term beneficial impact on disease activity;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">No maintenance therapy was used after HSCT in patients with recurrent disease;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">HSCT achieved statistically significant differences over control for secondary endpoints including clinical remission and endoscopic disease activity;</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">Combined uncontrolled data of all transplanted patients shows a striking reduction in clinical and endoscopic disease activity at 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">The high dose of cyclophosphamide used increased AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">Reduced intensity HSCT regimens and enhanced supportive care have reduced HSCT morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p>
              <p id="Par54">ASTIClite will therefore assess the clinical efficacy and long-term impact of low-dose cyclophosphamide/G-CSF mobilisation with reduced intensity conditioning in patients with active CD refractory to biologic therapies. Embedded mechanistic studies will assess the timeline of response, immune reconstitution after HSCT and the mechanism by which HSCT alleviates disease and restores anti-TNF responsiveness in this previously refractory group.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec id="Sec6">
              <title>Aims</title>
              <p id="Par55">The main aims of this study are to assess whether stem cell mobilisation with low-dose cyclophosphamide (1 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and G-CSF followed by autologous transplantation with a reduced intensity (‘HSCTlite’) conditioning regimen (fludarabine 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and rabbit ATG 7.5 mg/kg) is safe and effective in inducing regression of intestinal ulceration in patients with refractory CD, when compared with standard care.</p>
              <p id="Par56">An observational follow-up study through the EBMT will assess the long-term benefit and safety of HSCTlite for a minimum of a further 4–7 years after the stem cell transplant. The follow-up will also investigate the burden of disease without a transplant, although no formal comparison between groups is planned. Patients in the control group who undergo HSCTlite after the end of ASTIClite will continue with annual follow up in the follow-up study.</p>
              <p id="Par57">This multi-centre RCT has been designed to have direct clinical applicability in the management of refractory CD in the UK following completion.</p>

              <p id="Par67">The safety objectives in this study will initially be assessed as part of the embedded pilot study. The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will assess whether low-dose cyclophosphamide and G-CSF is a safe and effective mobilisation regimen for patients with refractory CD.

              <p id="Par72">HSCT is thought to induce regression of autoimmune diseases by altering the diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire and generating functional renewal of regulatory T cells and other immunoregulatory mechanisms that establish and maintain peripheral immune tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Neither the mechanism of action nor the time-course of response in CD is known.

The mobilisation phase can be undertaken as either an inpatient or outpatient, depending on the sites’ local procedures. Mesna, an NIMP in this study, is given alongside cyclophosphamide to prevent haemorrhagic cystitis. Four days after cyclophosphamide infusion, participants will receive G-CSF (filgrastim or biosimilar) 5 μg/kg.

Should the protocol fail to mobilise 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg (haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) in more than 10% patients, or if greater than 10% patients experience a disease flare up (increase in Harvey Bradshaw Index of &gt; 30% from baseline associated with a rise in CRP) during mobilisation, a protocol amendment will be submitted to modify the mobilisation regimen for subsequent patients.</p>
                <p id="Par170">All AEs will be recorded in the CRF and will use the NCI classification of toxicity for 100-day safety post HSCT for assessment of grade.</p>
                <p id="Par171">All AEs, SAEs and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be captured. All SAEs and SUSARs will be reported in accordance with the CTRU’s standard operating procedure. The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) for relevant products will be used as the reference safety information for reporting SAEs, and the PI is responsible for ensuring the assessment of expectedness and relatedness for all SAEs. Adverse events will be recorded from consent until the study closes. Although the timeframes for reporting SAEs differ between the RCT and the follow-up study, AEs will continue to be recorded throughout both elements of the study.</p>

              <title>Sample size</title>
              <p id="Par205">The values in the calculations are based upon the endoscopic assessment post-HSCT reported in the ASTIC trial program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the primary outcome, to detect a significant difference in the proportion of patients with absence of ulceration on endoscopic assessment of 35%, based on 50% in the HSCT group and no more than 15% in the control group, with 90% power at 5% significance level requires 62 patients in the HSCT group, and 31 in the control group. Therefore, 93 patients will be recruited at baseline, using 2:1 randomisation. Due to the nature of the condition, the design of the intervention and control group, the definition of the primary endpoint and our experience in the ASTIC trial, we anticipate a 6% drop out rate and will therefore recruit 99 patients (66 in the intervention group and 33 in the control group).</p>
              <p id="Par206">Based on experience in ASTIC, recruitment is anticipated to take 36 months. Patients will be recruited at 8 UK NHS Trusts, at an anticipated rate of 2.75 per month across all sites, or approximately 4 patients per site per year.</p>
              <p id="Par207">For the EBMT observational follow-up study, no additional sample size calculation has been performed; the study size is necessarily constrained by the number of patients recruited within the main RCT. However, allowing for drop-out, an expected sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 50 for the intervention arm at 4 years post-transplant will allow the prevalence of AEs to be estimated to a standard error of at most 7%.</p>

                <p id="Par218">Analyses will be reported in line with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement. Detailed descriptions of statistical analyses can be found in the ASTIClite statistical analysis plan. The trial statistician(s) will remain blinded throughout the study, but will be unblinded at database freeze, for analysis. The Senior Statistician within the CTRU will be unblinded to the treatment allocation throughout the trial, but will review and approve the statistical analysis plan before seeing any outcome data. Confidence intervals will be two-sided, 95% intervals and hypothesis tests will use a two-sided 5% level of significance. The primary analyses will be carried out using the intention to treat principle with data from all participants included in the analysis, including those who do not complete therapy and with participants analysed by the group to which they were randomised. Although the trial may terminate early on futility or safety grounds, no formal stopping rules are defined.</p>
                <p id="Par219">Analysis will be conducted in Stata version 14 or other validated statistical software as agreed by the study statisticians. Descriptive statistics for baseline values will be presented within each randomised group. These will include counts and percentages for binary and categorical variables and means and standard deviations, or medians with lower and upper quartiles, for continuous variables, along with minimum and maximum values and counts of missing values. There will be no tests of statistical significance or confidence intervals for differences between randomised groups on any baseline variable. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise assessments of feasibility and acceptability in terms of recruitment, drop-out and completeness of therapy.</p>
                <p id="Par220">To test the primary hypothesis of a between group difference in the proportion of patients with absence of ulceration, we will estimate the proportions for each group. A mixed effects logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios for the disease remission in HSCTlite in comparison to conventional therapy. Baseline SES-CD ulcer subscore will be included as a fixed effect and study centre as a random effect. A number of sensitivity analyses will be carried out on the primary outcome, including assessing the impact of missing outcome data, adjustment for baseline predictors of missing outcome data and complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par221">For the secondary outcomes, analogous parametric regression models will be used as appropriate to the distributional form of the outcome, accounting for study centre, and the corresponding baseline assessment for the outcome under investigation where appropriate.</p>
                <p id="Par222">A secondary mediation analysis will investigate putative mediational factors using modern causal inference methods. This involves using parametric regression models to test for mediation of HSCT on treatment success through biomarkers. Analyses will adjust for baseline measures of the marker, and possible measured confounders.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par232">CD is a distressing condition, and for many patients, there are no treatment options available to which the disease responds. Surgery is not always an option, and consequently some patients have a poor quality of life and are unable to work. The ASTIC trial suggested that HSCT could be beneficial to these patients, however, with the trial design and dosing regimen used in ASTIC, CD was not “cured”, and toxicity was unacceptably high for many patients.</p>
              <p id="Par233">ASTIClite aims to achieve these suggested beneficial outcomes, using a lower dose of the Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) in the HSCT regimen, using primary clinical outcomes that are designed to show beneficial effects, even if the patient still experiences CD recurrence.</p>
              <p id="Par234">Furthermore, ASTIClite will assess the clinical efficacy and long-term impact of lower doses of cyclophosphamide in the mobilisation of PBSCs followed by a reduced intensity fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and ATG-based conditioning regimen in patients with active CD refractory to biologic therapies. Embedded mechanistic studies will assess the timeline of response, immune reconstitution after HSCT and the mechanism by which HSCT alleviates disease and/or restores anti-TNF responsiveness in this previously refractory group.</p>
