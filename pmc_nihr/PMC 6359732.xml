                <sec>
                  <title>Design</title>
                  <p>Mixed methods. Single blind pilot randomised controlled trial, with control offered Skype therapy at end of study. Qualitative study of the acceptability of therapy delivery via Skype.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Setting</title>
                  <p>Nine speech and language therapy departments in northern England recruited participants to the study. Skype therapy was provided in a university setting.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Participants</title>
                  <p>Twenty-two children (14 M, 8 F) with dysarthria and cerebral palsy (mean age 8.8 years (SD 3.2)) agreed to take part. Participants were randomised to dysarthria therapy via Skype (n=11) or treatment as usual (n=11).</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Interventions</title>
                  <p>Children received either usual speech therapy from their local therapist for 6 weeks or dysarthria therapy via Skype from a research therapist. Usual therapy sessions varied in frequency, duration and content. Skype dysarthria therapy focused on breath control and phonation to produce clear speech at a steady rate, and comprised three 40 min sessions per week for 6 weeks.</p>

                  <title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title>
                  <p>Feasibility and acceptability of the trial design, intervention and outcome measures.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Departments recruited two to three participants. All participants agreed to random allocation. None withdrew from the study. Recordings of children’s speech were made at all time points and rated by listeners. Families allocated to Skype dysarthria therapy judged internet delivery of the therapy to be acceptable. All families reported that the study design was acceptable. Treatment integrity checks suggested that the phrases practised in one therapy exercise should be reduced in length.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>A delayed treatment design, in which dysarthria therapy is offered at the end of the study to families allocated to treatment as usual, is acceptable. A randomised controlled trial of internet delivered dysarthria therapy is feasible.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Approximately 2 per 1000 infants have cerebral palsy,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> of whom 20% have motor disorders affecting speech production,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> causing the speech disorder dysarthria. Dysarthria in cerebral palsy can lead to shallow, uncontrolled breathing for speech; breathy, harsh voice; reduced pitch variation/unexpected pitch breaks; hypernasality; poor articulation and difficulties in modulating pitch, loudness and timing to vary intonation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4–7</xref> These characteristics reduce the intelligibility of children’s speech, with severe impacts on quality of life,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> social participation,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> education and employment prospects.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</p>
              <p>Therapy to improve speech is limited, but is a priority for families.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Children in the UK receive an average of 20 hours per year to address both communication and speech issues. Intervention often targets word production through the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and non-speech oromotor function, which have no supporting evidence in childhood dysarthria.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Small-scale studies of therapy to control respiratory effort for speech and coordinating exhalation with phonation to generate a clearer speech signal and a steady speech rate have shown increases in intelligibility, utterance duration and communicative participation.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref> However, as yet no randomised controlled trials (RCT) of this type of intervention for children with cerebral palsy have been reported.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p>
              <p>To date, therapy focusing on breath support and rate has been provided face to face. But sessions may be difficult to schedule in school given the number required to promote motor learning (18–20 sessions over 4–6 weeks, depending on the therapy programme<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18 21</xref>). Attending clinics outside school hours may not be possible because children with cerebral palsy have considerable mobility restrictions, in addition to parents’ work and other commitments. A recent systematic review has shown that web-based therapy shows promise as an acceptable, feasible and effective method of delivery for children with speech and language disorders.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The activities involved in dysarthria therapy (eg, repetition, picture naming, picture description and conversation) are similar to those used in previously tested internet therapy,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> and thus it may be possible to deliver dysarthria programmes as teletherapies.

              <p>This study aimed to examine the acceptability of internet delivery of dysarthria therapy and to test the feasibility of conducting an RCT comparing intensive dysarthria therapy targeting respiration, phonation and speech rate delivered via the internet using Skype in increasing the speech intelligibility of children with cerebral palsy and dysarthria with usual therapy. The objectives were: to ascertain recruitment rate, attrition rate, outcome measure completion, data quality and acceptability of the study design to participant children and their families in both randomised arms of the study; to measure adherence to the treatment protocol to those allocated to Skype therapy and gauge families’ perceptions of the acceptability of Skype delivery of therapy; and to develop a tool to measure therapy costs. Our previous research sought to capture natural variation and change in speech by recording children on two separate occasions twice before and three points after therapy.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> This study additionally aimed to determine the minimum amount of data that should be collected in a full trial.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Families used their own personal computer (PC) or tablet and webcams (internal or external) for the therapy. No additional hardware (eg, external microphones) was provided. Smartphones were not used as images of pictures used in therapy would be too small to see clearly. Prior to Skype therapy parents accepted the therapist’s Skype contact request and taught their child to recognise the therapist’s Skype picture on their PC or tablet. Parents were with the child when the therapist called to start each session. Skype dysarthria therapy was delivered three times per week for 6 weeks following the Speech Systems Approach.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> Therapy sessions were delivered by one of three therapists employed for the project (HK, NP, KS), depending on availability. The therapists were generalist paediatric clinicians who were 6 months to 4 years postcertification and who had no prior experience of providing motor speech interventions or teletherapy. Prior to the research, they were trained to conduct the programme according to a written protocol by the lead author through demonstration, discussion and self-study. Each therapy session lasted approximately 40 min. Children were taught to control exhalation and phonation to produce a clear voice in open vowels by copying the therapist’s model. Children were given external targets relating to how voice sounds, individualised to children’s vocal characteristics, for example, ‘say it in a loud/big/strong/steady voice’, until the most helpful prompt was found. Children then practised using their (loud, steady, strong) target voice in a hierarchy of speech tasks involving increasingly longer utterances, from short single words to multisyllabic words and phrases in speaking tasks involving progressively greater cognitive processing (eg, conversation, question and answers, guess who games). Children were required to produce their target voice in 8/10 productions in a task to move to the next level of the hierarchy. In phrases, children were encouraged to limit the number of syllables they spoke on a breath and to maintain a speaking rate which sustains the target voice and speech clarity. In each session, children practised using their target voice in at least 120 utterances in four exercises: (1) 10 open vowels; (2) three productions of 10 self-selected phrases that they often use in daily life (herein familiar phrases); (3) 70–80 words and phrases from the speech task hierarchy (eg, 70 single syllable words); and (4) random presentation of 10–20 utterances from the three preceding tasks. Feedback was provided frequently to help children acquire the new voice at each level and then faded to aid retention. Children were also encouraged to monitor their own productions and to use internal feedback (eg, ‘How did that sound/feel?’). Parents were free to sit with their child during the therapy. During the first two or three sessions all parents sat near their child, watched how therapists elicited speech behaviours and commented on how their child sounded. Therapists also asked parents to remind children to use their target voice in daily interaction, but did not train them to use other therapy techniques. Once they were familiar with the therapy routine, some parents chose to attend to household tasks out of view of the webcam but within calling distance of the child if any difficulties arose, others continued to sit nearby.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>The aim of dysarthria therapy is to increase children’s speech intelligibility. We measured the intelligibility of children’s speech in single words and connected speech. As in our previous studies, we elicited single words using the Children’s Speech Intelligibility Measure (CSIM),<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which comprises 200 lists of 50 single words matched in length and complexity. In this assessment, the child repeats words spoken by the researcher. We developed random allocation schedules to ensure that each list was allocated a maximum of twice in the study and no list was allocated to the same child twice. We elicited connected speech using picture description. Children described pictures and the researcher transcribed their speech verbatim, and then repeated the utterances to check their understanding with the child. The research therapists recorded children’s single word and connected speech at home on two separate days at 6 weeks and 1 week prior to therapy and at 1, 6 and 12 weeks after therapy completion. Recordings were made using an Edirol 9 digital recorder, with a table-mounted microphone (Audio-Technica Pro 24) placed on a table 80 cm from the child (measured at 180°).</p>
                  <p>To calculate average percentage intelligibility we played each recording to three unfamiliar adults who had no experience of conversing with people who have speech disorders. We recruited listeners via adverts in newsletters for personnel in regional businesses. Each recording was heard by three different listeners. Each listener was allocated two to three different recordings via a secure web platform with the proviso that they heard the same child only once. Listeners were blind to the time of recording (ie, before or after therapy). They were instructed not to turn up the volume of the recordings (although this could not be enforced). In the single word task listeners heard a word and selected the word from a written list of 12 phonetically similar foils. In the connected speech task listeners orthographically transcribed each phrase they heard. The system constrained playing of recordings so that each word/phrase could be played only once. We provided no information about the participants other than that they had cerebral palsy and were taking part in a study about their speech. We calculated percentage intelligibility scores for each single word recording and each connected speech recording heard by each listener using the word lists and gold standard transcriptions created by the researchers when making the connected speech recordings as the denominators.</p>

                <p>The Skype dysarthria therapy requires that children produce at least 120 speech behaviours in four exercises per session. At the start of each exercise the therapist gains eye contact, checks the child’s sitting posture, describes the exercise, provides a model and instructs the child to produce the behaviour in their target voice (eg, ‘Tell me what these are. Use your strong voice.’ We developed a Treatment Integrity Checklist to code the presence of these therapy actions and the number of behaviours elicited in each exercise (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary material 1</xref>). We randomly selected two sessions of each child’s Skype dysarthria therapy to be video recorded. A researcher who was not involved in delivering therapy to the recorded child completed the treatment integrity checklist from the video recording. Five of the video recordings were also independently rated by a second rater.</p>

                <p>Parents and children allocated to the Skype dysarthria therapy group were interviewed three times (1 week before, 3 weeks into and 6 weeks after the intervention) about their experiences of receiving therapy through Skype by a researcher who was not involved in therapy provision (JS). In the third interview they were also asked about their experiences of randomisation and taking part in the study. Parents and children allocated to usual therapy were interviewed about the study design at the end of the study. Interviews were semistructured and followed a topic guide developed for the study. Questions about the therapy covered perceived benefits and disadvantages of receiving therapy via Skype, any memorable experiences of the Skype therapy, impact of therapy on children’s speech and communication and parents’ encouragement of children to use their new voice (the latter two topics are unrelated to feasibility and are reported elsewhere<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Questions about the study design asked what it was like to be involved in the research, suggestions for making it easier for families to take part and views about the measures used. All but two children were interviewed separately to their parent/carer to ensure each participant’s voice was heard. Initial interviews took place in children’s homes. Subsequent interviews were taken at home or via telephone/Skype at the families’ convenience. Two children were interviewed at school with their teaching assistant present. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed orthographically. Interviews with children took approximately 35 min (range 15–45 min) and 45–50 min with parents.</p>

We also conducted a literature review of tools to measure benefits suitable for use in an economic evaluation. PubMed, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, NHS EED and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (Ovid) databases were searched to identify literatures on tools to measure benefits for children with speech, language and communication disabilities aged 3–18 years. Full-text articles were included with no year limitation but language restricted to English. The review focused on the relevance of the tool to the client group and the availability of a validated method to convert responses into health state utilities which in turn would be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years—a common metric used in economic evaluations (further details available from the authors).</p>

                <p>To determine the feasibility of the study design we assessed the recruitment rate, attrition rate, outcome measure completion and data quality in both randomised arms and adherence to the dysarthria therapy protocol in children allocated to Skype therapy. We used descriptive statistics to assess feasibility and set the following criteria:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Seventy-five per cent identified children agree to be randomised to dysarthria therapy or usual treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seventy-five per cent children allocated to the usual treatment group are retained for the duration of the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Eighty-five per cent recorded sessions reach criterion of 120 behaviours produced across four exercises.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seventy-five per cent children recruited to the treatment group and their parents rate therapy via Skype as acceptable and no insurmountable problems are reported by families.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sixty-seven per cent in the Skype therapy condition and their parents rate therapy as at least somewhat effective at 12 weeks after therapy.</p></list-item></list>
</p>
                <p>Agreement between raters on the adherence to the therapy protocol was assessed using kappa for the presence of therapist actions at the start of each exercise (eg, describing the exercise, providing a model) and Pearson correlation coefficient for the number of behaviours elicited in each exercise. As the aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of the study design, we did not examine change using our clinical outcome measures.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>

                <p>To assess acceptability of delivery of the therapy via Skype and acceptability of the study design we analysed transcribed interview data using an inductive thematic analysis.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> One researcher (JS) repeatedly read and compared interview transcripts to develop codes to describe meaning within interviews, and grouped codes into overarching themes and subthemes. Verification of the codes and themes took place through discussion of code examples and potential themes with two other researchers (KB and LP). Disagreements were resolved through further review of the data set and explanation of thinking behind particular coding or themes. Interview transcripts were coded and stored using NVivo V.10.</p>
                <p>In the development of a tool to assess therapy costs we used descriptive statistics (median, range) to summarise data relating to therapists’ time spent on activities relating to each participant allocated to treatment as usual and completion of each section of the data collection form.</p>
                <p>To determine if it is possible to reduce the amount of data collected, we examined the agreement between intelligibility measures taken on day 1 and day 2 of the paired recordings and between pretherapy recordings using mixed effects regression models, with recording pair nested within data collection point, nested within child to obtain intraclass correlation coefficients.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We also used regression models to examine the effect of word list length on estimates of percentage intelligibility. Lists comprising the first 15, 20, 25 and 30 words were compared with the full 50 words. In the examination of the effect of word list length, we fitted child as a random effect and list length as a fixed effect. We used intraclass correlation coefficients to measure agreement between the reduced lists and the full 50-word list for the full data set, and for pretherapy and post-therapy data separately.</p>

                  <p>None of the participants withdrew from the study. All children allocated to Skype dysarthria completed 6 weeks of intervention. All children remained in the arm to which they were originally allocated, surpassing our feasibility criterion of 75%.

                  <p>We completed 206 of 220 planned recordings (94%) of children’s speech. Seven recordings, from the last four children recruited, could not be completed by the cut-off for recordings which was imposed by the research time frame. A further seven recordings (from four children) could not take place due to child illness (4) or holidays (3). We recruited 213 listeners over 12 weeks, who rated a mean of three recordings each (SD 0.15). Parent and teacher compliance with questionnaire (FOCUS) completion was low: 29/44 parent questionnaires (66%); 26/44 teacher (59%); 34 pretherapy (77%); 22 post-therapy (50%).</p>

Therapy time lost to connection problems ranged from 2 to 30 min per child over their programme of therapy (median 15; range 0–38). Longer connection issues were encountered when new devices were used and one session was abandoned due to Skype issues that affected users globally.</p>
                  <p>Video recordings of 31 Skype dysarthria therapy sessions (19%) were checked for treatment fidelity. Agreement between the two raters on the presence of therapy activities at the start of each exercise was substantial<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> (Κ=0.72) and high for the numbers of behaviours produced in each exercise (<italic>r</italic>=0.99, p&lt;0.001). Twenty sessions (65%) met the criterion of 120 behaviours (mean 121, range 74–140), thus failing to meet the feasibility criterion of 85% of sessions containing 120 speech behaviours. Failure to elicit 120 speech behaviours arose because the functional phrases selected by five participants for practice in exercise 2 were long and could not be spoken on one breath. This curtailed the time left for rapid elicitation of novel words and phrases and random practice in exercises 3 and 4. In two sessions, Skype connection difficulties reduced time available to complete the exercises.</p>

                  <p>Discussion about the delivery of the intervention via Skype centred around four key themes: (1) familiarity with technology; (2) remote connections; (3) fit with family life; and (4) unforeseen benefits.</p>
                  <sec id="s4b1a">
                    <title>Familiarity with technology</title>
                    <p>During the interviews, none of the parents raised concerns about using Skype for therapy. Those allocated to the Skype therapy described themselves as being familiar with using technology for communication; some had used Skype before to keep in touch with relatives and others had used alternative video communication software such as FaceTime. Parents were happy for the children to be contacted by the research therapists via Skype for prearranged sessions once they had accepted the study Skype name as a contact.</p>

                    </disp-quote>
                    <p>Children were also positive about therapy via their tablet/computer, seeing it as ‘cool’ (Child G). Most appeared confident about using the technology from the start, although one child who had not used Skype or FaceTime had lots of questions about how to work the software and appeared a little anxious about being able to connect. However, in post-therapy interviews this child reported that she quickly ‘got used’ to Skype after the first couple of sessions.</p>

They described how children used their own computer or tablet, chose where to do therapy and some older participants logged on independently once parents were sure they recognised the Skype contact used by the researchers for the study. Parents described how they could remain nearby, see what was happening in therapy and be on hand to help if was required, but could also attend to other household tasks and spend time with their other children. This meant that parents could be involved but also let their children take control and ownership of their therapy.</p>

                <title>Summary of findings</title>
                <p>This study aimed to test the feasibility of conducting an RCT of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of intensive dysarthria therapy versus usual treatment for children with cerebral palsy. Results suggest that an RCT is feasible and acceptable but that the study processes and data collection can be simplified to reduce research costs and burden to participants.</p>
                <p>The study design was acceptable to families. Families joined the research because they were seeking therapy to improve children’s speech intelligibility and communicative independence, which is highly prized.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> An important component of feasibility of recruitment was the offer of the experimental therapy to families allocated to treatment as usual at the end of data collection, even though the treatment may turn out not to be effective. Our findings here concur with the results of previous trials of interventions for children with other types of neurodisability, such as autism,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42–44</xref> and support the conclusion that parents of children with neurodisability often feel the need to ‘do more’ for their children continue to seek additional input that could aid their child’s development.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> There was no loss of precision in estimates of variation of intelligibility when we reduced the number of words assessed from 50 to 20, which is similar to other tests of intelligibility.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Future trials could limit data collected to single recordings of 20 single words and picture description at 1 week before therapy, and 1, 6 and 12 weeks after therapy. Return of the FOCUS questionnaire was low (approximately 60%) and could possibly be improved if usual mechanisms of communication (eg, home-school diaries and bags) were used.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
</p>
                <p>Similar to other studies of teletherapy for children with speech disorders and adults with dysarthria,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 24 49</xref> interviews with parents and participants suggest that provision of therapy via Skype is feasible and acceptable to families. Therapy was delivered according to the therapy protocol and children and parents reported no difficulties in maintaining rapport with the therapist, supporting other recent research.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 24 50</xref> One possible advantage of the study design was that the research therapists were familiar to families by the time therapy was due to commence, having carried out the assessments and speech recordings. Shaw and colleagues, in their study of general practice consultations, found that sessions via videoconferencing flowed more easily when patients and practitioners knew each other and had time to build a relationship.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Internet connection issues affected one in five sessions in our study, but were generally short and resolvable as previous UK research.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, connection difficulties affected some children more than others, possibly due to broadband speed. Test sessions to establish Skype connection with families and to confirm computer settings would be advisable in future research and if implementing Skype in therapy.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> None of the parents reported any concerns about internet safety and were happy for therapists to contact the family via Skype to start therapy sessions. Individualised actions to maximise internet safety would be required in a trial, as recommended for all children,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and Trusts would need to assess information governance issues individually.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> However, Skype is now being piloted by NHS Trusts as a medium to conduct consultations and advice exists on its use in clinical settings.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52–54</xref>
</p>
                <p>For most children it was possible to complete all therapy exercises within 40 min. Problems that occurred were due to a selecting phrases that were too long to say in one breath. A similar finding has been noted for adults with dysarthria caused by Parkinson’s disease.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> This could be readily avoided in future trials. Shortening the phrases may also help reduce the overall session length, making them more accessible to children who find it difficult to maintain their concentration.</p>
                <p>Therapy was conducted by three generalist clinicians who had no experience of childhood motor speech disorders or teletherapy. As such, they were similar to many NHS therapists who provide services to children in mainstream schools in the UK, but less experienced than therapists who provide specialist services to children with motor disorders.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This study has shown that the protocol can be followed by junior therapists and by extension it should be suitable for therapists with greater experience. Future trials should test the effectiveness of the therapy when delivered via local therapists, and include a process evaluation to evaluate barriers to and facilitators of implementation which have not been identified in our research to date.<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> If a study were clustered at the unit of Trust, to avoid contamination between therapists providing intervention and participants interacting with each other, mean cluster size can be estimated as 3, based on recruitment from Trusts who had not participated in previous studies. We recruited a small number of participants who were known to NHS speech and language therapy services via parent networks and support organisations. Advertisement of trials via parental support networks should be encouraged to reduce gatekeeping.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec id="s5b">
                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study recruited participants from eight Trusts within one region. Recruitment may not be representative of Trusts in other parts of the UK. However, to our knowledge no research is being conducted on children’s speech elsewhere in the UK and there is sparse research internationally.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Families participating in this study used their own laptops/tablets for the remote therapy and may represent a ‘tech-savvy’ group. Teletherapy in NHS is only feasible to families with a computer and internet access; consideration would be needed as to whether this approach might widen socioeconomic health inequalities.</p>
                <p>Intelligibility measures were conducted by the research therapists, which could have prompted children to use their new voice during measurement. Future research should ensure that measurements are conducted by personnel who have not been involved in therapy but who have built up a rapport with children so that they feel comfortable during the assessments.</p>
                <p>All parents rated speech to have improved at least moderately by 12 weeks. Such lack of variation precludes the calculation of a minimally important difference in speech intelligibility using anchor-based methods and suggests change in percentage intelligibility should be used to inform sample size calculation.<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Only one child judged their speech to have improved moderately (level 4); all others judged their speech to be a (very) great deal better (6 or 7) at all time points. High ratings may be due to response bias and social desirability. However, children may have experienced change that led them to report their speech being a (very) great deal better. Furthermore, they may also have developed confidence in or from their ability to be understood, as reported in the interviews. Future research must measure the impact of therapy on children’s participation and well-being as well as their intelligibility.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</p>
                <p>The aim of usual treatment and a very brief description of the intervention was provided by local therapists in our costing tool. Although the tool showed that none of the children in the treatment as usual group received intervention focusing on breath support, phonation and rate to increase the clarity of children’s speech, it did not enable us to describe the intervention that the children received. For example, we do not know if motor learning principles that underpinned the Skype dysarthria therapy were included in articulation therapy. Future research should include the aim and focus of treatment as usual and the active ingredients. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication checklist<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> could be used as a basis for expanding the tool.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The study suggests that an RCT of dysarthria therapy is feasible, that therapy can be provided via Skype to children with cerebral palsy and that families would participate in a trial if all arms of the study included provision of Skype dysarthria therapy at some point. Future trials could use a smaller data set to measure intelligibility than previously tested, which would reduce the time and costs required to conduct a trial and reduce the burden of participating in the study for families.</p>
