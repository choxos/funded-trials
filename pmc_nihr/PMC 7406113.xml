                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Even though respiratory support is a common intervention in paediatric critical care, there is no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence regarding the effectiveness of two commonly used modes of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC). FIRST-line support for assistance in breathing in children is a master protocol of two pragmatic non-inferiority RCTs to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of HFNC (compared with CPAP) as the first-line mode of support in critically ill children.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>We will recruit participants over a 30-month period at 25 UK paediatric critical care units (paediatric intensive care units/high-dependency units). Patients are eligible if admitted/accepted for admission, aged &gt;36 weeks corrected gestational age and &lt;16 years, and assessed by the treating clinician to require NRS for an acute illness (step-up RCT) or within 72 hours of extubation following a period of invasive ventilation (step-down RCT). Due to the emergency nature of the treatment, written informed consent will be deferred to after randomisation. Randomisation will occur 1:1 to CPAP or HFNC, stratified by site and age (&lt;12 vs ≥12 months). The primary outcome is time to liberation from respiratory support for a continuous period of 48 hours. A total sample size of 600 patients in each RCT will provide 90% power with a type I error rate of 2.5% (one sided) to exclude the prespecified non-inferiority margin of HR of 0.75. Primary analyses will be undertaken separately in each RCT in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.</p>

                  <title>Ethics and dissemination</title>
                  <p>This master protocol received favourable ethical opinion from National Health Service East of England—Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee (reference: 19/EE/0185) and approval from the Health Research Authority (reference: 260536). Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed medical journals and presentations at national and international conferences.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Nearly 75% of the 20 000 critically ill children admitted annually to UK paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) receive some form of respiratory support.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Increasing recognition of the risks of invasive ventilation has prompted greater use of non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> Two main modes of NRS are used, to support acutely ill children with respiratory failure or to provide postextubation support after a spell of invasive ventilation.</p>
              <p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been used by PICUs for over three decades.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Although observational data suggest that CPAP is effective, there have been few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CPAP in critically ill children.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref> CPAP can be uncomfortable and may be associated with complications such as air-leak and nasal trauma, often necessitating the use of sedation, close monitoring and a high level of nursing input. An alternate mode of NRS, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), has gained popularity more recently. It appears easy to use and is well tolerated.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref> Between 16% and 35% of PICU admissions receive HFNC at some point during their stay.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 12 13</xref> The potential benefits of HFNC (improved patient comfort, safety profile and ease of nursing care) must be balanced against its potential risks (air leak, abdominal distension and nosocomial infection), and concerns regarding unnecessary prolongation of PICU/hospital stay and excess mortality from delayed escalation. There are few RCTs comparing HFNC with CPAP in the PICU setting. Previous RCTs do not include children with a range of ages and diagnoses needing either step-up or step-down (postextubation) care, making it impossible to generalise their findings to contemporary practice.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14–16</xref>
</p>
              <p>FIRST-line support for assistance in breathing in children (FIRST-ABC), therefore, addresses an important clinical dilemma faced daily by critical care clinicians: in a child requiring NRS, which modality, HFNC or CPAP, should they use as first-line therapy to achieve the best patient outcomes? Our research question was prioritised by clinicians as well as parents/patients. We previously successfully completed a pilot RCT, which supported the feasibility of performing a large pragmatic RCT comparing CPAP and HFNC in critically ill children, and informed its design and conduct.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This protocol has been written in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

                <title>Design</title>
                <p>FIRST-ABC is a master protocol comprising two pragmatic, multicentre, parallel groups, non-inferiority RCTs (step-up RCT and step-down RCT) with shared infrastructure, including an internal pilot stage and integrated health economic evaluation. This design allows the research question to be addressed in each of the two important populations in an efficient way by minimising time and infrastructure costs as compared with conducting two sequential RCTs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The pragmatic study design ensures that research findings can be more easily generalised to real-world practice.</p>
                <p>A non-inferiority design was chosen based on previous RCTs in this area and feedback from clinicians from the UK Paediatric Intensive Care Society—Study Group in July 2017 which indicated that the potential benefits of HFNC (in terms of patient comfort and ease of use) would mean that it would likely be preferred in usual practice even if not shown to be superior to CPAP.</p>

Prespecified objective criteria to identify non-responders to HFNC/CPAP are provided in the algorithms as a guide for clinicians considering switching or escalating respiratory support. Reasons for switches or escalations will be recorded. Patients who switch or escalate treatments will remain in the trial and continue to be monitored until liberation from respiratory support.

                  <title>Consent procedures</title>
                  <p>Consent will be sought for the child (patient) from their parent/legal guardian. Children become eligible for FIRST-ABC when critically ill, a profoundly stressful time for parents/guardians, during which there are ethical concerns both about the burden of trying to understand the trial and the ability to provide informed consent. Initiation of NRS typically occurs during a time-sensitive situation, where delays could be detrimental to the child and to the trial’s scientific validity. Moreover, both CPAP and HFNC are already widely used in standard practice across the NHS. Considering these reasons, FIRST-ABC has been given ethical approval to use a deferred consent model (‘research without prior consent’). Once a patient is confirmed eligible, they will be randomised and the allocated treatment (CPAP or HFNC) commenced as soon as possible. This model, developed in line with the CONseNt methods in paediatric Emergency and urgent Care Trials guidance,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> has been found acceptable to parents/guardians and clinicians in several recent RCTs in the PICU setting<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 21–25</xref> and is informed by experience/feedback from the pilot RCT.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Following randomisation, a trained, delegated member of the local research team will approach the child’s parents/guardians as soon as appropriate and practically possible to discuss the trial (usually within 24–48 hours of randomisation). A participant information sheet will be provided, covering information about the purpose of the trial; the consequences of participating or not; confidentiality; use of personal data; data security and the future availability of the trial results. A consent form (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>) will be provided, indicating that: the information given has been read and understood; participation is voluntary and consent can be withdrawn at any time without consequence; and that consent is given for access to medical records to continue data collection, to receive a follow-up questionnaire and for anonymised data to be shared in the future. Due to age and severity of illness, it will not be possible to involve the patient in the consenting process. Instead, assent will be obtained prior to hospital discharge if their condition allows (eg, they regain mental capacity).</p>

In the latter situation, the local research team will obtain information from colleagues and bereavement counsellors to establish the most appropriate clinical/research team member to notify the parents/guardians of involvement in the trial. If approach for consent is deemed not appropriate prior to the parent/guardian’s departure from hospital, then they will be approached by post 4 weeks postrandomisation. The letter will explain how to opt out of the trial. Postal contact will be made again if there is no response after 4 weeks. If no consent form is received within 4 weeks of the second letter, the participant’s data will be included in the trial.</p>
                  <p>If informed consent is refused or withdrawn, this decision will be respected and abided by, and no further contact made. All data occurring up to the point of this decision will be retained in the trial, unless parents/guardians request otherwise.</p>

                <p>Time to liberation from respiratory support, defined as the start of a 48-hour period during which the child was free of all forms of respiratory support.</p>
                <p>The primary outcome definition of respiratory support does not include administration of supplementary oxygen alone. In addition, the primary outcome will to be monitored/recorded after discharge from critical care, as necessary. We chose time to liberation from respiratory support, instead of rate of (re)intubation, as the primary outcome for several reasons, including: (1) through our patient and public involvement (PPI) work, parents/families reported that even though intubation was clearly an undesirable outcome, the fact that the child needed a ‘breathing machine’ of any description would be more important for them, in terms of assessing the success or failure of the intervention. Normalisation of ‘breathing’ was an important outcome prioritised over intubation; (2) since the rate of intubation on average was around 20% in the pilot RCT, nearly 80% of patients may not fulfil the intubation outcome. In these patients, several non-invasive support modes may be used, which prolong the time the patient is on ‘breathing support’ with resource implications for critical care. Clinicians felt that it was important that the effect of the intervention was assessed on patients who did not need intubation as well as on those who did. (3) unpublished data from the pilot RCT showed that the length of respiratory support is longer in patients who need intubation compared with those who do not. Therefore, the adverse impact of intubation is likely reflected in longer duration of respiratory support.</p>

                <p>To achieve 90% power with a type I error rate of 2.5% (one sided) to exclude the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of HR=0.75 requires 508 events to be observed. Based on pilot RCT data,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> we anticipate 5% censoring due to death or transfer, leading to a required sample size of 268 patients per group in each of the two RCTs. To allow for withdrawal/refusal of consent, and for exclusion due to non-adherence in the per-protocol (PP) population, we will recruit a total sample size of 600 patients in each RCT.</p>

                <p>Data will be analysed at the end of the internal pilot stage (months 7–12 of the grant timeline) on patients recruited during the first 6 months in each RCT. The RCTs will progress from pilot to full trial based on prespecified progression criteria related to successful site set-up, screening and recruitment, and adherence.

                <p>All analyses will be publicly lodged<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> in a statistical analysis plan, a priori, before the investigators are unblinded to any trial outcomes. Following best practice for non-inferiority trials, the primary analyses will be undertaken in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and PP populations, with robust conclusions possible in the situation where both populations provide concordant results. Results will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement extensions for non-inferiority and pragmatic trials.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref>
</p>
                <p>Analyses will be undertaken independently for each RCT. In each RCT, baseline patient characteristics will be compared between the two groups to observe balance and the success of randomisation. These comparisons will not be subjected to statistical testing. The delivery of the intervention will be described for each group in detail, including (but not limited to) number and percentage of patients who commence the randomised treatment, remain on the randomised treatment until liberation from ventilation, who are changed to a different mode of respiratory support.</p>
                <p>HFNC will be considered non-inferior to CPAP if the lower bounds of the 95% CIs for the HR from Cox regression models on time to liberation from respiratory support fitted in both the ITT and PP populations exclude the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.75 (corresponding to approximately a 16-hour increase in median time to liberation, based on pilot RCT data). This margin was considered adequate such that the other potential benefits of HFNC in terms of comfort and tolerability would mean that it would be likely to be preferred in usual practice. The Cox regression models will be adjusted for important baseline characteristics. The covariates for inclusion in the regression models will be selected a priori based on an established relationship with outcome for critically ill children, and not because of observed imbalance, significance in univariable analyses or by a stepwise selection method.</p>
                <p>Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome will be performed to test for interactions between the effect of allocated treatment group and the following baseline covariates:</p>

                <p>We will treat age as a continuous variable and determine whether the model goodness-of-fit is better versus treating age as a categorical term for any analyses focusing on those over the age of 12 months. We anticipate a high proportion of patients will be aged &lt;12 months, and therefore, exploration of age effects in the older ages will only be conducted if there are sufficient patient numbers.</p>
                <p>As a sensitivity analysis, the primary analysis will be repeated using time to start weaning of NRS (ie, duration of ‘acute’ respiratory support) and time to meeting objective ‘readiness to wean NRS’ criteria.</p>
                <p>Secondary analyses of binary outcomes (mortality, reintubation) will be performed by Fisher’s exact test and adjusted logistic regression. Duration of survival to day 180 will be plotted as Kaplan-Meier survival curves, compared unadjusted with the log rank test and adjusted using Cox regression models. Analyses of duration of PICU/HDU and hospital stay will be performed by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, stratified by survival status. Analyses of COMFORT-B score, sedation use, PSS:PICU and HrQoL will be performed by t-tests and adjusted linear regression.</p>
                <p>In the step-up RCT, a single interim analysis will be carried out after the recruitment and follow-up to day 60 of 300 patients. The interim analysis will use a Peto-Haybittle stopping rule to recommend early termination due to superiority of either intervention (p&lt;0.001) in time to liberation from respiratory support or evidence of harm from either intervention (p&lt;0.05) in mortality at day 60. Both tests will be performed using a log-rank test on all available data within the ITT population. Further interim analyses will be performed only if requested by the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC).</p>
                <p>In the step-down RCT, due to faster than anticipated recruitment, no formal interim analysis will be performed. Safety data (counts and percentages of AEs by arm and a line listing of SAEs) will be available for scrutiny by the DMEC, by the end of the internal pilot stage.</p>

Resource use data from the PICU/HDU stay will be taken from the CRF and linked routine data from PICANet. Information on subsequent PICU/HDU and hospital admissions will be obtained via data linkage with PICANet and NHS Digital and also through completion of the HSQ. Data on the level of care for PICU bed-days will be gathered through routine collection of the Paediatric Critical Care Minimum Dataset in the participating sites via the PICANet database. Use of primary care and community health services will be assessed by HSQ at 6 months. Patient-level resource use data will be combined with appropriate unit costs from the NHS payment by results and Personal Social Services Research Unit databases to report total costs per patient for up to 6 months postrandomisation. Data from PedsQL and CHU-9D at 6 months will be combined with survival data to report QALYs at 6 months. The CEA will follow the ITT principle and report the mean (95% CI) incremental costs, QALYs and net monetary benefit at 6 months. The CEA will use multilevel linear regression models that allow for clustering of patients at site. The analysis will adjust for key baseline covariates at both patient and site level.</p>
