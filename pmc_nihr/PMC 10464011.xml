                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Arts therapies are widely but inconsistently provided in community mental health. Whilst they are appealing to patients, evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Trials to date have been limited to one art-form or diagnosis. Patients may hold strong preferences for or against an art-form whilst group therapies rely on heterogeneity to provide a range of learning experiences. This study will test whether manualised group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) are effective in reducing psychological distress for diagnostically heterogeneous patients in community mental health compared to active group counselling control.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">A pragmatic multi-centre 2-arm randomised controlled superiority trial with health economic evaluation and nested process evaluation. Adults agedââ¥â18, living in the community with a primary diagnosis of psychosis, mood, or anxiety disorder will be invited to participate and provide written informed consent. Participants are eligible if they scoreââ¥â1.65 on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Those eligible will view videos of arts therapies and be asked for their preference. Participants are randomised to either their preferred type of group arts therapy or counselling. Groups will run twice per week in a community venue for 20Â weeks. Our primary outcome is symptom distress at the end of intervention. Secondary outcomes include observer-rated symptoms, social situation and quality of life. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12Â months post-intervention. Outcome assessors and trial statisticians will be blinded. Analysis will be intention-to-treat. Economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of group arts therapies. A nested process evaluation will consist of treatment fidelity analysis, exploratory analysis of group process measures and qualitative interviews with participants and therapists.</p>

                  <title>Discussion</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This will be the first trial to account for patient preferences and diagnostic heterogeneity in group arts therapies. As with all group therapies, there are a number of logistical challenges to which we have had to further adapt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the study will provide evidence as to whether there is an additive benefit or not to the use of the arts in group therapy in community mental health care.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par41">Arts therapies are widely but inconsistently provided across National Health Service (NHS) mental health trusts. Art, music and dance movement therapies can enable patients with mental illness to identify difficulties and strengths through use of the art-form in varying group interactions, facilitate emotional expression in creative activities, allow experiences and learning in non-verbal and verbal communication, strengthen self-esteem in art production (e.g. painting, song, dance) and help exploration of new emotional and cognitive approaches with the support of the group and the therapist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A core principle in group therapies is the composition of group members to ensure heterogeneity of problems and experiences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A mix of different perspectives and experiences therefore allows greater opportunities for new behaviours and learning between group members.</p>
                <p id="Par42">To date, effectiveness trials of group arts therapies have mostly focused upon patients with a single psychiatric disorder with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The focus on a single disorder limits the extent findings that can be generalised to how arts therapies are routinely provided. For example, the MATISSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and NESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] trials, whilst pragmatic in nature, both focused on narrowly defined populations (patients only with schizophrenia) that are rarely encountered in usual clinical practice. In contrast, a study of individual music therapy for patients with low therapy motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] is one of the few trials to have included a diagnostically heterogeneous population but did not examine this within a group context. One further study for psychiatric outpatients with severe mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] utilised group music therapy only with a songwriting focus and found significant effects on quality of life.</p>
                <p id="Par43">This study is based on the concept that therapeutically effective processes are common to all arts therapies modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Accordingly, NICE combines the evidence for them in one analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, for any arts therapy to have an effect, patients need to engage with the group and the art form used. The appeal of art forms and patient preferences vary. A poor match of preference and the offered art form is likely to lead to poorer attendance andâeven in attending patientsâpoorer outcomes, as suggested by both MATISSE and NESS trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A similar picture is seen in wider psychological treatment, preference matching is associated with lower dropout and higher therapeutic alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], whereas lack of preference matching has been associated with lower perceived benefit from treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Also, it does not really reflect the clinical reality as patients, if they have a choice, rarely accept a form of arts therapy that does not strongly appeal to them.</p>
                <p id="Par44">We will test whether arts therapies provided in groups are effective for diagnostically heterogeneous patients in mental health services. Patients will choose which of the three forms of arts therapy they want to participate in, thus providing modality âpreference strataâ within which patients will be randomised to either their preferred form of arts therapy or an active group counselling control. They will be offered 40 sessions over a 5-month period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and after 6- and 12-month post-intervention follow-up periods. Overall, the study will provide pragmatic evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group arts therapies as they are most commonly provided within NHS community mental health services.</p>

Participants will be invited to meet individually with the therapists in the group space in the 2Â weeks prior to the group commencing to discuss any concerns regarding the groups or answer any questions they may have. Each session will last between 60â90Â min, comprising a 60-min focused treatment group with up to 15Â min either side to afford social activity between group members arriving and leaving. Participants will be actively encouraged to attend, but are free to choose not to. Should a participant miss a scheduled session, the therapists will contact the participant to ascertain the reason for missing the session, check on their wellbeing and refer onto the clinician responsible if concerns are raised. After the final therapy group, participants will be offered an individual end of therapy meeting with the therapists to enable signposting and referral onto further services if needed.</p>
                <p id="Par103">If too few patients choose one form of arts therapy to form a group at one of the sites, or if too many study participants show poor attendance or drop out completely during treatment, we will aim to refer additional patients from outside the trial so that a critical mass of 4 or more patients is maintained in each group. To ensure a critical mass of group membership for the trial duration, if group attendance falls below 4 for 2 sessions, therapists will inform the Trial Manager and work with local services to refer additional non-trial participants into the group. New referrals must meet the inclusion criteria as defined for this study; this will be confirmed through the completion of screening measures. Additional referrals into the group will be accepted until week 10 of the intervention, after which point, the group will be closed to new referrals. Patients joining the group for this purpose will be provided with an information sheet about the study and written informed consent will be obtained for the purposes of audio-visual recording.</p>

                <title>Sample size {14}</title>
                <p id="Par136">We have designed the trial to detect a treatment effect of 0.5 standard deviations on the primary health outcome, i.e. the level of psychological distress, as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory Global Severity Index. In a sample of 378 patients from a UK psychiatric outpatient population, the mean GSI was 1.65 with a standard deviation of 0.81 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. An effect of 0.5 standard deviations would therefore represent a difference of 0.4 on the GSI. We assume clustering of outcomes of patients treated in the same therapy group. In the NESS trial on group body psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the ICC for therapy groups of 10 patients varied for different outcomes, but did not exceed 0.01 (which applied to the primary outcome). We assumed, conservatively, an ICC of 0.1. We assume a drop-out rate of 15% by the end of the study, so that if we allocate 10 patients on average to each therapy group we will end up with clusters with 8.5 patients on average. Assuming a coefficient of variation of cluster size of 0.5, we will need 200 patients before drop-out in 20 clusters in each arm to achieve 90% power at the 5% significance level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Allowing, conservatively, for the additional loss of one full cluster in each arm, we plan to recruit a total of 2âÃâ210 patients.</p>
                <p id="Par137">The estimated loss takes into account drop-outs at each of the different phases of the study, i.e. between consent and beginning treatment, during treatment, during the 6-month follow-up period and during the 12-month follow-up period. Some patients will have to wait between giving consent and beginning of treatment. Within this period, they may drop out due to changing their mind, being offered alternative treatment or experiencing a reduction in symptoms. Based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we expect this drop-out rate to be less than 10% and we will be able to compensate for most of that loss through recruiting additional patients closely before the time of the baseline assessment.</p>
                <p id="Par138">During the treatment phase, we may have drop-outs from both groups. An intention-to-treat approach to analysis does not mean that all outcome data must have been collected, but it does mean that every effort should be made to minimise the amount of missing data. We expect a low drop-out rate from research during treatment but envisage a drop-out rate of 10% by the 6-month follow-up (in NESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] it was 7.3% after 6Â months), and 15% by the 12-month follow-up.</p>

                <p id="Par139">We plan to recruit from Secondary Mental Health care services including CMHTs, Recovery teams, and Secondary Care service user and carer involvement forums within the participating Trusts. To ensure adequate participant enrolment, we have begun by engaging with Senior Clinical leadership within each NHS Trust and then wider management teams to agree on the most effective strategies from which we will recruit. We have built in flexibility for different recruitment methods (letter, in-person and clinician approaches) alongside flexibility for research meetings to take place (on clinical sites, at participantsâ homes or remotely).</p>

In the second phase of recruitment, we plan to double the number of groups in London by including an additional site. For this, based on a participation rate of 25%, we plan to approach 240 patients at each London, with the aim of recruiting 10 patients per month over 6Â months.</p>

                <p id="Par141">Randomisation will be on a site-by-site basis (three sites in the first phase of recruitment, and four sites in the second stage) and will be further stratified at each site by preferred modality. To minimise the time between enrolment and commencing the intervention, we will aim to conduct randomisation as soon as a batch of 20 people with the same modality preference have been enrolled at a site and have completed baseline measures. Participants in each batch of 20 will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to two therapy groups, one receiving the preferred modality and one receiving group counselling (the control), using constrained randomisation to balance the distribution of primary diagnosis, age and gender in each therapy group. We implement constrained randomisation using the cvrand command in Stata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par142">If 15â19 participants with a preferred modality are still to be randomised at the end of the recruitment window, they will be randomised 1:1 to two therapy groups, with the possibility to add non-study participants to maintain numbers within the group. In the case where there are fewer than 15 participants with a preferred modality at the end of the recruitment window, they will be randomised (where feasible) in a 2:1 ratio to intervention and control, with the option of enlarging groups with non-study patients.</p>
                <p id="Par143">At the end of recruitment, there is a chance that the number of participants with a preferred modality is below that of the number required to feasibly run a group. Taking into account drop-out and non-attendance, we estimate that we require a minimum of 8 participants for a group to be viable. This equates to a minimum of 12 participants in a randomisation batch if randomising 2:1. In order to minimise the loss of already consented participants, we will ask participants to provide a second modality choice and also to indicate whether or not they would be willing to receive this in case numbers for their original preferred modality cannot be met.</p>
                <p id="Par144">Where the number in a preference stratum at the end of recruitment is fewer than 12, we will consider enriching this stratum with participants for whom the modality was their second choice, to give a sufficient number to be randomised as a batch. If a participant is unwilling to receive a second choice, we will withdraw them from the study and signpost them to local services.</p>

Performing a longitudinal analysis of all time-points using all non-missing data should allow for greater precision in the estimation of treatment effect at end of treatment than an analysis of this time-point alone. However, to allow results on the primary outcome to be reported in a timely fashion, we will also conduct and report an initial analysis of the first two time-pointsâbaseline and end of treatmentâas soon as these are available for all participants. The analysis will include random effects to allow for clustering within each therapy group and individual. The primary hypothesis of a beneficial effect of arts therapy will be investigated by testing for a fixed effect of intervention vs. control, adjusting for fixed effects of site, patientsâ preference for the form of arts therapy (art, music or dance), primary diagnosis, age, sex and baseline psychological distress.

Costs for each type of resource (or service) use will be calculated as a product of the quantity of resource (or service) use and its corresponding unit cost. Cost items will be summed together and presented at baseline and 12Â months after intervention for each patient. The primary health outcome measure in the economic evaluation is patientsâ self-reported outcomes on the EQ-5D-5L instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

We will also report the uncertainties around the point estimate. In addition to the primary analysis, a few sensitivity analyses will be conducted including to (1) undertake analysis using broader analytical perspective in the economic evaluation by including estimated costs from productivity lost; (2) run the primary analysis use intervention period alone or intervention period and 6-month period after intervention as the time horizon; (3) perform two scenario analyses using the ReQoL-20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and BSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] as the alternative health outcome measures; (4) consider uncertainty in the intervention costs; (5) explore the pattern of missing values in costs and outcome data and then identify an appropriate method to manage missing values; and (6) estimate ICER for each form of art therapy in order to assess its cost-effectiveness compared to group counselling.</p>

                <p id="Par238">Interviews will last up to 1Â h and will be conducted by an unblinded member of the research team. We will use an amended version of the Client Change Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which explores experiences of therapy, changes over a given time period and attributions for this. The amended version used in existing music therapy studies also explores participantsâ experiences of the research process and involvement in the study as a whole. This information will provide understanding not only of the interventions but of how best to involve this patient group in trials in the future. Following advice from our LEAP, we will also interview the arts therapists providing the intervention as a means of triangulating patientsâ experiences of change and relating identified changes to observations within the sessions. These interviews will also last for 1Â h and will happen within 6Â months of the therapy group ending.</p>
                <p id="Par239">Given the relatively large qualitative sample size due to nesting of participants within groups and diagnoses, we will initially analyse the material using the framework approach outlined by Ritchie et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] whereby after familiarisation with transcripts, a thematic framework is constructedâinformed by the theoretical model for this study and interview contentâand then use charting within thematic matrices to examine similarities and differences on core characteristics outlined above across and within themes. We will relate this to the hypothesised theory of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and highlight where our data supports of conflicts with this hypothesis.</p>

The TMG includes the CI, co-CI, a range of clinical co-applicants, the main researchers and patient representatives from the LEAP. The TMG will meet regularly (at least every 2â3Â months) to ensure all practical details of the trial are progressing and working well, and to ensure everyone within the trial understands them. More regular and individual meetings between the PIs, site leads and different parts of the research team will be arranged as appropriate. The TSC includes an independent chair, clinician, statistician and patient representative. The TSC will meet jointly with the DMEC at the beginning of the study and then immediately following the delivery of expected major milestones. Further meetings will be arranged as and when required. The LEAP will consist up to eight patient and carer members with experience in secondary mental health services or caring for someone accessing such services. They will meet at least twice per year to advise on study materials, progress and findings including website content and development, recruitment strategy, patient-facing information, issues during the running of the trial and contribution towards analysis and interpretations of findings, including suggestions as to how to present these to wider members of the public and develop lay summaries.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par257">This will be the first randomised controlled trial to account for patient preferences and diagnostic heterogeneity in group arts therapies. Overall, the study will provide evidence as to whether there is an additive benefit or not to the use of the arts in group therapy in community mental health care. As with many trials of group therapies, there are a number of logistical challenges to which we have had to further adapt, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
              <p id="Par258">Arts therapists are trained in a variety of methods and theoretical backgrounds. Our initial work to develop a shared manual for group arts therapy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] is now being implemented for the first time within this trial. Drawing upon learning from wider arts therapies and psychotherapy trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], we have been proactive in offering adherence feedback sessions to arts therapists in the aim of ensuring good treatment fidelity and building therapist confidence. End-of-therapy interviews with therapists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] will also assist us in learning from the group processes and experiences of implementing the manual within this trial.</p>
              <p id="Par259">We originally designed the study to randomise once a single large cohort of participants was recruited at each site. However, this incurred delays for participants and would have made provision of a large number of therapy groups all at once logistically challenging. To counter this we amended the protocol to enable baseline assessments to happen at the informed consent stage (thus removing an additional burden of assessment) and enabled randomisation immediately once an arts preference quota of 20 was filled. This enabled us to be more responsive and provide therapy more quickly to enrolled participants. However, this has also had limitations in that it has been a challenge to know exactly how much of an arts therapy resource may be required from services as this is based purely on the preference selections made by enrolled participants.</p>
              <p id="Par260">The COVID-19 pandemic hit the study in March 2020 and lockdown measures put in place by the UK government required us to cease all recruitment and group interventions for 16Â months. At this time-point, we had a number of participants who we had just randomised but had not yet informed of their group allocation or commenced treatment. During this time frame, study researchers stayed in regular contact with enrolled participants to prevent attrition and monitor for adverse events, surveyed enrolled participants for their views on accessing groups during the pandemic and collaborated with clinical service directors to draw up stringent infection control procedures for face to face groups. We put in place an amendment to allow for remote consent. For those enrolled and randomised at the point of study pause, therapy groups were delayed by more than a year after baseline. We therefore sought an amendment to re-assess eligibility, repeat baseline measures and re-randomise these participants. Recruitment was able to recommence in July 2021 and with the support of clinical services, has successfully resumed.</p>
              <p id="Par261">In spite of the above challenges, the study has continued to recruit successfully to date and is on track to meet its target of 420 enrolled patients.</p>
