              <p id="Par3">Several preclinical studies have described the structure and function of the typhoid toxin in vitro and in small-animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Systemic administration of typhoid toxin to C57BL/6 mice results in the reproduction of many characteristic symptoms of typhoid fever; other studies have suggested that typhoid toxin may contribute to the establishment of chronic infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. It remains unclear how the surrogate end points of illness in mice—such as lethargy, weight loss, behavioral and motor changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>—are representative of acute typhoid fever in humans. The toxin is also encoded by &gt;40 clade B non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (NTS) serovars that display a broad host range and a distinct clinical phenotype to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and Paratyphi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, although some typhoid toxin-expressing NTS serovars appear to cause an enteric fever-like syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Importantly, no previous studies have characterized the role of typhoid toxin in a human model of disease.</p>
              <p id="Par4">We aimed to characterize the role of typhoid toxin in human infection and pathogenesis using an <italic>S</italic>. Typhi human challenge model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. This model has previously been used to test novel live-attenuated (MO1ZH09) (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>) and Vi-conjugate (Typbar-TCV) typhoid vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We manufactured two challenge strains of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi to good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. We used the wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhi Quailes strain (genotype 3.0.1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>)) as the parent strain to generate an isogenic typhoid toxin-deficient knockout strain (TN), as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of the typhoid toxin pathogenicity islet in the TN strain (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). The wild-type and TN strains harbored no other differences in relation to known key virulence factors (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). In particular, there were no differences identified in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 7, a region encoding genes required for expression of the Vi-capsule—a key virulence factor in the pathogenesis of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi. Differences between strains were confined to highly variable regions encoding phage proteins, which were not known to impact on bacterial survival in the environment or persistence in the human host. However, deletion of the entire typhoid toxin pathogenicity island was associated with increased bacterial burden in a mouse model of <italic>S</italic>.

Two serious adverse events were reported, neither of which was assessed as being related to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi challenge (<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). The most common symptoms reported by participants who developed typhoid were headache (30 out of 30; 100%), malaise (30 out of 30; 100%), anorexia (26 out of 30; 87%) and abdominal pain (23 out of 30; 77%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>).

              <p id="Par8">We next assessed if absence of typhoid toxin was associated with altered microbiological end points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At least one stool culture was positive for <italic>S</italic>. Typhi in 13 out of 21 (62%) participants challenged with the wild-type strain and 11 out of 19 (58%) challenged with the TN strain.

There was no difference in the probability of shedding over the entire challenge period following challenge with TN compared with wild-type (odds ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.17–2.47, <italic>P</italic> = 0.51).

Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed no separation of challenge groups by cytokine profile during acute typhoid disease (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Following adjustment for multiple testing, linear modeling found no cytokines to be significantly different between groups, although interleukin 8 (IL-8) was marginally downregulated in the toxin-negative but not the wild-type group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par11">These data suggest that the typhoid toxin is not essential for <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection nor the early acute presentation of typhoid fever. This study represents the first application of a typhoid human challenge model to prospectively study the role of a specific virulence factor in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever.

Overall, in this study, the clinical presentation was indistinguishable between the TN and wild-type groups. Counterintuitively, there was a trend toward a more severe disease phenotype in the TN group, including a shorter time to diagnosis, higher number of cases meeting the criteria for severe enteric fever, elevated ASC response and prolonged duration of bacteremia. These observations suggest that the typhoid toxin may have an important role in modifying host immune responses to infection.</p>
              <p id="Par12">These data raise questions as to the utility of targeting typhoid toxin in the development of novel therapeutics or vaccine strategies.

              <p id="Par14">The absence of experiments showing reversion to virulence after complementation of the typhoid toxin genes in vitro is a limitation of this study. Additional studies with a strain expressing inactive components of typhoid toxin (for example, <italic>cdtB</italic><sup>H160Q</sup>, <italic>pltB</italic><sup>S35A</sup>, <italic>pltA</italic><sup>E133A</sup>) could address whether deletion of typhoid toxin genes is associated with an altered phenotype beyond loss of toxicity. Importantly, the study was underpowered to detect anything other than a large effect size (80% power to detect at 72% relative reduction). Additional in vitro studies and deeper analysis of challenge samples are ongoing to further characterize the potential immunobiological role of typhoid toxin in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever.</p>
              <p id="Par15">These data indicate that typhoid toxin is not essential for the development of early acute typhoid fever within the context of a controlled human infection model.

PBMCs at a concentration of 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> were added in duplicate to the ELISpot plate (100 μl per well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Plates were washed four times with PBS-0.25% Tween, once with PBS and soaked with PBS for 5 min. Goat anti-human IgG, IgA and IgM secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (catalog nos. 401442, 401132 and 401902, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) were diluted to 1:5,000 in PBS/FBS and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After incubation, the plates were washed five times with PBS-0.25% Tween and four times with dsH<sub>2</sub>O. Alkaline phosphatase substrate (catalog no. 170-6432; Bio-Rad) was added at 50 μl per well, allowed to develop over approximately 10 min and stopped with dsH<sub>2</sub>O as spots began to develop.</p>

Study- and antigen-specific count settings for spot intensity, size and gradient were applied to the plate counts and manually verified to remove artifacts. Raw counts (spots per 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> PBMCs) were averaged across duplicate wells and multiplied by four to give the number of spot-forming units (SFUs) per 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs.</p>

Samples were run in duplicate and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of duplicates was used for analysis. To minimize plate-to-plate variation, samples across time points for each individual were run on the same plates and each plate contained an equal mix of individuals allocated to wild-type or toxin-negative challenge. Control beads (CHEX 1–4) and control sera were used per plate.</p>

                <p id="Par47">The sample size was dictated primarily by the number of participants that could be feasibly enrolled within the time frame and budget of the study; therefore, it represents a convenience sample. Assuming typhoid toxin is central to the clinical presentation of acute typhoid fever, it was anticipated that the attack rate following challenge with the TN strain would be reduced compared with the wild-type strain, although the effect size was unknown. Assuming an attack rate of 65% following wild-type challenge (as observed in previous studies) and 50% attack rate following TN challenge, and accounting for a 10% dropout, 20 participants in each group had 95% CIs for attack rate of 41–85% in the wild-type group and 27–73% in the TN group. Twenty participants per arm provided 95% power to detect an absolute reduction in attack rate of 55% (65% with the wild-type strain versus 10% with the TN strain, corresponding to an 85% relative risk reduction) and 80% power to detect an absolute reduction in attack rate of 47% (65% with the <italic>S</italic>.
