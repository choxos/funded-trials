                <p id="P1">Precision medicine aims to treat an individual based on their clinical characteristics. A differential drug response, critical to using these features for therapy selection, has never been examined directly in type 2 diabetes. We tested two hypotheses: 1) individuals with BMI&gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, compared with BMI ≤30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, have greater glucose lowering with thiazolidinediones than DPP4-inhibitors, and 2) individuals with eGFR 60-90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> compared with eGFR &gt;90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> have greater glucose lowering with DPP4-inhibitors than SGLT2-inhibitors. The primary endpoint for both hypotheses was the achieved HbA1c difference between strata for the two drugs. 525 people with type 2 diabetes participated in a UK based randomised, double-blind, three-way crossover trial of 16 weeks treatment with each of sitagliptin 100mg/day, canagliflozin 100mg/day and pioglitazone 30mg/day added to metformin alone or metformin plus sulfonylurea. Overall, the achieved HbA1c was similar for the three drugs pioglitazone 59.6 mmol/mol, sitagliptin 60.0 mmol/mol, canagliflozin 60.6 mmol/mol (p=0.2). Participants with BMI&gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, compared with BMI≤30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, had a 2.88 mmol/mol (95% CI 0.98,4.79) lower HbA1c on pioglitazone than on sitagliptin (n=356, P=0.003). Participants with eGFR 60-90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, compared with eGFR &gt;90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, had a 2.90 mmol/mol (95% CI 1.19,4.61) lower HbA1c on sitagliptin than on canagliflozin (n=342, P=0.001). There were 2201 adverse events reported, and 447/525 (85%) randomised participants experienced an adverse event on at least one of the study drugs. In this precision medicine trial in type 2 diabetes, our findings support the use of simple routinely available clinical measures to identify the drug class most likely to deliver the greatest glycaemic reduction for a given patient.

              <p id="P2">Precision medicine aims to tailor treatment to an individual based on their clinical characteristics<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. The most successful examples of precision medicine to date have been in cancer and monogenic disease, where genetic sequencing has indicated molecularly distinct subtypes that could benefit from specific treatment strategies<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. This approach however is not suitable for common polygenic complex diseases, so other strategies are needed.</p>
              <p id="P3">Type 2 diabetes is an attractive candidate for a precision medicine approach as it is a heterogeneous disease with varying underlying pathophysiology, and there are many different options for glucose-lowering treatment available which have differing mechanisms of action<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Identifying clinical characteristics or biomarkers robustly associated with differential treatment responses could allow the targeting of specific glucose-lowering agents to those most likely to benefit.</p>
              <p id="P4">In the 2022 ADA/EASD international guidelines, the targeting of therapy based on a person’s clinical features is limited<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) or sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are recommended<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Patients with either heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are recommended to receive SGLT2i. However, these recommendations apply to only 15-20% of individuals<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. For most individuals with type 2 diabetes, current guidelines include a broad choice of potential therapies with differentiation between treatment classes based predominantly on costs and side effect profiles, rather than efficacy.</p>
              <p id="P5">Simple clinical features, such as a person’s sex, surrogate markers of insulin resistance such as BMI and triglycerides, or markers of renal function such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), can be used to stratify people with type 2 diabetes into subgroups showing differential responses to glucose lowering therapies<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Individuals with obesity have been shown to have a greater glycaemic reduction on thiazolidinediones (TZD), compared with individuals without obesity, whereas a higher BMI is associated with a smaller glycaemic reduction on DPP4-inhibitors (DPP4i)<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. For SGLT2i, which act through inhibiting the active reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, impaired renal function (lower eGFR) is associated with reduced glucose-lowering efficacy<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, with some DPP4i, impaired renal function is associated with increased glucose lowering efficacy, likely due to the drug pharmacokinetics where reduced renal clearance can lead to increased plasma DPP4i concentrations<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These associations to date have been observed in independent treatment groups in electronic healthcare records and in post-hoc analyses of individual participant data in parallel group randomised controlled trials<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P6">The precision medicine approach to using these data-derived strata needs to be tested in a clinical trial. To date, there have been no trials directly examining a precision medicine approach to prescribing in type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of any stratified approach for choosing between therapies will depend upon the extent to which differential responses can be predicted, and therefore the true test of a precision medicine approach would be to assess the within-person differential responses to therapy.</p>
              <p id="P7">We have carried out a three-drug, three-period, randomised crossover trial to assess two specific hypotheses (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in people with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin alone, or with metformin plus sulfonylurea: <list list-type="simple" id="L1"><list-item><label>1)</label><p id="P8">Individuals with a BMI &gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, compared with those with a BMI&lt;=30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, will have a greater glycaemic reduction with a TZD (pioglitazone), than with a DPP4i (sitagliptin).</p></list-item><list-item><label>2)</label><p id="P9">Individuals with an eGFR 60-90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, compared with those with eGFR&gt;90mls/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, will have a greater glycaemic reduction with a DPP4i (sitagliptin), than with an SGLT2i (canagliflozin).</p></list-item></list></p>

                <p id="P11">742 patients were screened for eligibility between 22 November 2016 and 24 January 2020. 210 did not meet eligibility criteria and 7 patients withdrew before being randomised. Overall, 525 participants were randomised to one of the six sequences of drug allocations (see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for participant characteristics). Of these, 20 withdrew prior to the baseline visit (4 health reasons, 10 changed mind, 2 ineligible, 1 moved out of area and 3 unable to contact) and two withdrew at the baseline visit due to difficulties taking blood, leaving 503 receiving their first study drug. Overall, there were 45 participants who subsequently withdrew (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) leading to 458 participants (87% of those randomised) who completed all 3 study periods. In total, there were 1417 instances of people taking drugs: 469 pioglitazone, 474 sitagliptin, 474 canagliflozin.</p>
                <p id="P12">For hypothesis 1, 356 participants (68%) had HbA1c results that could be included in primary analysis (i.e. took therapy for at least 12 weeks with &gt;80% adherence based on pill count). For hypothesis 2, 342 participants (65%) had HbA1c results that could be included in primary analysis. No participants were missing eGFR or BMI results.</p>
                <p id="P13">There was no evidence of any HbA1c carryover effect, but some evidence of a period effect with participants having a mean (95% CI) 1.38 (0.23, 2.54) mmol/mol lower HbA1c in period 2 compared with period 1. There was no difference in period 3 compared with period 1, suggesting this was not a sustained reduction over the year (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Period effect was adjusted for in subsequent analysis.</p>
                <p id="P14">Prior to stratification, there was no difference in achieved HbA1c between the three therapies pioglitazone 59.6mmol/mol (95% CI 58.5,60.7), sitagliptin 60.0mmol/mol (95% CI 59.0, 61.1), canagliflozin 60.6mmol/mol (95% CI 59.7, 61.6) mmol/mol (p=0.2) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Pioglitazone was associated with the lowest rates of discontinuation, sitagliptin was associated with the lowest mean number of side effects, and canagliflozin was associated with the lowest weight on therapy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The distribution of side effects on the three therapies is shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Figure 1</xref>.</p>

                <p id="P15">The five components of the estimand for both hypotheses are shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P16">For hypothesis 1 (BMI dependent differential glycaemic responses to pioglitazone and sitagliptin), 356 (68% of randomised participants) had valid HbA1c values for both pioglitazone and sitagliptin and so were eligible for hypothesis 1 primary analysis (BMI strata). Eligible participants were slightly older and had a slightly lower HbA1c at baseline, compared with those without valid HbA1c values, but were similar with respect to other characteristics (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Characteristics of patients in the two BMI strata are shown in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P17">Participants with BMI &lt;=30kg/m<sup>2</sup> participants had a lower mean 1.48 (95% CI 0.04, 2.91) mmol/mol achieved HbA1c on sitagliptin, compared with pioglitazone. Participants with BMI &gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup> had a lower mean 1.44 (0.19, 2.70) mmol/mol achieved HbA1c on pioglitazone, compared with sitagliptin (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Extended Data Table 2</xref>). This led to a 2.92 (0.99, 4.85) mmol/mol overall difference between BMI strata.

              <p id="P31">This randomised crossover study provides prospective trial evidence to directly support a stratified approach for therapy to manage glycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Our results demonstrate that for second- and third-line therapy in type 2 diabetes, simple predefined stratification using body mass index and renal function can determine the choice of the drug most likely to be effective for glucose-lowering.</p>
              <p id="P32">We have shown, among patients with type 2 diabetes on background metformin or combination metformin and sulfonylurea therapy, stratification based on BMI and eGFR is associated with differential glucose-lowering responses to canagliflozin, sitagliptin, and pioglitazone. For a population of people with type 2 diabetes, treating patients with the drug proposed best for their strata rather than the alternative drug could potentially lead to an overall mean improvement of ~3mmol/mol, in those who are able to tolerate the therapy. This stratification could be used to help select glucose-lowering therapies for individuals in clinical practice. For participants with a BMI&gt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a lower HbA1c was achieved on pioglitazone compared with sitagliptin, whereas for those with a BMI&lt;30kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a lower HbA1c was achieved with sitagliptin. For participants with impaired renal function (eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>), a lower HbA1c was achieved on sitagliptin compared with canagliflozin, whereas for those with normal renal function (eGFR&gt;90), a lower HbA1c was achieved on canagliflozin. These findings are concordant with our original study hypothesis. There was no evidence by strata in reported drug tolerability or overall rates of side effects.</p>
              <p id="P33">We found using different strata led to clinically meaningful differences (~3mmol/mol) in achieved HbA1c between glucose lowering therapies. This equates to approximately 3 years without requiring additional therapy, given the median deterioration in HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes is 1mmol/mol per year<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, without stratification, all three therapies were on average equivalent in achieved HbA1c. Although, these differences are of a smaller magnitude than the benefits seen with targeted therapy in monogenic diabetes (e.g. a ~30mmol/mol difference in response between metformin and gliclazide treatment for patients with HNF1A_MODY<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>), the overall improvement through stratification would likely have a pronounced effect at the population level as type 2 diabetes is far more common (90% of all diabetes for type 2 compared with &lt;0.5% for MODY)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. A lack of difference in tolerability or overall incidence of side effects between strata suggests that if choice of therapy were to be based solely on the optimal strata for glycaemic response this would not likely lead to any overall increase in these detrimental effects. However, consideration would need to be made regarding the weight gain associated with pioglitazone, which was greater in individuals with obesity and would need to be balanced against the greater HbA1c improvement. Further work is needed to determine the effect of this on other non-glycaemic effects such as blood pressure.</p>
              <p id="P34">These findings, based on binary, free-to-implement strata, establish the principle of stratification helping to target type 2 diabetes treatment to those most likely to benefit, and represent a step forward in the translation of type 2 diabetes precision medicine into clinical practice. However, ultimately a more sophisticated ‘precision’ approach using models that integrate multiple individual-level clinical features (eg BMI, HbA1c and eGFR) on a continuous scale will have greatest utility for clinical practice<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Using individual-level features will likely enable the identification of more ‘extreme’ patient phenotypes with large differences in HbA1c reduction than we demonstrated with binary strata based on clinically defined cut-offs. For example, when we look at the impact of BMI or renal function on a continuous scale rather than two dichotomous groups, it is clear that those with more extreme values have greater differential response to the treatment. Such models could potentially be optimised to incorporate more advanced biomarkers and genetics, and to evaluate additional outcomes beyond HbA1c<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P35">Our findings are consistent with previous research from trial subgroup and observational data which has suggested that higher BMI may be associated with increased glucose lowering to thiazolidinediones<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and modestly reduced glucose lowering to DPP4-inhibtors<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, and with research suggesting that lower eGFR is associated with reduced response to SGLT2-inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Pioglitazone acts through altering the transcription of genes influencing carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in adipocytes<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, which could lead to a greater glycaemic effect in those with higher BMI. For sitagliptin, which reduces degradation of incretin hormones, including GLP-1, thereby potentiating insulin secretion, the association of greater HbA1c reduction in those with a lower BMI is less clear. Potential mechanisms include the impact of high insulin resistance on the action of a drug which acts predominantly through potentiating insulin secretion, impaired GLP-1 secretion in obesity, or direct effects of lipotoxicity on GLP-1 receptor expression which have been demonstrated in animal models<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. For SGLT2i,the drug mechanism of action to lower glucose levels per se (as opposed to its other effects) is through inhibition of renal tubular glucose reabsorption, and a low eGFR might therefore be expected to lead to reduced filtration of glucose, and subsequently reduced glycosuria with SGLT2i therapy<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="P36">A key strength of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is that we have shown that these differences are observed in the crossover setting, allowing robust assessment of differential response to therapy within individuals and therefore direct assessment of stratified treatment that cannot be undertaken from existing trials with a parallel group design. The crossover design also requires a much smaller sample size compared with parallel group trials. There were a number of limitations to our RCT. The crossover design, although more powerful for assessing within-person differences, does require careful design to avoid period and carryover effects. We did see a period effect with a reduction in HbA1c in the second period, but in line with our statistical analysis plan we adjusted for this in our analysis, and this was not a sustained reduction over the year, which would indicate a more general decline in glycaemic control. We did not see a carryover effect for HbA1c, our primary outcome, but there was carryover with weight limiting the interpretability of the effect sizes for the associations seen with weight. In addition, the crossover design only enabled an assessment of short-term outcomes, meaning that we did not evaluate durability of HbA1c reduction, cardiovascular outcomes or development of diabetes complications. However, our previous work using parallel group trial data and observational data suggest that differences in response associated with strata are maintained over time, with early HbA1c response representative of long-term effects<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The majority of our study population were male (73%) and self-reported white ethnicity (94%), which limits conclusions about the relative benefits and risks of these therapies in females and in other ethnic groups. We assessed only specific glucose-lowering agents and findings cannot be assumed to reflect class effects of SGLT2-inhibitors, DPP4-inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. We chose a perprotocol analysis rather than intention-to-treat approach for our primary analysis as we could not obtain a valid HbA1c value when participants had not taken the therapy for at least 12 weeks, and imputation with baseline measures was deemed inappropriate due to the pre-study baseline not being representative for later study periods. This means the inferences from this study apply only to those who can tolerate the therapies of interest. There were some minor differences between individuals included and excluded from the BMI-defined strata (hypothesis 1), but there was no difference in tolerability between the study drug and/or strata combinations. In addition, tipping point analysis indicated that the missing data would have to show large differences in the opposite direction to change the statistical significance of our findings. Therefore, we are confident that our findings are not artefacts of our analytical approach and are reflective of the effects seen in those who are able to tolerate the respective therapies.</p>
              <p id="P37">It should be recognised that we have only studied patients treated with metformin (with or without a sulphonylurea) at baseline and that the glycaemia and tolerability related outcomes we have studied are not the only factors considered by clinicians and patients when choosing a glucose lowering therapy for a patient with type 2 diabetes. In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (or those at elevated risk), or chronic kidney disease or heart failure, SGLT2-inhibitors are the recommended drugs in international guidelines, and GLP1-RAs are recommended for those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. In addition, despite still being a low-cost treatment option proposed in guidelines, prescribing of thiazolidinediones is declining<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Any precision medicine approach based on short-term outcomes such as glycaemia will need to be embedded in existing treatment pathways based on the longer term cardiorenal risk benefits of specific therapies. In patients without specific cardiorenal indications (~80% of patients<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>) the 2022 ADA/EASD updated guidelines offer many treatment options, so considering likely glycaemic response (based on participant characteristics), alongside other factors considered in current practice (such as cost, and side effect profile) may offer a low cost approach to improving treatment response and patient outcomes.</p>
              <p id="P38">We have shown, in a randomised crossover study, that clinically relevant differences in glycaemic responses to therapy in type 2 diabetes can be seen when stratifying a patient population based on BMI and eGFR, leading to benefits in those who tolerate these therapies that would not be observed if considering overall glycaemic response to the three drugs in the population as a whole. This study represents a prospective demonstration of a potential stratified approach to type 2 diabetes treatment.</p>

There was no washout between therapies. The 16-week treatment period was designed to minimise any carryover (the effects of the previous treatment on the HbA1c in the subsequent period): all three drugs have half-lives between 7 and 14 hours, and HbA1c measurement reflects the previous 8 to 12 weeks of glycaemia. Therefore, the end of treatment period HbA1c represented the initial glycaemic response to the drug for that individual.</p>

                <title>Rationale for a per protocol approach</title>
                <p id="P63">Analysis was carried out using a per-protocol approach. For a participant to be included in primary analysis, it was necessary to have a valid HbA1c. For intention to treat analysis, in the absence of a valid HbA1c, some form of imputation of missing values would be required. This is more challenging in a crossover setting, as parallel group approaches such as imputing with the baseline are not valid as the pre-treatment baseline is only an appropriate baseline for the first period. However, we recognise the missing data could be informative. Therefore, to address this issue, we proposed two further analyses to explore the extent to which the missing HbA1cs could affect the final results: a tipping point analysis (see sensitivity analysis) and a secondary analysis of tolerability.</p>

                  <title>Carryover and period effects</title>
                  <p id="P64">Carryover and period effects were checked prior to main analysis. In line with the Statistical Analysis Plan, we examined first order carryover effects (i.e. carryover from the preceding period only) using mixed effects models with drug, period, and a carryover variable (i.e. drug in previous period) as fixed effects, participant as a random effect, and HbA1c as the outcome. The carryover variable used the same coding as the drug variable, or a 0 if in the first period (adjustment for period removes this part of the carryover term in analysis). We adjusted for period in primary analysis by adding as a fixed effect variable in the mixed effects models.</p>

Distribution of HbA1c difference was checked and confirmed to be normally distributed. For the main analysis, a mixed effects model was used for each hypothesis to allow adjustment for study period, with HbA1c as the outcome, participant as the random effect, and drug, period, stratum and drug*stratum interaction as fixed effects. The drug*stratum interaction represented the effect size of interest.</p>

By only examining new side effects, this did not allow us to show change in side effects from baseline. It was apparent that the proportion experiencing some side effects went down on treatments compared with baseline, whereas some went up. By allowing analysis of all we were able to demonstrate this. It also meant participants could record the same side effect on two different drugs, which would not be possible otherwise.

A strata specific analysis for each side effect would entail multiple testing without prior hypotheses and increased likelihood of type 1 errors, so this was deemed inappropriate.</p>

The mixed effects models for the primary analysis were extended by defining an exponential autocorrelation structure for the residual errors. This allowed for the pairwise correlation between HbA1c measurements to decrease systematically as the time gap increased and could account for irregularly spaced intervals.</p>
                  <p id="P81">Finally, we added in scatterplots to show the association on a continuous scale between each of BMI and eGFR against the difference in HbA1c for the two drugs of interest for each hypothesis.

This was adjusted due to the change in guidelines and prescribing trends leading to decline in use of sulfonylureas. At the time of study design sulfonylureas were the most commonly prescribed second line therapy in the UK. Subsequent decline in their use in favour of DPP4-inhibitors and SGLT2 inhibitors <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, resulted in the inclusion of patients currently treated with either metformin and sulfonylureas or metformin only. We will perform a sensitivity analysis to determine if the difference in study “epoch” (before/after this amendment) has any impact on the main study outcomes. Altered exclusion criteria also added ‘limb ischaemia’ due to updated safety information for Canagliflozin, and an upper limit of HbA1c &gt;110mmol/mol.</td>

Following advice from the Trial Steering Committee statistician, the protocol was amended to analyse only those completing at least 12 weeks on therapy, as this will determine whether the strata result in differences in response (we cannot adequately measure glycaemic response by HbA1c if the patient has been on the drug for less than 12 weeks). A separate analysis will be performed to determine whether the strata influence tolerability by assessing whether the proportion completing at least 12 weeks on therapy differs by drug and strata.</td>

                <p>Effect of stratification on treatment response. Point estimates represent the mean difference in HbA1c between the two therapies for a) hypothesis 1 - pioglitazone and sitagliptin, with stratification by obesity (n=141 BMI&lt;=30; n=215 BMI &gt;30), and b) hypothesis 2 – canagliflozin and sitagliptin, with stratification by renal function (eGFR) (n=163 eGFR 60-90; n=179 eGFR&gt;90). Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Overall difference between strata determined from drug*strata interaction in mixed effects analysis adjusting for period.</p>
