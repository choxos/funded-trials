                <p id="Par1">Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with increased risk of infection, but little is known regarding antibody levels against specific bacteria. We assessed levels of polyclonal immunoglobulin and antibacterial antibodies in patients recruited to the TEAMM trial, a randomised trial of antibiotic prophylaxis at the start of anti-myeloma treatment. Polyclonal IgG, IgA and IgM levels were below the reference range in 71%, 83% and 90% of 838 MM patients at diagnosis. Anti-vaccine targeted tetanus toxoid antibodies were protective in 95% of 193 healthy controls but only 41% of myeloma patients. In healthy controls, protective antibodies against 6/12 pneumococcal serotypes, haemophilus and meningococcus A were present in 67%, 41% and 56% compared to just 15%, 21% and 17% of myeloma patients. By 1 year, myeloma patients IgG levels had recovered for 57% of patients whilst the proportion with protective levels of IgG against thymus-dependent protein antigen tetanus toxoid had changed little. In contrast the proportions of patients with protective levels against thymus independent polysaccharide antigens pneumococcus, haemophilus and meningococcus had fallen from 15 to 7%, 21 to 0% and 17 to 11%. Findings highlight the need for strategies to protect patients against bacterial infections during therapy and vaccination programmes during remission.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Multiple myeloma (MM) arises from the malignant proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells in the bone marrow and accounts for over 10% of haematological malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. With the average age at diagnosis being 70 years MM causes anaemia, skeletal fractures, renal failure and profound cellular and humoral immunodeficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Advances in anti-myeloma therapy have improved overall survival (OS) to 50% at 5 years but infection contributes to death in a fifth of patients with myeloma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The risk of infection is greatest in the first 3 months after diagnosis, with a third of patients suffering serious bacterial infection, and infection contributing to half of early mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The most common causes of infection are encapsulated extracellular bacteria such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although novel agents and intensive therapeutic strategies have improved survival rates for myeloma, anti-myeloma therapy may further suppress patient’s immunological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Humoral immunodeficiency in MM is characterised by polyclonal IgM, IgG and IgA levels below the normal range in 85% of patients (immunoparesis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Lower levels of polyclonal IgG and IgA have been reported to be predictive of blood stream infections in the first few months from MM diagnosis and serious infection episodes during MM remission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, Danish registry analysis of 2557 MM patients during 6 months from diagnosis showed tumour burden and renal impairment but not immunoparesis were risk factors for infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p>

              <p id="Par5">Much is known about the significance of total levels of polyclonal immunoglobulins in MM with respect to survival but as we have found they are not strongly predictive of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, the significance of antibody levels specific to different bacterial antigenic targets at diagnosis and following modern MM therapies has yet to be characterised.

                <p id="Par8">The TEAMM trial recruited between August 2012 and April 2016, 977 patients aged ≥21 years with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma, and within 14 days of starting active myeloma treatment. Treatment allocation was blinded and balanced by centre, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and intention to give high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant. The 838 included in the present investigation out of 977 patients in the trial represent patients with sufficient serum sample available for analysis. Details of treatment, however, are limited to intended treatments at baseline as the trial did not record treatment delivered, with the exception of steroid usage. The trial (ISRCTN registration No. 51731976) had approval from the UK Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Multi-Research Ethics Committee and all patients provided written informed consent.

                <p id="Par9">Serum from diagnosis was analysed centrally at the Clinical Immunology Service (Birmingham, UK) by protein electrophoresis, densitometry and immunofixation for M-protein quantification and characterisation. Serum IgG, IgA and IgM, and kappa and lambda free light chains (sFLC) levels were quantified by turbidimetry. Patients were characterised as having one of the following multiple myelomas: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, light chain only (LCO), non-secretory (NS) or oligosecretory; with either kappa or lambda monoclonal light chain. Patients were classified as being below, within or above normal range (NR) for polyclonal immunoglobulins based upon 5th–95th centile ranges of adults aged over 45 years in the UK reported by Protein Reference Units: IgG 6–16 g/l; IgA 0.8–4 g/l; and IgM 0.5–2 g/l.</p>

The concentration of 19 anti-bacterial antibodies were quantified using a multiplexed Luminex assay, described in detail previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. IgG antibody levels were measured against 12 pneumococcal (Pn) serotypes, 4 meningococcal (Men) serotypes, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib) polysaccharide, and tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Protective thresholds for IgG were: 0.35 μg/ml for Pn serotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, 2 μg/ml for Men serotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, 1 μg/ml for Hib polysaccharide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and 0.1 IU/ml for diphtheria and tetanus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> capsular polysaccharides were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia, USA), Tetanus toxoid was obtained from Quadratech (Epsom, UK), <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and Hib capsular polysaccharides, and diphtheria toxoid were from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK). Briefly, polysaccharide antigens were pre-conjugated to poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and purified. Poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-conjugated antigens and toxoids were conjugated to carboxylated microspheres (Bio-plex Systems, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA), each corresponding to a different bead region, through a two-steps carbodiimide reaction. Beads were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 0.05% sodium azide, counted with a haemocytometer and stored in the dark at 4 °C. The analysis of serum samples for 19 antigens (19-plex) on multi-beads was performed in a 96-well filter plate. A 12 point standard curve was obtained following a 12-fold 1:2 dilution of standard serum 007 in PBS 1% BSA 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5 µg/ml pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide (Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark). Serum samples were diluted 1:100 using PBS 1% BSA 0.05% Tween containing 5 µg/ml pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide and 5 µg/ml pneumococcal serotype 22 F to prevent unspecific binding. Human serum, pooled serum and serum deprived of IgGs were used as controls. In all, 200 µl of PBS 0.05% Tween 20 were aspirated through the filter of each well to pre-wet the filter. Twenty-five microlitres of bead-conjugated antibody mix were added to each well and washed twice with PBS 0.05% Tween 20. Twenty-five microlitres of test samples were added to the plate and incubated at room temperature covered from light for 1 h on an orbital shaker at 500 rpm. After washing, 100 µl of mouse anti-human IgG phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, Alabama, USA) diluted 1:200 were added and left in incubation at room temperature covered from light for 30 min on an orbital shaker at 500 rpm. Wells were washed twice and beads were resuspended in 125 µl PBS 0.05% Tween 20 for the reading. Fluorescent intensity was measured with a Luminex-200 instrument (BioRad Laboratories) and data analysis was performed with Bio-plex Manager 6.1 software (BioRad Laboratories). Polyclonal IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified by turbidimetry. Antibody levels in patients with MM were compared to a cohort of 193 healthy adult blood transfusion service donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

Statistical significance of the results was determined using the Chi-Square test to identify differences in categorical variables between groups, Wilcoxon’s rank test to compared differences between paired data and the Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test to analyse differences between unpaired data. Correlations between biomarkers and outcomes measures were investigated using Spearman’s rank test. Infection rates and febrile episodes were investigated based on severity of polyclonal immunoglobulin suppression. Patients were split into groups based on normal, slightly reduced and severely reduced polyclonal immunoglobulins.

Cox regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of febrile episode or death. Patient and disease characteristics were considered, including polyclonal IgM, polysaccharide antigens, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Overall survival was calculated from date of starting trial treatment to the date of death or censor date for those alive up to 12 months.</p>
                <p id="Par13">In addition to TEAMM treatment allocation (Levofloxacin or placebo), prophylactic Septrin was evaluated as an independent predictor of febrile episode or death. Patients were ineligible for the TEAMM trial if receiving other prophylactic antibiotic treatment, excluding pneumocystis prophylaxis if regarded as essential. Prophylactic co-trimoxazole 960 mg (Septrin) three times per week to prevent pneumocysistis was allowed and given to 314 patients within the TEAMM trial due to its wide use in the UK but was not part of stratification or randomisation. Results of the TEAMM trial showed a benefit in reducing febrile episodes for patients taking septrin prophylaxis, a benefit for levofloxacin prophylaxis and the greatest benefit for patients who took both antibiotics as prophylaxis compared to the population receiving no antibiotic prophylaxis.</p>

Only 6% of myeloma patients had protective levels for 2/3rd of pneumococcal serotypes compared with 55% of healthy donors. Protective levels for half and a third of pneumococcal serotypes, respectively, were 15% and 33% in myeloma patients compared to 6%7 and 80% for healthy controls.

                <title>By 1 year IgG antibodies against protein antigens have changed little and against bacterial polysaccharide antigens have reduced to lower levels than seen at diagnosis</title>
                <p id="Par19">Anti-bacterial antibodies were measured in paired samples from diagnosis and at 1 year for 322 MM patients. The concentration of antibodies against the 19 bacterial antigens are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and comprise the two thymus-dependent protein antigens tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and the seventeen thymus independent polysaccharide antigens, haemophilus, 4 meningococcal serotypes and 12 pneumococcal serotypes. For the two protein antigens there was no significant difference in overall concentrations of IgG anti-toxoid antibodies between baseline and 1 year (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), although antibody median titres were significantly increased at 1 year compared to baseline for both toxins when patients were divided by treatment in TE and TNE (30% in TNE and 63% in TE for tetanus and 100% in TNE and 33% in TE for diphtheria (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>)). No significant differences were identified in the levels of anti-toxoid antibodies at baseline between TE and TNE (<italic>p</italic> = 0.17 for tetanus and <italic>p</italic> = 0.11 for diphtheria), while anti-tetanus levels were 44% higher at 1 year in TE patients compared to TNE (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). There was no difference in the proportions of patients protected at baseline and 1 year for tetanus (53 and 52%) or diphtheria (32 and 30%) toxins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In contrast levels of antibody against polysaccharide antigens fell by a year both as median titres (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and proportion of patients protected (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For haemophilus and meningococcal C, W and Y serotypes most patients had antibody levels 50–100 times lower than the protective threshold and there was little difference between diagnosis and a year. For meningococcal A and the pneumococcal serotypes there was a reduction in antibodies between diagnosis and a year. There were significant reductions in IgG titres between diagnosis and a year for pneumococcal serotypes 3, 4, 5, 6b, 7f, 9v, 14, 19a, 19f, and 23f (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The percentage of people protected against 4/12 serotypes reduced from 26 to 15 and for meningococcal A from 14 to 11%. No significant differences were found between levofloxacin treatment or placebo for antibody levels or percentage protected at 1 year.</p>

                <p id="Par20">No relationships were found between levels of protection against the 19 bacterial serotypes and the occurrence of deaths, febrile infections, non-febrile infections or total infections in the first 12 weeks from entry to the trial (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Cox regression analysis showed that use of prophylactic septrin was the single most important predicator of time to febrile episode or death within 12 weeks of starting trial treatment. Septrin retained significance in a multivariate model adjusting for baseline factors and antigens. A cox regression model excluding septrin identified ECOG performance status as the only factor with borderline significance (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Neither polyclonal IgM, nor the levels of specific antibody against the 17 polysaccharide and two protein bacterial targets were significant predicators of febrile episode or death (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par21">Polyclonal serum IgG, IgA and IgM levels were low at myeloma diagnosis as we and others have found previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This immunoparesis is present in 85% of patients and is severe. In our previous study we found immunoparesis, particularly of IgM, associated with adverse PFS and OS but not strongly associated with infection and this has been reported by other groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In the TEAMM study, infection was a major outcome in the first 12 weeks from diagnosis when infection is commonest and so this provided a good platform for more detailed investigation of the utility of polyclonal immunoglobulin levels for predicting risk of infection. Further, for the first time, we have been able to investigate, in a large number of MM patients, specific titres of antibody against a range of bacterial antigens (functional antibody) to predict infection and guide use of management strategies including prophylactic antibiotics. We show functional antibodies are even more severely compromised at disease presentation than total polyclonal antibody levels although the two are correlated.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Levels of functional antibody against the thymus-dependent antigen tetanus toxoid were the least impaired with 41% of patients protected vs. 95% of healthy controls. Following pneumococcal vaccination achievement of protective levels of antibody against two thirds of serotypes tested is considered a satisfactory antibody response. Most of the healthy donors would not have received a pneumococcal vaccination but by natural exposure to pneumococci 55% had protective antibody levels against 8/12 serotypes vs. just 6% of the myeloma patients.</p>
              <p id="Par23">The proportion of myeloma patients with protective antibody levels against tetanus toxoid was significantly lower in older myeloma patients as expected because of immunosenesence. Conversely, a higher proportion of older patients had protective levels against pneumococcal serotypes. This may reflect the UK 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination (PPV23) programme for individuals aged above 65<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Although these findings provide some support for the efficacy of the current vaccination programme in this age/patient population, significant differences were only found for 4 pneumococcal serotypes. Further, the majority of older patients still failed to meet protective levels and only 6.5% of older myeloma patients demonstrated protective levels for 8/12 or more serotypes. Previous studies have shown reduced levels of antibody production to PPV23 in MM patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Higher proportions of patients were found to experience infections and febrile episodes when polyclonal IgA and IgM were severely reduced but not IgG. However, cox regression analysis showed total polyclonal antibody levels nor titres of antibody against 19 different bacterial antigenic targets predicted infections and deaths in the first twelve weeks from diagnosis. This may reflect that stratification by immunoparesis at diagnosis is limited because the great majority of MM patients have severe immunoparesis whether assessed by total or specific functional antibody levels. Additionally, they have a broad and profound immunodeficiency encompassing reduced integrity of barriers to infection and major deficits in other components of adaptive immunity and of innate immunity. The greater importance of this much broader immunodeficiency causal to high infection rates is supported by lack of efficacy of IgG replacement therapy in newly diagnosed myeloma. In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 203 newly diagnosed myeloma patients infusions of placebo or 18 g human polyclonal IgG on days 1, 8, 22, 43, 64 and 85 from entry to the study did not alter the incidence or type of infections and did not alter hospital admissions or antibiotic use for infections (MacLennan ICM personal communication. A Trial of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Prophylaxis in Myelomatosis for the MRC Working Party on Leukaemia in adults. Presented to the 1993 UK annual review).</p>
              <p id="Par25">There is a gradation of severity of immunoparesis from Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) to Smouldering MM and through increasing severity of MM stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Accordingly as anti-myeloma therapy brings patients into remission one might expect a degree of recovery from immunoparesis particularly as current myeloma treatments induce complete responses in higher proportions of patients. Post high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplant about half of myeloma patients have recovery of normal levels of polyclonal immunoglobulins and these patients compared to those with sustained immunoparesis have improved PFS and OS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We have found the same in our TE patients and importantly also (we believe for first time) that TNE patients had a similar recovery of polyclonal immunoglobulin levels post induction treatment. This observation is limited in being made at the fixed time point of 1 year from entry to the trial and not all patients will have completed their TE or TNE treatments and reached remission. A further limitation is that the trial did not extend observations beyond a year and so we have not been able to assess recovery from immunoparesis as a prognostic factor for PFS or OS.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Despite substantial recovery of total polyclonal IgG levels at 1 year in both TE and TNE patients, median titres and percentage of patients with protective IgG levels did not increase for tetanus and diphtheria toxins. Further, levels of specific IgG against bacterial polysaccharides (12 pneumococcal serotypes, 4 meningococcal serotypes and haemophilus) had fallen from very low levels at diagnosis to levels, suggesting their immune systems had reverted to a naive state. For most patients and against most bacterial antigen targets levels of antibody were 50- to a 100-fold lower than protective levels.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The findings of this study show that functional antibody levels against certain pathogens worsens following treatment and does not mirror total immunoglobulin recovery. Presumably this reflects recovery of humoral immunity following myeloma therapy being skewed by the antigenic and cytokine environment at that time and would not favour recovery of humoral immunity to pathogens to which the individual was vaccinated against or exposed against much earlier in life.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In conclusion, these data demonstrate the need to protect patients against infections at diagnosis, during anti-myeloma therapy and importantly also during remission phases. Prophylactic antibiotics and patient education, should be considered during active disease/when patients are undergoing therapy. The TEAMM trial showed a clear benefit for levofloxacin in the first 12 weeks and further studies are needed to identify optimal prophylaxis (levofloxacin, septrin, or a combination of both) and the optimal duration for prophylaxis. Vaccination should be avoided while patients are on treatment but this study clearly demonstrates the need for vaccination following treatment: in remission despite substantial recovery of total polyclonal immunoglobulin levels patient’s humoral immune system has been rendered naive by the disease and its treatment meaning they lack protective antibody levels against most bacterial antigens.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Current data on vaccination in myeloma is limited and this study highlights the necessity to determine optimal vaccination timing and need for booster vaccinations following treatment. The European Myeloma Network currently recommendations using a broad spectrum of vaccinations to overcome severely reduced antibody titres associated with autologous and particularly allogenic transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, these guidelines largely reflect findings in the general/elderly population or are based on risk of disease. Consequently there is a need to design and conduct trials to investigate optimal timing and vaccination strategies in myeloma patients, specifically in relation to bacteria (such as pneumococcal, mennigocci) and also viruses (influenza) that pose a high risk to myeloma patients. The efficacy of vaccination schedules in remission should be considered and tested for all myeloma patients both in individual patients through measurement of antibody response to vaccination and in studies comparing different vaccination schedules.</p>
