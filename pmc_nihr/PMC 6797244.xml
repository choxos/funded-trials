                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Sarcopenia is a progressive muscle disorder characterised by decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength and function leading to adverse health outcomes, including falls, frailty, poor quality of life and death. It occurs more commonly in older people and can be accelerated by poor diet and low physical activity. Intervention studies incorporating higher dietary protein intakes or protein supplementation combined with resistance exercise (RE) have been shown to limit muscle function decline. However, less is known about the role of whole foods in reducing the risk of sarcopenia. Milk is a source of high-quality nutrients, which may be beneficial for skeletal muscle. This pilot study examines the feasibility and acceptability of milk consumption with RE to improve muscle function in community-dwelling older adults at risk of sarcopenia.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>30 older adults aged ≥65 years will be randomly allocated to three groups: ‘whole milk+RE’, ‘skimmed milk+RE’ or ‘control drink+RE’. Assessments will take place in participants’ homes, including screening (milk allergies, grip strength, walking speed), baseline and postintervention health and function. All participants will undertake a structured RE intervention twice a week for 6 weeks at a local gym, followed by the consumption of 500 mL of whole or skimmed milk (each ~20 g of protein) or an isocaloric control drink and another 500 mL at home. Participants’ views about the study will be assessed using standardised open-ended questions. The primary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability of the intervention with recruitment, retention and intervention response rates. Analyses will include descriptive statistics, exploration of qualitative themes and intervention fidelity.</p>

              <p>The UK population is ageing rapidly; the number of adults aged ≥65 increased by 17.3% in the last decade, and in mid-2017 was estimated to account for 18.2% of the total population of 66 million<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Understanding factors associated with healthy ageing<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> such as diet and physical activity<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> for optimising health and well-being of an ageing population is essential for the development of effective interventions.</p>
              <p>Sarcopenia is a progressive, generalised muscle disorder characterised by decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength and function,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which leads to an increased risk of falls, frailty, disability, low health-related quality of life (QoL) and death.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref> It occurs more commonly in older people and can be accelerated by poor diet and low physical activity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> The prevalence of sarcopenia increases with advancing age—and although dependent on the algorithm used to define sarcopenia<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>—it reaches &gt;20% in men and women aged ≥85 years,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> resulting in estimated healthcare costs in excess of £2.5 billion/year in the UK.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This emphasises the need for sustainable preventive measures aimed to preserve and optimise muscle health and function in a rapidly ageing population before the onset of difficulties leading to or exacerbating the risk of sarcopenia.</p>

                <title>Protein intake and exercise for healthy muscle ageing</title>
                <p>Loss of muscle mass and strength can be accelerated by poor diet, low levels of physical activity and the presence of long-term conditions,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9 13</xref> leading to diminished QoL.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 14</xref> Adequate intake of dietary protein and resistance exercise (RE) are recognised as effective interventions to promote skeletal muscle health and reduction of physical decline.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Specifically, intervention studies that examined a combined effect of protein supplements, comprising essential amino acids (EAA) and RE to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) have observed an increase in total muscle protein within 3–5 hours following exercise in both young and older adults.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Compared with young adults, older adults experience a blunted response after protein ingestion to stimulate MPS (anabolic resistance), especially in response to lower amounts of protein or EAA of &lt;20 or &lt;10 g, respectively. Other studies have shown that greater amounts of protein supplementation and intermittent feeding in combination with repeated bouts of RE resulted in increased muscle mass in older adults, even in those diagnosed with frailty and sarcopenia.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref>

                <p>However, there is limited research on the role of whole foods rich in protein (eg, milk and dairy products, fish and meats) in maintaining skeletal muscle mass, strength and function in older adults at risk of sarcopenia. Regular consumption of high-quality, nutrient-dense foods, high in macronutrients and micronutrients relevant for muscle<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> within a varied diet may provide a platform for developing strategies for maintenance of muscle health and function in later life that do not include supplements and medical products, and may be easier adopted as a behavioural change in older adults.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

                <title>Milk for muscle health: current evidence and why this pilot is needed</title>
                <p>Cow’s milk is an example of a whole food with the potential to ameliorate loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function. Whole milk (3.6% fat) is a source of high-quality proteins (whey and caseins), minerals (eg, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium), vitamins (eg, A, B, D and E), carbohydrates, bioactive lipids and fatty acids (monosaturated and polyunsaturated, and saturated fatty acids).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Whey protein is considered superior to other protein sources for MPS after exercise in younger and older adults because of its greater bioavailability and solubility, and higher content of the branched-chain amino acids, including leucine.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref> Furthermore, the concurrent intake of milk fats with protein in whole milk has been shown to increase the use of EAA for MPS after exercise in young men compared with skimmed milk (0.3% fat),<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> suggesting additional benefits of milk lipids for muscle. Other benefits of milk containing fat include reduction in exercise-related muscle damage, soreness and decline in muscle performance in young adults and athletes<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> compared with energy-matched (isocaloric) carbohydrate drink. However, little is known about the effect of milk and protein-fat ratio in milk on muscle in older adults, particularly the impact on muscle function of varying milk fat contents (whole vs skimmed) providing &gt;20 g protein/day after exercise.</p>
                <p>We hypothesised that whole milk (3.6% fat), providing &gt;20 g of protein and the same amount of energy as fat and protein-free carbohydrate drink, after structured exercise conducted in the community may be a feasible and acceptable intervention for maintaining skeletal muscle mass, strength and function in older adults at risk of sarcopenia.</p>

At the prescreening stage, practices will identify potential participants from their patient database using exclusion/inclusion criteria (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, left column), and then mail out recruitment packs, containing detailed information about the study with a reply slip. Interested individuals will be interviewed over the telephone by a researcher using a 5-item SARC-F questionnaire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 1</xref>)<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> to assess any difficulties with day-to-day activities (lifting and carrying 10 pounds, walking, rising from a chair and climbing stairs), and number of falls in the past year. Those evaluated by the research team to have no major difficulties that would preclude safe participation in the exercise programme (eg, unable to walk across a room), will be visited in their own home for a screening interview to obtain written informed consent, and to evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria not screened through GPs (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, right column).</p>

GS measurements (high or low) at the screening interview will be used for minimisation along with sex to allow equal distribution of those with muscle strength weakness across the intervention groups.

Capacity to consent will be assessed using an established consent pathway.

Except for the intervention (six consecutive weeks), this time scale can be adjusted to participants’ individual needs with a maximum 3 weeks gap between baseline assessment and the first week of intervention, and a maximum 3 weeks gap between the last week of intervention and postintervention assessment.</p>

                  <title>Resistance exercise</title>
                  <p>All participants will perform two RE sessions per week for 6 weeks at a community leisure centre (The Parks, North Tyneside Council, North Shields, UK) that is easily accessible and close to their residence. For each RE session a time slot of ~45–60 min in duration will be allocated, with a minimum of 48 hours between sessions. The sessions will be completed in groups of two to four participants under the supervision of an experienced exercise physiologist (CH). Exercise intensity, volume, frequency and duration have been determined based on recent literature<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref> and the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations for older adults.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> With the exception of the structured exercise sessions and the nutritional intervention prescribed, participants will be asked to maintain their usual diet, level of physical activity and lifestyle throughout the duration of the intervention period.</p>
                  <p>During the first RE session, participants will be familiarised with the exercises (leg press, leg curl, seated row, chest press) as well as the equipment to be used throughout the intervention with correct technique demonstrated and extensively described. Following this, participants’ one repetition maximum (1RM) will be estimated for all four exercises using a previously established equation.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
</p>
                  <p>Following the initial RE session, each remaining session will begin with a 5 min warm-up performed at progressive intensity using either a cycle ergometer or treadmill. Participants will then complete 2–4 sets of 8–12 repetitions at a workload of 70%–79% 1RM<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38 39</xref> for all four of the exercises listed above. Each session will conclude with a short cool-down period of low-ntensity aerobic exercise, and (except the initial session) may be completed within 30 min.</p>
                  <p>In an attempt to promote participants’ engagement with RE, each will receive a training log with diagrams and short instructions with space to record the details of the exercise completed. Participants’ gym attendance, sets and repetitions completed and weight lifted will be recorded following each RE session allowing for the calculation of measures of training load (eg, volume load (number of sets×number of repetitions×weight lifted)). In addition to measures of external training load, resistance training intensity will be monitored using participant ratings of perceived exertion. Using the CR100 scale<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 2</xref>), participants will provide an overall session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) as well as differential ratings of perceived exertion for upper-body muscle exertion (RPE-U) and lower-body muscle exertion (RPE-L) approximately 10 min after the completion of each RE session.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Each participant must complete at least 10 sessions (out of 12) to be considered compliant with the exercise programme.</p>
                  <p>Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured pre and post each RE session in each participant and compared with the guidelines provided by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and existing literature.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45 46</xref> Muscle soreness will be assessed using a simple visual analogue scale (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary appendix 3</xref>) at ~40–45 min and at ~6–7 hours after each RE session.</p>

Arla Cravendale skimmed milk contains 0.3 g fat, 3.6 g protein and 4.9 g of carbohydrate per 100 g of milk. The energy content of the control drink (cranberry juice; Ocean Spray Classic 23/kcal/100 g of energy) will be balanced to match whole milk energy content and supplemented with maltodextrin (4 kcal/g; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.myprotein.com">www.myprotein.com</ext-link>) on the day of intervention. Both milk and juice will be provided in packs of 1 L, bought fresh on a weekly basis through a local retailer and kept in a locked refrigerator at the Campus for Ageing and Vitality, Newcastle University.</p>
                  <p>The milk/control drink will be consumed as a bolus intake of 500 mL under the supervision of a researcher immediately after exercise during the recovery period, aiming for complete consumption within ~45 min prior to leaving the centre. The second dose of 500 mL will be consumed at the participants’ home over the next 4–5 hours as a part of their usual diet with other foods. Participants’ compliance with consumption of the milk/control drink will be checked in the evening (~6–7 hours postexercise). Each participant will be provided with a plastic measuring jug (500 mL) to measure their consumption at home and to report it back to a researcher over the telephone.</p>

Additionally, participants’ feedback will be collected at the end of the postintervention interview using a combination of structured multiple-response and standardised open-ended questions. The following themes will be explored: (1) attitudes and barriers to consuming of 2×500 mL milk/control drink intake postexercise (eg, volume of liquid, taste, etc); (2) opinion about milk as a functional food for muscle strength/function; (3) changes in appetite and habitual diet because of milk/control drink intake, and (4) what was liked and disliked about the study (intervention), including motivations and barriers to continue engagement in a local gym. The postintervention interview will be completed within 50 min.</p>

Using descriptive statistics (percentages, means (SDs)), we will calculate the response rates, the numbers consented and randomised, the retention rate and the number, length and frequency of interviews and RE sessions. Compliance with the milk and control drink intervention will be calculated as a percentage of actual consumption divided by expected consumption over the 6-week intervention. Recording the number of repetitions for each exercise within each RE session and the weight lifted will allow calculation of several indices of training intensity.

                <p>A consumer panel was organised through the NIHR Research Design Service North East and North Cumbria, UK during the funding application phase of the study in September 2017 to obtain a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in the study. We incorporated several panel's suggestions in the study design, including a clear identification of 'community-dwelling' older adults, and the intake of the second dose of milk/control drink within regular diet at home. The following key outputs will contribute to study dissemination and impact. The results of the study will be reported to the funder (NIHR Newcastle Biomedical Research Centre). The funder, sponsor and industry support (Arla) will have no role in the study design, conduct, data analysis, results interpretation or writing. The aim is that at least two peer-reviewed papers will be published in high-impact open-access journals, and the results will be presented at relevant scientific conferences. A lay summary of the main results will be presented to interested participants at a PPI event. A flyer featuring the main results of the study and, if desired, an individual report titled ‘My muscle function and strength before and after MIlkMAN’ will be prepared for all study participants. Reports with abnormal results (blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, Mini Mental State Examination and Geriatric Depression Scale) will be sent to general practices. Regular updates on the study progress will be reported on a publicly accessible website.</p>

                <title>Strengths and limitations</title>
                <p>To our knowledge, this is the first pilot study examining the fidelity of a whole food (milk) combined with RE intervention in community-dwelling older adults living in the UK. The primary aims of the MIlkMAN pilot are to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in the community, and to provide essential data for planned future substantive research. The secondary aims are exploratory because the pilot lacks power to identify differences in physical functioning between the groups. However, the exploratory findings will be helpful in informing power calculations for the definitive study. The intervention will be conducted under the close supervision of a trained research team including an exercise physiologist and a health psychologist in a local gym with an easy access to older adults. Participants naïve to gym environment will benefit from the familiarisation with RE programme to encourage self-guided continued engagement in the community. A postintervention interview in the pilot will include the collection of qualitative evidence on the barriers and motivators of community-based interventions. To our knowledge, only one study has investigated the barriers and drivers of compliance with protein-rich diets with RE interventions,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and none has included views of older adults about what motivates their willingness and keenness to continue.</p>
                <p>This study has several limitations, which will inform the development of the subsequent trial. Physical activity and exercise are consistently reported as positive influences on muscle mass and function in healthy older adults,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 50</xref> while the evidence for positive effects of protein-rich foods above the effect of RE on muscle in older adults with adequate nutrition and activity levels has been more mixed.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref> There may be more benefit for protein supplementation with RE in those with muscle weakness and physical frailty.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As the MIlkMAN pilot will enrol 30 participants with relatively healthy muscle, the effect of the intervention is likely to be minimal. To achieve clinically meaningful differences between the groups and to examine the effect of milk above the effect of RE, a larger sample size, longer duration of the intervention and the inclusion of older adults with reduced physical functioning or probable sarcopenia<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> will be necessary. Previous studies have reported difficulties in recruiting older adults with (probable) sarcopenia for various reasons, including the multifaceted nature of muscle health, the variety of muscle-related clinical outcomes relevant to sarcopenia and the lack of routine diagnosis of sarcopenia in clinical practice.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> However, the universal acceptance of a sarcopenia definition<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 10</xref> and cut-offs for sarcopenia components,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 10</xref> the availability of sarcopenia screening tools<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> for a rapid assessment of sarcopenia and wider use of GP surgeries (that routinely derive an electronic Frailty Index from data held in healthcare records<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) for recruitment will increase the potential for enrolling appropriate participants to the larger trial. To reduce the risk of muscle injury, diabetes and exacerbation of any other health risks not covered by the exclusion criteria, this pilot will not recruit older adults with BMI&gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, in the light of continued debate about the relationship between overweight/obesity and adverse health outcomes,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and to maximise the recruitment, the substantive study will consider those with a BMI&lt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                <p>We hypothesise that the ratio of protein to fat in whole milk in combination with RE may be beneficial to ageing muscle and superior to skimmed milk for MPS, physical performance and muscle soreness after exercise as observed in younger adults.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref> To test this hypothesis and accurately quantify the differences across the groups in the future study, a validated chromatographic analysis of amino acid<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> and fat content<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> in Arla Cravendale milk will be necessary through the scientific support of Arla.</p>
                <p>The present study will use BIA to assess body composition in participants preintervention and postintervention. Although BIA has been used widely to estimate lean body mass in community-dwelling older adults via validated prediction formulas,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> there are several limitations to the method, including low sensitivity to detect changes in muscle mass and the effect of hydration/dehydration on the analysis.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Ultrasound has been proposed as another non-invasive, safe and easy-to-use method suitable for longitudinal monitoring of muscle mass<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> with higher sensitivity compared with BIA. While it requires technical skills,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> this method may be an appropriate strategy to minimise the limitations associated with BIA to detect changes in muscle mass. In addition, muscle measurements assessed by ultrasound can be compared with anthropometric measures used to estimate RE-induced changes in muscle cross-sectional area, such as thigh circumference and a skinfold thickness,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> while keeping in mind the limitations of the method in older and obese adults.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>

                <p>To minimise participant burden, the present study will use GS as a measure of overall muscle strength and for minimisation to allow equal distribution of participants with low GS across the groups. However, a future definitive trial will include repeat assessment of 1RM via submaximal testing at baseline and postintervention,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> to provide a more reliable and internally valid assessment of muscle strength. Repeat assessment of 1RM for all exercises prescribed in the RE programme will enable a more specific evaluation of muscle strength changes following the intervention period.</p>
                <p>In summary, this is the first pilot study examining the feasibility and acceptability of whole compared with skimmed milk in combination with RE conducted in a local gym in community-dwelling older adults in the UK. Qualitative data will be collected to inform the future substantive trial, and allow better understanding of the barriers and facilitators of community-based intervention. This pilot study has low statistical power to detect changes in physical functioning between the groups, however, the results will be used to aid the development and refinement of a future clinical trial, including study design, power calculations, recruitment strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria and outcome measures.</p>
