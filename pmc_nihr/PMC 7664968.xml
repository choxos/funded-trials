                <title>Background:</title>
                <p>To examine the association between the degree of risk factor control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in type 2 diabetes and to assess if the presence of cardio-renal disease modifies these relationships.</p>
                <sec>
                  <title>Methods:</title>
                  <p>A retrospective cohort study using data from English practices from CPRD GOLD (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and the SCI-Diabetes dataset (Scottish Care Information-Diabetes), with linkage to hospital and mortality data. We identified 101 749 with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in CPRD matched with 378 938 controls without diabetes and 330 892 with type 2 diabetes in SCI-Diabetes between 2006 and 2015. The main exposure was number of optimized risk factors: nonsmoker, total cholesterol ≤4 mmol/L, triglycerides ≤1.7 mmol/L, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤53 mmol/mol (≤7.0%), systolic blood pressure &lt;140mm Hg, or &lt;130 mm Hg if high risk. Cox models were used to assess cardiovascular risk associated with levels of risk factor control.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Results:</title>
                  <p>In CPRD, the mean baseline age in T2D was 63 years and 28% had cardio-renal disease (SCI-Diabetes: 62 years; 35% cardio-renal disease). Over 3 years follow-up (SCI-Diabetes: 6 years), CVD events occurred among 27 900 (27%) CPRD-T2D, 101 362 (31%) SCI-Diabetes-T2D, and 75 520 (19%) CPRD-controls. In CPRD, compared with controls, T2D participants with optimal risk factor control (all risk factors controlled) had a higher risk of CVD events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–1.29). In T2D participants from CPRD and SCI-Diabetes, pooled hazard ratios for CVD associated with 5 risk factors being elevated versus optimal risk factor control were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.17) in people with cardio-renal disease but 1.96 (95% confidence interval, 1.82–2.12) in people without cardio-renal disease. People without cardio-renal disease were younger and more likely to have suboptimal risk factor control but had fewer prescriptions for risk factor modifying medications than those with cardio-renal disease.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions:</title>
                  <p>Optimally managed people with T2D have a 21% higher CVD risk when compared with controls. People with T2D without cardio-renal disease would be predicted to benefit greatly from CVD risk factor intervention.</p>

            <p>Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common condition that increases the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD).<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The Steno-2 trial suggested that in people with T2D, multiple CVD risk factor intervention might halve the risk of CVD events and mortality and may provide up to 8 years longer life expectancy<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>.</p>
            <p>In observational data of people with T2D and coronary disease, we showed that individuals with suboptimal risk factor control had a 2-fold higher risk for mortality and CVD events when compared with those with optimal risk factor control.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A Swedish population-based study recently showed similar findings.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In addition, it showed: 1) that people with T2D who had optimal risk factor control had little or no excess risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke when compared with the general population; and 2) that relationships between the degree of risk factor control and CVD events were stronger in younger people than older people, possibly due to differing baseline CVD risks and risk factor management.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p>
            <p>Currently, we don’t know whether people in the United Kingdom with T2D who have optimal risk factor control have similar risks of CVD and mortality to people without diabetes, and whether baseline CVD risk modifies the relationship between the degree of risk factor control and CVD risk. This is important because quantifying these risks in individuals considered to be at low-risk or high-risk for CVD could guide appropriate interventions on CVD risk factors. Therefore, in people with T2D, stratified by baseline CVD risk, defined by the presence of cardio-renal disease, we studied associations between the number of abnormal CVD risk factors at baseline with subsequent mortality and CVD events, and we compared CVD risk in optimally controlled people with T2D and controls without diabetes.</p>

                <p>In CPRD, we used Cox regression to examine risks for primary and secondary outcomes in relation to the number of risk factors above threshold values among people with T2D compared with matched controls. In CPRD and SCI-Diabetes T2D cohorts, Cox regression examined risks for CVD outcome associated with the number of risk factors above threshold values compared with people with optimal risk factor control (ie, no risk factors above threshold values). Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, diabetes duration, and history of CVD. To account for matched cohort design, the Cox regression was stratified by matched sets. History of CVD was not included in the analyses stratified by cardio-renal disease. Risk estimates from the 2 cohorts were pooled by DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analysis.

                <p>In people with T2D and cardio-renal disease, the pooled association between the number of risk factors above target and risk of CVD events was weak (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). There was no significant risk increase when 1 to 3 risk factors were above thresholds; however, when 4 and 5 risk factors were elevated, the respective risks were 7% (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03–1.11) and 9% (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01–1.17) higher than optimally controlled people. In contrast, in people with T2D and no cardio-renal disease, CVD risk increased stepwise for each additional risk factor above target, with a near 2-fold (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.82–2.12) higher risk for those with 5 elevated risk factors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). A similar pattern was observed for CVD mortality with stronger associations with risk factor control in those without cardio-renal disease (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). In people with T2D and cardio-renal disease, CVD mortality risk was modestly higher than in optimally controlled patients when 4 (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22–1.39) or 5 (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.28–1.80) risk factors were above targets. However, in contrast, those without cardio-renal disease with 1 risk factor above target had a 16% (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29) higher CVD mortality risk compared with optimally controlled people. Each additional risk factor above target was associated with increasingly higher risks, with more than twice the risk observed in those with 5 risk factors above target (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.85–2.79). A similar pattern was observed for the risks for individual nonfatal and fatal events (CHD, stroke, and heart failure hospitalization) associated with different levels of risk factor control in patients with and without cardio-renal disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046783">Figure IIIA in the Data Supplement</ext-link> [CVD events] and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.046783">Figure IIIB in the Data Supplement</ext-link> [CVD mortality]).</p>

                <p>Our key findings with important clinical implications are: 1) compared with people without diabetes, those with T2D and optimally managed risk factors have a 21% higher risk for all CVD events and nonfatal CHD and a 31% higher risk for heart failure hospitalization; 2) only 6% of people with T2D had optimal risk factor control; and 3) the association between the number of elevated risk factors and CVD events/mortality was much stronger in people with T2D without cardio-renal disease when compared with T2D and established cardio-renal disease.</p>

                <title>Prior Studies</title>
                <p>The landmark Steno-2 trial showed that intensive CVD risk factor intervention could halve risk for both CVD events and mortality in subjects with T2D and microalbuminuria.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In an extended follow-up of the cohort, life expectancy was 8 years longer with intensive risk factor control.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> These impressive results show how simultaneous intervention on multiple risk factors might have major benefits in people with T2D. However, the optimal strategy for multifactorial intervention in T2D has not been established based on other multifactorial intervention trials,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and meta-analyses,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> that have provided inconsistent results. It is useful to highlight that these trials were performed before SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) were in common clinical use. Since these agents improve CVD risk factors,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> and reduce CVD risk, intensive intervention using these agents may deliver even more impressive CVD benefits than the Steno-2 trial might suggest.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Our observational data suggest that in people with T2D there is a clinically significant residual CVD risk even when all causal risk factors are optimally managed, at least to levels mandated in the United Kingdom by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>; 21% to 31% higher risk for CVD events and heart failure hospitalization compared with people without diabetes. These findings are in contrast to the results from a large T2D Swedish study in which optimal risk factor control was not linked to higher risks when compared with the general population.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Potential explanations for these discrepant results include: 1) differences in the risk factors studied, specifically regarding albuminuria and cholesterol; 2) differences in the health of participants without diabetes; and 3) differences in diabetes management including lifestyle interventions and type of diabetes medications.</p>
                <p>As far as we are aware, no diabetes study has previously shown that the associations between risk factor levels and CVD outcomes were stronger in low-risk people without cardio-renal disease compared with high-risk individuals with cardio-renal disease. These findings have important clinical implications. Individuals with T2D and absence of cardio-renal disease were younger than T2D individuals with cardio-renal disease (mean age: 59 versus 71 years) and had higher CVD risk factors levels. The risk difference between the least and best-controlled low-risk individuals was ≈2-fold higher for both CVD events and for CVD mortality (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting the importance of optimal medical therapy in these people. This follows a similar pattern observed in data presented by Rawshani et al in which risks for death and cardiovascular outcomes increased dramatically in younger than in older people.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These more pronounced risks in younger individuals without cardio-renal disease may be due to the age at which T2D was diagnosed. Younger-onset T2D poses greater excess CVD morbidity and mortality risk than later-onset T2D, highlighting the need for, and the potential gains from, more aggressive intervention.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p>
                <p>We can only speculate on the reasons why associations between risk factor levels and CVD outcomes were stronger in people without cardio-renal disease. Although differences in drug regimens and drug interactions may play a role, it seems plausible that different metabolic pathways could underlie the development and progression of intimal plaque atheroma seen in people without cardio-renal disease compared with the medial arterial calcification commonly seen in those with cardio-renal disease. Our data, and the disappointing results of clinical trials of CVD risk factor intervention in dialysis populations, support the idea that risk factor intervention needs to be initiated early, before CVD or stage 3b chronic kidney disease develops, in order to maximize the benefits of risk reduction by these means.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p>
                <p>We showed that in individuals with cardio-renal disease, risk factor levels appeared to contribute little to the relative risk for the combined fatal and nonfatal CVD event end point (9% relative risk between optimally-controlled and poorly controlled participants) but were strongly related to risk for fatal CVD (52% relative risk). Therefore, benefits from risk factor intervention in this group may be dominated by a reduction in risk for fatal CVD rather than nonfatal CVD.</p>
              </sec>
              <sec>
                <title>Clinical Implications</title>
                <p>While the benefits of optimal risk factor control have been demonstrated (risk differences between the best- and least-controlled individuals with T2D was 40% for CVD events and 73% for CVD mortality) we observed that only 6% of people with T2D had optimal risk factor control. The issue of inadequate risk factor management in T2D is an international problem.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p>
                <p>Our data supports early and more intensive intervention in people with T2D who are perceived to be at lower risk (without established cardio-renal disease), whom on average, have higher body mass index, total cholesterol, HbA1c, and blood pressure levels than individuals with established cardio-renal disease. Such intervention could yield substantial long-term reductions in CVD events and mortality at the population level. In keeping with the results of the National Diabetes Audit,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> our data showed that a smaller proportion of patients without cardio-renal disease were receiving antihypertensive therapy and statins compared with people with cardio-renal disease (48% versus 80% and 37% versus 70%, respectively). We support calls for greater use of early guideline-driven care, wider use of newer agents including SGLT2i and GLP-1RA that lower cardio-renal risks beyond effects on HbA1c, pharmacist-led clinics,<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> IT systems supporting self-management,<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and clinical decision support for clinical staff.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p>
                <p>While we emphasise the potential benefits of risk factor reduction in individuals without cardio-renal disease (considered to be low-risk), we would not want to minimize the potential importance of risk factor control in patients with cardio-renal disease (considered to be high-risk) for several reasons: 1) our data do not inform us about the potential benefits of treatment already given to individuals considered to be at high-risk (eg, ≈3 quarters were receiving antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy); 2) although our data predict modest further reductions in the relative risk for total CVD in people with cardio-renal disease through further risk factor intervention, the number needed to treat to prevent an event may be small due to high absolute risk for events; and 3) risk factors studied appeared to contribute significantly to the relative risk for fatal CVD events (52% relative risk between optimally controlled and poorly controlled participants).</p>

              <sec>
                <title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
                <p>Our study strengths include: 1) combining linked data from 2 large T2D cohorts from England and Scotland; 2) having a control group without diabetes; 3) stratifying outcomes by baseline CVD risk, defined by prevalent cardio-renal disease; and 4) presenting results which are general to the UK population. We acknowledge these limitations: omission of albuminuria as a risk factor due to lack of data, and in CPRD, prevalent T2D cases were required to have a diabetes diagnostic code documented by the General Practice within the study window period (2006–2013). Since such coding may occur sometimes after hospitalization, these cases may have higher CVD risk than prevalent cases not satisfying this selection criterion. However, this limitation is unlikely to have substantially affected our results as the proportion of prevalent T2D in CPRD was 28%, and as shown, relationships between risk factor levels and CVD risk were similar between our CPRD and SCI-Diabetes cohorts, with the latter capturing the entire population in Scotland.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Compared with people without diabetes, those with T2D have higher risks for CVD events, CVD mortality, and heart failure hospitalization even when all causal risk factors are optimally controlled to levels mandated in current clinical guidelines. We found that the association between risk factor levels and CVD outcomes was much stronger in people with T2D without cardio-renal disease when compared with those with cardio-renal disease at cohort entry. Since overall risk factor management was poor, we encourage greater use of guideline-driven care, newer agents including SGLT2i and GLP-1RA, pharmacist-led clinics, IT systems supporting self-management, and clinical decision to support for clinical staff.</p>
