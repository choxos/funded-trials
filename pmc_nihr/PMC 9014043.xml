                  <title>Outcome measures</title>
                  <p>This economic analysis focused on quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-Y, symptoms assessed by the Canadian Acute Respiratory Infection and Flu Scale (CARIFS), healthcare use and costs including medication, hospital visits and admissions, general practitioner and nurse contacts. Outcomes were assessed for up to 28 days post randomisation.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Information on resource use, EQ-5D-Y (day 28) and CARIFS (day 7) was available for 265 (98%), 72 (27%) and 123 (45%) out of 271 participants, respectively. Average costs in the co-amoxiclav group were £25 lower (95% CI −£113 to £65), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.566). The difference in EQ-5D-Y scores between groups was also not statistically significant (−0.014 (95% CI −0.124 to 0.096), p=0.798). However, day 7 CARIFS scores were 3.5 points lower in the co-amoxiclav arm (95% CI −6.9 to −0.1, p=0.044).</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>Our findings did not show evidence that early co-amoxiclav treatment improves quality of life or reduces healthcare use and costs in ‘at-risk’ children with ILI, but may reduce symptom severity though confirmation from further research would be important. Reliable data collection from children’s parents/carers was challenging, and resulted in high levels of missing data, which is common in pragmatic trials involving children with acute respiratory tract infections.</p>

              <p>The clinical results of the ‘Early use of Antibiotics for at Risk CHildren with InfluEnza-like illness’ (ARCHIE) trial were recently published.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to assess uncertainty in the treatment of influenza-like illness (ILI) in ‘at-risk’ children, that is, children with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, diabetes mellitus and cerebral palsy.</p>
              <p>The RCT compared early treatment with oral co-amoxiclav against placebo, and used proportion of children reconsulting due to clinical deterioration within 28 days of randomisation as the primary outcome measure.</p>
              <p>Full details of the trial are published elsewhere.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The primary intention-to-treat analysis did not show a statistically significant difference between the co-amoxiclav and placebo groups, as measured by the proportion of children reconsulting due to clinical deterioration within 28 days. A reconsultation rate of 24.8% was observed in the co-amoxiclav arm, and 21.2% in the placebo arm (adjusted risk ratio 1.16 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.80). An exploratory analysis in the subgroup with laboratory-confirmed influenza showed that a lower proportion of children in the co-amoxiclav group reconsulted due to clinical deterioration, although this subgroup did not have sufficient power to demonstrate whether this difference was statistically significant.</p>
              <p>The trial also investigated health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare use and cost associated with the early co-amoxiclav use in ‘at-risk’ children. This research is important due to the absence of QoL and healthcare use data associated with early antibiotic use associated with influenza or ILI in this important patient population. Our literature review for our pre-trial modelling work demonstrated a lack of observational data in these ‘at-risk’ children, and we were unable to identify any clinical trials in this paediatric cohort.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> Previous UK based cost-effectiveness models of antivirals for treatment of influenza in children used adult utility values based on derived values from adults treated with oseltamivir.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> An alternative source of child-specific proxy EQ-5D data was from a trial of corticosteroids for otitis media.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

                <title>Study population</title>
                <p>The ARCHIE trial recruited 271 children at increased risk of influenza-related clinical deterioration or complications. Recruited children were between the ages of 6 months to 12 years and within the first 5 days of an ILI. In the remit of this pragmatic trial, ILI was defined as the presence of both cough and fever, whereby fever could either be child-reported, parent-reported or temperature &gt;37.8°C (axillary or tympanic temperature measurement). ‘At-risk’ was based on healthcare professionals’ clinical judgement and included children with pre-existing conditions such as asthma, diabetes mellitus and cerebral palsy. Children were ineligible if they had known contraindications to co-amoxiclav, required immediate antibiotics based on clinical judgement, required immediate hospital admission for an influenza-related complication (clinical judgement), or had been observed on a hospital ward or ambulatory care unit for longer than 24 hours. Full details of all inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in the trial protocol.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p>
                <p>Participants were recruited from general practices, walk-in centres and hospitals in the UK with a view to making healthcare decisions in the NHS and other healthcare settings.</p>
                <p>The planned sample size for the trial was 650, based on an absolute risk reduction in reconsultations due to clinical deterioration of 14% (reduction from 40% to 26%), using 90% power, a two-sided 5% significance level, an inflation factor of 1.041, and up to 25% loss to follow-up. The full sample size was not reached, and recruitment was closed after 271 children had been randomised.</p>
                <p>Children were randomised 1:1 to either co-amoxiclav 400/57 (amoxicillin 400 mg as trihydrate and clavulanic acid 57 mg as potassium salt/5 mL when reconstituted with water) or a matching placebo, to be taken orally twice daily for 5 days. Co-amoxiclav was used due to its susceptibility in treating lower respiratory tract bacterial isolates associated with influenza in primary care,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and is stockpiled by the UK government for use in influenza pandemics; a matching placebo was chosen to obtain unbiased results for treatment effects.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

                <title>Quality of life</title>
                <p>QoL was measured using the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 3-Level (EQ-5D 3-L) youth version (EQ-5D-Y), which was confirmed in pre-trial focus groups as most applicable in this patient population, compared with other questionnaires (ie, Child Health Utility-9D).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The EQ-5D-Y was collected at baseline, days 4, 7, 14 and 28. For all children, parents or carers (ie, proxies) completed the data on the children’s behalf. Data were also collected from the participants directly, where appropriate. No restrictions on which children should complete the EQ-5D-Y themselves were included in the protocol. This was due to some of the participants having complex needs and therefore being unable to complete questionnaires regardless of their age. Equally, severe illness may have prevented some children who would usually be able to complete the data from doing so at some trial follow-up time points. Whether or not children were asked to complete questionnaires was left to their proxy’s discretion.</p>
                <p>The EQ-5D-Y consists of five questions covering mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/ depression. Each question has three response levels; ‘no’, ‘some’, ‘a lot’. As the scoring for the youth-version had not been published at the time of the analysis of this study,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> the responses to the five questions were converted into utilities using the EQ-5D-3L algorithm for the UK value set,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13–15</xref> ranging from −0.594 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect health.</p>
                <p>The health state utilities calculated from the responses to EQ-5D-Y were used to estimate mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) rated on behalf of the child and by the child for both trial arms at 28 days. This was done using an area under the curve approach, whereby utilities were assumed to change linearly between each follow-up time point, weighted by the time periods the questionnaires were administered, that is, days 0 (baseline), 4, 7, 14 and 28. QALYs were generated only for participants who had EQ-5D-Y data available at baseline and all follow-up time points to 28 days.</p>

Information on the number of days children were unable to attend school or nursery, and subsequent changes to childcare requirements were also collected. These data were collected in weekly diaries on days 7, 14, 21 and 28, requiring recall of healthcare resource use over the previous week.</p>
                <p>A medical notes review was conducted to obtain clinical data for the primary outcome (reconsultation due to clinical deterioration), medication prescriptions and/or further investigations, and hospitalisations or deaths within 28 days of randomisation. The number of reconsultations, antibiotics and other drugs given, chest X-rays and other investigations performed were included in this review and were used in the estimation of healthcare use.</p>
                <p>For the purposes of this analysis, only reconsultations due to clinical deterioration considered as related to the initial illness episode for which the child was randomised were included, in line with the primary endpoint of the trial. Reconsultations had to take place within 28 days from randomisation and in relation to worsening symptoms, new symptoms or complications for which the child required medication, investigation or referral to hospital.</p>
                <p>Referrals to hospital or emergency departments for acute admission were recorded from the medical notes review including information on hospital inpatient admissions, medications and investigations undertaken.</p>
                <p>The study’s clinical lead reviewed all hospital admissions, and distinguished between those considered to be related to the illness episode the child was randomised for, and those not related. They also reviewed all medication recorded. Medications deemed unrelated to the illness for which the child was recruited into the trial were identified and excluded from this analysis.</p>
                <p>Information on healthcare use was restricted to the information obtained via the medical notes review. Information from the carer-completed diaries was considered insufficient for inclusion in this analysis (details on data availability for the self-reported questionnaires are provided in the results section for information). Serious adverse events as reported by the recruiting sites were reviewed to ensure all relevant healthcare use was captured through the medical notes review.</p>

The CARIFS score was significantly lower in the co-amoxiclav arm, indicating lower severity of respiratory symptoms in those children.

                <p>Costs per participant associated with related reconsultations and hospital admissions are shown in <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>. Average total costs over 28-day follow-up period were estimated as £82 (SD 481) in the co-amoxiclav arm, and £117 (SD 540) in the placebo arm. The medians and IQRs of zero for most costing items reflect the fact that 75% of the participants did not use the relevant resources and hence did not incur corresponding costs. There were no statistically significant differences in total costs, or any of the cost-components, between the treatment groups. Hospital stays appear to be the main cost drivers.</p>

                <title>Extrapolation of findings to national scale</title>
                <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, in mid-2018,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> there were approximately 9.7 million children aged 6 months to 12 years in the UK. Information from the ‘Surveillance of influenza and other respiratory viruses in the UK’ indicates that maximum weekly rates of GP consultations for ILI in 2018/2019 were around 21 per 100 000 for children aged &lt;1 years, 25 per 100 000 for children aged 1–4 years and 19 per 100 000 for children aged 5–14.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</p>
                <p>We assume approximately 21 per 100 000 GP consultations were for influenza-like symptoms over an 8 week period in children. Weekly GP consultations for the remaining 44 weeks of the year were assumed to be 5 per 100 000.</p>
                <p>Finally, Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> estimate that 15.3% of children with influenza like symptoms suffer from at least one of the underlying conditions that were used to classify children as ‘at-risk’, and hence eligible for the ARCHIE trial.</p>
                <p>This means that UK-wide, there were around 37 821 GP consultations for influenza like symptoms, 15.3% (5787) of which would have been expected to occur in the ‘at-risk’ groups included in the ARCHIE study. Using the estimated cost difference between the treatment arms of −£25 (95% CI −£113 to £62), the potential cost saving of early co-amoxiclav treatment compared with not providing early antibiotics is estimated as £−144 675 (95% CI £−358 794 to £653 931).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we have summarised the HRQoL, healthcare use and costs associated with treating ‘at-risk’ children with ILI with co-amoxiclav versus placebo.</p>
              <p>Our findings, which present within-trial comparisons of costs and outcomes separately, are an important addition to the literature, due to the paucity of observational data and no previous clinical trials performed in this cohort of ‘at-risk’ children. Recruitment from both primary and other ambulatory care settings with wide geographical coverage and a very pragmatic definition of ILI ensured that our study population was highly representative of ‘at-risk’ children with ILI. High data availability rates for NHS costs as obtained via the medical notes review are also a strength of this study. Due to the low completion rate of the EQ-5D-Y, we did not perform a full cost-effectiveness analysis. Data on school/nursery attendance and childcare arrangements were also subject to low completion rates, and prevented a more robust assessment from a societal perspective.</p>
              <p>The low response rates for the EQ-5D-Y and CARIFS data demonstrates the difficulties in assessing HRQoL in this patient population. Low questionnaire return rates are a common limitation of paediatric trials; for example, return rates at 14 days from two trials in respiratory tract infections were reported as 41%.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In our study, there was anecdotal evidence of parents and carers struggling to complete the questionnaires, especially the EQ-5D-Y questions on walking, usual activities and dressing, if the items were not appropriate to the expected capabilities of their children, either because of their age, especially for very young children, or their underlying condition or disability. This was reflected in the lower proxy completion rates of the EQ-5D-Y for children below the age of 2 years, compared with those aged 2 years and over, and the fact that the VAS scales of the EQ-5D-Y and the CARIFS had higher completion rates than the Likert-style questions of the questionnaires, as shown in the <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental material</xref>. Generally, there is a need for validated questionnaires that can be completed easily in this patient population.</p>
              <p>The EQ-5D-Y was expected to be completed by proxy, that is, by the children’s parents or carers on their behalf, and/or by the children themselves, as appropriate. There appeared to be some overlap between the answers provided on the proxy and self-completed EQ-5D-Y questionnaires, particularly for very young children. It is possible that some parents or carers completed the questionnaires supposed to be filled in by the children. All EQ-5D-Y data were analysed as received, without exclusions.</p>
              <p>The proxy-completed EQ-5D-Y values were not statistically significantly different between the two groups at any of the time points, although there was an improvement in HRQOL as indicated by the EQ-5D-Y scores over time (day 0–28) for both trial arms. There was a trend towards lower EQ-5D-Y values, indicating worse QoL, in the co-amoxiclav arm on days 4, 14 and 28. The CARIFS score in the co-amoxiclav arm at 7 days was significantly lower than the score in the placebo arm, indicating less severe symptoms. This might suggest that the CARIFS score is more sensitive to subtle disease specific changes in children’s health than the EQ-5D-Y. Interestingly, the EQ-5D VAS also showed a statistically significant benefit of co-amoxiclav at 7 days, and the EQ-5D-Y values were higher (not statistically significant) in the co-amoxiclav arm at 7 days compared with the placebo arm, indicating higher HRQOL. Studies of common cold or non-specific respiratory tract infections in general paediatric populations suggest that symptoms in 50% of children had improved by day seven to eight, and for 80% by day 14.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It may, therefore, be that any differences between groups will be more apparent at a stage in the illness where more children are likely to still be symptomatic than later on, when the majority will have resolved due to the natural course of the illness. Both questionnaires were subject to high levels of missing data, and should be interpreted cautiously. The high rates of missing data and anecdotal evidence of parents’ and carers’ difficulties of completing the questionnaires demonstrate a need for additional validated tools to reliably measure QoL in this patient population. The EQ-5D-Y, EQ-5D-VAS and CARIFS were secondary endpoints of the ARCHIE trial, and the EQ-5D-Y was measured at several follow-up time points. As such, the limited number of statistically significant p values might be false positives due to multiple testing and should be interpreted carefully.</p>
              <p>Overall, only 5% of children were admitted to hospital for reasons related to the illness episode for which the child was randomised into ARCHIE over the 28-day follow-up period. Admissions were often only for one or two nights. Three per cent of participants reported one emergency department visit each. Fewer than 25% of all randomised children had a reconsultation. This was lower than the anticipated 40% reconsultation rate based on published data available at the time the study was designed,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but still significantly higher than the 4% observed in a primary care cohort of children with acute respiratory tract infection who did not have known risk factors for complications from influenza or ILI.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As such, the use of primary and secondary care facilities during the trial follow-up for reasons related to the initial illness episode for which the child was randomised into ARCHIE was generally low and the limited related hospital admissions were the main cost drivers for the average cost per randomised child. In the co-amoxiclav arm, costs related to hospital admissions and emergency department visits accounted for 70% of total costs; in the placebo arm, this was 85%.</p>
              <p>Fourteen per cent of the study population had laboratory-confirmed influenza. We conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis in participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza because previous data suggesting a possible clinical benefit from early antibiotic use are reported in trials which recruited patients with confirmed influenza<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> or ILI presenting during an influenza epidemic,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> when a high proportion of ILI cases are likely to be due to influenza. This subgroup analysis indicated that there was a trend that the early co-amoxiclav treatment may be more cost saving in participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza, although this subgroup does not have sufficient statistical power to draw definitive conclusions. Also, this trial assessed the benefit of treating at-risk children as early as possible after the onset of ILI. While there is a possibility that treatment may be more beneficial in those with laboratory-confirmed influenza, evaluating the nasal swabs takes time, and may make it impossible to treat these children early. Nasal swabs were costed at £8 per child, and all children presenting with ILI would need to be tested. This outweighs the costs of co-amoxiclav, which was costed at £4.13 for children below 7 year of age, and at £5.79 children above 7 years of age. As such, there is no advantage in terms of costs to confirm influenza prior to commencing of treatment outside influenza pandemic periods. Based on the findings of the subgroup analysis, early co-amoxiclav treatment without prior nasal swab testing may be cost-effective during periods of high influenza activity, such as influenza pandemics. However, further trials conducted during such periods would be needed to confirm this.</p>
              <p>In line with the study protocol, we aimed to extrapolate the results of the study to a national level. With regards to the ARCHIE trial, this extrapolation has a number of limitations. First, the difference in costs between the co-amoxiclav and placebo was not statistically significant. Therefore, it is unclear if extrapolation to a national level would result in a cost saving or increase in spending. Finally, influenza is an infectious disease, and rates of infections vary greatly between epidemics. Our current extrapolation uses GP consultations for ILI in 2018/2019. However, it is unclear how many children may be affected in upcoming influenza seasons. This is particularly important as the rates of influenza were low during the recruitment period of ARCHIE,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28–31</xref> but more children may be affected in coming years. Our extrapolations were based on recent data, but may have to be revised in the light of SARS-CoV-2, and its impact on influenza and ILI in future influenza seasons.</p>
              <p>Neither the findings of this economic evaluation nor the findings of our main trial<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> support early use of co-amoxiclav in ‘at-risk’ children who present with ILI in primary or ambulatory care.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> With increasing concerns about growing antimicrobial resistance,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> preserving antibiotic effectiveness by avoiding routine early co-amoxiclav in this group is therefore important. The findings of a longitudinal study nested within the ARCHIE trial will report data on long-term bacterial carriage and antibiotic resistance in the co-amoxiclav versus placebo arms in a separate paper. These findings may help inform estimations relating to the potential implications of antibiotic resistance on the results reported in this economic evaluation. However, incorporating the potential cost of antimicrobial resistance to the health system and society into economic evaluations is challenging.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 34 35</xref>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our findings did not show evidence that early treatment with co-amoxiclav in ‘at-risk’ children with ILI improves QoL, reduces healthcare use or leads to cost savings over 28 days. However, there was a suggestion that early co-amoxiclav treatment might be associated with decreased symptom severity at day 7, though confirmation from additional research would be important. Collection of proxy-reported data was challenging in this patient population. Suitable validated QoL instruments are therefore needed to support more robust evaluations in this group.</p>
