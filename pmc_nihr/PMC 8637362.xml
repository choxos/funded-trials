                  <p>Participants with missing data at the previous time-point and poorer
performance status were more likely to have missing data for the primary
outcome and quality of life outcomes, at the primary follow-up point and end
of follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the number of site randomisations and
number of study site personnel were significantly associated with missing
data. Trial duration and the number of research personnel explained most of
the variance at the trial and site-level respectively, except for the
primary outcome where the amount of data requested was most important at the
trial-level. Variance at the trial level was more substantial than at the
site level across models and considerable variance remained unexplained for
all models except quality of life at the end of follow-up.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Missing data compromise the power, precision, generalisability and validity of study
findings. A systematic review of palliative care trials found nearly one quarter of
primary outcome data were missing with evidence of subsequent bias.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>
              <p>To minimise the impact of missing data on trial findings, prevention is important as
statistical methods to handle existing missing data are based on unverifiable
assumptions.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
However, there is little research on how best to reduce missing data.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> A Cochrane review of trials testing strategies to improve retention in
randomised controlled trials, an overlapping issue, included 38 studies that
assessed a range of interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Assessment of interventions to improve trial management and site-level
factors was limited, and most were evaluated in single trials in a particular context.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Effective interventions to reduce missing data should be based on evidence. It is
necessary to identify the factors associated with missingness to inform the design
of such interventions. A meta-regression of factors associated with missing data in
a systematic review of palliative care trials found that trial duration and the
amount of data requested during the trial were associated with missing data.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> However, there was insufficient evidence that participant-level factors such
as age and performance status were associated with missing data.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This analysis, however, relied on aggregate-level participant data.
Furthermore, there were no data regarding site-level factors.</p>
              <p>Individual-participant level data on the other hand uses the raw unit-level data from
each primary study.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bibr24-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This allows different sources of heterogeneity in the effect

                <p>Randomised controlled trials were eligible if: participants were over 18 years
old with an advanced life-limiting illness and palliative care needs; the
interventions were palliative where the primary aim is to improve QoL, rather
than survival, although this may be a secondary gain; the comparator was a
placebo, standard care or another palliative intervention; the primary outcome
was patient-reported; the trial was a priori adequately powered and the trial
was completed in the 5 years before this study began. Published and unpublished
trials were included with no language restrictions.</p>

measures consisted of a number of question items (range 20â28 items), which were

outcomes were dichotomised into all present or absent if one or more questions
were missing. Specifications of the explanatory variables are available in <xref rid="table1-02692163211040970" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A systematic

                <p>The multivariable models for missing data for the primary outcome at Timepoint 1
showed a strong association between baseline and Timepoint 1 primary outcome
missing data (OR 17.2, 95% CI: 8.6, 34.5). This indicates that those with
missing data at baseline were highly likely to have missing data at Timepoint 1
(<xref rid="table4-02692163211040970" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). As
the baseline AKPS increased (i.e. improved), the odds of missing data for the
primary outcome at Timepoint 1 reduced significantly (OR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70,
0.87) per 10-unit increase) (<xref rid="table4-02692163211040970" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>

                <p>Findings for Timepoint1-QoL-missing were similar. As QoL was a secondary outcome
in all trials (not a pre-specified criteria), the association with missing data
for the primary outcome at baseline was also assessed, which found participants
with missing data for the primary outcome at baseline were more likely to have
missing data for the QoL outcome at Timepoint 1 (<xref rid="table4-02692163211040970" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>

              <p>Individual participant-level data analysis of 10 palliative care trials found
participants with a poorer performance status and those with previous missing data
were more likely to have missing data at both Timepoint 1 and Timepoint 2. At
Timepoint 2, site level factors were also found to be significantly associated with
missing data. Trial duration and the number of research personnel explained most of
the variance at the trial and site-level respectively, except for the primary
outcome at Timepoint 1 where the amount of data requested was most important at the
trial-level. Variance at the trial level was more substantial than at the site level
and a considerable proportion of the variance remained unexplained at the trial and
site-level for most models.</p>

                <p>Missingness of the primary outcome and principal QoL measure at the previous
time-point was strongly and consistently associated with missingness at the
time-point of interest. This is most likely driven by complete withdrawals at
the previous time-point. However, 17.3% of participants with missing data at a
previous time-point provided data at the following time-point of interest. Thus,
for participants continuing in a trial, missing data at one time-point should be
a âred flagâ for future missing data.</p>
                <p>Participants who were more functionally limited were more likely to have missing
data. Trialists should not use this to justify the exclusion of participants
with poor performance status from palliative care trials in order to reduce
missing data. Such patients are a core group who require palliative care input.
If eligible for the intervention in clinical practice, it is essential that they
are actively recruited to trials and supported to provide data to maximise the
generalisability of trial findings. This study highlights the need for
additional consideration on how best to support this group to provide data as a
trial proceeds, this may include a more flexible study design, different
modalities of data collection and the use of proxies.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Any interventions to reduce missing data need to be evaluated to

                <p>Site-level variables and missing data were significantly associated at Timepoint
2 but not Timepoint 1. This may be because intensive central monitoring and
checks are often in place for outcomes at Timepoint 1, but not always so at
Timepoint 2 due to limited resources. The impact of site-level practices
therefore may be more evident and influential after Timepoint 1 as the burden of
the study on participants and site-staff increase. At Timepoint 2, sites that
recruited more participants were more likely to have missing data. These
findings are new, and the underlying reasons for these need exploration.</p>
                <p>The number of research personnel employed at a site and missingness at Timepoint

relationship, suggesting that there may be other influential site-level factors,

work full/part-time, staff turnover, research experience and level and content
of research training. Furthermore, there is recognition that conducting
palliative care research can be emotionally challenging with a need for
additional resources to promote job satisfaction and sustainability for trial staff<sup><xref rid="bibr19-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which may also play an important role in data quality. Further research
into how the number of researchers and research culture at a site may influence
missing data is required.</p>

                <title>Residual variance</title>
                <p>There was significant variance between trials and sites, indicating that the
effect of trial and site factors were important and need to be addressed. This
is an important finding as often the dominant focus of missing data literature
in palliative care research is on participant-level factors such as
participantsâ poor health and fatigue.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Also, for missing data for the primary outcome at Timepoint 1, unlike the
other outcomes, there was little evidence that some sites were worse than others
in a consistent way across trials (site-level variance), suggesting efforts to
reduce missing data for the primary outcome at Timepoint 1 should focus on
reducing between-trial variability.</p>
                <p>The findings suggest that duration and the numbers of research personnel are key
factors for consideration when trying to reduce missing data in palliative care
trials, however other factors, such as data-requested, may be more important for
the primary outcome at Timepoint 1. The variables included in the models
explained almost all the variance at the trial and site-level for
Timepoint2-QoL-missing, suggesting these variables have the greatest impact for
QoL outcome missing data at Timepoint 2. However, as the Timepoint 2 models
estimated a greater number of parameters at the site-level, this may be due to
over-saturation at the site-level. Other participant, trial and site level
factors, that were not included in the models, may be more crucial for the other
outcomes and need to be investigated.</p>

                <title>Limitations and strengths</title>
                <p>The included trials were a small convenience sample, manageable within the
time-frame of the study, which may limit the generalisability of the findings.
However, the average extent of missing data for the primary outcome at Timepoint
1 (26%) and participant characteristics are consistent with a systematic review
of 108 palliative care trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The principal investigator (JH) was blind to the extent and risk of bias
of missing data and study characteristics at the time of selection, and the
included trials involved participants with a range of ages, diagnoses and
performance status scores, and varied in duration thus optimising
generalisability (<xref rid="table2-02692163211040970" ref-type="table">Table
2</xref>). Although sought, data on ethnicity and socio-economic status at
the participant-level were not available consistently across the trials limiting
our understanding of the representativeness of the study sample and the effect
of these constructs on missing data. Data for two trials were not made
available, and if the reason for this is related to missing data, it could bias
the findings.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The majority of trials included in the sample were pharmacological trials
and although two non-pharmacological complex intervention trials were included,
additional considerations may be required for trials involving several
interacting components.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-02692163211040970" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The variables used in the models were restricted to those that were
collected consistently across trials and could be quantified reliably.</p>
                <p>The strengths of this study include the rigorous methodological approach which
included multi-level modelling. Both published and unpublished palliative care
trials were included and the participant-level data allowed the integrity of the
data to be assessed.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Participants with a poorer performance status and previous missing data are at higher
risk for missing data in palliative care trials and require early identification and
support to provide complete data. These factors could also be considered as
auxiliary variables in missing data imputation models, especially if associated with
the missingness outcome. However, performance status only explained part of the
residual variance, indicating that other factors affect missing data at the trial
level; identifying these factors may help to reduce missing data in future trials,
especially if they are modifiable factors.</p>
