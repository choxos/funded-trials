                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Arm weakness is common after stroke; repetitive activity is critical for recovery but people struggle with knowing what to do, volume, and monitoring progress. We studied the feasibility and acceptability of OnTrack, a digital intervention supporting arm and hand rehabilitation in acute and home settings.</p>

                  <p>A mixed-method, single-arm study evaluating the feasibility of OnTrack for hospital and home use. An independent process evaluation assessed the intervention’s fidelity, dose and reach. Amendments to the protocol were necessary after COVID-19.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>181 individuals screened, 37 met eligibility criteria, 24 recruited (65%); of these, 15 (63%) were recruited before COVID-19, and 9 (37%) during. 12 completed the intervention (50%). Despite COVID-19 disruptions, recruitment, retention and completion were in line with prestudy expectations and acceptable for a definitive trial. Participants felt the study requirements were acceptable and the intervention usable. Fidelity of delivery was acceptable according to predetermined fidelity markers. Outcome measures collected helped determine sample size estimates and primary outcomes for an RCT.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>The intervention was found to be usable and acceptable by participants; study feasibility objectives were met and demonstrated that a definitive RCT would be viable and acceptable.</p>

                <title>Background</title>
                <p>Globally, five million people are left disabled from stroke, commonly with a form of arm impairment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the UK, 75% of disabled stroke survivors, or ~4 50 000 people, have an arm weakness.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> By 2035, this number may increase by a third.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Stroke costs the UK society £26b annually, by 2025 costs could increase to £43b and to £75b by 2035. An ageing population, better stroke survival rates, and the overall increase in labour costs account for this trend.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p>
                <p>Understanding when to provide interventions that can improve arm function is recognised as a national research priority<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; despite this, time spent providing therapy for the arm is often limited, resulting in patients spending minimal time rehabilitating or being active.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> There is a correlation between physical activity and the ability to perform activities of daily living using the arm,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> but a Cochrane review of over 500 trials failed to yield high-quality practice recommendations for arm interventions.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this problem resulting in thousands of stroke survivors receiving diminished rehabilitation and an increase in health inequalities.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Without specialist support, rehabilitation can be less effective and an isolating experience.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p>
                <p>Ethnographic studies describe how patients struggle to see and keep track of improvements<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–14</xref>—especially outside of scheduled one-to-one therapy—having an impact on motivation and creating dependency on therapists for feedback.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7 15 16</xref> Stroke survivors often report feeling unsupported after leaving hospital and not knowing how to best help themselves improve their arm function.</p>
                <p>We believe repetitive activity can be increased by targeting the time patients go about their daily activities and could use their arm movement (however, small) to a greater extent. Capacity for activity could be increased further by using self-management strategies as demonstrated by several programmes in stroke and other long-term conditions.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref> In addition, there is strong evidence to suggest that digital interventions,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and in particular digital therapeutics (DTx),<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> could help support stroke patients in their rehabilitation and life after stroke.</p>
                <p>The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of the OnTrack intervention—which could increase opportunities for arm activity by improving individuals’ self-management skills through tailored support and real-time activity feedback—and inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p>
                <p>As per study protocol,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> recruitment, adherence and retention rates were measured, as well as reasons for declining participation or withdrawing from the trial; the utility and completion of outcome measures to provide an indication of effectiveness to inform sample size calculations for an RCT; the usability of OnTrack by study participants; and the acceptability of study procedures by front-line staff. An independent process evaluation assessed the fidelity of the intervention delivery as well as the acceptability of the intervention to participants and delivery team.</p>

                <p>A feasibility study with a nested process evaluation. The study was a single-site, non-randomised intervention trial. The design of the study was developed through a collaborative approach between the authors, a patient and public involvement (PPI) steering group, stroke therapists (occupational therapists and physiotherapists) and the Research Design Service at the National Institute for Health Research.</p>

                <title>Study settings</title>
                <p>Prior to lockdown restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, participants were enrolled in the study at an inner city National Health Service (NHS) hospital Trust in West London and, where necessary, continued their participation at home after discharge to complete the 14-week study period. After restrictions were introduced, all participants were enrolled at home and were followed remotely for 14 weeks.</p>

                <p>Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria are fully defined in the study protocol<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; briefly, participants were adults with a stroke diagnosis less than 6 months previously (first or recurrent) requiring arm and hand rehabilitation in hospital and/or at home, medically stable, presenting without arm pain or oedema, and with capacity to consent.</p>

                <title>Recruitment</title>
                <p>Participants were recruited from the Hyperacute Stroke Unit, Acute Stroke Unit and Clinical Neuro Rehabilitation Unit at an NHS Hospital Trust in London.</p>
                <p>Recruitment followed two distinct procedures before and after lockdown restrictions were in place. Between August 2019 and March 2020, hospital therapy teams were responsible for screening, introducing the study and providing information documents to potential participants. After taking consent, therapists shared patient information with the research team. Recruitment was suspended between March and August 2020. From September 2020 onwards, therapy teams continued to perform eligibility screens sharing patient information with the research team only at discharge. The consent and recruitment process was then completed remotely at participants’ homes.</p>

                <title>Intervention</title>
                <p>Participants were enrolled in the study for 14 weeks. Week 1 consisted of baseline assessments; weeks 2–13 consisted of the OnTrack intervention (detailed below); week 14 consisted of follow-up assessments and an interview performed by the process evaluation team. Additionally, a mid-participation assessment was performed during week 8.</p>
                <p>The intervention was the OnTrack system, consisting of three main components:</p>

                <p>Analysis was performed on the study parameters and its implementation. We evaluated the usage of OnTrack as well as outcome measures and recorded changes over time.</p>
                <p>Patterns of activity were analysed by day and hour of day. Comparisons between activity data and usage of different application features were created to understand their influence in activity output. Similarly, usage of individual features were recorded (eg, engagement with messages, number of times activity stats were accessed). Furthermore, a comparison between activity minutes and performance in the different outcome measures was performed.</p>
                <p>Pearson correlation coefficient was used to explore relationships between application usage and patient activity. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to investigate the independent effects of the the daily activity time of each patient, measured in 30 min intervals (‘Activity’), the number of days since the patient enrolment in the trial (‘Time’), and whether the patient suffered a stroke on their dominant arm (‘Dominant arm’) on the patients’ left-right arm usage ratio. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the independent effects of the ‘Activity’ and ‘Time’ variables on the other outcome measures in this study.</p>
                <p>Data collected for the process evaluation was a combination of qualitative data from semistructured interviews and observations of coaching sessions. At the study half-point, a workshop was conducted with the PPI group who analysed interview transcripts and made recommendations to refine the protocol.</p>

                <p>A PPI group comprising three stroke survivors helped refine the intervention to the version used for this study. The group met a total of four times over the duration of the study, their time and travel were reimbursed according to INVOLVE<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> guidelines. The group supervised the development of all patient-facing material to ensure its clarity and accessibility. Members were trained by experienced researchers to participate in qualitative data analysis at the study’s halfway point. They helped to refine themes and key messages arising from qualitative interviews. The PPI involvement plan was shared with Imperial College London’s PPI ‘Research Partners Group’ to ensure the needs of the steering group were accounted for.</p>

                <p>Data collected from participants during the initial assessment was available for 21 participants (11 females; mean age 61.1, range 33.5–82.5), three participants were lost to follow-up before a session could be arranged. For the majority of participants (n=16, 76%) this was their first stroke, only one participant had had more than two previous strokes. Onset of the last stroke varied between 11 and 141 days with a mean of 42.2 days. Seven participants (33%) were impaired on their dominant arm. All participants owned or had experience with mobile phones but only 15 (71%) were smartphone users; 18 (86%) had WiFi at home. Although this was not a randomised study, participants’ acceptance of randomisation was queried; 13 (62%) expressed they would have consented to the study regardless of whether they’d be allocated to a control or intervention group.</p>
                <p>All participants underwent some form of rehabilitation treatment by a UK NHS acute and/or community provider, ranging from in-person Early Supported Discharge (ESD) to remote community neurorehabilitation. However, the study did not collect detailed information on the type of rehabilitation that was provided.</p>

Of the five participants lost between starting OnTrack and finishing the study, three withdrew consent and two were lost to follow-up. Reasons for withdrawing consent included one person who felt they had gained all they could from OnTrack and wanted to continue on their own; another felt that the intervention would not help them as they had too much on their mind; and another felt too anxious, fatigued and had a skin condition that was worsening.</p>
                <p>From the 12 participants completing the intervention, 1 was unable to attend the final interview as they finished participation the week lockdown started in the UK and were living in sheltered accommodation making it impossible for the process evaluation team to make contact.</p>

On average, participants increased their target by 5% every session and managed an overall increase of 75% (min 18%, max 200%) between weeks 1 and 12, reaching their target on 3.1 days every week (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>).</p>

Engagement with messages was lower than expected. One possible explanation is that messages were only sent to the smartphone and no notifications were received on the watch, if the participant did not have the phone with them they would miss the message notification. In addition, most participants felt that carrying the phone was sometimes a burden and so the OnTrack phone was left behind for long portions of the day.</p>

Some participants felt that the amount of assessments conducted could be tiring and recommended either reducing them or conducting them over two or more sessions.

                  <p>An in-depth analysis on the experience of participating and using the intervention is reported in a process evaluation publication. In summary, participants felt OnTrack was working as expected and intended. They expressed feeling well supported to use the technology, even without prior experience. They reported feeling that the activity targets were motivating, although they would welcome more specific activity recommendations alongside targets. All participants mentioned that the quality of the coaching was an important part of creating a positive experience.

                  <p>Overall, therapists felt that the time they spent in study procedures was in line with expectations, and that the tasks performed were acceptable.</p>
                  <p>On The potential benefits of the intervention, therapists thought that the intervention could be beneficial in general terms and that it could be of most benefit to stroke survivors with motor and sensory impairment. Benefits to patients with arm neglect were less clear but tended to the positive.</p>
                  <p>Therapists agreed that the intervention could help motivate patients into performing more activities with their impaired arm and support them in the self-management of their recovery. However, some respondents felt that patients who are less engaged with their recovery may not fully benefit from the intervention.</p>

                <title>Fidelity of intervention delivery</title>
                <p>Fidelity of delivery was assessed through the observation of coaching sessions. Observations during the first half of the study identified that the delivery of the coaching sessions was inconsistent with how participants were experiencing their recovery. This resulted in the intervention team consistently deviating from the coaching plan in response to participant needs.</p>
                <p>A workshop involving the PPI group was planned at the study half-way point to refine the delivery of the intervention for phase 2. A summary of findings from the half-way workshop suggested that overall, the OnTrack intervention was working as intended, however the following points were observed:</p>
                <list list-type="bullet">
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Participants reported a lack of clarity about whether the focus of the intervention was to improve hand and arm movement, or to improve activity more generally.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>In coaching sessions, the discussions relating to the activity target were distinct from those relating to individual functional goals, and the self-management strategies were not easy to observe.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>The activity targets were regarded as motivating.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Participants wanted more specific activities as targets, for example, holding a cup, making toast.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>Participants valued facts and useful information in messages.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                    <p>The coaches were seen as central—the language and strategies they use is key to promoting self-management.</p>
                  </list-item>
                </list>
                <p>In response to these findings, a more fluid and flexible approach to coaching was developed. The new guide included prompts for supporting self-management during all sessions, as opposed to being session specific, it encouraged focusing more on discussing the meaningful activities that participants would like to use their arms for, and using the activity data to support this (a table describing these changes is provided as a <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file</xref>).</p>
                <p>Delivery of the intervention during phase 2 was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. All sessions were delivered remotely, participants stated that this was acceptable and welcomed the contact with coaches during lockdown.</p>

                <title>Summary of principal findings</title>
                <p>This study aimed to assess the acceptability of a novel digital intervention to support arm and hand rehabilitation after stroke and the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial into its effectiveness. The study met its objectives in assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and trial procedures. Despite being affected by the pandemic, recruitment to the trial was in line with prestudy expectations as described in the protocol’s sample size calculation,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> as well as participant retention rates. Appropriate outcome measures and sample size estimations for an RCT were analysed. Qualitative data were gathered showing that the intervention was usable and acceptable to study participants, but most importantly, it highlighted the components of OnTrack that were perceived as most valuable to them.</p>

                <title>Strengths and weaknesses of the study</title>
                <p>Findings from this study have shown a positive way in which wearable technology and self-management coaching could be combined to improve rehabilitation outcomes by helping participants identify opportunities for self-practice and become more engaged in their recovery. Previous studies involving wearable technologies to encourage more practice at home have shown positive results<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 32</xref>; similarly self-management approaches have been shown to obtain better outcomes for stroke patients.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–20</xref> To our knowledge, this is the first study aiming to combine these two approaches to provide a viable intervention that can be delivered in conjunction with usual care.</p>
                <p>The coronavirus pandemic significantly affected the running of this study. In the first instance, a suspension in recruitment was necessary, followed by an amendment to the recruitment and consenting procedures. In addition, the adaptation to lockdown restrictions accelerated the need for remote delivery of OnTrack, this, however, had little impact on participants’ experiences. As explored in the context of DTx,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> this may represent an opportunity to challenge conventional clinical practice and may bring a more direct access to services for patients. Furthermore, it may bring additional benefits such as closer monitoring at a lower cost and optimisation of clinician/patient interactions. Future studies should help provide answers to these questions.</p>
                <p>The independent process evaluation provided an opportunity to understand the different mechanisms of impact. Allowing for refinement at the half-way point enabled the researchers to incorporate feedback to modify the way OnTrack was delivered. The engagement of the PPI group enabled this refinement to be implemented through a user-centred process. However, the process evaluation also found that the messaging component of the intervention received mixed reviews by participants. On the one hand, the practical information sent was perceived as valuable, but the tone of voice and frequency of other messages was questioned by some participants. This should be revised for a future version of OnTrack.</p>
                <p>Due to pragmatic reasons, the study could not cater for longer-term participant follow-up. During interviews, participants expressed they would value a check some time after the programme ended. A future study should consider incorporating longer-term follow-up to understand if participants continue to apply self-management principles.</p>

                <title>Unanswered questions and future research</title>
                <p>While randomisation was not possible during this study, participants were asked if they would be willing to participate in a randomised study. Most participants said that randomisation would not influence their decision to participate, however, more consideration is needed to understand the appropriate design of control and intervention arms.</p>
                <p>The messaging component of this intervention needs further refinement and co-design in collaboration with stroke survivors. While, for the most part, the messages are seen as a valuable component, their design requires a better understanding of the content, context, frequency and tone of voice in which they are delivered.</p>
                <p>The intervention was delivered over 12 weeks (plus 2 weeks of assessments at each end), however questions remain as to whether OnTrack could be delivered over shorter or longer periods and how this would affect the design of the coaching component. The coaching component itself requires further thinking in how it may be delivered at scale, the training required, and other tools needed to support this role. For this trial, coaching guidelines were used and coaches had access to a digital dashboard showing participants’ activity. Future development and studies should focus on understanding these components from the perspective of therapy teams. In addition to this, it will also be necessary to provide answers regarding the economic impact that the intervention may have when delivered as an adjunct to standard care in a NHS such as the UK NHS.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>This study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the OnTrack intervention when used to support arm and hand rehabilitation in acute and home environments. The results obtained through this study indicated that participants found the intervention to be safe, usable and acceptable. Moreover, the study’s feasibility objectives were met and provide a basis to support further investigation to demonstrate the intervention’s clinical effectiveness through a RCT.</p>
