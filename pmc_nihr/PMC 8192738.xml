                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>No new method of assisting vaginal birth has been introduced into clinical practice since the development of the vacuum extractor in the 1950s. The Odon Device is a new device that employs a circumferential air cuff over the fetal head to assist birth. In this study, the Odon Device has been used to assist vaginal birth for standard clinical indications.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                  <title>Objective</title>
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact, safety, and acceptability of the Odon Device to women, their babies, and clinicians and to assess the feasibility of recruiting women to an interventional intrapartum research study.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Study Design</title>
                  <p>This is a nonrandomized, single-arm interventional feasibility study of the Odon Device for operative vaginal birth undertaken in a single maternity unit: Southmead Hospital, Bristol, United Kingdom. The Odon Device was used to assist birth in 40 women who required the birth to be assisted for suspected fetal compromise and/or prolonged second stage of labor. The primary clinical outcome was the proportion of births successfully assisted with the Odon Device, and the primary feasibility outcome was the proportion of eligible women who were approached and who agreed to participate. Neonatal outcome data were reviewed at day 28, and maternal outcomes were investigated up to day 90.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>Between October 2018 and January 2019, 298 of 384 approached, eligible women (77.6%) consented to participate. Of these women, 40 received the intervention—the use of the Odon Device. Birth was assisted in all cephalic (occiput anterior, occiput transverse, and occiput posterior) fetal positions, at all stations at or below the ischial spine and with or without regional analgesia. The Odon Device was effective in 19 of 40 cases (48%). Of the 40 births, 21 (52.5%) required additional assistance: 18 of 40 births (45%) were completed using nonrotational forceps, 1 of 40 births (3%) required rotational forceps, and 2 of 40 births (5%) required an emergency cesarean delivery. There was no serious maternal or neonatal adverse event related to the use of the device, and there was no serious adverse device effect. There were 4 devices (10%) that were ineffective because of a manufacturing fault. Furthermore, 39 of 40 women (98%) reported a high birth perception score. All practitioners were able to use the device as intended, although some steps in using the device were reported to be easier to perform (setup and deflation of air chamber) than others (application of the device and withdrawal of the applicator).</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Recruitment to an interventional study of a new device for operative vaginal birth was feasible; 78% of eligible women were willing to participate, often expressing an aspiration for an alternative to forceps and vacuum. The success rate of the Odon Device was lower than reported success rates of vacuum and forceps; however, in this study, the device had been used to assist birth for standard clinical indications. There was no significant maternal or neonatal safety concern associated with the use of the device, although the number of births studied was small. Further feasibility study to establish iterative changes to the device, technique, and clinical indications is necessary.</p>

However, in contrast to the huge advances in medical care over the past 70 years, no new method for assisting vaginal birth has been introduced into clinical practice since the development of the vacuum extractor in the 1950s. The advantages of the Odon Device compared with the advantages of standard methods for assisting birth (ie, forceps and vacuum) are currently unknown as the device has not yet been used in clinically indicated cases. Potential advantages could include improved neonatal outcomes (eg, reduction in subaponeurotic and retinal hemorrhages, skull fracture, and facial nerve palsy), increased maternal acceptability, reduction in failed rate of operative vaginal birth, decreased risk of adverse maternal outcomes (eg, postpartum hemorrhage and vaginal tears), and ease of use (ie, the same application technique of the device for all cephalic positions).</p>
              <p id="p0035">The Odon Device is a new device that can be used for operative vaginal birth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) consisting of a plastic applicator and polyethylene sleeve. The applicator has 4 flexible spatulas that position the sleeve over the fetal head. A progress indicator allows the operator to confirm the correct depth of insertion. The sleeve contains a circumferential air chamber that is inflated around the fetal head, providing the grip for the operator to apply traction (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Video</xref>). The instructions for the use of the Odon Device are shown in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>. A phase 1 study of 4 earlier versions of the Odon Device in 49 healthy volunteers (women who were about to have a spontaneous vaginal birth) demonstrated that the device could be applied to the fetal head during the second stage of labor with no serious safety concern.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Animal studies were subsequently performed for safety, and an extensive program of simulation studies confirmed that the device could be reliably sited and used in occiput anterior, occiput transverse, and occiput posterior fetal positions.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><fig id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Odon Device component parts</p><p><italic>Hotton et al.

In addition, 3 infants (8%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) following birth, all with respiratory distress. In all 3 cases, the indication for operative vaginal birth was “presumed fetal compromise.” NIPS was reassuring in only 1 infant, who was admitted to the NICU, with a score of ≥4 indicating pain.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Immediate neonatal outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Neonatal outcome</th><th>Overall (n=40)</th><th>Successful Odon (n=19)</th><th>Unsuccessful Odon (n=21)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Umbilical artery pH</td><td>7.18±0.07</td><td>7.19±0.06<xref rid="tbl3fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>7.18±0.08<xref rid="tbl3fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Umbilical artery base excess</td><td align="char">−6.6 (−8.6 to −5.2)</td><td align="char">−6.5 (−8.5 to −5.7)<xref rid="tbl3fna" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td align="char">−7.0 (−9.0 to −4.6)<xref rid="tbl3fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Umbilical vein pH</td><td align="char">7.33 (7.29 to 7.36)</td><td align="char">7.33 (7.30 to 7.36)<xref rid="tbl3fnc" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td align="char">7.31 (7.28 to 7.36)<xref rid="tbl3fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Umbilical vein base excess</td><td align="char">−4.9 (2.3)</td><td align="char">−4.9 (2.4)<xref rid="tbl3fnc" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td align="char">−4.8 (2.3)<xref rid="tbl3fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Shoulder dystocia</td><td align="char">1 (2.5)</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td><td align="char">1 (4.8)</td></tr><tr><td>Apgar scores&lt;7</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> 1 min</td><td align="char">5 (12.5)</td><td align="char">3 (15.8)</td><td align="char">2 (9.5)</td></tr><tr><td> 5 min</td><td align="char">2 (5.0)</td><td align="char">1 (5.3)</td><td align="char">1 (4.8)</td></tr><tr><td> 10 min</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Neonatal Infant Pain Scores≥4</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> 2 h postnatal<xref rid="tbl3fnb" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td align="char">1 (2.6)<xref rid="tbl3fnd" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref></td><td align="char">1 (5.6)<xref rid="tbl3fne" ref-type="table-fn">e</xref></td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td></tr><tr><td> 6 h postnatal<xref rid="tbl3fnc" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td><td align="char">0 (0.0)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tspara0055"><p>Data are presented as mean±standard deviation, number (percentage) or median (interquartile range).</p></fn><fn id="tspara0060"><p><italic>Hotton et al.

                <p id="p0175">It is feasible to recruit women to a study investigating a novel device for operative vaginal birth. A recruitment rate of 78% is high and appears to be related to a general maternal aspiration for an alternative to forceps and vacuum (details from qualitative findings that will be published separately). The success rate of the Odon Device was lower than the reported success rates of both vacuum and forceps<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref>; however, the device had been used to induce birth where clinically indicated.</p>

                <title>Results</title>
                <p id="p0180">Factors that are likely to affect the efficacy of the device assisted the clinical context, technique of application and traction, the initial uncertainty of the optimal technique in inserting and using the device (as the device was used for clinically indicated cases), and the design and functionality of the device itself. For example, it became clear after 3 births that the device is most effectively placed during a uterine contraction, in contrast to forceps and vacuum.</p>
                <p id="p0185">Although the study was not powered to look at predictors, births were more likely to be successful if the fetal vertex was lower in the birth canal or if there was minimal molding of the fetal skull or similar other assisted births.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The Odon Device was never successful when it was used with the vertex at the level of the ischial spines; indeed, a vertex above +1 is a contraindication to attempting operative vaginal birth in some national guidelines.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> The average time of decision to delivery was 11 minutes, which was faster than documented average times in the literature of 15 to 59 minutes depending on whether the birth was assisted in a labor or operating room.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The Odon Device was successfully employed across the full range of fetal positions using the same technique, which may be particularly useful for maternity settings with low operative vaginal birth rates. During the routine device inspection following birth, 4 devices (10%) were found to have a fault with the inflation mechanism. Further investigation along with the manufacturer identified a single issue related to the use of gamma radiation in the sterilization process that degraded the device components. This issue has been rectified by the manufactures and highlights the importance of postuse device inspection during feasibility studies.</p>

                <p id="p0190">There was no significant maternal or neonatal safety concern associated with the use of the device, although the number of births is small. There seem to be some neonatal benefits associated with the use of the device, consistent with the findings from simulation<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>; 16% of babies whose birth was successfully assisted with the Odon Device had evidence of soft tissue trauma compared with 60% of babies in cases where the device was unsuccessful. We recorded any soft tissue trauma, including a bruise, graze, laceration, or hematoma, whether it appeared to be related to device use or not. Evidence demonstrated that the laceration rate following operative vaginal delivery can be up to 10%<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and instrument bruises up to 37%<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>; however, there are few studies reporting all soft tissue injury. We had 4 cephalohematomas (10.3%), which agrees published rates of occurrence following operative vaginal birth.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Clearly, the use of 2 instruments is associated with an increased risk of neonatal trauma,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> but the trauma rates in this study were consistent with other operative vaginal birth studies in the same unit.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Operators used their clinical judgment to decide whether to use a second device or perform a cesarean delivery following the failure of a primary device. This study routinely used NIPS to assess infants following operative vaginal birth, and the scores have indicated reassuringly low levels of neonatal pain.</p>
                <p id="p0195">Maternal outcomes were also acceptable. No woman required a blood transfusion after a successful Odon Device–assisted birth compared with 10% of women in unsuccessful cases. Clearly, this may reflect the use of 2 instruments<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and/or a more difficult cohort of births. Overall, the maternal outcomes were again comparable to a previous study of operative vaginal birth in the study unit.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> There were 3 third-degree tears (7.5%) during the study, 1 (5.3%) from a birth successfully assisted by the Odon Device and 2 (9.5%) from births requiring a second device to assist birth. This agrees tear rates in the literature, which range from 1% to 4% for ventouse-assisted births,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> 8% to 12% for forceps-assisted births,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> and 17.4% for women who had births assisted with sequential devices.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref></p>

                <p id="p0205">A future randomized controlled trial will be required to objectively compare outcomes among the Odon Device, forceps, and vacuum. However, this would require equipoise among the options for operative vaginal birth. We are confident that the success rates of the Odon Device can be improved with iterative improvements to the insertion technique, refinement of participant selection, and a more reliable device design. Further feasibility studies are currently underway in Bristol, United Kingdom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/research-innovation/our-research/current-research/women-childrens-health-research-unit/women-4" id="intref0010">https://www.nbt.nhs.uk/research-innovation/our-research/current-research/women-childrens-health-research-unit/women-4</ext-link>), and Besançon, France, and the success rate has markedly improved in this second phase; an interim analysis of the current ongoing studies demonstrated a success rate of 78% (66 of 85 cases).<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p>

                <p id="p0210">The Odon Device has been used in clinically indicated cases for operative vaginal birth. It demonstrates an innovative approach to information sharing and recruitment, with positive results. The study ensured a holistic approach when evaluating a novel device, ensuring that data from women, infants, clinicians, midwives, and the device were scrutinized. Key quantitative data were consolidated with embedded qualitative research to enable further understanding. Key limitations included the small sample size and the reasonably short follow-up period of 90 days. We intended to perform long-term follow-up of women and their babies during the next phase of the study, following the completion of our feasibility research. We acknowledge that this research was undertaken in a single center in a single country where most participants were White.</p>

The potential advantages of the Odon Device (eg, possible reduction in neonatal soft tissue trauma, single mode of application irrespective of fetal position) merit further iterative exploration and investigation of the device in larger studies.</p>
