                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Influenza and other respiratory viruses promote <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> proliferation in the upper respiratory tract. We sought to investigate for what we believe is the first time, the effect of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) on nasopharyngeal <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> density in a low-income to middle-income country population with high pneumococcal carriage rates.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>In an open-label, randomised, controlled trial in The Gambia, 330 healthy children aged 24–59 months were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive one trivalent LAIV dose at enrolment (day 0, intervention) or at the end of active follow-up (day 21, control). The investigator team were initially masked to block size and randomisation sequence to avoid allocation bias. Group allocation was later revealed to the investigator team. The primary outcome was PCR-quantified day 7 and 21 pneumococcal density. Asymptomatic respiratory viral infection at baseline and LAIV strain shedding were included as covariates in generalised mixed-effects models, to assess the effect of LAIV and other variables on pneumococcal densities. The study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" id="interrefs10">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT02972957" id="interrefs20">NCT02972957</ext-link>, and is closed to recruitment.</p>

                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Feb 8 and April 12, 2017, and Jan 15 and March 28, 2018, of 343 children assessed for eligibility, 213 in the intervention group and 108 in the control group completed the study and were included in the final analysis. Although no significant differences were seen in pneumococcal carriage or density at each timepoint when comparing groups, changes from baseline were observed in the LAIV group. The baseline <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> carriage prevalence was high in both LAIV and control groups (75%) and increased by day 21 in the LAIV group (85%, p=0·0037), but not in the control group (79%, p=0·44). An increase in pneumococcal density from day 0 amounts was seen in the LAIV group at day 7 (+0·207 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·105, p=0·050) and day 21 (+0·280 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·105, p=0·0082), but not in the control group. Older age was associated with lower pneumococcal density (−0·015 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·005, p=0·0030), with the presence of asymptomatic respiratory viruses at baseline (+0·259 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·097, p=0·017), and greater LAIV shedding at day 7 (+0·380 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·167, p=0·024) associated with higher pneumococcal density. A significant increase in rhinorrhoea was reported in the LAIV group compared with the control group children during the first 7 days of the study (103 [48%] of 213, compared with 25 [23%] of 108, p&lt;0·0001), and between day 7 and 21 (108 [51%] of 213, compared with 28 [26%] of 108, p&lt;0·0001).</p>

                  <p>LAIV was associated with a modest increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage and density in the 21 days following vaccination, with the increase in density lower in magnitude than previously described in the UK. This increase was accelerated when LAIV was administered in the presence of pre-existing asymptomatic respiratory viruses, suggesting that nasopharyngeal <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> proliferation is driven by cumulative mixed-viral co-infections. The effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density is probably similar to other respiratory viral infections in children. Our findings provide reassurance for the use of LAIV to expand influenza vaccine programmes in low-income to middle-income country populations with high pneumococcal carriage.</p>

                  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed and Web of Science for research articles published in English up to April 7, 2021 with the terms: “<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>” OR “pneumococcus” AND “colonisation” OR “colonisation density” OR “bacterial load” AND “live attenuated influenza vaccine” OR “asymptomatic influenza infection” OR “asymptomatic viral infection”. This search identified five studies on the effect of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or asymptomatic influenza−viral infection on <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> colonisation dynamics. The first study used a murine model to investigate the effect of LAIV on nasopharyngeal <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> densities, showing increased bacterial loads for both following LAIV. The second study was a randomised, clinical trial in children aged 2–4 years from the UK, examining the effect of LAIV on upper respiratory tract colonisation with <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and other bacteria. This study found a six-times increase in pneumococcal colonisation density at 28 days following one dose of LAIV in children colonised with <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> at baseline (increase from 2687 copies per mL at baseline to 16687 copies per mL at day 28). The third study was a longitudinal study in children aged between 48 and 96 months in the USA, which showed increased colonisation densities of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> in the upper respiratory tract during symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections. The fourth study was a cross-sectional prospective study investigating nasopharyngeal carriage of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and other bacteria among children in Greece, aged 3 months to 6 years old, presenting with and without symptomatic respiratory symptoms. This study reported that carriage prevalences were significantly higher in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic children for <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> (37·1% compared with 23·6%). The fifth study consisted of two randomised, control trials in adults, which used a human co-challenge model with LAIV and <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> in the UK. The first trial investigated pneumococcal density in adults who were randomly assigned to receive LAIV or placebo before challenge with <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> 3 days later. In this trial, a ten-times increase in <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> densities was observed by day 9 in LAIV recipients but not in the control group. In the second trial, adults were first challenged with <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> before receiving LAIV or placebo 3 days later. This study paradoxically observed reduced <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> densities in adults in the LAIV group. We did not find any published studies from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) or with high pneumococcal carriage prevalences, investigating the effect of LAIV or asymptomatic viral infections on <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> colonisation dynamics.</p>

                  <p id="para60">To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first longitudinal, randomised, controlled trial reporting the effect of LAIV and asymptomatic viral infections on nasopharyngeal colonisation and density of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> in a low-income to middle-income country population with high pneumococcal carriage prevalences. Our results show that LAIV leads to an increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density in this population, similar to the effect caused by asymptomatic viral infections in this cohort. Although, to a much lower magnitude (1·78 times the original magnitude) than previously shown in the study of UK children given LAIV (six times). We also report a small increase in the proportion of children with pneumococcal carriage 21 days after receiving LAIV (75–85%). Additionally, we show that LAIV administered in the presence of pre-existing asymptomatic respiratory viruses accelerates pneumococcal proliferation in the nasopharynx. Our study is, we believe, the first to show that LAIV leads to modest increases in <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> colonisation and density in children residing in an area of high pneumococcal carriage, and to a degree not dissimilar to fluctuations seen due to repeated asymptomatic respiratory viral infections.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p id="para80">Our study contributes to the existing knowledge highlighting the importance of asymptomatic viral infections on <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> colonisation densities in the nasopharynx, as well as the specific effect of LAIV on <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> dynamics in young children. Asymptomatic viral infections are common and could be an important contributing factor to high colonisation densities and consequently transmission rates, even after introduction of pneumococcal vaccines in LMICs. Strategies to reduce pneumococcal carriage, transmission rates, and disease should also consider interventions to reduce respiratory viral infections, especially in at risk populations including children. Our data provides evidence that the effect of LAIV on <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> density in children residing in an area of high pneumococcal carriage is modest and supports the wider rollout of LAIV in LMICs to help reduce the burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality.</p>

              <p id="para90">Viral-bacterial co-infections are commonly observed in RTIs and associated with greater disease severity.

              <p id="para110">There are no data available on the effect of LAIV on nasopharyngeal <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> proliferation in children from LMICs, where in many settings high rates of pneumococcal carriage and disease are seen. Despite high uptake of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), pneumococcal carriage rates in The Gambia in children younger than 5 years continues to be over 70%, primarily with non-PCV serotypes. The burden of influenza in LMICs is not well known due to lack of robust surveillance data in these settings, but influenza-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be higher compared with other regions.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Routine influenza vaccination programmes for at-risk groups such as children younger than 5 years are not in place in most of sub-Saharan Africa.

As an open-label study, from this point on, the investigator team were aware of group allocation. Because of the need to carry out LAIV quantitative PCR (qPCR) on samples in the LAIV group only, group allocation was also revealed to the local laboratory team after recruitment.

              <p id="para270">The presence of an asymptomatic viral infection at baseline was associated with higher pneumococcal density during the study period in LAIV recipients (+0·287 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, p=0·020, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>) but not in the control group (+0·135 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, p=0·41, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 4</xref>). In the LAIV group, the presence of an asymptomatic respiratory virus at baseline resulted in an earlier peak in pneumococcal density at day 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>).<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of the presence of asymptomatic respiratory viral infection at baseline on <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> densities during the study period in the LAIV group (A) and the control group (B)</p><p>LAIV=live attenuated influenza vaccine.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p>
              <p id="para280">The greater pneumococcal density in the control recruited in 2018 appeared to be seen mainly in children with no respiratory viruses detected at day 0, and due to an increase between day 7 and day 21 (+0·311 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL, SE 0·155, p=0·050, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 6</xref>). This probably explains the interaction seen in our main analysis between group and year on the effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density. Because asymptomatic viral infections at baseline in control group participants were not significantly different in 2017 (24 [40%] of 60) compared with 2018 (17 [39%] of 44, p=0·93), we hypothesised that this unexpected increase in pneumococcal density in the control group between day 7 and day 21 in 2018 might have been due to acquisition of new respiratory viral infections between day 0 and day 7, leading to greater pneumococcal proliferation by day 21. Of samples available for testing, 10 (21%) of 48 children in the 2017 control group had acquired a new viral infection by day 7, compared with 17 (40%) of 42 children in the 2018 control group (p=0·07, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>). Overall, (20 [54%] 37) new viral infections were due to a rhinovirus infection. The median day 21 pneumococcal density in children who acquired a new viral infection was 1·93 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL (IQR 0·92–2·65) compared with 1·34 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL (0·03–2·15, p=0·12) in those who did not. Because of unavailability of day 7 samples from the LAIV group for further testing, this analysis was done by use of only samples from the control group.</p>
              <p id="para290">We next investigated whether the degree of LAIV strain viral shedding was a potential driver of the observed increase in pneumococcal densities. We have previously described the detailed shedding dynamics observed in this cohort, with 184 (86%) of 213 children at day 2 and 154 (72%) of 213 at day 7 shedding at least one strain.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Children were categorised as high viral shedders if the Ct value in any of the three strains was equal to or below the median Ct value of all RT-PCR values at each timepoint.

In a generalised linear model including baseline asymptomatic respiratory viruses, year of recruitment and age as covariates, high LAIV viral shedding at day 7 was associated with higher day 7 pneumococcal density (+0·380 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL compared with low viral shedding, SE 0·167, p=0·024, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para310">We report what we believe is the first study exploring the effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density in children living in an LMIC with a high prevalence of <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> carriage. We found a modest increase in pneumococcal density following LAIV administration, supporting our initial hypothesis. Although these findings are consistent with the only other such study among children in the UK,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> the increase in density we observed was less (1·78-times the original magnitude by day 21) than the six-times increase (at day 28) in genome copies per mL reported by Thors and colleagues.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Furthermore, the increase in our study was mainly seen between day 0 and 7 (1·58-times), consistent with the peak seen in a mouse model,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and appeared to be driven by higher viral shedding and co-infection with asymptomatic respiratory viruses at baseline.</p>
              <p id="para320">The reasons for this contrast with the study of UK children are not entirely clear. Our study used the trivalent Russian-backbone LAIV whereas Thors and colleagues used a trivalent Ann Arbor LAIV.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Given the influence of the high LAIV shedding on pneumococcal density we observed, and the effect of pre-existing influenza antibodies on shedding we have previously shown,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> it is possible that differences in either LAIV formulation or previous influenza history in the two cohorts could have played a role. Although it is possible that had we extended our timepoints to day 28 we might have seen a similar rise, our observed dynamics with the greatest increase between day 0 and 7 would suggest otherwise. Finally, although comparison of pneumococcal densities across the two studies should be done with caution, it is striking that our baseline pneumococcal density in the LAIV group (1·26 log<sub>10</sub> copies per μL or 18 197 copies per mL) was higher than that in the UK study even following the six-times rise (16 687 copies per mL). Little is known about the plausible dynamic range of pneumococcal colonisation in the paediatric nasopharynx, but there might be limits to how much perturbation is possible if density is already very high and at relative equilibrium with other microorganisms.</p>
              <p id="para330">We observed that the presence of an asymptomatic respiratory viral infection at baseline was associated with an earlier peak and higher pneumococcal densities following LAIV. Respiratory viruses are common in asymptomatic children,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> albeit data are scarce from LMICs. In a 52-week household transmission study in Utah, 79 (31%) of 254 of viral episodes in 21 children younger than 5 years were asymptomatic.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> In a Dutch cohort, 250 (83%) of 303 healthy asymptomatic children (median age 14·1 months) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with rhinovirus being most prevalent.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> The prevalence of asymptomatic viruses detected in our cohort was lower (35%), but in slightly older children who were deliberately recruited during the dry season in The Gambia when less respiratory viral infections occur. Interestingly, the trajectories of pneumococcal density during the study were very similar between LAIV recipients with no baseline respiratory virus compared with control group participants who had asymptomatic viruses detected at day 0. This suggests that the effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density might be similar to any other mild respiratory viral infection. Importantly, our findings show that the effect of asymptomatic viruses on pneumococcal density is enhanced with cumulative infections, whether acquired naturally or introduced in attenuated forms such as LAIV. We detected a new respiratory viral infection in 27 (30%) of 90 children in the control group at day 7 of the study. This highlights how frequently the nasopharynx of young children is subjected to new viruses and therefore the dynamic nature of viral–bacterial interactions that must exist in this biological niche. Increases in pneumococcal density have been shown in children aged 48–96 months during both symptomatic and asymptomatic acute respiratory viral infections.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Another study in children aged 3 months–6 years old showed pneumococcal carriage prevalences to be higher during symptomatic (37·1%) compared to asymptomatic (23·6%) respiratory viral infections.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para340">Lastly, LAIV receipt was associated with increased rhinorrhoea in our study. Elevated pneumococcal colonisation density during episodes of viral rhinitis in children can potentially facilitate pneumococcal transmission.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> It is possible that prolonged nasal discharge combined with the modest increase in pneumococcal density could together increase the chances of pneumococcal transmission in this setting. This could be explored in studies specifically measuring <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> acquisition in household members of children receiving LAIV.</p>
              <p id="para350">Our study has several strengths. The randomised, controlled design and longitudinal nature allowed us to compare bacterial dynamics over time, enabling us to quantify the effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density while minimising confounding effects. High retention of study participants and adherence to study visit dates greatly reduced variability. Our study was adequately powered to detect at least a 2-times increase in pneumococcal density following LAIV. A 1·5–2·0-times increase has been suggested as being at the lower end of a clinically meaningful increase with respect to enhanced transmission potential.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="para360">Our study has limitations. We used a qPCR to detect and quantify <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> and therefore could not establish the burden of viable bacteria. Nevertheless, a strong correlation between culture and <italic>lytA</italic> qPCR in quantifying <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> is reported.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Although we provide an effect of LAIV on the overall pneumococcal population, analysing the effect on specific PCV and non-PCV <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> serotypes would be important. We also observed an association between higher day 7 LAIV shedding and greater pneumococcal density at that timepoint. This is in keeping with a hypothesis that greater viral burden might drive more bacterial proliferation, whether due to higher viral load of a single virus or co-infections with several viruses. However, as both LAIV and <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> quantification was done by means of a single swab, we cannot exclude that this association was an artefact of variability in sample material collected with each swab.</p>
              <p id="para370">Our study was not powered to detect a difference in pneumococcal carriage rates between groups. However, we did observe an increase in pneumococcal colonisation over time in the LAIV group. It was not possible for us to establish whether this was due to an increase in pre-existing <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> below the level of detection of our qPCR assay or new acquisitions. Of note, human co-challenge study in adults has observed that receipt of LAIV 3 days before pneumococcal challenge increased the <italic>S pneumoniae</italic> carriage prevalence detected by molecular methods (60% compared with 40% in controls).<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Our study was also not designed to establish how long the effect of either LAIV or other acute respiratory viral infections on pneumococcal density might last. We did not know when the asymptomatic respiratory viruses detected at baseline might have occurred. An LAIV challenge study with longer follow-up or a longitudinal cohort study characterising the effect of asymptomatic and symptomatic respiratory viral infections on bacterial dynamics would be valuable.</p>
              <p id="para380">We did an individually randomised study, which theoretically might underestimate the effect on children in the control group as higher pneumococcal densities in vaccinated children might increase transmission in shared environments. Although this might be an issue when recruiting from day care centres,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> it is less likely to be relevant in our community-based study in which young children spend most days within and around their own households. We recruited 20 sibling pairs, with only six pairs in which one sibling was in the LAIV group and the other in the control group during the same year. Finally, we were unable to fully explain the unexpected increase in pneumococcal density between days 7 and 21 in control group participants recruited in 2018 which confounded our comparisons between groups.</p>
