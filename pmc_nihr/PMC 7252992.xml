                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>The Antidepressant Advisor Study is a feasibility trial of a computerised decision-support tool which uses an algorithm to provide antidepressant treatment guidance for general practitioners (GPs) in the UK primary care service. The tool is the first in the UK to implement national guidelines on antidepressant treatment guidance into a computerised decision-support tool.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>The study is a parallel group, cluster-randomised controlled feasibility trial where participants are blind to treatment allocation. GPs were assigned to two treatment arms: (1) treatment-as-usual (TAU) and (2) computerised decision-support tool to assist with antidepressant choices. The study will assess recruitment and lost to follow-up rates, GP satisfaction with the tool and impact on health service use. A meaningful long-term roll-out unit cost will be calculated for the tool, and service use data will be collected at baseline and follow-up to inform a full economic evaluation of a future trial.</p>

                  <p>The study has received National Health Service ethical approval from the London—Camberwell St Giles Research Ethics Committee (ref: 17/LO/2074). The trial was pre-registered in the Clinical Trials.gov registry. The results of the study will be published in a pre-publication archive within 1 year of completion of the last follow-up assessment.</p>

                <title>Background and rationale</title>
                <p>Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> with approximately 2 million adults in the UK experiencing an episode each week.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Population-based studies show that only 50% of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) are treated<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> and more than half of these receive inadequate treatment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, less than one-third of patients fully recover after treatment with a standard antidepressant, such as citalopram,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and only 40% of patients recover after accessing the National Health Service (NHS) Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends three first-line antidepressants with similar mechanism of action (fluoxetine, sertraline and citalopram).<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Second-line and third-line treatments are recommended by NICE, but, due to a lack of sequenced guidance, it is unclear whether and when general practitioners (GPs) should prescribe them.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Overall, unlike for the management of other long-term conditions, there is no structured disease management for antidepressant prescribing in UK primary care<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> and patients’ access to second-line and third-line antidepressants is variable. National prescription data show frequent and rising use of certain second-line antidepressants such as venlafaxine and mirtazapine without clear decision strategies.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A lack of structure in treatment decision making and poor implementation of existing guidelines could exacerbate the suffering caused by insufficiently treated depression.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Enhanced depression care has been called for and entails tailoring treatment to measured outcomes.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p>
                <p>One way to provide structured treatment guidelines is through algorithms which incorporate various patient characteristics and allocate treatments most likely to be effective. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no scientifically evaluated and pragmatic antidepressant decision-support tool in UK primary care. This is based on a literature search conducted in September 2019 in the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN), Eudra CT, Clinical Trials.gov, PubMed and Web of Knowledge databases using the key words: (“depression or depressive”) AND “decision” AND (“computer or algorithm”) AND “antidepressant”. The search returned four relevant studies which employed a computer-based algorithm to help make decisions about antidepressant treatments.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11–14</xref></p>
                <p>Out of three completed studies, two found evidence for the effectiveness of algorithm support compared with treatment-as-usual. Adli <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found shorter time to remission and fewer medication switches using an algorithm compared with computerised support and treatment-as-usual for depression treatment. Kurian <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> assigned private GPs and their MDD patients to active computerised decision support for antidepressants based on the 1999 Texas Medication Algorithm Project<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and treatment-as-usual. The active group showed a 41% response rate to treatment versus 26% in the treatment-as-usual group. However, Rollman <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported no difference in depressive symptoms after 6 months between active decision support, non-specific prompting that depression needs treatment and treatment-as-usual. The ongoing Assurex Health Inc Study<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> uses a genetic testing decision-support tool to predict differential treatment response to treatments for depression.</p>
                <p>Overall, all of the above studies were conducted outside of the UK, often in private healthcare settings which are difficult to compare with the UK NHS. Several of the support tools did not provide specific treatment sequences, only broad recommendations to change medication. Furthermore, some of the studies could not translate recommendations into algorithms to be used by GPs so that researchers had to manually provide GPs with advice reports. This creates a complicated treatment process and it seems unlikely that the support tools could provide ongoing recommendations to prescribers after initial treatment recommendations. Moreover, Kurian <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Rollman <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> employed algorithms that are now outdated and lacked integration of recent evidence on superiority of specific novel antidepressants in terms of tolerability and efficacy. All of the tools lacked integration into existing electronic healthcare record systems that GPs are familiar with. NICE guidelines provide useful MDD treatment advice for GPs but a scarcity of studies on complex interventions using sequenced treatment algorithms has meant that the guidelines are unclear about how many switches between individual antidepressants are recommended before seeking specialist advice on other strategies such as, augmentation. The seminal STAR*D Study investigating such a sequenced treatment algorithm has used augmentation strategies that according to NICE should not be carried out by GPs.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p>
                <p>Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility of a future definitive randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy and cost effectiveness of a decision tool incorporating an algorithm to advise GPs on antidepressant prescribing for patients who have not responded to first-line treatments. In contrast to earlier work, the treatment algorithm is based on NICE guidelines including the latest health technology appraisals. If successful, the present study will therefore enable the first investigation into whether a sequenced treatment algorithm that relies on well-tolerated single antidepressants is effective and cost effective. The authors have gained support from one of the leading UK providers of primary care electronic record systems (EMIS group) who have implemented the algorithm into their software. The tool will be designed to be easy to use and to save time for GPs who are often limited to 10 min appointments.</p>

                  <p>Potential participants will be identified using an EMIS eligibility tool to search participating GP practice medical records for patients meeting inclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>). Interested participants will complete a pre-screening assessment, followed by a screening assessment including a clinical evaluation to determine full eligibility. The results of the screening assessment will be shared with GPs and patients. Inclusion decisions will not be made by GPs to help mitigate against selection biases and will be decided by the research team after the screening assessment. After being enrolled, patients receive access to a secure mobile phone app developed in the study. Eligible patients will undergo treatment for depression over 14 weeks with their GPs. In both arms, patients will be seen by their GP who will review and monitor treatment. Patients’ participation will last for approximately 15–18 weeks after their screening assessment, at which point their follow-up assessment will be conducted.

                <p>An EMIS decision support module was developed which provides suggestions for antidepressant prescribing after highlighting the importance of non-pharmacological strategies such as psychological therapy or exercise. The treatment recommendations are based on NICE guidelines, British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and Maudsley prescribing guidelines.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The algorithm is designed to incorporate patient preferences, ensure maximum prescribing safety and offer guidance on antidepressant monotherapy (avoiding combinations). NICE guidelines state that GPs should not normally initiate combinations without consulting a psychiatrist first.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref> for stepped recommendations provided in the tool; for further detail see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">online supplementary file 1</xref>.</p>

                <p>The module is implemented only for those GP practices taking part in the study and only for participating patients at those practices. GPs will use the EMIS module during patient appointments by entering patients’ Maudsley Modified Patient Health Questionnaire (MM-PHQ-9)<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> scores of their depressive symptoms over the last week from the study mobile app. The tool will offer treatment advice on whether a patient’s antidepressant should be maintained or changed and what it should be changed to. The advisor tool is used for every depression review appointment over the 14-week study duration, with no minimum number of appointments.</p>
                <p>GPs in both conditions will receive training by the study Principal Investigator (PI) on study procedures including adverse event (AE) reporting and incorporating patients’ mobile app data. Training will be tailored to treatment arm so that GPs in the decision-support tool arm will be trained in how to use the EMIS module to guide treatment decisions whereas GPs in the TAU arm will be advised to use their clinical judgement as usual for treatment.</p>

GP adherence to the algorithm will be measured after GPs have completed their participation in the study with a self-report questionnaire and information from EMIS.</p>

The QIDS-SR16 and other continuous outcomes will be summarised at baseline and follow-up using means and SDs.

A preliminary analysis of the difference between the groups, as far as possible using the intention-to-treat principle, is planned. This analysis will be identified as preliminary and underpowered when published, and no p values will be provided. Continuous outcomes measured at baseline and follow-up only, such as the QIDS-SR16, will be analysed using linear regression with robust SE calculation to account for clustering within GP practice. Continuous outcomes measured weekly will be analysed using mixed linear regression models with a random intercept for GP practice to account for clustering. Both sets of models will include treatment arm as a covariate and will adjust for baseline measure of the outcomes where appropriate. Any missing baseline data will be imputed using mean imputation.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Missing data in weekly outcomes will be accounted for under the missing at random assumption by using the maximum likelihood algorithm to fit the mixed models. We may consider multiple imputation for outcomes measured only at follow-up if post-randomisation variables can be quantified and are related to having missing outcomes. AEs (see the Harms section) will be summarised separately as AEs and SAEs, by intervention group, as number of events and number of people experiencing events.</p>

                <title>Health economics</title>
                <p>The study will not include a formal economic evaluation, instead the focus is on developing the tools needed to support a future trial. First, a meaningful unit cost will be calculated for our tool in collaboration with EMIS. The unit cost will consider the long-term roll-out cost of the intervention and investigate how to allocate this to an individual patient in order to carry out a future cost-effectiveness analysis. Second, the methods for the collection of service use data will be optimised, which will include a comparison of data collected from EMIS and data collected from patients via self-report.</p>

              <title>Limitations</title>
              <p>One limitation of the algorithm is that it does not take pharmacogenomic evidence into account which could be an important refinement in the future, should pharmacogenomic testing become implemented into NHS routine care. For example, both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms affect the liver metabolism of sertraline, escitalopram and citalopram, as well as paroxetine and fluvoxamine.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Therefore one could argue if someone has not responded to or not tolerated citalopram or paroxetine, this carries a higher risk of non-tolerance or non-response of escitalopram and sertraline. Pharmacogenomic effects of liver enzymes, however, are only one of many factors which determine response and tolerance.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> From a pragmatic perspective, it is therefore worth trying escitalopram or sertraline as the first step in the algorithm which is supported by network-meta-analytical evidence.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> CYP2D6 also plays a role in metabolising vortioxetine and mirtazapine, but pharmacogenomic guidelines have not been developed for these to our knowledge.</p>
