                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Dental caries is one of the most prevalent non-communicable disease globally and can have serious health sequelae impacting negatively on quality of life. In the UK most adults experience dental caries during their lifetime and the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey reported that 85% of adults have at least one dental restoration. Conservative removal of tooth tissue for both primary and secondary caries reduces the risk of failure due to tooth-restoration, complex fracture as well as remaining tooth surfaces being less vulnerable to further caries. However, despite its prevalence there is no consensus on how much caries to remove prior to placing a restoration to achieve optimal outcomes. Evidence for selective compared to complete or near-complete caries removal suggests there may be benefits for selective removal in sustaining tooth vitality, therefore avoiding abscess formation and pain, so eliminating the need for more complex and costly treatment or eventual tooth loss. However, the evidence is of low scientific quality and mainly gleaned from studies in primary teeth.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">This is a pragmatic, multi-centre, two-arm patient randomised controlled clinical trial including an internal pilot set in primary dental care in Scotland and England. Dental health professionals will recruit 623 participants over 12-years of age with deep carious lesions in their permanent posterior teeth. Participants will have a single tooth randomised to either the selective caries removal or complete caries removal treatment arm. Baseline measures and outcome data (during the 3-year follow-up period) will be assessed through clinical examination, patient questionnaires and NHS databases. A mixed-method process evaluation will complement the clinical and economic outcome evaluation and examine implementation, mechanisms of impact and context. The primary outcome at three years is sustained tooth vitality. The primary economic outcome is net benefit modelled over a lifetime horizon. Clinical secondary outcomes include pulp exposure, progession of caries, restoration failure; as well as patient-centred and economic outcomes.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par51">Dental caries in permanent teeth is a widespread and costly public health problem. Globally, it is one of the most prevalent non-communicable disease and can have serious health sequelae which can impact negatively on quality of life and productivity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the UK most adults experience dental caries during their lifetime and the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey reported that 85% of adults have at least one restoration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The removal of less tooth tissue for both primary and secondary caries reduces the risk of failure due to tooth-restoration fracture, complex fracture and the surfaces are less vulnerable to further caries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, smaller cavities simplify the operative procedure when placing restorations, so improving their long-term viability.</p>
              <p id="Par52">However, despite the prevalence of this non- communicable disease there is no consensus about how much caries affected tooth tissue to remove prior to placing a filling to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Evidence for selective compared to complete or near-complete caries removal suggests there may be benefits for selective removal in sustaining tooth vitality therefore avoiding abscess formation and pain, and eliminating the need for more complex, costly treatment or eventual tooth loss. However, the evidence is of low scientific quality and mainly gleaned from studies on primary teeth.</p>
              <p id="Par53">The majority of current NHS treatment is managing failed restorations and their consequences moving to increasingly invasive and costly treatments. NHS expenditure on primary and secondary dental care in England approximates to £3.4bn per year, with over one million patient contacts weekly. Many of these contacts relate to treatment of caries. In 2016/17 in England, there were over 7m permanent fillings, over 2m extractions and around 1.5 m endodontic treatments, crowns, inlays or bridges provided to adult NHS patients in primary dental care. The total value of these treatments was about £1.27 bn, with a significant burden on both patients (~£635 m) and the NHS (~£639–£290 m for fee-paying and a further £349 m for exempt patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] . A similar pattern of spend has been observed in Scotland for 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This does not take into account the dental treatment provided in private practice or the costs of NHS treatments delivered in secondary care.</p>
              <p id="Par54">The importance of this topic has been highlighted both by patients and general dental practitioners. General dental practitioners within the Scottish Dental Practice Based Research Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sdpbrn.org.uk/">http://www.sdpbrn.org.uk/</ext-link>) in 2011 voted this as the top research priority. More recently, focus groups and interviews with general dental practitioners followed by a national online survey of dental practitioners, which was conducted as part of this proposal, have established the current importance of the topic and informed the trial design of SCRIPT. The 320 survey participants demonstrated considerable variation in practice with 3% reporting they always perform selective caries removal and 13% reporting they never perform selective carious tissue removal. The primary outcome in the SCRIPT trial was considered to be important by 99% of participants and their free text comments clearly demonstrate the current professional uncertainty around how best to manage patients with deep carious lesions—“<italic>would be willing to use selective caries removal if there was proof it does no harm” and “I'd be very keen to see more research in this area and would put it to use in my day to day practice.”</italic></p>
              <p id="Par55">In this trial, in addition to adults, young people between the ages of 12 years and 15 years will be included because the 2013 UK child dental health survey reported that nearly a half (46%) of 15 year olds and a third (34%) of 12-year-olds had "obvious decay experience" in their permanent teeth<sup>12</sup>. Of these a fifth (19%) of 12-year-olds and 15-year-olds (21%) had decay into dentine requiring treatment. Toothache was experienced by 18% of 12-year-olds and 15% of 15-year-olds. This suggests that the burden of dental caries is very high in this group and therefore including this age group in the trial would generate evidence of acceptability and potential issues related to actual treatment provision. Such evidence would help the dental practitioners in primary care to adopt minimally invasive approaches to carious tissue removal especially when the recent EU directive has recommended not to use amalgam fillings in under 15-year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par56">This was further highlighted by a research priority setting exercise conducted with patients at a general dental practice in Derbyshire with the greatest potential benefit seen for the young people. A Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group at the Health Services Research Unit (HSRU) in Aberdeen felt that development of such conservative techniques was very important as they could improve both the health and dental experience of patients. Overall, new evidence investigating whether a procedure involving sealing in decay in reduces the chances of teeth being lost and reduces the chance of painful episodes and further complex treatment like root canal treatment would be important and welcomed by patients.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Randomised controlled clinical trials and systematic reviews have concluded that selective caries removal (SCR) may offer benefits, but the evidence on managing deep caries in permanent teeth is weak and biased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Schwendicke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found a significant risk reduction for pulp exposure (OR 0.31 [0.19–0.49]), but pulp symptoms (OR 0.58 [0.31–1.10]) and risk of restoration failure (OR 0.97 [0.64–1.46]) were inconclusive (n=1,257). Similarly, for selective caries removal, Ricketts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] found a significant risk reduction for pulp exposure (OR 0.23 [0.08–0.69]), but again pulp symptoms (OR 0.27 [0.05–1.60]) and risk of failure were inconclusive (n=345 in the partial caries analysis of primary and permanent teeth). Quality of the evidence is judged to be poor scientifically and most of the included studies were conducted solely on children with short term follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], used less durable materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] or included more aggressive complete caries removal (CCR) interventions to “hard” dentine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] than would be present in UK NHS.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Bjørndal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] followed-up for 5 years a 2-staged (stepwise) carious tissue removal protocol on lesions spreading into the pulpal quarter of dentine (n=239). Pulp exposure rate was lower in this stepwise removal protocol (21.2% vs. 35.5%; p = 0.014) and more successful (60.2% vs 46.3%) (p = 0.031) when pulp exposures were classed as failure. The trial has limited generalizability to SCRIPT’s context and patients: it recruited participants with more severe caries and its two interventions differed from SCRIPT’s. Their partial approach (2-step) was similar to CCR; their CCR approach was more aggressive than the one we propose to use, excavating “hard” dentine. Therefore, more evidence is needed about the performance of a minimally invasive option of SCR in the NHS and about whether dentists will adopt it. There is one ongoing trial in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] looking at this research question in a secondary care setting. Personal communication with the trial team confirmed they had experienced a merger (contamination) of the two technologies (i.e. the two techniques undertaken by an individual dentist tended to become more similar dependent upon their initial skills and preferences). The trial has had more than 30% loss to follow-up. The authors believe that is due to the secondary care setting where patients are usually transient and short term. Our research robustly monitors and minimises the risk of the technologies merging, and most patient participants are routine attenders at their dental practice.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Therefore, this research is important to establish whether SCR will sustain tooth vitality and reduce the need for complex, costly treatment including root canal treatment, crowns, extractions, bridgework or implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition to potential cost savings, this reduced treatment need would be expected to improve quality of life and reduce anxiety and stress.</p>
              <p id="Par60">The risk to participants is low as both treatments are utilised in NHS practice albeit that SCR is relatively under-employed. For SCR, which is a minimally invasive treatment, the perceived risk is the residual caries alone may lead to further deterioration of the tooth. The risks from CCR are already managed within existing dental practice so the trial does not impose any new risks. Risk in both arms will be monitored as part of the trial as the primary and some secondary outcomes directly measure the impact of each treatment.</p>

Part 2a involves posting 3D plastic teeth to the dentists to complete the trial interventions and returning a selected pair of teeth to the trial clinical team for validation and to check adherence to protocol. In cases where further training was required this was followed up by individual zoom discussion, feedback and further practice on 3D printed teeth.</p>

Trial clinicians will identify patients at routine visits that meet the inclusion criteria and explain the trial. Eligible patients who express interest will be given a participant information leaflet (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and an appointment for their treatment as per current clinical practice. At the treatment visit the patient will be given the opportunity to clarify any questions prior to informed consent being obtained and recorded on a written consent form (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
                  <p id="Par86">The eligibility of all participants will be assessed and determined by their dental practitioner following clinical and radiographic examination according to pre-determined criteria. Those who do not wish to take part will receive caries removal and restoration as per current practice. Those who are eligible and wish to take part will give informed consent to the clinician providing treatment.</p>
                  <p id="Par87">A baseline questionnaire will be completed by the participant to collect baseline patient centered outcomes. Randomisation will then take place using an online randomisation system. If the participant has more than one eligible tooth, a trial tooth will be selected at random by the randomisation application. The randomisation algorithm will use recruitment site, number of eligible teeth (1; &gt; 1) and type of caries (primary and secondary) as minimisation covariates to allocate to treatment intervention and control groups in a ratio of 1:1To maintain participant blinding, participants will not be informed of their allocated treatment group following randomisation. Baseline clinical information will be recorded by the clinician after the treatment has been provided.</p>

SCRiPT will investigate whether giving participants a welcome letter on entry to the trial improves questionnaire response rates and retention across the trial’s follow-up. The letter will welcome participants to the trial, reiterate the participant journey (summarising information provided in the patient information leaflet), identify the location of the participant’s study tooth and list the expectations for participation i.e. the need to return the trial questionnaires. Allocation to receive or not receive the letter will be randomised following recruitment into the trial by the trial office and will be 1:1. The intervention group will be issued with a letter within 2 months of consent to participate. The control group will not be issued with a letter.</p>

                <title>Sample size calculation</title>
                <p id="Par146">The sample size calculation is event-based. We aim to detect an absolute improvement in sustained tooth vitality at three years of 12% from 80% (CCR) to 92% (SCR). The control rate of 80% is based upon the existing evidence base, clinical experience and confirmed by Scottish tooth-level routine data. As described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref> above, the current evidence base gives rates of pulpal exposure that are higher than those seen in UK NHS and therefore our rate of sustained tooth vitality will be higher than observed in those studies. Bjørndal 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] presented a tooth vitality rate of approximately 80% at 3 years for two-step selective restoration in lesions that were deeper than those in this trial. The two-step procedure is more similar to a CCR than the SCR in our trial. The Scottish tooth specific data demonstrated that of 459,648 teeth that required a three surface restoration in 2013, 6.6% had received further endodontic treatment or were extracted at 3 years follow-up. These teeth however, could be at any level of dentine involvement and it is not possible to identify the level of involvement in the routine data. Therefore, as the study is interested in only teeth with involvement in the pulpal third of dentine, it has been estimated that the number of events may be three times larger. There is little empirical evidence to inform the expected size of an important effect. A target difference of 12% was judged clinically important and plausible by both dentists and PPI partners. The target difference of 12% was also informed by the difference observed in Bjørndal 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] which was 13.7% at 5 years. However, as this is a patient RCT there are concerns around contamination (participants receive the intervention that they were not randomly allocated to). The team conservatively have allowed for up to 25% contamination and therefore the sample size for SCRiPT aims to detect an absolute improvement of 9%; from 83 to 92% at three years. Recruitment of 623 participants (71 events) will detect a hazard ratio of 0.42 between experimental and control strategies and provide, using the log-rank test, assuming an exponential failure rate, 90% power at a 2-sided 5% significance level. The calculation also assumes 17 months of recruitment, a minimum of 33 months of follow-up and a 30% follow-up attrition at the end of year three. Recruitment is assumed to be staggered and builds in seasonal variation. We used the Stata package ARTSURV for calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par153">Participants with no event will be censored at their last visit with sustained tooth vitality. It is anticipated that a small proportion of participants will not return at all, and a further proportion will be censored early in the trial because they do not come back to their clinician. The team will consider how robust the findings are to these missing data using multiple imputation approaches under an assumption of missing at random, and using pattern mixture models if appropriate. In participants with more than one eligible tooth, we will repeat our primary analysis with a clustering effect for participant.</p>

This will include a trial-based analysis at three years follow-up and a decision model to assess economic value over an extrapolated lifetime horizon. The primary economic outcome will be net benefit, WTP minus cost (NHS and patient perspective) evaluated in a cost–benefit analysis (CBA) framework, modelled over a lifetime horizon. CBA is chosen as the preferred framework because of concerns that generic QALY measures are not sufficiently sensitive to capture the value of important outcomes in dental care. Cost Utility Analysis (CUA) reporting cost per QALY will also be conducted as a secondary economic analysis to comply with NICE guidelines for technology appraisal.</p>

                <title>Estimation of costs</title>
                <p id="Par161">Routinely collected dental claims data will be used to assess the costs to the NHS, and co-charges to patients of NHS provided dental treatments. Routine datasets will be supplemented with data collected using CRFs in the dental practice at each visit. Remaining resource use data, NHS and patient perspective costs directly related to dental problems will be collected using patient questionnaires. NHS costs of providing SCR and CCR will be based on the appropriate NHS contract-based payments to clinicians in the respective UK regions for the base case analysis. Contract payments detail the cost burden to the NHS but may not capture the full opportunity cost of time spent and materials used to deliver the interventions. Therefore, a micro-costing approach will also be used as a secondary analysis. Resource use data for the intervention micro-costing will include staff resource use and time, and consumables with information collected in a detailed CRF at the point of intervention delivery. Patient perspective costs will include patient co-charges for NHS treatments, time and travel costs, time-off work, privately purchased care and self-purchased dental care products. The participant time and travel cost questionnaire will be sent to a random sample (N = 347) of trial participants. The required sample reflects the minimum number of respondents contributing complete data that is required to enable a multi-variable regression to estimate costs according to a range of predictor characteristics of the sample. The minimum sample size is calculated from the formula N ≥ 50 + 8(k) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] where k is the number of independent categories of the model assuming linear additive effects and no interactions. For k = 15 explanatory variables in the model, the minimum number of fully complete responses to the questionnaire is N ≥ 50 + 8(15) ≥ 170. Assuming a questionnaire non-response rate of 30% and a further item non-response rate that would preclude running the model of 30% of returned questionnaires (as per the IQuaD study), the minimum number of questionnaires that need to be sent to obtain the required sample is N = 347 (170/0.7/0.7). The questionnaire will be administered to a random sample of respondents split across the one and two-year annual follow-up time-points. The information collected will also be used to validate an external prediction model of time and travel costs that can be used in future research. Incremental NHS and patient perspective costs for SCR vs CCR will be estimated using generalised linear regression models with appropriate specification of distributions for cost and outcomes data and adjustment for baseline covariates.</p>

                <p id="Par162">Willingness to pay (WTP) for the cost–benefit analysis (CBA) will be elicited from a discrete choice experiment (DCE). The DCE will be conducted with a nationally representative sample of the UK general population, using online panel surveys. The DCE will explicitly value preferences for provision of SCR and CCR, together with a range of plausible outcomes from the trial (e.g. sustained tooth vitality, longer term risk of repeat treatments and tooth loss). The DCE will examine the trade-offs between the potential benefits and risks of different treatment strategies. A cost attribute will be included to enable calculation of WTP. The DCE will also be used to assess the acceptability of SCR and CCR and predict uptake according to patient characteristics (investigating issues of preference heterogeneity for treatment). The target sample size for the DCE (N = 1067) is calculated using Dillman, 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], using an estimate of the population of interest (i.e. the UK general adult population) =  ~ 52 million), a conservative estimate of variation in the answers for the question of interest of 0.5, and an assumed margin of error of 3% in line with public opinion research, with a confidence level of 95%. A further sample of 100 respondents will be sought for a pilot study of the DCE. As a secondary objective, we will measure benefits in terms of QALYs gained, based on patient responses to the generic EQ-5D-5L health related quality of life measure.</p>

                <p id="Par163">Economic evaluations typically take the form of cost-utility (i.e. cost per QALY). However, in the context of dentistry, there are concerns that generic EQ-5D based QALYs lack the sensitivity to capture the processes and outcomes of care that are of value to patients and decision makers. Different perspectives of benefits will therefore be evaluated (Willingness to pay (WTP) for the interventions and outcomes, WTP for dental health outcomes only, and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Costs will be evaluated from an NHS dental, all NHS, and participant perspective. Costs and benefits will be combined to estimate incremental net benefit (WTP minus costs), incremental net dental health benefit, and incremental cost per QALY gained for SCR vs, CCR over the three year trial follow up period. Deterministic sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to test the impact of assumptions and analysis methods on results. Subgroup analysis will be conducted at the region level if data allow in order to explore the potential impact of different payment systems across the UK regions on results.

The model will be built as a cohort model, but we will retain the option to move to a more flexible micro-simulation model if appropriate. Results will be reported using the same net benefit framework as the within trial analysis. The final model structure and health state definition (e.g. loss of tooth vitality, tooth-restoration-complex failure, caries progression, and tooth loss) will be developed in conjunction with dental and patient experts. Survival analysis methodology will be used to assess the time to transition between health states, with survival curves fitted over an extended time frame (patient’s life time) to extrapolate the time to event data from the trial. The survival analysis will be supplemented with data from cohort studies and literature reviews to complete population of model transition probabilities and relative effects as required. Cost data (NHS and patient perspective) for health states will be sourced from the trial data and routine data sources (PHS / BSA). Benefits in terms of WTP will be sourced directly from the DCE for specific health states (e.g. WTP to avoid loss of tooth vitality, tooth-restoration-complex failure, caries progression or tooth loss), together with WTP tariffs from previously conducted DCE studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Sensitivity analyses will explore the impact of key assumptions on results. Gaps in the evidence base will be identified and their potential impact on efficiency (net benefit) explored through sensitivity analysis.

A Trial Management Committee will meet annually and be chaired by the Principal Investigators and include co-investigators and key members of the TCOD and CHaRT. Their remit will be to oversee the progress of the trial, and they will report to the independent TSC.</p>

                <p id="Par191">The findings of the trial will be disseminated widely through professional, primary care, public and scientific routes. The results of the trial will be communicated directly to all participating dental practices who will be invited to attend the SCRiPT conference to showcase the results and work done by the practitioners involved. The results of the trial will be used to update Cochrane reviews and clinical guidelines as published by NICE, SIGN and Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme and the online training resource will be made available to learning institutions across the UK. In addition, it is hoped to produce a range of actionable knowledge tools to encourage implementation of the trial results. The cost effectiveness elements of SCRiPT and patient related outcomes will be of high importance to the NHS policy and decision makers, including the UK’s four Chief Dental Officers and as such this trial has the potential to impact decision making for the general dental community both nationally and internationally. To enable this research to be embedded as an output and impact on future decision making we will draw on the extensive networks of the research team who are well connected, respected and cover a vast number of professional fields and demonstrate our ability to actively participate in creating a Global Evidence Ecosystem for Oral Health as aspired to by the MAGIC Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Many of the research team members are part of the academic teaching community for both national and international undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Through formal and informal channels and established teaching community networks, we will actively encourage Dental Schools to embed the research findings and clinical implications into teaching.</p>

              <title>Milestones for the SCRiPT trial</title>
              <p id="Par192">Dental practice recruitment began at month 3. Patient recruitment has been delayed due to the effects of COVID-19 and has therefore not commenced on time. We predict that patient recruitment will take place over an 18-month period. Follow up assessments will take place three years after recruitment and delivery of intervention.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par193">The SCRiPT Trial is an NIHR HTA funded trial being undertaken across the UK and will begin to address the lack of high-quality evidence to aid dental practitioners, patients and policy makers in their decision making. As a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomised, open trial with blinded outcome evaluation, SCRiPT aims to eradicate the uncertainty that exists among dental practitioners when treating deep carious lesions by testing the interventions in the environment that they will most often be delivered in, dental primary care.</p>
              <p id="Par194">In order to ensure the results of this trial are widely applicable the geographical areas that are included in the SCRiPT Trial have been selected to yield a cross-section of practices, operating in a range of different environments and circumstances (e.g. high, middle or low income communities, rural and urban, method of remuneration for GDPs (capitation and fee for item of service or a banded payment system based on Units of Dental Activity (UDA)).</p>
              <p id="Par195">The study team is multidisciplinary and broad-based, and will be led by the teams at the Dental Health Services Research Unit, Dundee and the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials in Aberdeen. This will ensure that whilst the trial design and conduct is of the highest standard, it remains practical and pragmatic at all times.
