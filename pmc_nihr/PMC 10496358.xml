                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Approximately one in ten women have high blood pressure during pregnancy. Hypertension is associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, and as treatment improves maternal outcomes, antihypertensive treatment is recommended. Previous trials have been unable to provide a definitive answer on which antihypertensive treatment is associated with optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes and the need for robust evidence evaluating maternal and infant benefits and risks remains an important, unanswered question for research and clinical communities.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The Giant PANDA study is a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of a treatment initiation strategy with nifedipine (calcium channel blocker), versus labetalol (mixed alpha/beta blocker) in 2300 women with pregnancy hypertension. The primary objective is to evaluate if treatment with nifedipine compared to labetalol in women with pregnancy hypertension reduces severe maternal hypertension without increasing fetal or neonatal death or neonatal unit admission. Subgroup analyses will be undertaken by hypertension type (chronic, gestational, pre-eclampsia), diabetes (yes, no), singleton (yes, no), self-reported ethnicity (Black, all other), and gestational age at randomisation categories (11 + 0 to 19 + 6, 20 + 0 to 27 + 6, 28 + 0 to 34 + 6 weeks). A cost-effectiveness analysis using an NHS perspective will be undertaken using a cost-consequence analysis up to postnatal hospital discharge and an extrapolation exercise with a lifetime horizon conditional on the results of the cost-consequence analysis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <sec id="Sec3">
                <title>Background and rationale {6a}</title>
                <p id="Par23">Approximately 1 in 10 women have hypertension or high blood pressure in pregnancy. This includes chronic (pre-existing, typically essential) and gestational (new from 20 weeks’ gestation) hypertension and pre-eclampsia (hypertension with additional features of maternal multi-organ or uteroplacental involvement). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in particular pre-eclampsia, are associated with substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par24">Treatment with antihypertensives is typically offered to pregnant women to lower blood pressure and prevent progression to severe hypertension, known to be associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The 2018 Cochrane systematic review of antihypertensive trials in pregnancy included data from 58 trials and 5909 women. It concluded that treatment benefit is such that no further research is needed on treatment versus no treatment, noting that the use of any antihypertensive drug (versus placebo or no antihypertensive drug) halves the risk of developing severe hypertension (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40–0.60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A trial published since this systematic review demonstrated a significant reduction in pre-eclampsia (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.89) and preterm birth (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.99) in women actively treated for mild chronic hypertension compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It further concluded that future research should be high-quality, large-sized, randomised controlled trials focused on the head-to-head assessment of antihypertensive drugs. Only two trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with a total of 354 women, compared the top two antihypertensive treatments recommended across international guidelines, namely labetalol (a mixed alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blocker) and nifedipine (calcium channel blocker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A network meta-analysis, published since the commencement of recruitment to this trial, confirmed the reduction in severe hypertension with both agents versus no therapy and recommended that further information from a variety of sources should be obtained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A feasibility study (not powered for clinical outcomes) found a 7.4 mmHg (− 0.4 to − 14.4) reduction in central aortic pressure with nifedipine (vs. labetalol), but definitive evidence for superiority of one agent over another remains to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par26">First-line therapy across international guidelines is typically labetalol or nifedipine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with no advice on tailoring of drug therapy for ethnicity, as recommended out of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) pregnancy Hypertension guideline advises labetalol as first-line treatment based on its license for use in pregnancy, with a research recommendation to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of antihypertensives (in head-to-head trials) in improving maternal and perinatal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">The Giant Pregnancy ANtihypertensive Drugs: which Agent is best? (PANDA) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR128721">https://fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR128721</ext-link> study aims to compare a treatment strategy of nifedipine versus labetalol in women with pregnancy hypertension. It addresses a research recommendation first published by NICE in 2010 and reiterated in the 2019 update [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Our study is also informed by the findings of a four-centre feasibility study (ISRCTN40973936) and developed by a multidisciplinary team with outcomes chosen by patient and public involvement. This study is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Technology Assessment programme and has been approved by the Health Research Authority and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, together with NHS Trust Research and Development Offices for each site.</p>

              <p id="Par28">The objective of this study is to address the research question: “In women with pregnancy hypertension (Population), what is the effect of treatment with nifedipine (Intervention) versus labetalol (Comparator) on severe maternal hypertension (Outcome) and a composite of fetal or neonatal death, or neonatal unit admissions (Outcome)?”.</p>

              <title>Trial design {8}</title>
              <p id="Par34">The Giant PANDA study is a pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre, two-arm randomised controlled trial of treatment with nifedipine versus labetalol by random allocation (1:1) in women with pregnancy hypertension, with two co-primary outcomes: a maternal outcome assessing superiority and a fetal/neonatal outcome assessing non-inferiority. Women who decline randomisation or are unable to be randomised (meeting any of the exclusion criteria detailed below) are offered participation in an observational study, involving data collection only.</p>
              <p id="Par35">The study is anticipated to take around 48 months to complete. This timeline accounts for study set-up, internal pilot, main trial recruitment, follow-up for all women and babies, data analysis, and write-up. An embedded internal pilot is expected to be run in approximately 17 sites over 10 months to assess recruitment and retention rates, acceptability, and implementation. Provided the pre-specified progression criteria are satisfactorily met, recruitment to the main trial would proceed with no break (or interim data analysis) and data from the pilot and main trial analysed together.</p>

Potential participants are provided with information on the study, both verbally from a member of the research team and written via the participant information leaflet. They are given the opportunity to ask any questions they may have and then provided with appropriate time to decide whether they wish to participate. Provided the woman is happy to participate, an appropriately trained healthcare professional (who is Good Clinical Practice (GCP) trained and designated to take consent by the site principal investigator) obtains informed consent before performing any study-related procedures. For trial participants, this follows confirmation of eligibility by a medically qualified individual. Study participation and information on the prescription of the study antihypertensive drug is documented in the handheld paper or electronic maternity record as in usual clinical care, as the standard way of communicating with general practitioners and other relevant healthcare professionals.</p>

                <title>Explanation for the choice of comparators {6b}</title>
                <p id="Par50">The comparator is oral labetalol (no brand specified) which is currently recommended as the first-choice treatment for pregnancy hypertension by NICE guidance in England.</p>

                <title>Intervention description {11a}</title>
                <p id="Par51">The intervention is nifedipine modified-release preparations (no brand specified), which is listed as an acceptable alternative in NICE guidance.</p>
                <p id="Par52">The starting dose for both the intervention and comparator is left to the discretion of the responsible healthcare professional. Sites are asked to follow standard NICE care pathways, for the management of pregnancy hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Apart from the trial treatment allocated at randomisation, all other aspects of clinical management are entirely at the discretion of the local healthcare team. This includes any up- or down-titration, switching, or adding to the randomised antihypertensive drug ensuring that women are effectively and safely treated. All aspects of both interventions are open label.</p>

                <title>Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions {11b}</title>
                <p id="Par53">Discontinuation of allocated treatment (stopping or switching antihypertensive treatment) is a common part of usual clinical care during pregnancy (either at the request of the woman, or the clinician), and a woman can continue in the study, for collection of perinatal and maternal outcome data, after discontinuation of treatment. Women are able to withdraw consent for further contact at any time without giving a reason and with no effect on their (or their baby’s) ongoing care. Women continue to receive usual clinical care if they withdraw from the study.</p>

                <title>Strategies to improve adherence to interventions {11c}</title>
                <p id="Par54">As a pragmatic trial, standard clinical advice on adherence to antihypertensives is provided by the prescribing healthcare professional with no additional specific trial advice given. Information on women’s adherence to the antihypertensive medication is captured via participant-completed online surveys at 2 weeks after consent and monthly thereafter.</p>

                <p id="Par55">The Giant PANDA study is embedded in usual clinical care and thus woman can receive concomitant care as clinically required and participate in any other observational study. Co-enrolment in other trials is considered, discussed, and agreed upon by the trial management group.</p>

                <p id="Par56">As antihypertensive treatment is commonly switched immediately after birth, outcomes are collected up to primary hospital discharge or 28 days post-birth, whichever occurs soonest. The decision to continue or switch antihypertensive drugs after birth sits entirely with the clinicians within the woman’s usual care team.</p>

Using data from the Control of Hypertension In Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) trial and the PANDA feasibility study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the control group event rate for fetal or neonatal death or neonatal unit admission was 25%. A sample size of 2190 babies would have 90% power to detect a non-inferiority margin of 6%, with a 2.5% one-sided significance level. Assuming approximately 1.5% of pregnancies are multi-fetal (Office for National Statistics), a sample size of 2190 women would provide a conservative estimate for the number of babies required to address the hypothesis for the fetal/neonatal co-primary outcome. Due to the anticipated small proportion of multi-fetal pregnancies, this sample size would also allow for the dependence between outcomes for infants from the same pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par173">A separate health economics analysis plan will be produced and will provide a more comprehensive description of the planned health economic analyses. A brief outline of these analyses is given below.</p>
                <p id="Par174">An economic evaluation will be conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of nifedipine compared to labetalol from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Our clinical hypothesis is that nifedipine will outperform labetalol in terms of reducing the incidence of severe systolic hypertension among pregnant women. Additionally, we hypothesise that the co-primary fetal/neonatal outcome will be non-inferior in the nifedipine group. Hence, we also anticipate no significant difference in costs for neonatal care between the two groups, but potential variations in costs and maternal health-related quality of life in favour of nifedipine due to better systolic blood pressure control throughout the trial period.</p>
                <p id="Par175">To demonstrate these hypotheses, we will collect data on healthcare resource utilisation for mothers during the trial period and for babies after delivery. For mothers, we will review case notes to gather information on antenatal care (including outpatient visits and hospital admissions prior to delivery), care received during delivery, and the duration of hospital stay post-delivery. Regarding babies, we will record the number of inpatient days categorised by the level of care required (high, medium, or low) after delivery. Unit costs for valuing the healthcare provided will be obtained from national references. We will assess maternal health-related quality of life at various time points using the EQ-5D-5L instrument: at trial entry, 2 weeks after randomisation, and every 4 weeks until the expected delivery date. The utility scores for EQ-5D-5L states will be derived from value sets currently being evaluated by the NICE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], with the expectation of a final value set being available when the economic evaluation is analysed. To provide initial insights into the need for further extrapolation, we will initially present a cost-consequence analysis of the primary and secondary clinical outcomes, along with maternal quality of life and the costs associated with mother-baby pairs until the primary hospital discharge or 28 days post-birth.</p>
                <p id="Par176">Complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia) associated with hypertension during pregnancy are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and affect long-term life expectancy, health-related quality of life, and costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, if the trial demonstrates that nifedipine can better control hypertension during pregnancy, there is potential to reduce associated complications and mitigate the long-term risks of cardiovascular disease, either for all women or specific sub-groups. In such a scenario, we will consider employing decision analytic modelling to examine costs and maternal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime horizon, enabling a cost-utility analysis. This model will depict the disease progression of women with elevated blood pressure following delivery, incorporating cardiovascular events over time. Observed risk factors, quality of life estimates, and healthcare resource utilisation data from our trial will inform the characteristics of a hypothetical cohort for each drug therapy within the model. The model will be adapted from an existing economic model developed as part of the BUMP studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To inform health states over time, we will extract information on maternal quality of life and costs from relevant literature sources. Costs and outcomes will be synthesised using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as the cost per QALY gained between the two therapies.</p>
                <p id="Par177">When interpreting and reporting this economic evaluation, we will adhere to current guidelines, giving special attention to addressing uncertainty in the within-trial and the decision analytical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par205">The central trial team monitors recruitment, provides study-related training, and monitors the quality of the data collected. The site research team is responsible for undertaking all trial-related activities at their recruiting site. The Giant PANDA study has been classed as a type A, low-risk, trial. This is comparable to the risk of standard medical care as both treatments are routinely used in clinical practice.</p>
                <p id="Par206">Given the low-risk nature of this study, central monitoring is routine, and onsite monitoring is triggered, or as required, as documented in the sponsor/quality management group-approved monitoring plan. The central trial team are in regular contact with the site research team to check on progress and address any queries. Trial staff regularly check the quality of the data collected for compliance with the protocol, data consistency, and completeness. The study data manager sends sites data clarification queries requesting missing data or clarification of inconsistencies or discrepancies. Additional on-site monitoring visits would be triggered, for example by poor electronic case report forms return. The PI must permit trial-related monitoring, audits, ethical review, and regulatory inspection(s) at their site, providing direct access to source data and documents.</p>

Monthly newsletters and site teleconferences provide a platform to communicate across sites, with discussions inclusive of recruitment progress and sharing challenges and good practices.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par209">As detailed above (in the ‘<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Trial design {8}</xref>’ section), the Giant PANDA study was initiated at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial design had already been streamlined for efficient delivery, including a pragmatic design, electronic case report forms, electronic participant completed questionnaires, electronic consent with a remote option, no additional study visits, usual clinical care prescriptions, and follow-up within clinical care, with a supportive central research team with trial-related training delivered online. These strategies were intended to reduce the burden to the site team; however, the practical issues of operating within the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic caused initial delays to the study timeline. Outside of pregnancy, prescribing decision are influenced by family origin or ethnicity across many hypertension guidelines. In order to address this, our analysis will seek to understand if tailoring blood pressure medication by ethnicity could improve outcomes for pregnant women and their babies, given the disproportionate burden and increased risk of adverse outcomes in women from ethnic minority backgrounds.</p>
              <p id="Par210">This study aims to fill the gap in the evidence and establish whether one drug or another is better for the woman (i.e. superior) and whether the outcomes for the infant are not worse (i.e. not inferior), adding to the sparse evidence on which women and clinicians share decision-making, with the trial results likely to influence clinical practice directly and via guideline changes.</p>

The trial received approval from MHRA on 16 December 2020 and HRA on 17 December 2020 (REC approval was granted on 3 November 2020). The trial opened to recruitment in June 2021, with the first participant recruited on 7 June 2021 and is estimated to complete recruitment by summer 2024.</p>
