                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Teenage pregnancy remains a worldwide health concern which is an outcome of, and contributor to, health inequalities. The need for gender-aware interventions with a focus on males in addressing teenage pregnancy has been highlighted as a global health need by WHO and identified in systematic reviews of (relationship and sexuality education (RSE)). This study aims to test the effectiveness of an interactive film-based RSE intervention, which draws explicit attention to the role of males in preventing an unintended pregnancy by reducing unprotected heterosexual teenage sex among males and females under age 16 years.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>A phase III cluster randomised trial with embedded process and economic evaluations. <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> encompasses a culturally sensitive interactive film, classroom materials, a teacher-trainer session and parent animations and will be delivered to replace some of the usual RSE for the target age group in schools in the intervention group. Schools in the control group will not receive the intervention and will continue with usual RSE. Participants will not be blinded to allocation. Schools are the unit of randomisation stratified per country and socioeconomic status. We aim to recruit 66 UK schools (24 in Northern Ireland; 14 in each of England, Scotland and Wales), including approximately 7900 pupils. A questionnaire will be administered at baseline and at 12–14 months postintervention. The primary outcome is reported unprotected sex, a surrogate measure associated with unintended teenage pregnancy. Secondary outcomes include knowledge, attitudes, skills and intentions relating to avoiding teenage pregnancy in addition to frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse, contraception use and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Teenage pregnancy remains a worldwide health concern and is both an outcome of, and contributor to, inequalities in health.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The UK has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in Western Europe.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While conception rates for girls aged under 18 years have halved since 1998 in England and Wales, and now stand at 21.0 per 1000 population,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> it remains that just over 20 000 teenage women under 18 years became pregnant in England and Wales in 2015 and approximately half of these ended in legal abortion.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The conception rate for Scotland was 32.4 per 1000 in 2015.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In Northern Ireland (NI), abortion is illegal and is only considered lawful in exceptional circumstances where the life of the pregnant woman is at immediate risk or if there is a risk of serious injury to her physical or mental health. Reflecting this different legal framework, government targets around reducing teenage pregnancies in NI relate to births and not conceptions. In NI, the birth rate for teenage mothers per 1000 young women aged 13–19 years was 11.3 in 2013.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the same year, the teenage birth rate in the most deprived areas was 23.0 per 1000, nearly six times that of the least deprived areas in NI (3.9 per 1000).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p>
              <p>Although the life course for teenage parents is not universally negative,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> the social disadvantage and exclusion that are linked to teenage pregnancy are considered problematic.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Unintended teenage pregnancy can lead to considerable adverse health problems for teenagers and their infants as well as generating emotional, social and economic costs for them, their families and society.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> While unintended teenage pregnancy is a complex phenomenon that cannot be prevented through relationship and sexuality education (RSE) alone,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10–16</xref> high-quality RSE is an essential component in the process of reducing unintended pregnancy rates, as well as being a vital aspect of improving holistic sexual health and well-being.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17–21</xref> The UK governments all emphasise the policy importance of decreasing under-18 conception rates and increasing sexual health precaution behaviours in teenagers via the implementation of RSE in schools as a key objective in their current sexual health policies.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22–24</xref></p>
              <p>Several systematic reviews have identified the characteristics of effective RSE programmes, which help increase their impact on sexual risk-taking behaviours.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25–31</xref> These include the use of theoretically based interventions targeting sexual and psychosocial-mediating variables such as knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, intentions, perceptions of risk and perceptions of peer norms which are linked to sexual behaviour change; the use of culturally sensitive and gender-specific interventions; the use of interactive modalities which promote personal identification with the educational issues and engagement of young people; the use of skills-building components; the involvement of parents in the RSE process and facilitating linkages with support services. However, teenage boys have usually been neglected in relation to RSE, particularly with respect to teenage pregnancy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 32–36</xref> The lack of gender-sensitive interventions which acknowledge the potential influence of gender in successfully engaging both males and females in addressing teenage pregnancy has been highlighted as a global health need by WHO<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref> and identified in systematic reviews of RSE.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 35 40 41</xref></p>
              <p>The <italic>If I were Jack</italic> teacher-led classroom-based RSE intervention represents an innovative combination of the effective characteristics identified in the above-mentioned systematic reviews. It is aimed at both teenage boys and girls but with explicit attention drawn to the role of teenage boys in preventing an unintended teenage pregnancy. A specific aim of <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> is to encourage scrutiny of the gender norms, which typically situate the issue of a teenage pregnancy as a woman’s problem, by placing emphasis on teenage male perspectives while not excluding teenage female perspectives. The <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> intervention is predicted to decrease young people’s sexual risk-taking behaviour in relation to avoiding teenage pregnancy and to promote positive sexual health.</p>
              <p>We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the <italic>If I Were Jack</italic>, RSE intervention in reducing rates of unprotected sex among teenagers under 16 years of age and to better understand the contextual conditions through a process evaluation. The intervention will be delivered to replace some of usual RSE in the intervention group. Schools in the control group will not receive the intervention and will continue to deliver RSE according to their current and existing practices, including meeting their statutory curriculum requirements. This is a pragmatic comparator reflecting typical routine practice, which allows for comparison of the intervention with the existing RSE experience.</p>

                <p>The JACK trial is a phase III multicentre, parallel-group cluster randomised trial (cRCT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Schools are the unit of randomisation with a 1:1 allocation. The study design has an embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation.

                <p>The trial will take place in 66 secondary level schools in the UK (24 in NI and 14 each in England, Scotland and Wales). The whole of NI is included but, for reasons of practicality, convenience and cost, representative geographical restrictions will be in place in England (Greater London area), Scotland (mainland Scotland) and Wales (South Wales). The intervention will be delivered by teachers, as part of the Key Stage 4 Personal and Health Education curriculum (NI, England and Wales) and in Scotland as part of the Curriculum for Excellence Relationships, Sexual Health and Parenthood education.</p>

                <title>Public involvement</title>
                <p>Public involvement in the design of the <italic>If I were Jack</italic> intervention has been facilitated by a Young People’s Advisory Group (YPAG) composed of members from each of the four nations of the UK. The group of 20 members aged 14–16 years and their designated youth workers was brought together for a facilitated discussion about the intervention during one weekend in Cardiff in April 2017. The group contributed especially to production decisions for the interactive video drama. This YPAG also read and commented on the questionnaire and pupil information sheet remotely. In the earlier feasibility trial, we had consulted extensively with pupils about the questionnaire.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The intervention and trial design has also been informed by a Trial Stakeholders Group. This group is composed of relationship and sexuality education experts and teachers and senior representatives from key statutory organisations and government departments from all four nations of the UK. Finally, the trial design has been informed by a Trial Steering Group, composed of methodological experts, pupils, teachers and school principals/head teachers. All three groups will continue to advise the research team throughout the trial. Dissemination to schools will first involve discussion with schools and our YPAG involving regular updates and final reports. Our research team across the four nations will disseminate at talks aimed at the public and policymakers in all four jurisdictions and a lay summary will be made available on our Jack trial website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/if-i-were-jack/">http://www.qub.ac.uk/sites/if-i-were-jack/</ext-link></p>

                  <p>Eligible pupils are the 2018/2019 academic year pupil cohort (all classes within) in year 11 in NI, S3 in Scotland and year 10 in England and Wales (mean age 14). This year group has been selected for a number of reasons. First, proximal risk factors of teenage pregnancy begin manifesting in this age group,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 44</xref> making it an appropriate time for preventative sex education that is considered acceptable in society and education.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 27 45</xref> Second, there is an identified deficit in resources for this age group in relation to teenage pregnancy,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46 47</xref> and third, findings from the JACK feasibility study<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> indicated that there is a greater opportunity for implementation of the intervention during a year where there are no statutory examinations. Finally, this population has been chosen to facilitate a 12–14 months follow-up of pupils (postintervention) before some pupils exit formal education following their first major statutory exams or reaching the age of 16 years.</p>

                <title>Sample size</title>
                <p>The sample size calculation is based on UK-wide data<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48 49</xref> demonstrating that between 25% and 33% of 15 years old are having sex and the proportion of 15 years old reporting unprotected sex is 2.8% (overall in NI, England, Scotland and Wales). The study will be powered to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence of unprotected sex (from expected rate of 2.8% to 1.4%) by 15 years of age. Such a difference of 1.4% in unprotected sex has been shown to have a meaningful impact on pregnancy rates.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 50–52</xref> The between-group difference in the incidence of unprotected sex of 1.3% (95% CI 0.5% to 2.2%) by 9 months in our feasibility trial<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> demonstrates that such an effect size is plausible and is consistent with effect sizes seen in the literature.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The study will take account of clustering. In the feasibility data, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.01.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> As pilot studies can provide imprecise estimates of ICCs,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> we re-estimated using ICCs from three sources, the RIPPLE cRCT,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> a 2013/2014 WHO Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and a 2013 Young Persons’ Behaviour and Attitudes Survey in NI conducted by the Northern Ireland Statistics &amp; Research Agency (NISRA).<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The data from WHO and NISRA studies were combined. The Randomised Intervention of a PuPil-led sex education trial (RIPPLE) and combined WHO and NISRA studies found an ICC of 0.004. Assuming 120 students per school, an ICC of 0.01% and 7% attrition (plus two additional schools to be conservative), a trial involving 33 schools per group will provide 80% power at a 5% significance level (a pupil participant sample size of n=7904, with n=224 reporting unprotected sex). The power would rise to 93% if the ICC is 0.004.</p>

In England, Scotland and Wales, 8 schools will be randomly selected from the above-median stratum and 6 from the below-median stratum (to give a total of 14). The decision to select slightly more schools from the above-median %FSM reflects research which indicates that teenage pregnancy and unprotected sex is more acute in more deprived areas.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 48</xref></p>

                  <p>When a school and the relevant teachers who will be delivering the intervention to pupils have provided consent, the first step taken towards pupil recruitment is to inform parents/guardians.

Schools will be responsible for addressing and preparing envelopes for postage. Parents/guardians will be advised within the material provided that they have to return the opt-out consent forms by a date no later than 3 weeks prior to commencement of baseline data collection within the school. The trial coordinator will collate a list of parents/guardians who have opted their child out of participation and return this to participating teachers.</p>
                  <p>Schools will be provided with printed copies of the pupil information sheets to be distributed to eligible pupils at least 1 week prior to baseline data collection. Only eligible pupils whose parents/guardians did not opt-out of providing consent for them to participate will be provided with a copy of the pupil information sheet. Immediately prior to administering the baseline questionnaire, eligible pupils will attend a short information session, delivered by a member of the research team, including an information video. Pupils will be given an opportunity to ask questions prior to deciding whether to participate. A repeat information session and baseline data collection session will be facilitated in agreement with the school to accommodate any pupils who are absent from the initial session. In the unlikely event that absenteeism remains in excess of 5%–10% in a school, the research team, in agreement with the school, will return a third time to facilitate an additional information session and baseline data collection. Pupils with mild learning difficulties or poor English will be supported where possible by fieldworkers to complete the questionnaires.</p>

                  <title>Primary outcome</title>
                  <p>In this trial, a reduction in unintended teenage pregnancy rates would be the ideal primary outcome measure, but the sample size would need to be very large to detect change in unintended pregnancy rates. We will therefore use a surrogate measure associated with unintended teenage pregnancy: unprotected sex at last sexual encounter, as defined by sexual intercourse without use of contraception (barrier or hormonal). Unprotected sex during teenage years is well established as the main proximate behavioural determinant of teenage pregnancy and is a commonly measured behavioural outcome in studies examining the impact of RSE interventions on teenage pregnancy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 12 14 50 63–65</xref> Studies indicate that, although other behavioural determinants (such as frequency of sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners) are important, avoidance of unprotected sex via consistent use of contraception is central in explaining variation in levels of teenage pregnancy.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 51</xref> The primary outcome will be based on contraception use at last sexual intercourse (ie, answers to the question "Did you use any form of contraception the last time you had sex?”), consistent with the data on which the sample size calculation was based.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> An additional item will also be included related to lifetime incidence of unprotected sex in order to account for sporadic use of contraception that may not be reflected in the last sexual encounter. Participants reporting the use of natural family planning or withdrawal methods will be categorised as having engaged in unprotected sex due to the reduced efficacy of these methods in preventing pregnancy and transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study will not undertake any data linkage with Health and Social Care or National Health Service records, given that data on conception rates are not available in NI and that data for sexual health-related services in England are not readily available as part of routinely collected data given patient privacy requirements.</p>

Secondary outcomes informed by our theory of change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>) include knowledge, attitudes, communication skills and intentions relating to avoiding teenage pregnancy at follow-up and are hypothesised to lead to increased intention to avoid unprotected sex. Data will be collected using a number of standardised measures, including comfort communicating about pregnancy and comfort communicating about contraception derived from mathtech behaviour inventory<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>; the male role attitudes scale<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>; sexual socialisation instrument<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> and sexual self-efficacy scale.<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> We will also collect data using an ‘intentions to avoid a teenage pregnancy scale’, developed and psychometrically tested in our feasibility trial.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The measures were selected because the constructs they measure map closely to the theoretical framework underpinning the intervention and the reliability and completion rates of the measures were satisfactory in the feasibility trial.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In addition, to assist with the economic evaluation, supplementary secondary outcomes include: frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse, contraception use, diagnosis of STIs and incidence of pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes. The collection of these data was also shown to be feasible in the feasibility trial. Finally, we will collect important individual level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the sample to deepen understandings of how these factors moderate effectiveness.</p>

Second, we will examine intervention delivery and fidelity in the context of overall RSE provision in intervention schools. Third, we will assess provision in control schools and potential contamination caused by any changes to provision that could be due to participation in the trial. Fourth, we will explore self-reported perceptions of effectiveness and moderating influences in intervention schools among a sample of pupils, teachers and school principals and parents. Triangulated data collection methods will include semi-structured interviews with teachers, focus group discussions with pupils, observations of a sample of lessons and a survey of parents/guardians with follow-up focus groups.

                <title>Economic evaluation</title>
                <p>The economic evaluation will aim to describe the costs and consequences of implementing <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> in UK schools so as to provide information to decision makers on the implications of potential further roll-out of the intervention. This will include the duration of time taken up by <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> in school from the perspective of the teacher and impact on time spent on other important curricula activities compared with time spent on standard RSE. The aim of this will be to provide a measure of the opportunity cost to schools of implementing <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> compared with current RSE. The structure of the evaluation will follow the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for evaluating public health interventions<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> and recent guidance published by Edwards <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> on economic evaluations in public health. Costs will include the cost of implementing the intervention in schools including any training involved and the cost of current RSE in the control schools. We will also collect information on healthcare cost information in the intervention and control arms including the costs of sexual health-related primary care attendances, costs associated with STIs and unintended pregnancies (although numbers of these are likely to be small). The cost of adapting <italic>If I Were Jack</italic> to different groups will also be reported given that others may want to adapt the intervention before rolling it out. Mean cost per pupil will be reported alongside consequences including use of contraception, STIs and unintended pregnancies collected using questionnaires administered to pupils at baseline and follow-up. Although 12–14 months recall time is a relatively long time period, pupils are likely to be able to recall high impact events that occurred during this period. The follow-up time is also important to fit within the school year timetable. Costs will also be reported by country, given the different sexual health services provided and hence differential implications for health service costs by country.</p>
                <p>Given that STIs and unintended pregnancies are likely to be rare but potentially high impact events in this population group, the long-term costs and consequences will be modelled as part of the cost-effectiveness decision model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5</xref>), incorporating theories of behaviour change and identified as applicable for use in this trial during the feasibility trial.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> In addition to collecting information as part of the trial, we will look to systematic reviews of evidence of the impact of digital interventions on sexual health behaviour in this population group, for example, the review recently undertaken and published by Bailey <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> We will undertake one-way, two-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the results.

              <p>The strengths of this study include that this is the first RSE intervention to be developed and trialled which explicitly promotes a gender-sensitive approach to addressing teenage pregnancy by focussing on male perspectives and a gender-transformative approach by encouraging males to share reproductive responsibility. The intervention is culturally sensitive to different parts of the UK, is non-directive in terms of pregnancy resolution options and is sufficiently flexible to be taught within the framework of a school’s ethos and personal development/RSE policy, including in faith-based schools. This has particular significance in NI, with almost half (46%) of all NI grammar and secondary schools identifying as a Roman-Catholic school.<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> This is also the first RSE intervention to be developed and trialled across all four nations of the UK, allowing for exploration of what works best where. An additional strength of the study is that the embedded process evaluation involves triangulation of sources including school management, teachers, pupils, parents and RSE statutory and voluntary stakeholders. Study limitations include that the pragmatic setting —within schools—means that schools and participating teachers, pupils and parents will remain unblinded to the allocation. Finally, the use of the surrogate measure of unprotected sex rather than a biological measure (such as conception rates) introduces the possibility that the findings of the trial will be influenced by self-report bias, but the veracity of this measure is enhanced by privacy, confidentiality and a control group.</p>

              <p>In writing this protocol, we have endeavoured to adhere to the recommendations and guidance provided in the CONSORT 2010 statement and the extension for cRCTs,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74 81</xref> the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials Statement 2013<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82 83</xref> and the TIDieR guidelines.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> When registering the trial, we have provided structured summary information in accordance with the requirements of the WHO Trial Registration Data Set.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref></p>
              <p>Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the conduct of the study, potential effectiveness or impact study participants, including changes of study objectives, study design, sample size, study procedures or significant administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed on by the JACK Trial Steering Committee, reported to the funder (National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)) and approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation. Minor administrative changes, corrections or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted will be agreed on by the JACK Trial Steering Committee, documented and reported to the NIHR. The ethics committee may be notified of such changes at the discretion of the JACK Trial Steering Committee.</p>
              <p>A full study report will be submitted to the NIHR by the end of December 2020 and made publicly available thereafter in the Public Health Research journal on the NIHR Journals Library. We shall make data available to the scientific community with as few restrictions as feasible, following receipt of a request to the corresponding author, while retaining exclusive use until the publication of major outputs via academic conference presentations and journal articles in addition to material created for relevant stakeholders. Pupil-friendly brief reports will be provided to all participating schools.</p>

              <p>In addition to the authors listed, the JACK Trial study thus far has been dependent on the commitment provided by extensive public involvement. The intervention has been designed, developed and piloted in Ireland, NI and South Australia involving over 10 years of research with pupils, teachers, sex education specialists and education and health promotion departments. These collaborations have influenced the study by allowing different perspectives to inform the design and optimal conditions of implementation. The authors specifically acknowledge the role of the Trial Steering Committee, comprising trials experts, a school principal, a school teacher, parent and pupils, who have provided independent expert advice on the intervention itself as well as refining research methods for delivery in schools. The authors wish to acknowledge the Stakeholders Group, composed of a UK-wide group of RSE specialists and senior representatives from key statutory organisations and government departments who have helped to refine the intervention and the study design by ensuring the research outcomes are important to public concerns and the methods proposed are acceptable and sensitive to all study participants. The authors would also like to acknowledge the invaluable involvement of the Young People’s Advisory Groups (one in each country in the UK) who have enabled to further refine the intervention in a culturally sensitive way for effectiveness testing in the whole of the UK. Finally, the authors would like to thank all schools, teachers, parents and pupils who have participated in the feasibility, transferability and pilot studies that have preceded this trial.</p>
