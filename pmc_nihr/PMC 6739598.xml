                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p>Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, characterised by maternal pruritus and increased serum bile acid concentrations, is associated with increased rates of stillbirth, preterm birth, and neonatal unit admission. Ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used as a treatment without an adequate evidence base. We aimed to evaluate whether ursodeoxycholic acid reduces adverse perinatal outcomes in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p>We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled trial at 33 hospital maternity units in England and Wales. We recruited women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, who were aged 18 years or older and with a gestational age between 20 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days, with a singleton or twin pregnancy and no known lethal fetal anomaly. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo, given as two oral tablets a day at an equivalent dose of 500 mg twice a day. The dose could be increased or decreased at the clinician's discretion, to a maximum of four tablets and a minimum of one tablet a day. We recommended that treatment should be continued from enrolment until the infant's birth. The primary outcome was a composite of perinatal death (in-utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7 days after birth), preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks' gestation), or neonatal unit admission for at least 4 h (from birth until hospital discharge). Each infant was counted once within this composite. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. The trial was prospectively registered with the ISRCTN registry, number 91918806.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>Between Dec 23, 2015, and Aug 7, 2018, 605 women were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive ursodeoxycholic acid (n=305) or placebo (n=300). The primary outcome analysis included 304 women and 322 infants in the ursodeoxycholic acid group, and 300 women and 318 infants in the placebo group (consent to use data was withdrawn for 1 woman and 2 infants). The primary composite outcome occurred in 74 (23%) of 322 infants in the ursodeoxycholic acid group and 85 (27%) of 318 infants in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·62–1·15]). Two serious adverse events were reported in the ursodeoxycholic acid group and six serious adverse events were reported in the placebo group; no serious adverse events were regarded as being related to treatment.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Interpretation</title>
                  <p>Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid does not reduce adverse perinatal outcomes in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Therefore, its routine use for this condition should be reconsidered.</p>

              <p id="para10">Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, also called obstetric cholestasis, is the most common liver disorder specific to pregnancy. The disease is characterised by maternal pruritus and increased serum bile acid concentrations, with maternal symptoms and abnormal biochemical test results typically resolving post partum. A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> from 2019 showed that intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is associated with increased rates of spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and neonatal unit admission.

                  <p id="para90">An updated systematic review and meta-analysis, including this trial, with the search conducted by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (updated Dec 5, 2018), found that ursodeoxycholic acid does not reduce the incidence of stillbirth (incidence of one in the ursodeoxycholic acid group <italic>vs</italic> four in the placebo group, relative risk [RR] 0·39 [95% CI 0·08–1·93]; five trials, 891 participants; quality of evidence low) or spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation (RR 0·78 [95% CI 0·49–1·23]; three trials, 749 participants; quality of evidence high). However, ursodeoxycholic acid might reduce total (spontaneous and iatrogenic) preterm birth (RR 0·68 [95% CI 0·52–0·89]; three trials, 819 participants, including one low quality). Ursodeoxycholic acid does not reduce neonatal unit admission (RR 0·77 [95% CI 0·55–1·08]; two trials, 764 participants; quality of evidence high). Ursodeoxycholic acid does not seem to have any significant clinical benefit when used routinely for treatment of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.</p>

                <title>Participants</title>
                <p id="para130">Women were eligible if the attending clinician considered that they had a diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (defined as maternal pruritus with an increase in serum bile acid concentration above the upper limit of normal at randomly timed assessment, as measured in the local laboratory),<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> and they were between 20 weeks and 40 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy on the day of randomisation, with a singleton or twin pregnancy, no known lethal fetal anomaly, aged 18 years or older, and able to give written informed consent. The diagnostic criteria were based on the UK standard-of-care guideline from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which defines intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy as “when otherwise unexplained pruritus occurs in pregnancy and abnormal liver function tests and/or raised bile acids occur in the pregnant woman and both resolve after delivery”.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> However, we required the more stringent criterion that all women had raised bile acid concentrations. In accordance with the UK guideline, all participating units used randomly timed bile acid concentrations for diagnostic and management purposes. Because we were recruiting prospectively to the trial, we could not confirm post-partum resolution at the time of enrolment. Women were not included in the trial if a decision had already been made for delivery within the next 48 h, if they had any known allergy to any component of the ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo tablets, or if they had a triplet or higher-order multiple pregnancy. 17 of the 33 maternity units used a threshold of 14 μmol/L as the upper limit of normal, whereas the remaining units used thresholds between 10 μmol/L and 13 μmol/L, according to local laboratory reference ranges. Research teams at each site approached women to confirm eligibility and provided verbal and written information. A trained clinician obtained written informed consent.</p>

                <title>Randomisation and masking</title>
                <p id="para140">Participants were randomly allocated to receive ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo. Randomisation was done using a probabilistic minimisation algorithm to ensure approximate balance within the following groups: study centre, gestational age at randomisation (&lt;34 weeks' gestation, 34 to &lt;37 weeks' gestation, ≥37 weeks' gestation), singleton versus twin pregnancy, and highest serum bile acid concentration before randomisation (&lt;40 μmol/L, ≥40 μmol/L). The minimisation algorithm was implemented by a MedSciNet database programmer, with balance and predictability checked by an independent National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit statistician during the trial. Randomisation was managed via a secure web-based randomisation program.</p>
                <p id="para150">Ursodeoxycholic acid tablets and placebo tablets were manufactured by Dr Falk Pharma (Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany). The two types of tablet appeared identical in size, shape, and colour. Packs of ursodeoxycholic acid or placebo in identical packaging were produced by the central manufacturing unit at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK) and shipped to site pharmacies. The tablets were packaged for oral administration and did not require any special storage conditions. Packs were labelled with unique pack identifiers according to a randomly generated sequence known only to the manufacturing unit and the trial programmers. A research team member entered baseline data on a web-based database at study enrolment and then allocated a pack number using the web-based randomisation program, which corresponded to a pack for dispensing by that site's pharmacy. If more packs were required, the randomisation program was used to allocate further packs containing the same allocation. Women who were taking ursodeoxycholic acid at enrolment agreed to stop the medication at randomisation.</p>

                <title>Procedures</title>
                <p id="para170">Each film-coated ursodeoxycholic acid tablet contained 500 mg ursodeoxycholic acid (active ingredient) and the following inactive ingredients: magnesium stearate, polysorbate 80, povidone K 25, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal anhydrous silica, crospovidone, and talc. The placebo tablet contained identical inactive ingredients.</p>
                <p id="para180">We recommended that women were started on a dose of two oral tablets a day (equivalent to 500 mg ursodeoxycholic acid twice a day in the ursodeoxycholic acid group). The dose was increased by a health-care professional in increments of one tablet a day every 3–14 days if there was no biochemical or symptomatic improvement, to a maximum of four tablets per day (equivalent to 2000 mg ursodeoxycholic acid per day). The dose could be reduced to one tablet a day (equivalent to 500 mg ursodeoxycholic acid a day) at a clinician's discretion (eg, if a woman's bodyweight was &lt;50 kg or if gastrointestinal side-effects occurred). We advised that doses should be spread evenly throughout the day, but that no specific instructions to take with or without food needed to be given. We recommended that treatment should be continued from enrolment until the infant's birth.</p>
                <p id="para190">Clinical teams reviewed participants at routine-care clinic visits until delivery. Antenatal care, particularly the timing and mode of delivery, was at the discretion of the responsible clinician. Outcomes were recorded on the web-based trial database through case-note review by trained researchers after discharge of the woman and infant.</p>

                <title>Outcomes</title>
                <p id="para200">The primary outcome was prespecified as a composite of perinatal death (defined as in-utero fetal death after randomisation or known neonatal death up to 7 days after birth), preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks' gestation), or neonatal unit admission for at least 4 h (from birth until hospital discharge). Each infant was counted once within this composite.</p>
                <p id="para210">Secondary maternal outcomes, measured at clinical visits between randomisation and delivery, were maternal serum concentrations of bile acids, alanine transaminase (or aspartate transaminase), total bilirubin, and γ-glutamyl transferase, and maternal itch score (measured as the worst episode of itch over the past 24 h in mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale). Additional secondary maternal outcomes, assessed on case-note review after maternal discharge, were gestational diabetes, mode of onset of labour, and estimated blood loss after delivery.</p>
                <p id="para220">Secondary perinatal outcomes, assessed on case-note review after infant discharge, included the components of the primary outcome, mode of delivery, birthweight, birthweight percentile, gestational age at delivery, presence of meconium, Apgar score at 5 min, umbilical arterial pH at birth, and number of nights in the neonatal unit. All other secondary outcomes were descriptive only.</p>
                <p id="para230">Health-resource use post-enrolment was collected at case-note review after maternal and infant discharge. Maternal use was assessed as: total number of nights in hospital (antenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal) together with the level of care, including adult intensive care unit (ICU); mode of delivery; and cost of ursodeoxycholic acid (in intervention group). Infant use was assessed as: total number of nights in the neonatal unit, together with level of care (eg, ICU). Information on outpatient appointments was not collected, because the same outpatient clinical follow-up before the birth was required for both groups.</p>

We calculated that 550 infants of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (275 per group) were required for a 90% chance of detecting (significant at the two-sided 5% level) a reduction in the primary outcome measure from 40% in the control group to 27% in the treated group, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 13% and a risk ratio (RR) of 0·675. This estimate was conservative compared with the effect sizes in the Cochrane meta-analysis<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> for the three individual endpoints (RR 0·31 for perinatal death, 0·46 for preterm delivery, and 0·48 for neonatal unit admission). We planned to recruit 580 women in total, to allow for the possibility of 5% of infants being lost to follow-up. During the recruitment phase, we amended the protocol to permit continued recruitment of additional participants, to allow for women who discontinued the intervention or withdrew from the trial. Interim analyses were done only for presentation to the Data Monitoring Committee, to be reviewed when the committee met at least annually.</p>

                <p id="para270">Demographic and clinical data were presented as n (%) for categorical variables, mean (SD) for normally distributed continuous variables, and median (IQR) or median (range) for other continuous variables.

Analysis of outcomes that were measured repeatedly over time (severity of itch and biochemistry measures) used repeated measures models, with means or geometric means of the post-randomisation observations reported,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and the trial groups compared using a mean difference or geometric mean ratio, adjusted for the baseline measures (such that the summary statistics are adjusted for chance imbalances at baseline) and minimisation factors.</p>
                <p id="para290">Prespecified subgroup analyses were done for the primary outcome and its components, bile acid and itch outcomes, using a statistical test of interaction. Binary outcomes are presented as RRs with 95% CIs on a forest plot.

Follow-up to maternal and infant discharge continued until December, 2018. Because we met our recruitment target ahead of schedule, we continued recruitment to compensate for the number of women who discontinued the intervention or withdrew from the trial (with approval of the funder, sponsor, and ethics committee), such that our total number of women recruited (n=605) included the target sample size (n=550), the number who discontinued the intervention (n=53) and those who withdrew (n=2).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="para440">In this trial of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, ursodeoxycholic acid was not effective in reducing a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes. Although ursodeoxycholic acid appeared to be safe, it had no clinically meaningful effect on maternal itch symptoms. It did not reduce maternal bile acid concentrations, and the reduction in alanine transaminase was of uncertain clinical significance, given that alanine transaminase is not known to be associated with the risk of stillbirth or preterm labour in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The analysis in women who reported adherence to the intervention reduced the effect size for the primary outcome, and subgroup analyses did not identify any subgroup that showed a greater response to ursodeoxycholic acid. A 2019 meta-analysis<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> identified that the risk of stillbirth increases in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy with peak bile acid concentrations of at least 100 μmol/L, and that the risk of preterm birth increases with peak bile acid concentrations of at least 40 μmol/L. In subgroups of women identified by higher peak bile acid concentration at study enrolment in our study, there was no discernible effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on the primary perinatal composite outcome, its components, or key maternal outcomes. A biologically plausible and clinically important reduction is unlikely to have been missed. We have previously reported that clinicians and patients considered at least a 30 mm (95% CI 15–50) improvement in itch score (from a baseline score of 60 mm) to be a clinically important difference;<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> therefore, the 5 mm reduction in itch score reported in this trial is unlikely to be clinically useful. Although some secondary outcomes appear to be significantly different (at 95% CIs), the effects do not support a unified action related to ursodeoxycholic acid.</p>
              <p id="para450">To evaluate real-world effectiveness of the intervention, the trial included pregnant women presenting with pruritus and abnormal maternal bile acid concentrations, which are the criteria commonly used to identify women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Clinicians would be likely to offer ursodeoxycholic acid to these women in the absence of other diagnoses. The study population had a similar range of elevated bile acid concentrations to other multicentre cohorts,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> with around three-quarters of women with bile acid concentrations of lower than 40 μmol/L.</p>
              <p id="para460">A strength of this study was its size, which was considerably larger than any previous trial identified in the literature. The trial was rigorously conducted to a prespecified protocol without changes. The study was done in 33 maternity units in England and Wales, and it included women who were representative of the wider population of pregnant women in terms of demographics and spectrum of disease. Recruitment reached the target number of participants within the prespecified time period, indicating equipoise and a willingness to participate from clinicians and pregnant women.</p>
              <p id="para470">A limitation of this study was that the incidence of the primary outcome in the control group was lower than that estimated for the sample size calculation. At the time of trial inception, we used the best available data (from the PITCH pilot study,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which had a similar population of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and the Cochrane systematic review in this field<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>) to estimate the incidence of perinatal death, preterm birth, and neonatal unit admission. In our subsequent individual patient data analysis,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> we reported that 412 (13%) of 3080 women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy had spontaneous preterm birth, which was a much lower incidence than that reported in the Cochrane systematic review (39 [44%] of 89), highlighting the limitations of using small samples to estimate our primary event rate for sample size calculation. The trial primary outcome event rate was reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee, but because the event rate was similar in the two groups, extending the trial was not considered to be necessary. Although the trial could theoretically have insufficient power to show a difference between groups, the consistent absence of effect in both the analysis of women who adhered to the intervention, and in subgroup analyses of women at greatest risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (bile acid concentration ≥40 μmol/L at enrolment), suggest that this is unlikely.</p>
              <p id="para480">In contrast to previous meta-analyses,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> we did not find that ursodeoxycholic acid reduced maternal bile acid concentrations. Enzymic assays used to quantify total serum bile acids detect synthetic ursodeoxycholic acid as well as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, the pathologically elevated bile acids in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy that are implicated in the pathogenesis of fetal complications.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid reduces the proportion of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> but it might be associated with an increase in total bile acid concentration, because of elevated serum concentrations of the drug. Therefore, the interpretation of bile acid concentrations in clinical practice and in this trial is complex. Because we found that bile acid concentrations were reduced even in the placebo group, some women who were initially diagnosed with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy might have had a different disease, with transient raised maternal bile acid concentrations and a different underlying pathophysiology. Other trials in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have reported a similar reduction in bile acid<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> or alanine transaminase<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> concentrations in the placebo group. These results highlight that placebo groups might provide the most unbiased assessment of the natural history of a condition, avoiding the selection bias that might occur during enrolment into case series, particularly in treated women.</p>
              <p id="para490">We considered possible sources of bias for this trial. Selection bias was unlikely because of the randomisation process, including robust allocation-sequence concealment. Performance bias was reduced by effective masking of the intervention to clinicians, patients, and data collectors, such that identification of the active treatment was minimal, with the two groups receiving the same antenatal and intrapartum care pathways. Assessment of the outcome was also masked, minimising detection bias. Differences in attrition between the groups were small, with similar numbers discontinuing the intervention. We aimed to avoid reporting bias by presenting all prespecified secondary outcomes, including the secondary analyses for which effect size measures were calculated, and interpreting secondary outcomes with caution to avoid overinterpretation.</p>
              <p id="para500">The trial results support the findings of the pilot study,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> which reported only a small reduction in maternal itch symptoms, less than that judged by women and health-care professionals to be clinically useful. We have updated the Cochrane systematic review, including data from this trial and four others for stillbirth as an outcome,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> two additional trials for spontaneous preterm birth<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and total preterm birth,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and one additional trial for neonatal unit admission.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> We confirmed that the pooled results do not show a significant difference in most adverse perinatal outcomes between treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid and placebo. Our meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in total preterm birth, but not spontaneous preterm birth, with ursodeoxycholic acid, probably reflecting a difference in iatrogenic deliveries. In the absence of any discernible effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on iatrogenic preterm birth in women with peak bile acid concentrations at enrolment of more than 40 μmol/L, or in those presenting before 34 weeks' gestation, a strong biological effect of ursodeoxycholic acid seems unlikely.</p>
              <p id="para510">Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only treatment consistently proposed in guidelines as a disease-modifying drug; no other treatments are widely used for prevention of the adverse perinatal outcomes associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, although a study is planned to evaluate the use of rifampicin.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Our individual patient data analysis<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> suggests that in women with peak bile acid concentrations lower than 100 μmol/L, the risk of stillbirth is similar to that of the general pregnant population, whereas the risk is significantly higher in women with peak bile acid concentrations of at least 100 μmol/L at any time in the pregnancy. Coexisting pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, might increase the risk of stillbirth.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The only intervention to affect adverse perinatal outcomes is likely to be appropriately planned delivery.</p>
              <p id="para520">Some subgroups of women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, which have not yet been identified, could respond to ursodeoxycholic acid (eg, those with or without comorbidities), either by reduction of maternal symptoms or reduction of adverse perinatal outcomes. For instance, abnormally high bile acid concentrations are associated with stillbirth in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and in-vitro studies have shown that ursodeoxycholic acid might be protective against bile-acid induced cardiac arrhythmias,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> potentially mediated through reduction of specific bile acid species.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, further understanding of the pathophysiology underpinning stillbirth (and therefore the target for intervention) is needed. Additional work is also needed to confirm the likely pruritogen in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy to identify a target for therapeutic treatments; progesterone sulfates<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> and lysophosphatidic acid<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> have been proposed as candidates. However, the lack of in-vivo evidence of benefit should preclude further routine clinical use of ursodeoxycholic acid, even in the absence of harm, to avoid women being offered an unproven treatment.</p>
