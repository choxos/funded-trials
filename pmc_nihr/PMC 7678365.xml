                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>First-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation (TASD) is predominantly managed non-operatively. People sustaining TASD have ongoing pain, disability and future risk of redislocation. There are no published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different non-operative rehabilitation strategies to ascertain the optimum clinically effective approach after TASD.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>In this multicentre adaptive RCT, with internal pilot, adults with a radiologically confirmed first time TASD treated non-surgically will be screened at a minimum of 30 sites. People with neurovascular complications, bilateral dislocations or are unable to attend physiotherapy will be excluded.</p>
                  <p>Randomisation will be on a 1:1 treatment allocation, stratified by age, hand dominance and site. Participants will receive a single session of advice; or a single session of advice plus offer of further physiotherapy (maximum 4 months). The primary analysis will be the difference in Oxford Shoulder Instability Score at 6 months. A sample size of a minimum of 478 participants will allow us to show a four point difference with 90% power.</p>
                  <p>An embedded qualitative study will explore the participants’ experiences of the trial interventions.</p>

              <p>The shoulder is the most frequently dislocated joint; occurring in 8.2–23.9 per 100 000 people per year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations (TASDs) occur when excessive forces during a traumatic event displace the humeral head frontwards, out of the shoulder socket, resulting in the joint surfaces completely losing contact.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> They predominantly occur in men under 25 years during high-impact events and women over 80 years during low-impact events.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>People sustaining TASD often have ongoing pain, disability and morbidity linked to redislocation and subsequent need for repeated management.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Rehabilitation may reduce these events and restore a functional, painless shoulder through restoration of movement and retraining muscles.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, a Cochrane review has found no evidence to support this<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; Dutch national guidelines explicitly do not refer to physiotherapy<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and UK guidelines cite referral <italic>‘</italic>may be helpful’.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p>
              <p>This research protocol will investigate the hypothesis regarding the nature and extent of what physiotherapy is required for the management of patients following TASD with an embedded ‘Study Within A Trial (SWAT)’ to compare two strategies for retention of participants in randomised controlled trial (RCTs).</p>

                  <p>The physiotherapist will provide details of web-based materials, which will include all the core components above in written and video format, and will include a dedicated area for participants to set goals and keep diaries. The physiotherapist will also inform the participants that the website resources contain phase 3 progressive strengthening exercises and what they aim to achieve and later stage phase 4 progression to aid return to sports.

                  <p>Following completion of the first physiotherapy appointment, the participant will be randomised, allocating them to this advice session alone or to this advice session plus the offer of additional physiotherapy.</p>
                  <p>Participants randomised to the advice session only, will only receive this physiotherapy intervention. However, if they are experiencing ongoing issues which are not improving, as part of the control intervention, the advice is for the participant to contact the clinic they attended or see their general practitione. If a participant follows this advice and self-initiates further physiotherapy, this will not be deemed a deviation from the protocol. However, if someone other than the participant initiates further physiotherapy (another clinician) then this will be deemed a protocol deviation. This data will be collected as part of the trial dataset.</p>
                  <p>Participants randomised to receive additional physiotherapy will be offered of at least one additional physiotherapy session. Each additional session will last for up to 30 min, over a maximum duration of 4 months from date of randomisation. The number and frequency of any additional sessions will be jointly agreed between the clinician and participant, in keeping with standard practice. The course of physiotherapy will involve teaching and supervising the ‘core set’ of progressive exercises offered to the control arm in addition to being able to tailor treatment as per their usual practice.</p>

                <sec id="s4-12-1">
                  <title>RCT statistical analysis</title>
                  <p>The internal pilot will inform and test recruitment strategies for the main trial in 12 sites over 6 months. A recruitment rate of one participant per month per centre was estimated for the 6 months pilot phase, with 50 participants in total. The decision to progress to the main trial will be made based on predefined progression criteria. The criteria for continuing will be achievement of 75%–100% of the recruitment target; criteria for the need to review and amend trial procedures before continuing will be achieving 50%–75% of the target; criteria for not proceeding will be achieving less than 50% of the target. These randomised participants will be retained in the final analysis.</p>
                  <p>A detailed statistical analysis plan which will be agreed with the DMSC prior to the analyses taking place. All data will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. Baseline data will be summarised to check comparability between treatment arms, and screening data will be checked to highlight any characteristic differences between those individuals in the study, those ineligible and those eligible but withholding consent.</p>
                  <p>The research team recognise the theoretical possibility of therapist effects. Here, we are randomising by individual; it is the same therapist who will be seeing people in both arms of the trial, and the treatment is individually delivered ensuring there are no group effects. To keep presentation of key information as standard throughout the study, the initial therapist contact will be described in the study manual and will use supporting media. We intend to recruit from a minimum of 30 sites where there will be multiple therapists taking part over the course of the study (eg, sickness and holiday coverage). This gives the number of estimated therapist level clusters upwards of 60 and potential cluster sizes of around four participants in each arm of the trial. With such small cluster sizes, even if there were to be important therapist effects, their effect on statistical power would be minimal.</p>
                  <p>To address the possibility that these might exist, a single interim analysis is preplanned to re-estimate the sample size. This will occur after approximately 200 participants have completed the 3 months follow-up questionnaire, while recruitment is still open. The pooled SD of the primary outcome and presence of therapist effects will be estimated by calculating the therapist intraclass correlation coefficient and its 95% CI. Models will not include treatment effects. A revised sample size calculation will be discussed with DMC and TSC and if appropriate, permission requested from the funder to adjust the sample size.</p>
                  <p>All primary analyses are planned to be on an intention-to-treat basis with secondary per protocol analyses. The main analysis will investigate differences in the primary outcome measure, 6 months after randomisation, between the two treatment groups. Unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses will be used to estimate the between group difference. The adjusted analyses will adjust for the stratification variables, baseline scores and any other clinically important variables. Since individual clinicians will treat only a small number of participants enrolled in the trial, we do not expect clinician-specific effects to be important in this study.</p>
                  <p>Descriptive statistics of functional outcome data (ie, QuickDash and EQ-5D-5L) at each time point will be constructed with between group analyses following the method set out for the primary analysis above. Patterns of recovery will also be explored. Secondary analyses will includeχ<sup>2</sup> tests to compare the number of dislocations and other complications between allocation groups. For important complications (eg, dislocations), Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to complication will be constructed. If sufficiently large numbers of complication groups are observed, Cox regression models will be constructed to compare the time to complication in each arm. Temporal effects will be investigated using a multilevel model of all follow-up data.</p>
                  <p>Two prespecified subgroup analyses will be undertaken to assess whether there is evidence of differing intervention effect: hand dominance (injured shoulder dominant arm vs injured shoulder is non-dominant arm and age (younger participants vs older participants). Because of the small sample size these analyses will be exploratory. The subgroup analyses will follow the methods described for the primary analysis, with additional interaction terms incorporated into the mixed-effects regression model to assess the level of support for these hypotheses. We will additionally present the main result separately for younger and older age groups for the benefit of future systematic reviewers who may be focused on different age groups. We will draw no inference from these analyses.</p>
                  <p>Careful monitoring of missingness and crossovers will be conducted. If judged appropriate, multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data, with all necessary assumptions reported. If large numbers of treatment crossovers are observed, Complier-Average Causal Effect models will be used.</p>
