                  <title>Introduction</title>
                  <p>Evidence gaps limit management of small and/or nutritionally at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers, who are at higher risk of death, illness, malnutrition and poor growth and development. These infants may be low birth weight, wasted, stunted and/or underweight. An integrated care model to guide their management (MAMI Care Pathway) is being tested in a randomised controlled trial in Ethiopia. Evaluating the extent to which an innovation is consistent with national policies and priorities will aid evidence uptake and plan for scale.</p>

                  <title>Methods and analysis</title>
                  <p>This review will evaluate the extent to which the MAMI Care Pathway is consistent with national policies that relate to the care of at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers in Ethiopia. The objectives are to describe the range and characteristics, concepts, strategic interventions, coherence and alignment of existing policies and identify opportunities and gaps. It will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Eligible documents include infant and maternal health, nutrition, child development, food and social welfare-related policies publicly available in English and Amharic. The protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework Registry on 20 June 2022 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/m4jt6" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/m4jt6</ext-link>).</p>
                  <p>Grey literature will be identified through government and agency websites, national and subnational contacts and Google Scholar, and published policies through electronic database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global and Health Information). The searches will take place between October 2023 and March 2024. A standardised data extraction tool will be used. Descriptive analysis of data will be undertaken. Data will be mapped visually and tabulated. Results will be described in narrative form. National stakeholder discussions will inform conclusions and recommendations.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Globally, about one in five infants under 6 months is small and/or nutritionally at-risk (at-risk).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> An estimated 20.1% (23.8 million) infants under 6 months are underweight (low weight-for-age), 17.6% (24.5 million) are wasted/acutely malnourished (low weight-for-length) and 17.6% (21.5 million) are stunted (low length-for-age).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> An estimated 9.76% of babies are born low birth weight (LBW) in Sub-Saharan Africa.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Ethiopia, an estimated 7% of children under 5 years are wasted and 36.8% are stunted,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> while an estimated 13.2% are born LBW.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> These infants are at higher risk of death, illness, malnutrition and poor growth and development.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> Furthermore, experiencing an episode of wasting in early life leads to an increased risk of further wasting in later life<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which contributes to the global burden of 47 million wasted children.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p>
              <p>Community-based management of wasting in children over 6 months of age is a well-established approach globally, involving outpatient and decentralised care for medically uncomplicated cases.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Equivalent services for infants under 6 months are not common in low-income and middle-income countries for many reasons, including assumptions that infants under 6 months are protected from malnutrition through exclusive breastfeeding.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In reality, exclusive breastfeeding prevalence is suboptimal in almost all countries<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and may be overestimated.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In Ethiopia, prevalence among infants under 6 months is estimated at 60.4%, with regional variations.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p>
              <p>Increased awareness of the significant burden of care in this age group led to updated WHO guidelines in 2013 recommending outpatient care for uncomplicated severely wasted/acutely malnourished infants under 6 months.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, uptake of WHO recommendations into national guidance has been low and slow. A 2020 review of 63 national protocols for malnutrition treatment found that only six countries recommended outpatient care for infants under 6 months.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In most countries, including Ethiopia, inpatient treatment remains the only option, which is less accessible for families, limits service coverage and may not fully cater for their needs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Barriers to national policy uptake of WHO guidelines include demand for more context-specific evidence of what works, for whom and at what cost for health systems, services, communities, families and mothers.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This means that most at-risk infants and their mothers do not receive the prompt care they need, particularly after the early postnatal period (ie, post 6 weeks to 6 months of age), missing a critical window for early treatment and preventive action.</p>
              <p>Longstanding gaps in implementation guidance on how best to identify and manage at-risk infants under 6 months in outpatient and community services have hampered WHO policy translation into practice.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> To help address this, the MAMI Care Pathway Package<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was developed through expert consultation by the MAMI Global Network, an established global collaboration of nutrition and health practitioners, researchers and experts (<ext-link xlink:href="www.ennonline.net/ourwork/research/mami" ext-link-type="uri">www.ennonline.net/ourwork/research/mami</ext-link>). This resource material applies a care pathway model to guide practical management of at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers in pursuit of quality, respectful care continuity across systems of health and nutrition. Support to the mother–infant pair is central to the MAMI approach. It bridges maternal and child nutrition, health and social interventions to support continuity of quality, respectful care, integrated into and building on existing health and nutrition systems and services wherever possible. For example, it includes basic screening for at-risk infants under 6 months and mothers at routine immunisation visits and supports implementation of WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness guidelines in accordance with local protocols. The MAMI Care Pathway Package has been implemented in multiple contexts by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) through small-scale programmes and operational research.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18–20</xref> There have been two updates (most recently in 2021) through expert consultation and informed by implementation experiences and the latest evidence.</p>
              <p>Global ambitions for integrated services across sectors are shared by the Ethiopian government. The Ethiopian National Food and Nutrition Strategy, for example, highlights multisectoral coordination and integration as critical, but notes that progress has been slow and ineffective in bringing about changes to nutrition and public health problems. The Strategy suggests this is partly due to inadequate mainstreaming of nutrition into relevant sectoral policies, strategies, programmes and operational plans.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Sectoral policy development processes and roll-out plans are often siloed in different departments, ministries and institutions, thus missing opportunities to align and collaborate. The concept of at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers may be defined and understood in different ways across diverse policymakers, which may itself impede cross-sectoral collaboration. Poor alignment of policy limits achievement of strategic ambition and misses opportunities to leverage collection action. Lack of policy coherence also influences the operational context in which health workers work; siloed services may restrict frontline workers’ autonomy and capacity to innovate and connect across services during their day-to-day activities.</p>
              <p>To help fill the critical evidence gap in outpatient care, the MAMI Care Pathway is being tested in Ethiopia in a north–south research partnership that includes a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, formative research and a realist evaluation (MAMI RISE) (<ext-link xlink:href="www.ennonline.net/ourwork/research/mamiriseethiopia" ext-link-type="uri">www.ennonline.net/ourwork/research/mamiriseethiopia</ext-link>). Findings will be used to evidence national and international policy and practice, with the goal of achieving scalable sustainable care for at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers. Understanding, accounting for and responding to the national policy context are critical to ensure that the evidence generated meets the needs of national decision-makers<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> and to support the research uptake process. Interventions that correspond to national health sector goals are likely to gain the political and administrative support necessary for larger-scale implementation if the project results demonstrate success.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Evaluating the extent to which the innovation is consistent with existing policies, regulations, national health plans and priorities is a key step in early planning for future scale.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> To this end, a scoping review will be undertaken to describe and appraise policies in Ethiopia that address the multiple dimensions of care, including nutrition, health, child development, food and social welfare, through the lens of managing at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers.</p>

                <p>Our interest is in those infants under 6 months who are born small (eg, LBW, premature, small-for-gestational age) and/or are identified as malnourished or growing poorly or at-risk of malnutrition or poor growth, rather than the general population of all infants. We include those with: LBW, prematurity, small-for-gestational age, growth faltering, low weight-for-length, low weight-for-age, low length-for-age, low mid upper arm circumference and those whose mothers have physical/mental health issues that may affect the infant’s care or feeding.

                <p>This scoping review of policies aims to identify the main documents that have a bearing on the nature of practice regarding the care of at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers in Ethiopia. This review aims to capture all current infant and maternal nutrition, health, child development, food and social welfare-related policy evidence in Ethiopia. We wish to identify policy provisions for both direct and broader/indirect support for the care of at-risk mother–infant pairs. Policies that address treatment and/or prevention and that address maternal well-being, economic security and social enterprise, such as social protection and food assistance, will be included in the review. The policy characterisation will conceptually map definitions used, that is, describe the concepts and terminology used to define the population being examined. Policies will be appraised to identify alignment, coherence, opportunities and gaps. Opportunities investigated will include information on policy development processes, while the degree to which details (scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement and procedures for update) are available will be reported.</p>

                <p>The development of the search strategy is taking place in collaboration with a librarian. A pilot test of source selectors will be conducted whereby a random sample of abstracts will be screened by the selection team using the eligibility criteria. Discrepancies will be discussed and clarifications/modifications made to eligibility criteria/definitions accordingly. A preliminary search of Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), PROSPERO and Open Science Framework (OSF) Registry for systematic and scoping reviews of policies in Ethiopia was conducted on 26 May 2022 and no reviews were found on this review topic. The protocol was registered on the OSF Registry on 20 June 2022 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/m4jt6" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/m4jt6</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>The search strategy will be carried out using the search terms related to each of the concepts of interest. The following search terms and their variants will be used, as split across six concepts: small, nutritionally at-risk, infants under 6 months, mothers, policies and Ethiopia. The search strategy will combine keywords to include ‘small’ OR ‘nutritionally at-risk’ AND ‘infant under six months’ OR ‘mothers’ AND ‘policies' in 'Ethiopia’. A series of searches will be performed towards a final search to identify policies that relate to small and/or nutritionally at-risk infants under 6 months and their mothers in Ethiopia. See <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Online supplemental file 1</xref> for the initial search terms (Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and key words) using MEDLINE (Ovid) platform that will be further adapted to other databases/grey literature sources as described below.</p>

                <p>A standardised data extraction tool will be used against the selected policies (see the draft charting table in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Extracted data will be organised applying predetermined fields and the themes arising. Basic coding of data to categories, such as sectors, subpopulation and by policy type and source, will be conducted. Concepts/definitions within a field and policy development information will be extracted. One researcher will carry out data extraction and the data will be assessed by a second researcher. The data extraction tool will be changed and adapted during the process of gathering information from the respective evidence source, and all modifications made will be explained fully in the final review.</p>

This will be undertaken from extracted data by one researcher and assessed in the reviewers’ meeting. Any difference of opinion in the review team at any point will be resolved through discussion within the team. The results of the search and the study inclusion process will be comprehensively described in the scoping review and presented in a flow chart as indicated in the PRISMA-ScR statement.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p>
                <p>The review will provide an overview of the type of evidence and data extracted from the relevant policy findings. A basic descriptive analysis of extracted data will be included and mapped visually in figures, tables or diagrams as appropriate. Strategic interventions and policy alignment, coherence, opportunities and gaps will be described in narrative form. Findings will be discussed with in-country stakeholders (at group presentations/interviews) to inform conclusions and recommendations.</p>

                <p>No assessment of the quality of the documents included in the scoping review will be carried out as this is not the object of this study. Similarly, the review will not scope research evidence since this is not the objective of the review. A full AGREE II appraisal of identified documents is not feasible. The review is limited to English and Amharic documentation.</p>

                  <p>The review will involve coauthorship of national stakeholders, including representation from the Ministry of Health Ethiopia Research Advisory Council<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and direct engagement of the research team in national and international networks, fora and guideline processes. An emerging in-country network (the MAMI Country Chapter) will provide primed avenues for dissemination and uptake of evidence-based policies in Ethiopia.</p>
                  <p>Appraising policy content is an important dimension of policy analysis to support policy uptake of the evidence generated through the MAMI Care Pathway research programme in Ethiopia. The results of this review will be examined by the MAMI RISE Research Team to identify strategic policy targets and key multisectoral initiatives to engage in dissemination of trial findings and with whom to discuss implications for research, policy and practice.</p>
                  <p>The scoping review will provide evidence on the importance of accounting for national policy context when planning for future scaling of health and nutrition interventions. The rationale and method of scoping the national policy environment will be shared with international stakeholders through the MAMI Global Network, in targeted working groups and presentations, to encourage uptake of consistent and comparable approaches in other contexts.</p>
